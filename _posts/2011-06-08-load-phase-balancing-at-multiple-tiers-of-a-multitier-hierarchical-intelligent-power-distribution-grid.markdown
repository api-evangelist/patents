title: Load phase balancing at multiple tiers of a multi-tier hierarchical intelligent power distribution grid
abstract: The subject specification comprises enhanced power system balance control for a multi-tier hierarchical electrical distribution network (EDN). The EDN comprises a specified number of distribution network node controller (DNNC) components employed to desirably control power system balance, data communications, and power distribution between respective tiers of the EDN to facilitate efficient power distribution. In each tier, a power system balance component (PSBC), associated with a DNNC component, can monitor power system balance, such as load phase balance, associated with multi-phase power distribution for its tier, and detect power system imbalances in that tier. A power balance correction action can be identified and executed (e.g., automatically) in response to the detected power system imbalance to rectify the imbalance, wherein the correction action can include dynamic switching of loads between phases and/or filtering of the power signal.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject specification generally relates to intelligent power distribution grids, and, more particularly, to load phase balancing at multiple tiers of a multi-tier hierarchical intelligent power distribution grid.","Power grids have not undergone significant architectural changes since use of electricity for power was realized more than a century ago. The idea of a \u201cSmart Grid\u201d was introduced in the late 1990s, however, today, power grids still only employ limited intelligence in managing and providing power to consumers. Energy distribution systems are currently at a crossroads, as they confront the significant problem of imbalances of various kinds Not only is the gap between supply and demand continuing to increase due to global population growth, but there also is a geographic imbalance in energy production and consumption patterns. These imbalances and uncertainties could be exacerbated in the future considering the rapidly increasing energy demands of newly industrialized nations, such as China, India, Brazil, and Russia, as these and other nations will compete for more generating sources to meet expected energy demands. While incorporating a wide variety of renewable (non-fossil fuel) energy sources is part of the solution to the increasing energy demands, it is not likely that incorporating renewable energy sources will be a panacea for the impending energy issues. Thus, it is clear that there also will have to be significant changes in the power distribution network to help meet future energy needs.","To facilitate improving power distribution to help meet future energy needs, improvement in conventional power grids is desired to minimize power loss in transmission of power from point of generation to point of usage, minimize unnecessary heating of power system components, minimize damage and wear on power system components, minimize power fluctuations, and improve communications in the power grid to improve power system performance. One particular challenge in conventional power systems (e.g., three-phase alternating current (AC) power systems) is managing power system imbalances, such as, for example, phase load imbalances. In many regions of the world, power is generated from a power generator, wherein the power is distributed to end-use nodes (e.g., homes) using multiple phases, such as three-phase AC power. When transmitting three-phase power via electrical power transmission lines, there can be transmission lines for each phase of the three-phase AC power. In three-phase AC power, it is desirable for the power for each of the respective phases to be 120\u00b0 offset from the other phases (e.g., Phase A at 0\u00b0, Phase B at \u2212120\u00b0, Phase C at \u2212240\u00b0), with each phase having the same current or voltage amplitude, wherein power for each phase will be in the form of a sinusoidal wave, since it is AC power.","When three-phase AC power is connected to loads at the end-use nodes, it is desired for the loads to be distributed as evenly as practicable between the phases, so that the power system is balanced. In practice, power systems rarely have perfectly balanced loads, currents, voltages, or impedances in all three phases. Typically, homes and other end-use nodes (e.g., business buildings, sub-transmission components, micro power distribution sources, etc.), which carry respective loads (e.g., appliances, electric or hybrid-electric vehicles, etc.), are connected to one phased power line of the three-phase power lines. Load fluctuations and\/or other power fluctuations can affect the balance of a system, which may cause a power system to become more and\/or undesirably imbalanced. For example, connecting and disconnecting of appliances, electric or hybrid-electric vehicles, or other loads can impact or change the system balance. As another example, sometimes when connecting homes or other structures to a power grid, such structures are not connected to the distribution transformer or other component (e.g., three-phase power transmission lines) associated therewith, so as to evenly distribute the load across the three phases (e.g., people (e.g., servicemen) connecting homes to the distribution transformer or associated three-phase power lines sometimes connect more of loads to the same phased power line because it is easier to connect to the loads to that particular phased power line), which can result in power system imbalance. Undesirable power system imbalances can result in undesirable voltage fluctuations, power losses, increases in heat for system components which can cause damage or unnecessary wear on those system components, increase in maintenance and repair costs of the power system, etc.","Currently, communications is one area where changes are being made to power grids to create Smart Grids in order to facilitate improved power system performance. Presently, emerging Smart Grid networks are deployed using a variety of communications technologies, including wired (e.g., fiber, microwave, power line carrier (PLC), etc.) as well as public and private wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi), using the licensed and unlicensed spectrum. For example, utilities have used unlicensed spectrum for automatic meter reading (AMR) applications, wherein a smart meter, which can be found at locations of both residential and commercial customers, allows electrical consumption information to be identified and transmitted to distribution-level control center (DCC), typically at periodic (e.g., monthly) times. However, conventionally, communication technologies have been underutilized in power grids resulting in continued inefficiencies, including inefficiencies relating to managing and maintaining desired power system balance. Further, the emergence of distributed power generation systems (e.g., power generation systems that include a central power generation system as well as micro power generation sources, such as solar energy systems, wind power generation systems, etc.) to replace or supplement the relatively flat topography of traditional power distribution systems is likely to exacerbate the inefficiencies relating to managing and maintaining desired power system balance.","The above-described deficiencies of today's systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non-limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.","The following presents a simplified summary of the various embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosed subject matter.

The PSBC can perform (e.g., automatically) the power balance correction action in response to the detected power system imbalance to rectify or compensate for the imbalance. In another aspect, the DNNC component can transmit all or a desired portion of information relating to the power system imbalance (e.g., date and time the imbalance was detected, the power balance correction action that was taken, parameter values relating to the power system imbalance before and after correction, etc.) to another DNNC component, such as a DNNC component in a tier above the DNNC component that is transmitting the information to facilitate efficient power distribution (e.g., make decisions regarding future power allocations), obtain information indicating the effectiveness of a power balance correction action (e.g., to learn which correction actions are most effective, to determine whether a particular type of correction action should be modified due to not being sufficiently effective, etc.), obtain information relating to accounting and billing, etc.","In accordance with various aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a system that includes an analyzer component that is configured to analyze information relating to power conditions associated with multi-phase power being distributed to one or more CCNs to facilitate dynamic identification of at least an imbalance in the multi-phase power when such imbalance occurs, wherein the one or more CCNs are located in a portion of a lower tier in a multi-tier EDN. The system can further include a first power control component that is configured to be associated with the analyzer component, and dynamically control distribution of the multi-phase power in the portion of the lower tier via at least one junction node based at least in part on the analysis of the information relating to power conditions associated with the multi-phase power in the portion of the lower tier, in accordance with at least one predefined control criterion, to at least control an amount of imbalance in the multi-phase power in the portion of the lower tier.","In accordance with various other aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a method that includes the acts of receiving data relating to power conditions associated with multi-phase power being distributed in a portion of a lower level of a multi-level power distribution network (PDN) comprising one or more CCNs; and automatically controlling distribution of at least a portion of the multi-phase power to the one or more CCNs in the lower level based at least in part on the data relating to the power conditions associated with the multi-phase power, in accordance with at least one predefined control criterion, to at least control an amount of power system imbalance in the multi-phase power in the portion of the lower level.","In accordance with still other aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a system that includes means for at least one junction node that is configured to be associated with one or more CCNs located in a lower tier of a multi-tier electrical distribution network EDN, receive at least one control command from a power control component, and execute the at least one control command to facilitate control of distribution of multi-phase power in the lower tier. The system can further include means for at least one switch component that is configured to be associated with the at least one junction node, and switch an electrical connection of at least one CCN of the one or more CCNs from a first phased power transmission line to a second phased power transmission line of a plurality of phased power transmission lines that distribute the multi-phase power to reduce an amount of power system imbalance in the multi-phase power, in response to the at least one control command.","The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects of the disclosed subject matter.

The multi-tier hierarchical EDN can comprise a specified number of distribution network node controller (DNNC) components employed in various tiers to desirably control power system balance, data communications, and power distribution between respective tiers of the EDN to facilitate efficient power distribution. In an aspect, in each tier, there can be a power system balance component (PSBC) that can be associated with the DNNC component of that tier and can monitor power system balance, such as load phase balance, associated with multi-phase power distribution for that tier, and detect power system imbalances in that tier. The PSBC can analyze information relating to a detected power system imbalance and can identify (e.g., automatically) a power balance correction action that can rectify or compensate for the imbalance in that portion of the tier of the multi-tier hierarchical EDN, wherein a power balance correction action can comprise, for example, switching (e.g., automatically or dynamically) certain loads (e.g., consumer consumption nodes (CCNs) (e.g., homes or businesses consuming power) connected to that portion of the tier of the EDN from a transmission line of one phase to a transmission line of another phase of the multi-phase power transmission lines to restore balance between phases of the multi-phase power for that portion of the tier, isolate a node or component that is at least partially causing the power system imbalance from other nodes and components in the EDN to facilitate restoring balance between phases of the multi-phase power for that portion of the tier, respectively adjust voltage or current amplitude of the respective transmission lines of the phases of the multi-phase power, send notifications relating to the power system imbalance to desired locations (e.g., CCN, another DNNC component, etc.) or entities (e.g., utility repairman) to provide information regarding the power system imbalance and\/or request that a manual power system correction action be performed, and\/or filter out undesired (e.g., harmful) harmonics associated with the multi-phase power.

The system  can provide hierarchical and de-centralized control of and communication (e.g., two-way communication) relating to distribution nodes (e.g., power distribution sources (PDSs)) in the power grid in the EDN (which also can be referred to, for example, as a power distribution network (PDN), a smart distribution grid (SDG), or a power grid). In an aspect, the system  can include an upper level PDS  (e.g., power generator with a power transformer, power sub-station with a power transformer) that can generate and\/or supply electrical power to one or more CCNs (e.g., residential premises, commercial or industrial premises, etc.) (not shown in ; e.g., as shown in ) associated with the upper level PDS  in the portion of the EDN encompassed by the upper level PDS . The CCNs also can be referred to as end-use nodes, for example. The power provided by the upper level PDS  can be multi-phase power, such as, for example, three-phase power comprising Phase A, Phase B and Phase C that can be transmitted via respective power transmission lines (e.g., transmission line A, transmission line B, and transmission line C) to the lower level PDS , wherein there also can be a neutral line (N) between the upper level PDS  and lower level PDS , to facilitate desired multi-phase power distribution.","In another aspect, the system  can comprise a lower level PDS  (e.g., power distribution transformer) that can be electrically connected to the upper level PDS , wherein the lower level PDS  can be under the upper level PDS  in the hierarchy of the EDN and can be employed to distribute electrical power to the one or more CCNs associated with (e.g., electrically connected to) the lower level PDS . The power can be multi-phase power, such as, for example, three-phase power comprising Phase A, Phase B and Phase C that can be transmitted via respective power transmission lines (e.g., transmission line A, transmission line B, and transmission line C), wherein there also can be a neutral line (N) between the lower level PDS  and a CCN, to facilitate desired multi-phase power distribution. Typically, the upper level PDS  can provide power at a higher voltage level (e.g., greater than 100 kilovolts (kV)) (e.g., after the voltage of the electric power is stepped-up to facilitate efficient transmission) via electrical transmission lines to the lower level PDS , and the lower level PDS  can convert (e.g., transform, step-down, etc.) the higher voltage level to a desired lower voltage level (e.g., 110 volts (V), 220 V, . . . , 4 kV, . . . , 13 kv, . . .) suitable for use at the CCNs. For example, the upper level PDS  can be a power generation plant that serves a certain geographical area (e.g., city, county, district, or other defined area), and the lower level PDS  can be a distribution transformer (e.g., electromagnetic type of distribution transformer) that can be attached to a pole or a pad at or near a portion of the certain geographical area wherein the subset of CCNs associated with the lower PDS  are located to distribute the desired power to those associated CCNs. In an aspect, the upper level PDS  also can be associated with (e.g., electrically connected to or interfaced with) other upper level PDSs (not shown in  for reasons of brevity and clarity) in the EDN (e.g., in the same tier of the multi-tier EDN) to facilitate transferring power between the upper level PDSs to enable the respective upper level PDSs to meet power needs in their respective portions of the EDN.","While the system  is illustrated herein to show that the lower level PDS  receives power from the upper level PDS  to supply power to the CCNs, the disclosed subject matter is not so limited, as in accordance with various embodiments, a CCN also can comprise or be associated with (e.g., electrically connected to) a local PDS (also referred to herein as a micro PDS) (e.g., solar power generation system, wind power generation system, geothermal power generation system, hydroelectric power generation system, diesel-type power generation system, stored power (e.g., power stored in charged batteries of an electric or hybrid vehicle), etc.) (not shown in ; e.g., as shown in , , and ) that can produce and\/or otherwise provide power for use by the CCN to reduce or even eliminate the need for that CCN to obtain power from the power grid via the lower level PDS  and\/or can provide power to other CCNs associated with the power grid, such as, for example, CCNs that are associated with the same lower level PDS , when the local PDS associated with the CCN generates power in excess of the amount of power used and\/or stored by that CCN or when power is otherwise desired (e.g., in emergency situations) by the EDN from the local PDS, as more fully disclosed herein. For instance, the local PDS of the CCN can provide any excess power to another CCN(s) directly or, more typically, via the lower level PDS , wherein, for example, routing the power via the lower level PDS  can facilitate desired tracking of the amount of power being provided to the power grid by the local PDS and desired control over distribution of power from the local PDS to other CCNs in that portion of the tier or elsewhere in the power grid.","Conventionally, power distribution systems are \u201ctop down\u201d systems whereby power is distributed down from a central power generation system to transformers that transform the power and supply it to CCNs with limited communication of information (e.g., information limited to periodic (e.g., monthly) power usage information) from the lower nodes (e.g., CCNs via enhanced consumer meters (ECMs), such as smart meters or other meters employing advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)) in the power grid to the central power generation system. In multi-phase (e.g., three-phase) power distribution systems, there can be imbalances in power distribution due in part to connecting and disconnecting, or switching on and off, of power consumption devices (e.g., appliances, electric or hybrid electric vehicles, etc.) by CCNs in a portion of a power grid associated with a particular lower level PDS; local PDSs going online or offline, or having significant or sudden changes in power generation, in that portion of the power grid; disruption of power transmission lines in that portion of the power grid or elsewhere in the power grid; undesired reconnection of CCNs to power transmission lines in that portion of the power grid after disruption or disconnection (e.g., connecting too many CCNs to one phased transmission line relative to other phased transmission lines); etc. Such power imbalances can result in inefficient power distribution; increased heat, wear and\/or damage to components of the power grid; increased heat, wear and\/or damage to the consumer appliances or devices; and\/or other undesired problems. It is desirable to be able to manage power distribution, including any identified power imbalances, in a more localized way to facilitate more efficient power distribution in a power grid. It also is desirable to have improved communication between lower nodes and upper nodes in the multi-tier EDN to more efficiently manage power distribution. Management of power distribution locally, and communication between lower nodes and upper nodes in the multi-tier EDN, will continue to become increasingly important as more local PDSs are introduced into the EDN and more high power consumption devices, such as electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles are connected to the EDN to charge their batteries.","To that end, in accordance with various aspects, the system  can provide an enhanced hierarchical power system control and communication infrastructure to facilitate efficient power distribution to CCNs associated with the EDN that overcomes the deficiencies in the conventional technology relating to power distribution. In an aspect, the system  can employ a specified number of PSBCs, including upper level PSBC  and lower level PSBC , that can be respectively associated with (e.g., communicatively and electrically connected to and interfaced with) the upper level PDS  and lower level PDS  in the multi-tier EDN to facilitate managing power distribution, including managing (e.g., controlling, reducing and\/or minimizing) power system imbalances, in their respective tiers of the multi-tier EDN. Employing PSBCs in respective tiers of a multi-level EDN can enable the lower level PSBC  to control power distribution in the lower level of the multi-level EDN with reduced or minimal involvement of a PSBC in a higher level, such as the upper level (or a middle level), of the multi-level EDN in controlling the power distribution in the lower level in accordance with the predefined control criteria, as more fully disclosed herein.","In an aspect, the lower level PSBC  can monitor power conditions and detect undesired power conditions, such as, for example, power imbalances, in the multi-phase power being distributed to the CCNs in the portion of the lower tier of the multi-tier EDN that is controlled by the lower level PSBC . For example, the lower level PSBC  can comprise and\/or be associated with one or more sensors (e.g., a power sensor, voltage phase balance sensor, current phase balance sensor, load phase balance sensor, heat sensor, fault sensor, harmonic sensor, etc.) (not shown in ; as shown in ) that can monitor power conditions in each power transmission line (e.g., transmission lines A, B, C) and the neutral line (N) to determine or identify relative voltage levels, relative current levels, relative load levels (e.g., resistive, capacitive and\/or inductive load levels), relative power levels, power system faults, harmonic factors or levels, and\/or other desired parameter values, in relation to transmission of multi-phase power in the portion of the lower tier of the multi-tier EDN controlled by the PSBC . Based at least in part on information obtained from the one or more sensors, the PSBC  can detect and identify a relative imbalance in power distribution between the respective phases of the multi-phase power transmission lines. For instance, the PSBC  can detect and identify when a parameter value, or relative parameter values of respective phases, relating to power system balance is outside of a predefined power-system-balance threshold value (e.g., higher than a maximum threshold limit, or below a minimum threshold limit) or a predefined set of power-system-balance threshold values (e.g., upper threshold limit and lower threshold limit).","For example, when operating normally, a typical three-phase power system generally will still have a certain tolerable level of power system imbalance. In accordance with the disclosed subject matter, a PSBC (e.g., , ) can detect and identify when there is a power system imbalance in its portion of its tier that is outside of or beyond (e.g., greater than) the certain tolerable level of power system imbalance (e.g., greater than a predefined maximum threshold amount of power system imbalance).","In an aspect, the lower level PSBC  can analyze information relating to a detected power system imbalance and can identify (e.g., automatically) one or more power balance correction actions that can, wholly or at least partially, rectify or compensate for the power system imbalance in that portion of the tier of the multi-tier hierarchical EDN controlled by the lower level PSBC , based at least in part on predefined control criteria (also referred to herein as predefined power system control criteria). In accordance with various aspects, a power balance correction action can comprise, for example, switching (e.g., automatically or dynamically; or manually (e.g., via automatic notification sent to an utility repair person)) certain loads associated with CCNs connected to that portion of the tier of the EDN from a transmission line of one phase (e.g., Phase A) to a transmission line of another phase (e.g., Phase B) of the multi-phase power transmission lines to restore phase balance between phases of the multi-phase power for that portion of the tier; isolate a node (e.g., CCN, local PDS, etc.) or component that is at least partially causing the power system imbalance from other nodes and components in the EDN to facilitate restoring balance between phases of the multi-phase power for that portion of the tier; respectively adjust voltage or current amplitude of the respective power transmission lines of the phases of the multi-phase power; communicate notifications relating to the power system imbalance to desired locations (e.g., CCN, DNNC component, etc.) or entities (e.g., utility company and\/or associated utility repairman) to provide information regarding the power system imbalance and\/or request that a manual power system correction action be performed; and\/or filter out (e.g., automatically or dynamically) undesired (e.g., harmful) harmonics associated with the multi-phase power. In another aspect, the lower level PSBC  can perform (e.g., automatically or dynamically) the one or more power balance correction actions in response to the detected power system imbalance to rectify or compensate for the power system imbalance, which can reduce, minimize, or eliminate the power system imbalance in that portion of the tier of the multi-tier EDN controlled by the lower level PSBC .","Similarly, the upper level PSBC  can monitor power conditions associated with multi-phase power being distributed via the power transmission lines (e.g., A, B and C) and associated neutral line (N) from the upper level PDS  to the lower level PDS  and other lower level PDSs (not shown), if any, associated with the upper level PSBC . The upper tier of the EDN can employ one or more sensors (not shown in ) that can be distributed throughout the upper tier, including the power transmission lines and neutral line between the upper level PDS  and lower level PDS , to monitor and sense power conditions in that portion of the upper tier controlled by the PSBC . Based at least in part on information (e.g., parameter values, flags or indicators indicating a particular parameter value is outside of a predefined threshold parameter value or set of values, etc.) received from the one or more sensors, the upper level PSBC  can detect power system imbalances in those power lines, for example, relative to each other. The upper level PSBC  can identify (e.g., automatically or dynamically) and\/or perform (e.g., automatically or dynamically) one or more power system correction actions, to, wholly or at least partially, rectify or compensate for the detected imbalance in that portion of the tier between the upper level PDS  and lower level PDS  in the multi-tier hierarchical EDN.

For instance, data can be obtained or sampled at a desired level of granularity (e.g., 1 second, 1 millisecond, or other desired time period to attain the desired level of granularity) by a node, such as a PSBC (e.g., , ) from an associated PDS (e.g., , ), a sensor(s), a CCN, or other associated node. The data can be aggregated and\/or processed (e.g., parsed, filtered, compressed, and\/or encrypted, etc.), as desired, to obtain a desired subset of data, wherein the subset of data can be communicated in real time or near real time between the lower level PBSC  (or associated lower level DNNC) and the upper level PSBC  (or associated upper level DNNC). A PBSC (e.g., , ) also can aggregate and\/or process the obtained or sampled data to facilitate detecting and identifying power system imbalances, and identifying an appropriate power system correction action to take in response to an identified power system imbalance.","Turning to , depicted is a block diagram of an example system  having a multi-tier (e.g., three-tier) hierarchical control and communication architecture for an EDN in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.

The multi-level hierarchical system can decentralize the intelligence aspects of the system  by incorporating intelligence into each level of the hierarchy to facilitate advancing real time, or at least near real time, automation (e.g., relating to sensing, control, protection, etc.) of components associated with the system . In accordance with various aspects, the system  can manage data collection, archiving, and retrieval to facilitate reducing or minimizing communication latency of data flow between control nodes in various levels of the hierarchy. As more fully disclosed herein, the system  can employ two-way communication at each level of the hierarchy, wherein each level of the hierarchy can employ respective communication standards and protocols, as well as respective communication bandwidths. Such communication aspects of the system  can facilitate real time, or at least near real time, control of power distribution in the respective tiers of the multi-tier EDN.","It is to be appreciated and understood that, in accordance with various non-limiting embodiments, while the PSBCs and PDSs have respectively been referred to as upper level PSBC, upper level PDS, mid level PSBC, mid level PDS, lower level PSBC, and lower level PDS, as desired, the respective components also can be referred to as a first level PSBC, first level PDS, second level PSBC, second level PDS, third level PSBC, or third level PDS. Further, one or more embodiments also can include a fourth, a fifth, or more levels of respective components (e.g., PSBCs, PDSs, etc.) in the multi-level EDN.

For instance, as depicted, CCNs ,  and  are each connected to the power line of Phase A, which can result in a load phase imbalance, since there are no CCNs connected to the power lines of Phase B and Phase C. In such instance, the PSBC , via one or more sensors associated with the power lines and\/or lower level PDS , can detect that power system imbalance. The PSBC  can identify (e.g., automatically or dynamically) a power system correction action to perform in response to the detected power system imbalance. For instance, the PSBC  can identify a power system correction action that specifies that CCN  is to remain connected to the Phase A power line, CCN  can be switched from the Phase A power line to the Phase B power line, and CCN  can be switched from the Phase A power line to the Phase C power line, to facilitate desirably balancing the power system (e.g., reducing or minimizing power system imbalance). The PSBC  can perform (e.g., automatically or dynamically) the identified power system correction action and can switch CCN  from the Phase A power line to the Phase B power line, and switch CCN  from the Phase A power line to the Phase C power line. For instance, the PSBC  can comprise or be associated with respective junction nodes (not shown) at which CCN  and CCN  are respectively connected to the power lines associated with the lower level PDS .

The CCNs ,  and  initially can be connected to the Phase A power line, while other CCNs are connected to the Phase B power line or Phase C power line. If the user associated with CCN  connects (e.g., plugs in) a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV)  and the user associated with CCN  connects a PEV  at or near the same time such that the two PEVs are connected to the Phase A power line at the same time for a given period of time, the significant loading on the Phase A power line relative to the other power lines can be such that there can be a load phase imbalance due to the simultaneous connection of the PEVs  and . The PSBC  can detect and identify the load phase imbalance between the Phase A power line and the other power lines. The PSBC  can identify a power system correction action to rectify the load phase imbalance, wherein the power system correction action can specify that the CCN  is to remain connected to the Phase A power line, but CCN  is to be switched from the Phase A power line to the Phase B power line, and\/or can specify the switching of one or more other CCNs (not shown) from their respective current phased power lines respectively to another phased power line, to facilitate balancing the load on the phases of the power lines. The PSBC  can perform, and\/or can transmit a desired command(s) (e.g., instruction) to an associated component (e.g., switch(s) or junction node(s)) to perform, the identified power system correction action to perform the desired switching of respective CCNs between respective phased power lines, as specified in the power system correction action.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","302","304","306","302","308","304","302","304","304","304","302","304","306","308"]},"In an aspect, the lower level PSBC  can comprise a power system balance agent (PSBA)  that can be employed to monitor and\/or detect power conditions, including power system imbalances and interference, in the portion of the lower level of the EDN controlled by the lower level PSBC . The PSBA  can comprise or can be associated with one or more sensors (not shown in ; e.g., as shown in ) that can be distributed throughout the portion of the lower level of the EDN controlled by the PSBC , wherein the one or more sensors can sense, detect, or sample the power conditions in that portion of the lower tier.

In still another aspect, a junction node  can be configured to access or be connected to Phase A, Phase B and\/or Phase C of the multi-phase power lines, and can include a switch function that can be used to switch (e.g., automatically or dynamically) the electrical connection associated from one phased power line (e.g., Phase A power line) to another phased power line (e.g., Phase B power line), for example, in response to control information (e.g., switch command) received from the upper level PSBC  (or additionally or alternatively an upper level DNNC component), to facilitate controlling the power system balance to reduce or minimize the amount of imbalance in the power system in the portion of the upper tier controlled by the upper level PSBC . For example, the junction node  can have three power lines at its input in an order of Phase A power line, Phase B power line and Phase C power line, wherein, initially, the three power lines at the output of the junction node  can be in the same order as the input. In response to a switch command, the junction node can switch the routing of the phased power lines such that the output can be in a different order than the input, such as, for example, an ordering of Phase B power line, Phase A power line and Phase C power line at the output of the junction node .

It is to be appreciated and understood that transmitting all of the data (e.g., collected data, analysis-generated data, other data) from the lower level DNNC  to the upper level DNNC  can be undesirable for a number of reasons, as some of the data may not be needed by the upper level DNNC  since such data can relate to aspects or functions being controlled by the lower level DNNC  and not the upper level DNNC , and communication of such large amounts of data can or may overload the communication network and impair real time control of power distribution and communications in the EDN, especially when the upper level DNNC  is receiving respective large amounts of data from multiple lower level DNNCs (e.g., ) associated with the portion of the EDN controlled by the upper level DNNC , among other reasons.","In accordance with various aspects, the lower level DNNC , employing the ECC , can select a desired subset of data from the available data (e.g., collected data, analysis-generated data, other data), in accordance with the predefined control criteria, as more fully disclosed herein. For example, the ECC  can filter or abstract data obtained from sensors to facilitate reducing the amount of data communicated to the upper level DNNC component . For instance, the ECC  can monitor a particular power condition (e.g., power level, voltage level, current level, power system balance, harmonic level, interference level, etc.) and can obtain measurements of that power condition for each sample time, which, for example, can be finely granularized to a desired level (e.g., on the order of milliseconds, seconds, minutes, . . .). It may not be necessary for the upper level DNNC component  to have knowledge of all of the parameter values of the particular power condition parameter, but rather only desirable for the upper level DNNC component  to have knowledge of certain parameter values (e.g., a maximum power condition parameter value over a specified number of samples, a power condition parameter value that is outside of a predefined threshold acceptable parameter value or set of values, an average or mean parameter value and\/or standard deviation over a specified number of samples, etc.). The ECC  can evaluate and process the obtained data (e.g., perform calculations on the obtained data, filter out data from the obtained data) to generate a subset of data (e.g., a filtered subset of data that contains a parameter value(s) that is outside of the predefined threshold acceptable parameter value(s); or an abstract or summary of the data that includes an average or a mean of the parameter values obtained over a specified number of samples or period of time), in accordance with predefined control criteria (and corresponding predefined control rules), as more fully disclosed herein. The subset of data can be communicated from the lower level DNNC component  to the upper level DNNC component  via a desired communication channel (e.g., wireline or wireless communication channel) using a desired communication technology (e.g., DSL, cellular, Wi-Fi, etc.) for processing and evaluation by the ECC  to facilitate controlling power distribution over the portion of the grid controlled by the upper level PDS , wherein the desired communication channel can be automatically or dynamically selected in accordance with the predefined control criteria, as more fully disclosed herein. The disclosed subject matter can thereby control the amount of data being communicated via communication channels to limit the data to such data that is desired by the upper level DNNC component  or other upper level node(s) to control (e.g., reduce) the load on the communication channels and facilitate real time, or at least near real time, data communication between nodes in the EDN.","The ECC  can receive the subset of data from the lower level DNNC , and can analyze, evaluate, and\/or otherwise process that subset of data to facilitate making determinations for controlling the portion of the power grid controlled by the upper level DNNC component , including controlling that portion of the power grid associated with the lower level DNNC component  and\/or other portions of the power grid associated with other lower level DNNC components (not shown) that are under the control of the upper level DNNC component . Based at least in part on the processing of the subset of data, the ECC  can generate control information (e.g., power-related parameter values, control information or commands for power distribution, etc.), which can be communicated via a desired communication channel to the lower level DNNC component , another lower level DNNC component (not shown) associated with the upper level DNNC component , or another upper level DNNC component, to facilitate desirably controlling power distribution in the EDN.","As disclosed herein, the system  can employ various types of communication channels and technologies (e.g., wireline communication channels, such as digital subscriber line (DSL)-type channels, broadband-type channels, Broadband over Power Lines (BPL), power line carriers (PLC), Power line Digital Subscriber Lines (PDSL), etc.; and wireless communication channels, such as cellular communication channels, Wi-Fi communication channels, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax) communication channels, femtocell communication channels, satellite communication channels, wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) channels, wireless local area network (WLAN) channels, etc.), which can have respective communication conditions, costs, etc., associated therewith.

In identifying, determining, or selecting a communication channel or communication technology to utilize to communicate a particular set of data, the ECC  or ECC  can apply the predefined communication channel selection criteria (or corresponding predefined communication channel selection rules), which can relate to, for example, the amount of data to be communicated, the type of data (e.g. current power condition data, abstract or filtered subset of power condition data, fault data, power control data, communication control data, etc.), the priority of the data (e.g., high priority or emergency data, standard priority, low priority, etc.), the respective communication conditions (e.g., quality of service (QoS), data communication rates, communication channel congestion, etc.) of respective communication channels (e.g., wireline communication channel, wireless communication channel), respective costs of communication of the data for the respective communication channels, current availability of respective communication channels, time of day of data communication (e.g., peak-time communication times, off-peak communication times), etc.","For example, data that meets a predefined high level of priority threshold can be transmitted via one type of communication channel or technology over another type of communication channel or technology because the one type of communication channel or technology is more reliable or desirable (e.g., more desirable QoS and\/or faster data communication rate) than the other type, even if communication via the one type is more costly than communication via the other type, when the predefined communication channel selection criteria (or corresponding rule(s)) so specifies. As another example, the predefined communication channel selection criteria (or corresponding rule(s)) can specify that data is to be communicated via a wireless communication channel using Wi-Fi so long as the communication conditions for such wireless communication channel at least meet a predefined QoS level and data communication rate, or communicated via another communication channel (e.g., a wireline or other communication channel that meets the predefined QoS level and data communication rate) when that wireless communication channel does not meet the predefined QoS level and data communication rate.","In accordance with various other aspects, as more fully disclosed herein, the ECC  and ECC , respectively, can compress\/decompress data (e.g., the subset of data) being transmitted to\/received from the respective DNNC components  or , or other component (e.g., control or communication component associated with a consumer consumption point), in accordance with a specified compression\/decompression algorithm(s) (e.g., lossless compression algorithms, such as Lempel-Ziv (LZ) compression algorithm, LZ-Renau (LZR) compression algorithm, Huffman coding, DEFLATE, etc.; lossy compression algorithms, such as Mu-law Compander, A-law Compander, Modulo-N code, etc.), to facilitate reducing the amount of data bits being communicated thereby easing the communication load on the communication channel(s) between the upper level DNNC component  and the lower level DNNC component  or other component; encrypt data transmitted or decrypt data received from a DNNC component (e.g.,  or ) or other component, in accordance with a specified cryptographic algorithm(s) and protocols (e.g., data encryption standard (DES)-type algorithms, advanced encryption standard (AES)-type algorithms, symmetric key algorithms, etc.), to facilitate securing communicated data; employ desired data redundancy to facilitate recovery of data in case of data corruption; etc.","It is to be appreciated and understood that, while system  includes a single lower level DNNC associated with a single lower level PDS, the subject specification is not so limited, as in accordance with various embodiments, there can be one or more lower level DNNC components associated with a single lower level PDS, as desired.

Bottom-level control node  and  can be logically connected to top-level control node  by way of mid-level control node . As such, data and rules can be bubbled up (e.g., communicated upward in the hierarchy) or pushed down (e.g., communicated downward in the hierarchy) by way of this communication path. The bidirectional communication and closed loop control at each level (e.g., top, mid, and bottom) can facilitate improved electrical distribution grid performance. For example, where additional power is needed by the industrial customers associated with bottom-level control node , control signals from mid-level control node  can source more power from city power plant by way of bottom-level control node  without directly involving the top-level control node  or draining energy from the illustrated solar farm or wind farm.","Similarly, mid-level control node  can be associated with bottom-level control node  through . Bottom-level control node , for example, can be logically associated with a plurality of transformers service a portion of a city network. Further, for example, bottom-level control node  can be associated with a single transformer as part of a rural network. Moreover, at bottom-level control node , for example, the control node can be associated with a single consumer, such as the farm. The control nodes also can be associated with distributed power generation, for example bottom-level control node  associated with a solar farm and bottom-level control node  associated with a wind farm. As such, bidirectional communication between top-level control node  and bottom-level control node  through  can be by way of mid-level control node . As such, rules propagated for mid-level control node  and associate child control nodes can be different from rules propagated for mid-level control node  and associated child control nodes. Further, independent closed loop control can be affected, for example, at bottom-level control node  and the associated rural customers without impacting bottom-level control node  and the associated city network.","It is to be appreciated and understood that components (e.g., DNNC component, PDS, PSBC, junction node, sensor component, ECC, ECM, etc.), as described with regard to a particular system or method, can include the same or similar functionality as respective components (e.g., respectively named components or similarly named components) as described with regard to other systems or methods disclosed herein.","As it employed in the subject specification, the term \u201cprocessor\u201d can refer to substantially any computing processing unit or device comprising, but not limited to comprising, single-core processors; single-processors with software multithread execution capability; multi-core processors; multi-core processors with software multithread execution capability; multi-core processors with hardware multithread technology; parallel platforms; and parallel platforms with distributed shared memory.

Wi-Fi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices, e.g., computers, to send and receive data indoors and out; anywhere within the range of a base station. Wi-Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11 (a, b, g, n, etc.) to provide secure, reliable, fast wireless connectivity. A Wi-Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other, to the Internet, and to wireline networks (which use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet). Wi-Fi networks typically operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands, at an 11 Mbps (802.11b) or a 54 Mbps (802.11a) data rate, for example, or with products that contain both bands (dual band), so the networks can provide real-world performance similar to the basic \u201c10BaseT\u201d wireline Ethernet networks used in many offices.","In the subject specification, terms such as \u201cdata store,\u201d data storage,\u201d \u201cdatabase,\u201d and substantially any other information storage component relevant to operation and functionality of a component, refer to \u201cmemory components,\u201d or entities embodied in a \u201cmemory\u201d or components comprising the memory.
