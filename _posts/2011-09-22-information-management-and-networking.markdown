title: Information management and networking
abstract: In one embodiment, a personal information profile is constructed for a user having a collection of information items. The personal information profile comprises one or more information topics, and each information topic comprises one or more information items. Each information topic has an interesting score, which indicates a level of interest the user has in the information topic. In one embodiment, a social network is inferred among a group of users, each having a personal information profile. A connection exists between every two users that share at least one common-interest information topic, indicated by their respective personal information profiles.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to information management and information-based social network.","In this information age, there is an overwhelming amount of information readily available and accessible partly due to the ability of individuals to disseminate information freely, quickly, and easily. Often, people may be interested in and collect specific pieces of information. It is not unusual that over time, a person may collect a large amount of information such that it becomes difficult for the person to manage all the information he has collected and continues to collect.","There is an overwhelming amount of information available and accessible both online and offline. The information relates to various subject matters or topics and is organized in various structures, stored in various mediums, and presented in various formats. Depending on their needs or objectives, people may be interested in and collect specific pieces of information, also referred to as \u201cinformation items\u201d. This is especially true for people working in certain fields, such as researchers, developers, writers, etc. Such people may be referred to as \u201cknowledge workers\u201d. A knowledge worker is any person who interacts (e.g., review, disseminate, collect, create, publish, etc.) with information on a relatively regular basis.","Sometimes, a person, such as a knowledge worker, may wish to maintain a personal collection of specific information items. The information in a person's own collection may be especially interesting or useful to that person (e.g., information relating to a project that the person is working on or has worked on) so that the person may wish to be able to quickly and easily locate and retrieve specific information items in the collection whenever needed. However, over time, a person may gradually collect a large amount of information for his or her own information collection so that it becomes difficult to locate specific information items in the collection.","Particular embodiments manage the personal collections of information associated with individual persons, such as individual knowledge workers. For each person having a personal collection of information, an information profile is constructed that indicates, for example and without limitation, which subject matters, fields, or topics the person is interested in, what types or specific information items are relatively more important to the person and what types or specific information items are relatively less important to the person, which specific information items are similar or related to each other, etc. The individual information items in the collection may be ranked and filtered, and presented to the corresponding person in a way that is easy for the person to view the collection and locate specific information items in the collection.","In addition, particular embodiments establish an information-based social network among the people having personal collections of information. A social connection may exist between every two people who collect some of the same or similar information items. Moreover, the more information items commonly collected by two people, the stronger the social connection between them, and vice versa.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","110"]},"Each person may have his or her own personal collection of information. Given a specific person, \u201cX\u201d, there may be any number of information items from any number of information sources  in X's personal information collection. These information items may be created by X himself or herself (e.g., X is the author of the information) or by other people. Furthermore, these information items may be explicitly identified by X himself or herself or implicitly inferred as being relevant to X. For example, X may bookmark a web page (e.g., one that includes certain content that X is interested), follow an online discussion (e.g., messages or tweets on a specific topic), post an article, or send an email. The web page, messages, article, or email may be included in X's personal information collection based on X's explicit actions. As another example, X may visit websites (e.g., as indicated by server logs) or receive emails, data feeds (e.g., web, news, RSS, etc.), or short messages, which may be included in X's personal information collection because they are considered relevant to X. In particular embodiments, a person's personal collection of information may reflect that person's activities (e.g., online activities), interests (e.g., professional or personal), preferences, etc.","In particular embodiments, an information profile is automatically generated  for each person. Given a specific person, \u201cX\u201d, the information profile generated for X represents X's personal information collection, such as, for example and without limitation, what types or specific information items are included in X's personal information collection, their degrees of importance to X, their degrees of similarity or dissimilarity to each other, etc.","In particular embodiments, an information-based social network is automatically inferred  among a group of people each having a personal collection of information. The social network may be inferred based on the information profiles associated with the individuals. A social connection may exist between two people who have one or more same or similar information items in their respective personal information collections. Moreover, the more same or similar information items two people have in their respective personal information collections, the stronger the social connection between them, and vice versa","Information profile generation  and information-based social network inference  may each be implemented as computer software, hardware, or a combination thereof, and may each include any number of modules or components implementing various functionalities. A person (e.g., X) whose information profile is automatically generated by a computer-implemented system may also be referred to as a \u201cuser\u201d of the system. Thus, an information-based social network may be inferred among a group of users, each having his or her personal information profile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"Particular embodiments may retrieve the data representing the specific information that is considered relevant or personal to X from various applicable information sources, as illustrated in STEP . There may be different ways to retrieve different types of informational data. For example, a web crawler, implemented as computer software, may crawl the Internet or an intranet to retrieve all the web pages bookmarked or recently visited by X. X's emails (e.g., sent by or sent to X) may be retrieved from each of X's email accounts. X's short messages may be retrieve from X's mobile telephone. X's online posts may be retrieved from each of X's online accounts.","Particular embodiments may clean the retrieved informational data, extract specific information items from the retrieved informational data, and aggregate certain information items, as illustrated in STEP . In particular embodiments, each piece of information is a collection of text (e.g., a document), which may include any number of terms. Each term may include any number of words. Sometimes, there may be noise or irrelevant data in the retrieved informational data. Such noise may be removed and discarded when the retrieved informational data are cleaned so that only the relevant content is extracted. For example, a web page may include an advertisement in addition to its main content. The advertisement may be removed and discarded when the web page is cleaned and only the main content of the web page is extracted.","Particular embodiments may index the individual terms in each collection of text (e.g., document). The indexing may be used for searching specific terms in the documents. For example, the terms in the documents may be indexed using inverted indexing. This disclosure contemplates any applicable indexing algorithm. In addition, particular embodiments may extract and analyze the meta data (e.g., title, tags, timestamp, geo-location, etc.) associated with each document.","Given a collection of information (e.g., a collection of documents) thus obtained for X, particular embodiments may cluster the individual information items into specific topics or information clusters.  illustrates an example method for automatically clustering a person's (e.g., X's) collection of information into a number of information topics or clusters. There may be any number of information items in X's personal information collection, and they may be clustered into any number of information topics or clusters. In particular embodiments, each piece of information may be a collection of text, which may be represented as a document. Each document may contain any number of terms, and each term may include any number of words.","Suppose that there is a total of N documents in X's information collection. Particular embodiments may determine an importance score, iScore, for each document, d, in the collection, as illustrated in STEP . The importance score of a document may indicate the degree of importance the content of that document is to X. The importance score of each document may be determined based on various factors, such as, for example and without limitation, its content, source, type, recency, authorship, or degree of dissemination. This disclosure contemplates any applicable factor. X may also provide default score values (e.g., for documents of a specific type or from a specific source). For example, X may specify that documents retrieved from one particular information source should receive relatively higher importance scores because this information source is known to provide accurate and reliable information or information X is particularly interested in. On the other hand, documents retrieved from another information source should receive relatively lower importance scores because this second information source often provides inaccurate information or information X is not especially interested in. As another example, newer information may receive higher importance scores than older information as it is more up-to-date. As a third example, certain types of information (e.g., personal emails or messages sent to X or RSS feeds subscribed by X) may receive higher importance scores than other types of information (e.g., web pages downloaded from the Internet).","To further explain the computation of importance scores for the individual documents, consider the following two examples. First, suppose that there are a number of emails retrieved from X's email accounts, which are included in X's information collection. In some implementations, emails that belong to a conversation (e.g., a series of emails sent back and forth between X and one or more other people) may receive higher importance scores than emails not engaged in any conversation. In some implementations, the importance score of each email belonging to a particular conversion may be computed as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"iScore","mrow":{"mi":["email","_","i","n","_","conversaion"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":["f","w"]},"mo":"\u00d7","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"msup":{"mi":["N","conversaion"]},"mi":"M"}}}}}}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sup":["w ","conversation "]},"Second, suppose that there are a number of online contents (e.g., web pages, posts, etc.) retrieved from various websites on the Internet, which are included in X's information collection. In some implementations, contents created by X himself or herself may be more important than contents created by other people. Contents bookmarked by X may be more important than contents merely viewed (e.g., clicked on, but not bookmarked) by X. Contents from mainstream media may be more important than contents from personal blogs or forums. In some implementations, the final importance score of each online content may depend on several intermediate importance scores, such as a source importance score, iScore, which indicates the importance, to X, of the information source from where the content is retrieved, a type importance score, iScore, which indicates the importance, to X, of the type of the content, and a volume importance score, iScore, which indicates the amount of contents retrieved from the same information source.

A vector space model, also referred to as term vector model, is an algebraic model for representing objects, such as text documents, as vectors of identifiers, such as index terms. It is often used for information filtering, retrieval, indexing, or relevancy ranking. In particular embodiments, each piece of information in X's information collection may be represented as a document containing any number of unique terms.

Each topic may be a particular subject matter. For example, one topic may relate to sports, another topic may relate to travel, and a third topic may relate to computer programming. Similar documents, as indicated by their similarity values, may be assigned to the same topic. In some implementations, a similarity threshold may be used, such that when the similarity value (e.g., as computed using EQUATION (4B)) between two documents is above the similarity threshold, the two documents are assigned to the same topic; otherwise, they are assigned to different topics. The similarity threshold may be selected to control the granularity of the clustering. For example, all documents relating to sports may be assigned to a single topic. Alternatively, documents relating to team sports (e.g., baseball, basketball, football, etc.) may be assigned to one topic; while documents relating to individual sports (e.g., tennis, golf, boxing, etc.) may be assigned to another topic. Alternatively, documents relating to each type of sport may be assigned to a separate topic. Typically, higher similarity threshold may result in more granular clustering; while lower similarity threshold may result in less granular clustering.","Particular embodiments may determine a centroid and one or more keywords for each topic or cluster. Given a specific topic or cluster, its centroid may be used to represent all the documents in the cluster, and its keywords describe the content of the documents in the cluster. In the context of cluster analysis or clustering, the centroid of a cluster of documents is the center or average of the documents in the cluster.","Particular embodiments may rank the topics, as illustrated in STEP . The ranking may be based on X's personal interests, such that those topics that X is more interested in are ranked higher than those topics that X is less interested in. Particular embodiments may determine a ranking score, rScore, for each topic, T, that has been discovered during the clustering of the documents. The ranking score of a specific topic measures X's personal interest in that topic based on both the content and the time of that topic, as a person's personal interests often change over time. Thus, the ranking score may also be referred to as \u201cinteresting score\u201d, as the ranking score of a specific topic measures the level or intensity of interest X has in that topic.","In some implementations, the ranking score of each topic may be defined as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"rScore","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},{"mi":["j","N"],"mo":"\u2264"}]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":"\u03bb","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"t","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["t","j"]}}}}}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},{"mi":["i","M"],"mo":"\u2264"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},{"mi":["j","N"],"mo":"\u2264"}]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":"\u03bb","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"t","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["t","j"]}}}}}}}}]}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"5"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"j "},"Particular embodiments may rank the topics or clusters base on their respective ranking scores, such that those topics having relatively higher ranking scores are ranked higher than those topics having relatively lower ranking scores. A personal information profile may be generated for X based on the ranked topics, as illustrated in STEP . The topics may then be presented to X based on their ranking scores. In some implementations, the topics may be visually distinguished (e.g., using color, size, font, graphics, placement, position, etc.) so that it is easy and intuitive for X to recognize which topics are more interesting and which are less interesting to X. For example, if the topics are presented in a ranked list, then those topics that are ranked higher may be presented before those topics that are ranked lower. If colors are used to distinguish the topics, then those topics that are ranked higher may be presented using darker colors and those topics that are ranked lower may be presented using lighter colors. If sizes are used to distinguish the topics, then those topics that are ranked higher may be presented in larger sizes and those topics that are ranked lower may be presented in smaller sizes.","In some implementations, different personal information profiles may be generated for X at different times, and animation (e.g., an animated sequence) may be used to illustrate the evolution or change of X's personal information profile over time. For example, suppose that X becomes increasingly interested in art as X learns to paint over a period of time, and collects more and more information about art history, art techniques, art appreciation, etc. This evolution in X's personal interests may be reflected in the evolution in X's personal information profiles generated over the period of time. An animated sequence may illustrate such evolution.  illustrates an example presentation of evolution in people's personal information profiles, where the color corresponds to the intensity or level of personal interest.","Particular embodiments may recommend specific information items (e.g., documents) to X based on X's personal information profile, as illustrated in STEP . In some implementations, when a specific document, A, becomes available, an adjusted vector space model may be constructed for A, and the topic to which A belongs may be determined based on A's adjust vector space model. If A belongs to a topic that X is interested in (e.g., a topic that has a relatively higher ranking score), A may be recommended to X.","Given a group of people each having a personal information profile, an information-based social network may be automatically inferred among the people in the group. A social network, in general, is a social structure made up of entities, such as individuals or organizations, that are connected by one or more types of interdependency or relationships, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, financial exchange, dislike, or relationship of beliefs, knowledge, or prestige. In more recent years, social networks have taken advantage of the Internet. For example, there are social-networking systems existing on the Internet in the form of social-networking websites. Such social-networking websites enable their members to perform various social activities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 3 and 4"]},"For each pair of individuals in the group, particular embodiments may identify topics commonly interested by both individuals, as illustrated in STEP . Give two specific persons, X and Y, suppose that X's personal information profile contains a number of topics and Y's personal information profile contains a number of topics. Note that the number of topics in X's personal information profile may differ from the number of topics in Y's personal information profile. For each unique pair of topics, one from X's personal information profile and one from Y's personal information profile, particular embodiments may compute the distance between the two centroids of the two topics respectively. If the distance is sufficiently close (e.g., less than a distances threshold), then particular embodiments may consider that the two topics are the same or similar such that X and Y share a common interest with respect to this pair of topics. Two people may share any number of common-interest topics.","For each pair of individuals who share one or more common-interest topics, particular embodiments may determine a common-interest correlation between the two individuals, as illustrated in STEP . When two individuals (e.g., X and Y) share a common-interest topic, the intensity or level of interest each person has in the topic may be the same or may differ. For example, X and Y may both be interested in art, but X is very interested in art (e.g., because X actively studies painting) while Y is only mildly interested in art. On the other hand, X and Y may both be very interested in sports. As described above, each topic in a person's information profile may have a ranking or interesting score, rScore, which indicates the intensity or level of interest the person has in that topic. Thus, given a common-interest topic shared by X and Y, there may be one interesting score of the topic for X and another interesting score of the same topic for Y. These two interesting scores, one for X and one for Y, may be similar or may be different.","As an example, suppose that two people, X and Y, share five common-interest topics, A, B, C, D, and E.  illustrate several examples of different common-interest correlations between X and Y. In the example illustrated in , the two interesting scores, one for X and one for Y, of each of the five common-interest topics, A, B, C, D, and E, shared by X and Y are similar. In other words, not only do X and Y share these five common-interest topics, but the levels of interest X and Y have in each topic, respectively, are similar as well. Thus, there is a relatively close correlation between X's and Y's information interests. In the example illustrated in , the two interesting scores, one for X and one for Y, of each of the five common-interest topics shared by X and Y are less similar, in that X has a higher interesting score in each topic than that of Y. For example, even though both X and Y are more interested in topic B than topic A, X's interesting score for topic B is much higher than Y's interesting score for topic B.
