{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/386,174 filed Sep. 24, 2010 under the title STORAGE OF APPLICATIONS AND ASSOCIATED DIGITAL GOODS FOR USE IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICES AND SYSTEMS. The content of the above patent application is hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the detailed description hereof.","This application relates to the field of wireless communications, and more particularly, to wireless communications devices and related methods.","Mobile wireless communications systems continue to grow in popularity and have become an integral part of both personal and business communications. By way of example, cellular telephones allow users to place and receive voice calls most anywhere they travel. Moreover, as cellular telephone technology has increased, so too has the functionality of cellular devices and the different types of devices available to users. For example, many cellular or wi-fi devices now incorporate personal digital assistant (PDA) features such as calendars, address books, task lists, etc. Moreover, such multi-function or \u201csmart\u201d devices may also allow users to wirelessly send and receive electronic mail (email) messages and access the Internet via a cellular network and\/or a wireless local area network (WLAN), for example.","Mobile devices such as smart phones are also capable of running relatively sophisticated applications, such as games, document processing applications, chat or instant messaging applications, etc. As a result, it may be desirable to provide enhanced approaches for accessing and managing applications for mobile devices, especially as new applications continue to be developed and become available.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","In one aspect, the present disclosure describes a method of restoring digital goods previously acquired and associated with an application. The method includes: receiving, at an application delivery server, a request for the application to be delivered to a communication device; and in response to receiving the request: i) retrieving the application associated with the request; ii) sending the application associated with the request to the communication device; and iii) automatically restoring the digital goods previously acquired and associated with the application to the communication device.","In another aspect, the present disclosure describes an application delivery system. The application delivery system includes: an application delivery server including a communication subsystem to communicate over a wireless communications network, the application delivery server including a controller configured to: receive, at an application delivery server, a request for the application to be delivered to a communication device; and in response to receiving the request: i) retrieve the application associated with the request; ii) send the application associated with the request to the communication device; and iii) automatically restore the digital goods previously acquired and associated with the application to the communication device.","In another aspect, the present disclosure describes a non-transitory computer readable storage medium including computer readable instructions which, when executed, configure a processor to: receive, at an application delivery server, a request for the application to be delivered to a communication device; and in response to receiving the request: i) retrieve the application associated with the request; ii) send the application associated with the request to the communication device; and iii) automatically restore the digital goods previously acquired and associated with the application to the communication device.","In yet another aspect, the present disclosure describes a method of managing the use of applications from an application delivery server to a user of a wireless communications network. The method includes: storing, in a memory, application data for applications authorized for delivery to a first wireless communication device of the user, the application data including information regarding digital goods acquired by the user from within authorized applications; receiving, at the application delivery server, a request for an authorized application to be delivered to a second wireless communication device of the user; in response to receiving the request, retrieving the authorized application associated with the request, retrieving application data associated with the authorized application, delivering the authorized application and the application data to the second wireless communications device; and restoring digital goods within the authorized application delivered to the second wireless communications device based upon the application data including the information regarding digital goods.","In yet another aspect, the present disclosure describes a method of backing up application data associated with an application. The method includes: detecting a trigger event at the mobile device; and in response, sending the application data to a server.","The present description is made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which example embodiments are shown. However, many different example embodiments may be used, and thus the description should not be construed as limited to the example embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete.","Example Communication System","For an understanding of one possible environment in which example embodiments described herein can operate, reference is first made to  which shows in block diagram form a communication system  in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system  includes a number of mobile communication devices  (also referred to herein as mobile devices) which may be connected to the remainder of the system  in any of several different ways. Accordingly, several instances of mobile communication devices  are depicted in  employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices  are connected to a wireless network  which may include one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)  and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)  or other suitable network arrangements. In some example embodiments, the mobile communication devices  are configured to communicate over both the WWAN  and WLAN , and to roam between these networks. In some example embodiments, the wireless network  may include multiple WWANs  and WLANs .","The WWAN  may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example, but not limitation, the WWAN  may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations  (one of which is shown in ) where each of the base stations  provides wireless Radio Frequency (RF) coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN  is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some example embodiments, the WWAN  conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types: Mobitex Radio Network, DataTAC, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network), EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized) CDMA2000, EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems), HSPDA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX), or various other networks. Although WWAN  is described as a \u201cWide-Area\u201d network, that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.","The WWAN  may further include a wireless network gateway  which connects the mobile communication devices  to transport facilities , and through the transport facilities  to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines, the public Internet, a virtual private network, or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system  may be operated, for example, by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation, university, or governmental department, which allows access to a network  such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources, or the wireless connector system  may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some example embodiments, the network  may be realized using the Internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.","The wireless network gateway  provides an interface between the wireless connector system  and the WWAN , which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices  and other devices (not shown) connected, directly or indirectly, to the WWAN . Accordingly, communications sent via the mobile communication devices  are transported via the WWAN  and the wireless network gateway  through transport facilities  to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system  are received by the wireless network gateway  and transported via the WWAN  to the mobile communication devices .","The WLAN  includes a wireless network which, in some example embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN  in other example embodiments such as, for example, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX\u201d), or IEEE 802.20 (also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access). The WLAN  includes one or more wireless RF Access Points (AP)  (one of which is shown in ) that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.","The WLAN  may be a personal network of the user, an enterprise network, or a hotspot offered by an Internet service provider (ISP), a mobile network provider, or a property owner in a public or semi-public area, for example. The access points  are connected to an access point (AP) interface  which may connect to the wireless connector system  directly (for example, if the access point  is part of an enterprise WLAN  in which the wireless connector system  resides), or indirectly via the transport facilities  if the access point  is a personal Wi-Fi network or Wi-Fi hotspot (in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system , such as a virtual private network (VPN), may be used). The AP interface  provides translation and routing services between the access points  and the wireless connector system  to facilitate communication, directly or indirectly, with the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  may be implemented as one or more servers, and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system  manages communications, including email communications, to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system  also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices  which may connect to the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  allows the mobile communication devices  to access the network  and connected resources and services such as a messaging server  (for example, a Microsoft Exchange\u2122, IBM Lotus Domino\u2122, or Novell GroupWise\u2122 email server), and a content server  for providing content such as Internet content or content from an organization's internal servers, and application servers  for implementing server-based applications such as instant messaging (IM) applications to mobile communication devices .","The wireless connector system  also allows the mobile communication devices  to access an application delivery server . The application delivery server  is configured to deliver applications to the mobile devices  upon request by the mobile device . Applications are programs that include instructions for the mobile device  which provide a user of the mobile device  with tools to accomplish a task. By way of non-limiting example, the applications may include word processions applications, media player applications, database applications, games, etc. The application delivery server  may be configured to act as a remote storage facility for the mobile device  to permit users of the mobile communication devices  to re-download (i.e. re-transmit) applications that were previously downloaded (i.e. transmitted), purchased and\/or otherwise acquired.","In at least some example embodiments, the application delivery server  acts as, or interfaces with an application data backup server and is configured to store application data. Application data is data which is used by an application and which is, in some example embodiments, user or device specific data. The application data may, in various example embodiments, include user settings or preferences associated with an application, user achievements (i.e. high scores associated with a game), etc. The application data is, in at least some example embodiments, configured or created by a user of the mobile device .","The wireless connector system  typically provides a secure exchange of data (e.g., email messages, personal information manager (PIM) data, and IM data) with the mobile communication devices . In some example embodiments, communications between the wireless connector system  and the mobile communication devices  are encrypted. In some example embodiments, communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure, two-way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data. In some example embodiments, the private encryption key is stored only in the user's mailbox on the messaging server  and on the mobile communication device , and can typically be regenerated by the user on mobile communication devices . Data sent to the mobile communication devices  is encrypted by the wireless connector system  using the private encryption key retrieved from the user's mailbox. The encrypted data, when received on the mobile communication devices , is decrypted using the private encryption key stored in memory. Similarly, data sent to the wireless connector system  from the mobile communication devices  is encrypted using the private encryption key stored in the memory of the mobile communication device . The encrypted data, when received on the wireless connector system , is decrypted using the private encryption key retrieved from the user's mailbox.","The wireless network gateway  is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile communication device  over the WWAN  to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system  then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server , content server , application delivery server  or application servers . Conversely, the wireless connector system  sends data packets received, for example, from the messaging server , content server , application delivery server  or application servers  to the wireless network gateway  which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile communication device . The AP interfaces  of the WLAN  provide similar sending functions between the mobile communication device , the wireless connector system  and network connection point such as the messaging server , content server , application delivery server  and application server .","The network  may include a private local area network, metropolitan area network, wide area network, the public Internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these, alone, or in combination.","A mobile communication device  may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system  using a computer , such as desktop or notebook computer, via the network . A link  may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile communication device  and computer  connected to the wireless connector system . The link  may include one or both of a physical interface and short-range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may include one or combinations of an Ethernet connection, Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, Firewire\u2122 (also known as an IEEE 1394 interface) connection, or other serial data connection, via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile communication device  and computer . The short-range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network (PAN) interface. A personal area network is a wireless point-to-point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points. The short-range wireless communication interface may include one or a combination of an infrared (IR) connection such as an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) connection, a short-range radio frequency (RF) connection such as one specified by IEEE 802.15.1 or the Bluetooth\u2122 special interest group, or IEEE 802.15.3a, also referred to as UltraWideband (UWB), or other PAN connection.","It will be appreciated that the above-described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only, and that the above-described communication system includes one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be used in connection with other types of networks and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","Example Mobile Communication Device","Reference is now made to  which illustrates a mobile communication device  in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile communication device  is a two-way communication device having at least data and possibly also voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile communication device , in various example embodiments the mobile device  may be a data communication device, a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a tablet computer, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system with a wireless modem.","The mobile communication device  includes a controller including at least one processor  such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the mobile communication device , and a wireless communication subsystem  (also referred to as wireless communication circuitry) for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network . The processor  interacts with the communication subsystem  which performs communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems. In some example embodiments, the mobile device  may include a touchscreen display  which includes a display (screen) , such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, with a touch-sensitive input surface or overlay  connected to an electronic controller . The touch-sensitive overlay  and the electronic controller  act as an input mechanism to provide a touch-sensitive input device. The processor  also interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay  via the electronic controller . In other example embodiments, the display  may not be a touchscreen display. Instead, the mobile device  may simply include a non-touch display and one or more input mechanisms, such as, for example, a depressible scroll wheel.","The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, speaker , microphone , control keys , switch , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the mobile communication device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which the mobile communication device  is intended to operate.","The mobile communication device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations  () of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile communication device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after a network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory; for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  include operating system software  and software applications . The software applications  include an application store client  for requesting and receiving software applications from the application delivery server  () and interacting with the application delivery server  to provide remote application storage capabilities to the mobile device . The application store client  permits users of the mobile communication device  to connect to the application delivery server  and to browse or search for applications available for download (i.e. transmission) to their mobile communication device . The application store client  permits users to purchase applications for use on their mobile device .","A user of the mobile communication device  may request an application from the application delivery server  by interacting with the application store client  on the mobile device; for example, by using the touchscreen display , control keys  or other input mechanism. In response to receiving a request to download an application from the user, the application store client  of the mobile communication device  may transmit a download request to the application delivery server  and wait for the application delivery server  to transmit the specified application to the mobile device . The mobile device  receives the application from the application delivery server . In some example embodiments, the application may require installation onto the mobile device  before it may be used. In such cases the application may be installed to the mobile device . Later, the application may be removed from the mobile device . For example, at the request of the user the application may be uninstalled. After such deletion, the application can subsequently be retrieved and installed using a remote storage module  of the mobile device .","Some applications include the option of acquiring (e.g. purchasing) digital goods associated with the application. Digital goods are goods that are stored, delivered and used in an electronic format such as, for example, e-books, music files, digital images, etc. For example, from within the application, a developer of a news media application may offer upgraded feeds or subscriptions, or a game application may include the ability to purchase additional levels. Such \u201cin-application\u201d purchases of digital goods may also include links to content stored elsewhere.","In at least some example embodiments, when the application is removed from the mobile device  (for example, when it is deleted by the user), application data  associated with that application may be transmitted to a remote server, such as the application delivery server . The application delivery server  may store the application data  in a memory  (). In some example embodiments, the application data  may be retrieved from the server and restored on the mobile device  if and when the application is retrieved. In at least some example embodiments, such retrieval may occur automatically. For example, when an application is restored, the application data  may be automatically restored, without direct input to do so from a user.","The application data  may include email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile communication device  by its user, and other data. Also, the application data  may include application data  which is associated with a specific application. For example, an application which is a game may have associated application data  specifying high scores, etc. The application data  may also include the digital goods purchased from within the application, such as additional levels for the game application.","The remote storage module  is configured to interact with the application delivery server  to provide remote storage capabilities for the mobile device. To provide such capabilities, the remote storage module  may be configured to transmit identification information to the application delivery server . The remote storage capabilities may be related to either a user, account, or, in some example embodiments, a specific device. The identification information may, in some example embodiments, identify the mobile device . For example, the identification information may be a Personal Identification Number (\u201cPIN\u201d)  associated with the mobile device . In other example embodiments, the identification information may identify a user or account associated with the mobile device . For example, the identification information may include one or more of a username and\/or password, log-in information associated with the user or account, a unique identification number associated with the user or account, or an email address associated with the user or account.","The application delivery server  may determine, from the identification data, any applications that are available for re-download (i.e. re-transmission) and may transmit data identifying these applications to the mobile device .","The applications which are said to be available for re-download may, in some example embodiments, be applications which were previously downloaded by (i.e. transmitted to) either the mobile device  or by another mobile device associated with the same user. In some example embodiments, the applications which are said to be available for re-download are applications which the user of the mobile device  has previously purchased.","In at least one mode, the remote storage module  of the mobile device  is configured to display, on the display screen , data received from the application delivery server  which identifies at least one application available for re-download. For example, it may display data identifying one or more previously downloaded applications which are available for re-download to the mobile device. The displayed data may be presented in a list format in some example embodiments. The list may include two or more applications which are available for re-download to the mobile device .","In some example embodiments, a user may request that an application be re-downloaded to the mobile device  using an input mechanism associated with the mobile device; for example, the touchscreen display  or the control keys . The user may navigate, through a display screen containing a plurality of applications available for re-download, to a desired application available for re-downloading and select a \u201cdownload\u201d or other option to initiate the re-downloading of the application.","Upon receiving a user input to re-download an application, the remote storage module  of the application store client  transmits a request to the application delivery server  to request the delivery of the application. The request includes an identifier, such as a product number, associated with the application which permits the application delivery server  to determine the application that the request relates to. The application delivery server  may then cause the application to be transmitted and the application is received at the mobile communication device. In some example embodiments, the application may be automatically installed following its receipt.","The remote storage module  may, in some example embodiments, be launched from within the application store client . That is, the user may load the application store client  and may select an option to load the remote storage module  portion of the application store client . For example, the user may select an option entitled \u201cDigital Storage Locker\u201d, \u201cRemote Applications\u201d, \u201cPreviously Downloaded Applications\u201d or \u201cMy World\u2122\u201d or an option with another similar descriptor. In other example embodiments, the remote storage module  may be a stand-alone component that is operationally separate from the application store client  and that is loadable by selecting an appropriate icon in an icon grid on a home page associated with the mobile device .","The application store client  and the remote storage module  may, among other things, be implemented through stand-alone software applications, or combined together in one or more of the operating system  and applications . In some example embodiments, the functions performed by the above identified applications  may be realized as a plurality of independent elements, rather than a single integrated element, and any one or more of these elements may be implemented as parts of other software applications.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","The software applications  may include a range of other applications, including, for example, an address book application, a messaging application, a calendar application, and\/or a notepad application. In some example embodiments, the software applications  include an email message application, a push content viewing application, a voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, a map application, and a media player application. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display device ) according to the application. As discussed above, any of such applications may offer the ability for the user to acquire digital goods from within the application.","In some example embodiments, the auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems  may include an external communication link or interface; for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile communication device  may include other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may include a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the mobile communication device  such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some example embodiments, the mobile communication device  also includes a removable memory module  (typically including flash memory, such as a removable memory card) and a memory interface . Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile communication device  via the memory module , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory module  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the mobile communication device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The mobile communication device  stores data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various example embodiments, the data  includes service data including information required by the mobile communication device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include the user application data  such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile communication device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the mobile communication device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the mobile device memory. The application data  may include application data  which is associated with a specific application. For example, an application which is a game may have associated application data  specifying high scores, etc.","In some example embodiments, the data  may include identification data such as a Personal Identification Number (\u201cPIN\u201d)  identifying either the user or the mobile device. In some example embodiments, the PIN is a unique identifier assigned to the mobile communication device  during manufacturing of that device . The PIN may be saved in non-volatile memory so that the mobile device will retain the PIN even when it is powered off. In some example embodiments the identification data, such as the PIN  may be transmitted to the application delivery server  as part of the purchase, download (i.e. transmission), or re-download (i.e. re-transmission) method associated with the delivery and subsequent re-delivery of an application from the application delivery server  to the mobile communication device .","In some example embodiments, the remote storage module  may provide for the backup and restoration of application data . Application data  may be backed up to a remote server; such as, for example, the application delivery server . For example, the mobile device  may transfer application data  associated with one or more application to the application delivery server . Also, the application data  may be automatically backed up to the application delivery server  periodically, upon achievements or completion of various levels, or upon purchase of associated digital goods from within the application.","In one example embodiment, when a request to remove an application from the mobile device  is received (for example, via an input mechanism), the remote storage module  transfers application data  to a remote server, such as the application delivery server . The remote server stores the application data . Later, if a user wishes to re-install the application to the same device (or, in some example embodiments, to other devices), the application data  is automatically retrieved from the server and stored in memory  on the mobile device  so that it is accessible by the re-installed application.","In another scenario, a user may backup application data  to a server, such as the application delivery server , to transition to a different mobile device . For example, a user may purchase a new mobile device  (referred to as a \u201csecond device\u201d) and may wish to use the same applications, with at least some of the same application data , on the new device which were previously installed on the old device  (referred to as a \u201cfirst device\u201d). The remote storage module  may allow a user to initiate a transfer of the application data  associated with an application from the first device to the server (i.e. the application data  may be backed up to the server).","The second device , which may also include the features discussed with respect to , may, automatically or at the request of the user via the input mechanism, retrieve and install one or more applications which were previously installed on the first device . That is, the second device  may request such applications from the application delivery server . Upon receiving a request from the new device  for the application, the application delivery server  may automatically transfer the application and the associated application data  to the second device . The second device  may automatically save the application data  to its memory . Again, such application data  may include digital goods  acquired from within an application.","Thus, a \u201cDigital Locker\u201d, storing applications and\/or digital goods for a user, may include one or more of the following features. In at least some example embodiments, if an application is restored to a mobile device and the application uses digital goods that are stored elsewhere, a user of the application and\/or the digital goods may be notified that the digital goods should be downloaded (i.e. transmitted) again. That is, a server operated or controlled by the developer may be notified that the application has been restored and the server may provide the associated digital goods to the mobile device.","In some example embodiments, if an application that uses digital goods is restored to a mobile device and that application contains digital goods which were previously purchased (for example, if the application is delivered with the digital goods but the digital goods are initially stored in a locked state), access to those digital goods may be automatically unlocked upon successful restore of the application.","In at least some example embodiments, if the user deletes an application that uses digital goods from his\/her mobile device, the application and unlocked digital goods may persist in the user's Digital Locker. That is, the application and\/or the unlocked digital goods may be stored elsewhere (e.g. on a server). The Digital Locker may track the applications and\/or digital goods that a user, device, or account has access to (e.g. applications which were previously purchased). Applications and\/or digital goods may be restored to a mobile device associated with a user, device, or account which has access to such applications and\/or digital goods. As will be discussed in greater detail below, digital goods may automatically be restored when an associated application is restored.","The digital storage locker may include authentication features so that a mobile device switch (i.e. a user's switch from one mobile device to another mobile device) cannot be used to duplicate or bypass payment in a way to scam application vendors and to prevent users from being double charged for movement of items, such as applications and\/or digital goods.","In at least some example embodiments, the mobile device (and\/or the remote storage module ) is configured to display details regarding digital goods which were previously purchased for an application. That is, the mobile device may present visual information which allow a user to track previously purchased digital goods.","The nature of the information that may be displayed to the user may depend on the type of digital good. In various example embodiments, the mobile device may be configured to display any of the following information regarding digital goods. In at least some example embodiments, the mobile device may be configured to display a name associated with the digital good. In some example embodiments, the mobile device may display an unlock code or a license key associated with the digital good. In some example embodiments, the mobile device may display an indication showing that the digital good is available (e.g. that the user has already purchased it). If a digital good has not been purchased, but all the digital goods associated with an application are displayed in a description for that application, the remote storage module  may display an indicator that the non-purchased digital goods are \u201clocked\u201d\/\u201cunavailable unless purchased\u201d (or a similar indictor). If a digital good is free (i.e. available at no cost), the mobile device may display an indicator which marks it as free. If the digital good involves downloading (i.e. transmitting)\/installing extra application files, such install status may be displayed by the mobile device. In at least some example embodiments, the mobile device may display version information associated with a digital good (e.g. if there can be different versions for the same digital goods for the same application version). Other information may also be displayed.","The serial data port  may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (not shown). The serial data port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile communication device  by providing for information or software downloads (i.e. transmissions) to the mobile communication device  other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile communication device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","In some example embodiments, the mobile communication device  is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth\u00ae (Bluetooth\u00ae is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile communication device  to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network  is automatically routed to the mobile communication device  using the USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network  is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth\u00ae connection to the host computer system for processing.","The mobile communication device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile communication device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile communication device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile communication device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile communication device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile communication device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the data port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem  other wireless communication interfaces. The downloaded (i.e. transmitted) programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile communication device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile communication device .","The mobile communication device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by an email message application and output to the display . A user of the mobile communication device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the touch-sensitive overlay  in conjunction with the display device  and possibly the control buttons  and\/or the auxiliary I\/O subsystems . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the mobile communication device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., the voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile communication device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display device  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","Example Server","Referring now to , an application delivery server  for use in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will now be described in greater detail. The application delivery server  may, for example, be implemented using any known general purpose computer technology, and may, for example, be realized as one or more microprocessor based server computers implementing one or more server applications configured for performing the processes and functions described herein.","The application delivery server  may include one or more controllers, such as a processor  for controlling the overall operation of the server . The application delivery server  may communicate with other devices connected to the network  through a communication subsystem and network interface . For example, the application delivery server  may communicate with the mobile devices  () via the wireless connector system  (). The application delivery server  has access to a data store  which may be local to the server  or remote from the server . The data store  contains applications  which are available for download (i.e. transmission), application data , and application information  describing the applications available for download, and application history information  identifying the applications  that a user or mobile device  has access to. That is, the application history information  identifies the applications  each user, account, or mobile device  is permitted to re-download (i.e. re-transmit). The application data  may include the digital goods  purchased from within the application, such as additional levels or features for a game application.","The processor  of the application delivery server  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory  such as persistent memory; for example, on a hard disk drive. As illustrated in , the software modules  include an application store module  for interfacing with the application store client  () and remote storage module  on the mobile communication devices  and providing for the download, backup, re-download, and\/or purchase of software applications .","In some example embodiments, the application store module  permits users of mobile devices  to purchase and download (i.e. transmission) applications for use on the mobile devices . The application store module  of the application delivery server  includes an application delivery module  for receiving a request from a mobile device  for delivering an application to the mobile device , retrieving the application  from a data store , and transmitting the application  to the mobile communication device . In some example embodiments, the application delivery module  may process a payment for an application . For example, the application delivery module  may post a charge to an account associated with the mobile communication device  or its user or process a credit card transaction. The application store module may act as a remote storage module, allowing users or mobile devices  to retrieve and download previously purchased applications  and\/or associated digital goods .","To provide such remote storage capabilities, after transmitting the application  to the mobile device and\/or processing a payment associated with the application transfer, the application store module  creates a record of the purchase or download by updating the application history information  associated with the user. The application history information  specifies the applications  that are available for a user or mobile device  to re-download at a later time. Each user or mobile device  which has purchased an application  through the application store  has application history information  associated with that user. The application history information  may be, for example, stored in one or more databases which may be indexed by an identifier associated with the user or the mobile device . For example, the database may be indexed by the PIN  associated with the mobile device . The application history information  includes data relating to previously purchased applications. For example, the application history information  may include an identifier associated with and identifying applications which were previously purchased, a version number associated with the application, a record of the total number of downloads of an application  since it was purchased or over a predetermined period of time. For example, the application history information  may track the number of times a user has downloaded an application  in the past year. In some example embodiments, if the total number of downloads reaches or exceeds a predetermined threshold which specifies the amount of downloads available to a user or device , the application store module  may prevent the re-downloading of the application . Accordingly, each user or mobile device  may have an application history information  record specifying an application purchase or download history for that user.","The application delivery module  transmits, to the mobile device  information specifying the applications  which are available for re-download (i.e. re-transmission). For example, the application delivery module  may determine, from the application history information , the applications that are available for download (i.e. transmission) to the mobile device  and notify the mobile device  of details of the applications  that are available for re-download. By way of non-limiting example, these details may include: the name of the application, a version number associated with the application, a date of purchase of the application, and other application information  regarding the application such as a description of the application and\/or available application data  including digital goods .","Later, the application delivery module  may receive a request from the mobile device  to re-download an application. The application delivery module  retrieves the requested application  and transmits it to the mobile device . In some example embodiments, the application delivery module  may be configured to record details of the re-download to the application history information  record associated with the mobile device  or user making the download request.","In some example embodiments, the application delivery server  includes a backup module  which is configured to facilitate the backup of application data . In the example embodiment of , the backup module  is illustrated as being included within the application store module . However, it will be appreciated that the backup module  could be located in other modules and may, in at least some example embodiments, be located in a server that is physically separate from the application delivery server .","In some example embodiments, the backup module  may provide for the backup and restoration of application data  received from one or more mobile device . The mobile device  may transfer application data  associated with one or more application to the application delivery server .","The mobile device  may transfer application data  to the server  in response to the occurrence of one or more predetermined trigger events. The trigger event may be, for example, one or more of the following: the receipt of a request to delete the application associated with the application data , the deletion of the application associated with the application data  from the memory , a request received via an input mechanism to backup the application data , or the receipt of a request to switch to a different device, such as a new device. Other trigger events are also possible. The backup module  may be configured to store the application data  and associated digital goods  in memory .","Later, the application data  and associated digital goods  may be transferred to a mobile device . In some example embodiments, the application data  may be transmitted to a mobile device  if a request to reinstall the application associated with the application data  is received from the same device  or user or a user or device associated with the same account. When such a request is received the application delivery module  may transfer the application to the requesting device  and the backup module  may retrieve the associated application data  and transmit it to the requesting device .","Similarly, in at least some example embodiments, digital goods which were acquired through an application may be restored to a mobile device  when such that application is restored.","Example Method of Managing the Use of Applications and Digital Goods","Reference is now made to  which illustrates an example embodiment of a method  of managing the use of applications  from the application delivery server  to a user of a wireless communications network. The application store module  (), for example, may be configured to perform various steps or operations of such method . More particularly, the application store module  may include computer readable instructions which may be executable by the processor  () to perform the method .","The method  includes storing , in a memory , application data  for applications  authorized for delivery to a first wireless communication device  of the user. The application data  is data which is used by an associated application. The application data  may be user or device specific data, such as user settings or preferences associated with an application, user achievements (e.g. high scores associated with a game, etc.) The application data is, in at least some example embodiments, configured or created by a user of the mobile device .","In at least some example embodiments, the application data  may include digital goods  acquired by a user from within an authorized application (i.e. within an application authorized for delivery to the mobile device). In other example embodiments, the application data  may include information regarding digital goods  acquired by the user from within authorized applications . An authorized application is an application which is authorized for delivery to the mobile device, such as, for example, an application that the mobile device has rights to. Such rights may exist, for example, as a result of a prior download (i.e. transmission) by the same device or user of the authorized application.","At , the method includes receiving, at the application delivery server , a request for an authorized application . The request may be a request for the authorized application  to be delivered to a second wireless communication device  of the user. For example, the user may have multiple authorized devices  associated with an account, the user may have deleted the previously purchased application, and\/or the user may be switching\/upgrading to a new device .","The method  includes, in response to receiving the request, retrieving  the authorized application  associated with the request, retrieving  application data  associated with the authorized application , and delivering  the authorized application  and the application data  to the mobile device from which the request was received (e.g. the second wireless communications device ).","At , the method includes restoring digital goods  within the authorized application  delivered to the wireless communications device  (e.g. the second wireless communications device ).","In at least some example embodiments, the application data  delivered at  may include the digital goods which were acquired by the user from within the authorized application. In other example embodiments, the application data  may include information regarding the digital goods which were acquired by the user from within the authorized application. In such example embodiments, the digital goods  may be restored based upon the application data, such as the information regarding the digital goods.","The information regarding digital goods  acquired by the user from within authorized applications may include links to content stored by an application developer. The information regarding digital goods  acquired by the user from within authorized applications  may include information regarding digital goods  purchased through an application store  on the application delivery server . The information regarding digital goods  acquired by the user from within authorized applications  may include unlockable content within the authorized application , and restoring  the digital goods  may then include unlocking the unlockable content.","In at least some example embodiments, the method  may also include identifying , from application history information , authorized applications  which are available for delivery to the second mobile communication device . The application history information  identifies the applications  each user, account, or mobile device  is permitted to re-download (i.e. re-transmit).","Then, at , the method  includes sending data of identified authorized applications  and the associated digital goods  to the mobile device from which the request was received at  (e.g. the second mobile communication device ) for display thereon. As discussed above, the memory  may define a \u201cdigital locker\u201d to store the application data  associated with the user. That is, a user may be able to view authorized applications (i.e. applications which are authorized for delivery to the mobile device) and any digital goods which are associated with such applications which are also authorized for delivery to the mobile device.","In at least some example embodiments, the method  may also include validating , at the application delivery server , an authorization of the application  requested to be delivered to the wireless communication device  (e.g. the second wireless communication device of the user). That is, the application delivery server  may ensure that the wireless communication device which is requesting the application at  is received the application. Such a validation may include, for example, confirming that the request at  is received from a wireless communication device  which is associated with a user who previously purchased and\/or downloaded (i.e. transmitted) the application (for example, on another wireless communication device , such as the first wireless communication device ). Validating  may include consulting application history data  to confirm that a user, account, or device is permitted to download the application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Many modifications and other example embodiments of the invention will come to the mind of one skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings.
