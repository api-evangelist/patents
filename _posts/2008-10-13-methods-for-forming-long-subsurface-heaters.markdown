Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to methods and systems for production of hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and\/or other products from various subsurface formations such as hydrocarbon containing formations.","2. Description of Related Art","Hydrocarbons obtained from subterranean formations are often used as energy resources, as feedstocks, and as consumer products. Concerns over depletion of available hydrocarbon resources and concerns over declining overall quality of produced hydrocarbons have led to development of processes for more efficient recovery, processing and\/or use of available hydrocarbon resources. In situ processes may be used to remove hydrocarbon materials from subterranean formations. Chemical and\/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material in a subterranean formation may need to be changed to allow hydrocarbon material to be more easily removed from the subterranean formation. The chemical and physical changes may include in situ reactions that produce removable fluids, composition changes, solubility changes, density changes, phase changes, and\/or viscosity changes of the hydrocarbon material in the formation. A fluid may be, but is not limited to, a gas, a liquid, an emulsion, a slurry, and\/or a stream of solid particles that has flow characteristics similar to liquid flow.","During some in situ processes, wax may be used to reduce vapors and\/or to encapsulate contaminants in the ground. Wax may be used during remediation of wastes to encapsulate contaminated material. U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,114,880 to Carter, and 5,879,110 to Carter, each of which is incorporated herein by reference, describe methods for treatment of contaminants using wax during the remediation procedures.","In some embodiments, a casing or other pipe system may be placed or formed in a wellbore. U.S. Pat. No. 4,572,299 issued to Van Egmond et al., which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes spooling an electric heater into a well. In some embodiments, components of a piping system may be welded together. Quality of formed wells may be monitored by various techniques. In some embodiments, quality of welds may be inspected by a hybrid electromagnetic acoustic transmission technique known as EMAT. EMAT is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,652,389 to Schaps et al.; 5,760,307 to Latimer et al.; 5,777,229 to Geier et al.; and 6,155,117 to Stevens et al., each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","In some embodiments, an expandable tubular may be used in a wellbore. Expandable tubulars are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,366,012 to Lohbeck, and 6,354,373 to Vercaemer et al., each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","Heaters may be placed in wellbores to heat a formation during an in situ process. Examples of in situ processes utilizing downhole heaters are illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,634,961 to Ljungstrom; 2,732,195 to Ljungstrom; 2,780,450 to Ljungstrom; 2,789,805 to Ljungstrom; 2,923,535 to Ljungstrom; and 4,886,118 to Van Meurs et al.; each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","Application of heat to oil shale formations is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,923,535 to Ljungstrom and 4,886,118 to Van Meurs et al. Heat may be applied to the oil shale formation to pyrolyze kerogen in the oil shale formation. The heat may also fracture the formation to increase permeability of the formation. The increased permeability may allow formation fluid to travel to a production well where the fluid is removed from the oil shale formation. In some processes disclosed by Ljungstrom, for example, an oxygen containing gaseous medium is introduced to a permeable stratum, preferably while still hot from a preheating step, to initiate combustion.","A heat source may be used to heat a subterranean formation. Electric heaters may be used to heat the subterranean formation by radiation and\/or conduction. An electric heater may resistively heat an element. U.S. Pat. No. 2,548,360 to Germain, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes an electric heating element placed in a viscous oil in a wellbore. The heater element heats and thins the oil to allow the oil to be pumped from the wellbore. U.S. Pat. No. 4,716,960 to Eastlund et al., which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes electrically heating tubing of a petroleum well by passing a relatively low voltage current through the tubing to prevent formation of solids. U.S. Pat. No. 5,065,818 to Van Egmond, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes an electric heating element that is cemented into a well borehole without a casing surrounding the heating element.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,023,554 to Vinegar et al., which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes an electric heating element that is positioned in a casing. The heating element generates radiant energy that heats the casing. A granular solid fill material may be placed between the casing and the formation. The casing may conductively heat the fill material, which in turn conductively heats the formation.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,570,715 to Van Meurs et al., which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes an electric heating element. The heating element has an electrically conductive core, a surrounding layer of insulating material, and a surrounding metallic sheath. The conductive core may have a relatively low resistance at high temperatures. The insulating material may have electrical resistance, compressive strength, and heat conductivity properties that are relatively high at high temperatures. The insulating layer may inhibit arcing from the core to the metallic sheath. The metallic sheath may have tensile strength and creep resistance properties that are relatively high at high temperatures.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,060,287 to Van Egmond, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes an electrical heating element having a copper-nickel alloy core.","Obtaining permeability in an oil shale formation between injection and production wells tends to be difficult because oil shale is often substantially impermeable. Many methods have attempted to link injection and production wells. These methods include: hydraulic fracturing such as methods investigated by Dow Chemical and Laramie Energy Research Center; electrical fracturing by methods investigated by Laramie Energy Research Center; acid leaching of limestone cavities by methods investigated by Dow Chemical; steam injection into permeable nahcolite zones to dissolve the nahcolite by methods investigated by Shell Oil and Equity Oil; fracturing with chemical explosives by methods investigated by Talley Energy Systems; fracturing with nuclear explosives by methods investigated by Project Bronco; and combinations of these methods. Many of these methods, however, have relatively high operating costs and lack sufficient injection capacity.","Large deposits of heavy hydrocarbons (heavy oil and\/or tar) contained in relatively permeable formations (for example in tar sands) are found in North America, South America, Africa, and Asia. Tar can be surface-mined and upgraded to lighter hydrocarbons such as crude oil, naphtha, kerosene, and\/or gas oil. Surface milling processes may further separate the bitumen from sand. The separated bitumen may be converted to light hydrocarbons using conventional refinery methods. Mining and upgrading tar sand is usually substantially more expensive than producing lighter hydrocarbons from conventional oil reservoirs.","In situ production of hydrocarbons from tar sand may be accomplished by heating and\/or injecting a gas into the formation. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,211,230 to Ostapovich et al. and 5,339,897 to Leaute, which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describe a horizontal production well located in an oil-bearing reservoir. A vertical conduit may be used to inject an oxidant gas into the reservoir for in situ combustion.","U.S. Pat. No. 2,780,450 to Ljungstrom describes heating bituminous geological formations in situ to convert or crack a liquid tar-like substance into oils and gases.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,597,441 to Ware et al., which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes contacting oil, heat, and hydrogen simultaneously in a reservoir. Hydrogenation may enhance recovery of oil from the reservoir.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,046,559 to Glandt and U.S. Pat. No. 5,060,726 to Glandt et al., which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describe preheating a portion of a tar sand formation between an injector well and a producer well. Steam may be injected from the injector well into the formation to produce hydrocarbons at the producer well.","As outlined above, there has been a significant amount of effort to develop methods and systems to economically produce hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and\/or other products from hydrocarbon containing formations. At present, however, there are still many hydrocarbon containing formations from which hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and\/or other products cannot be economically produced. Thus, there is still a need for improved methods and systems for production of hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and\/or other products from various hydrocarbon containing formations.","Embodiments described herein generally relate to systems, methods, and heaters for treating a subsurface formation. Embodiments described herein also generally relate to heaters that have novel components therein. Such heaters can be obtained by using the systems and methods described herein.","In certain embodiments, the invention provides one or more systems, methods, and\/or heaters. In some embodiments, the systems, methods, and\/or heaters are used for treating a subsurface formation.","In certain embodiments, a method for forming a longitudinal subsurface heater includes longitudinally welding an electrically conductive sheath of an insulated conductor heater along at least one longitudinal strip of metal; and forming the longitudinal strip into a tubular around the insulated conductor heater with the insulated conductor heater welded along the inside surface of the tubular.","In certain embodiments, a method for forming a longitudinal subsurface heater includes longitudinally welding an electrically conductive sheath of an insulated conductor heater along an inside surface of a metal tubular.","In certain embodiments, a longitudinal subsurface heater includes an insulated conductor heater, including: an electrical conductor; an electrical insulator at least partially surrounding the electrical conductor; and an electrically conductive sheath at least partially surrounding the electrical insulator; a metal tubular at least partially surrounding the insulated conductor heater; and wherein the sheath of the insulated conductor heater is longitudinally welded along an inside surface of the metal tubular.","In further embodiments, features from specific embodiments may be combined with features from other embodiments.

The systems may be surface burners, downhole gas burners, flameless distributed combustors, and natural distributed combustors. In some embodiments, heat provided to or generated in one or more heat sources may be supplied by other sources of energy. The other sources of energy may directly heat a formation, or the energy may be applied to a transfer medium that directly or indirectly heats the formation. It is to be understood that one or more heat sources that are applying heat to a formation may use different sources of energy.

Temperature limited heaters may be AC (alternating current) or modulated (for example, \u201cchopped\u201d) DC (direct current) powered electrical resistance heaters.","\u201cThermally conductive fluid\u201d includes fluid that has a higher thermal conductivity than air at standard temperature and pressure (STP) (0\u00b0 C. and 101.325 kPa).","\u201cThermal conductivity\u201d is a property of a material that describes the rate at which heat flows, in steady state, between two surfaces of the material for a given temperature difference between the two surfaces.","\u201cThermal fracture\u201d refers to fractures created in a formation caused by expansion or contraction of a formation and\/or fluids in the formation, which is in turn caused by increasing\/decreasing the temperature of the formation and\/or fluids in the formation, and\/or by increasing\/decreasing a pressure of fluids in the formation due to heating.","\u201cThermal oxidation stability\u201d refers to thermal oxidation stability of a liquid.

Different stages or processes may be used to treat the formation during an in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments, one or more sections of the formation are solution mined to remove soluble minerals from the sections. Solution mining minerals may be performed before, during, and\/or after the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments, the average temperature of one or more sections being solution mined may be maintained below about 120\u00b0 C.","In some embodiments, one or more sections of the formation are heated to remove water from the sections and\/or to remove methane and other volatile hydrocarbons from the sections. In some embodiments, the average temperature may be raised from ambient temperature to temperatures below about 220\u00b0 C. during removal of water and volatile hydrocarbons.","In some embodiments, one or more sections of the formation are heated to temperatures that allow for movement and\/or visbreaking of hydrocarbons in the formation. In some embodiments, the average temperature of one or more sections of the formation are raised to mobilization temperatures of hydrocarbons in the sections (for example, to temperatures ranging from 100\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C., from 120\u00b0 C. to 240\u00b0 C., or from 150\u00b0 C. to 230\u00b0 C.).","In some embodiments, one or more sections are heated to temperatures that allow for pyrolysis reactions in the formation. In some embodiments, the average temperature of one or more sections of the formation may be raised to pyrolysis temperatures of hydrocarbons in the sections (for example, temperatures ranging from 230\u00b0 C. to 900\u00b0 C., from 240\u00b0 C. to 400\u00b0 C. or from 250\u00b0 C. to 350\u00b0 C.).","Heating the hydrocarbon containing formation with a plurality of heat sources may establish thermal gradients around the heat sources that raise the temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation to desired temperatures at desired heating rates. The rate of temperature increase through mobilization temperature range and\/or pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may affect the quality and quantity of the formation fluids produced from the hydrocarbon containing formation. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the mobilization temperature range and\/or pyrolysis temperature range may allow for the production of high quality, high API gravity hydrocarbons from the formation. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the mobilization temperature range and\/or pyrolysis temperature range may allow for the removal of a large amount of the hydrocarbons present in the formation as hydrocarbon product.","In some in situ heat treatment embodiments, a portion of the formation is heated to a desired temperature instead of slowly heating the temperature through a temperature range. In some embodiments, the desired temperature is 300\u00b0 C., 325\u00b0 C., or 350\u00b0 C. Other temperatures may be selected as the desired temperature.","Superposition of heat from heat sources allows the desired temperature to be relatively quickly and efficiently established in the formation. Energy input into the formation from the heat sources may be adjusted to maintain the temperature in the formation substantially at a desired temperature.","Mobilization and\/or pyrolysis products may be produced from the formation through production wells. In some embodiments, the average temperature of one or more sections is raised to mobilization temperatures and hydrocarbons are produced from the production wells. The average temperature of one or more of the sections may be raised to pyrolysis temperatures after production due to mobilization decreases below a selected value. In some embodiments, the average temperature of one or more sections may be raised to pyrolysis temperatures without significant production before reaching pyrolysis temperatures. Formation fluids including pyrolysis products may be produced through the production wells.","In some embodiments, the average temperature of one or more sections may be raised to temperatures sufficient to allow synthesis gas production after mobilization and\/or pyrolysis. In some embodiments, hydrocarbons may be raised to temperatures sufficient to allow synthesis gas production without significant production before reaching the temperatures sufficient to allow synthesis gas production. For example, synthesis gas may be produced in a temperature range from about 400\u00b0 C. to about 1200\u00b0 C., about 500\u00b0 C. to about 1100\u00b0 C., or about 550\u00b0 C. to about 1000\u00b0 C. A synthesis gas generating fluid (for example, steam and\/or water) may be introduced into the sections to generate synthesis gas. Synthesis gas may be produced from production wells.","Solution mining, removal of volatile hydrocarbons and water, mobilizing hydrocarbons, pyrolyzing hydrocarbons, generating synthesis gas, and\/or other processes may be performed during the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments, some processes may be performed after the in situ heat treatment process. Such processes may include, but are not limited to, recovering heat from treated sections, storing fluids (for example, water and\/or hydrocarbons) in previously treated sections, and\/or sequestering carbon dioxide in previously treated sections.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0500","num":"0499"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","200","202","202"]},"Heat sources  are placed in at least a portion of the formation. Heat sources  may include heaters such as insulated conductors, conductor-in-conduit heaters, surface burners, flameless distributed combustors, and\/or natural distributed combustors. Heat sources  may also include other types of heaters. Heat sources  provide heat to at least a portion of the formation to heat hydrocarbons in the formation. Energy may be supplied to heat sources  through supply lines . Supply lines  may be structurally different depending on the type of heat source or heat sources used to heat the formation. Supply lines  for heat sources may transmit electricity for electric heaters, may transport fuel for combustors, or may transport heat exchange fluid that is circulated in the formation. In some embodiments, electricity for an in situ heat treatment process may be provided by a nuclear power plant or nuclear power plants. The use of nuclear power may allow for reduction or elimination of carbon dioxide emissions from the in situ heat treatment process.","When the formation is heated, the heat input into the formation may cause expansion of the formation and geomechanical motion. The heat sources may be turned on before, at the same time, or during a dewatering process. Computer simulations may model formation response to heating. The computer simulations may be used to develop a pattern and time sequence for activating heat sources in the formation so that geomechanical motion of the formation does not adversely affect the functionality of heat sources, production wells, and other equipment in the formation.","Heating the formation may cause an increase in permeability and\/or porosity of the formation. Increases in permeability and\/or porosity may result from a reduction of mass in the formation due to vaporization and removal of water, removal of hydrocarbons, and\/or creation of fractures. Fluid may flow more easily in the heated portion of the formation because of the increased permeability and\/or porosity of the formation. Fluid in the heated portion of the formation may move a considerable distance through the formation because of the increased permeability and\/or porosity. The considerable distance may be over 1000 m depending on various factors, such as permeability of the formation, properties of the fluid, temperature of the formation, and pressure gradient allowing movement of the fluid. The ability of fluid to travel considerable distance in the formation allows production wells  to be spaced relatively far apart in the formation.","Production wells  are used to remove formation fluid from the formation. In some embodiments, production well  includes a heat source. The heat source in the production well may heat one or more portions of the formation at or near the production well. In some in situ heat treatment process embodiments, the amount of heat supplied to the formation from the production well per meter of the production well is less than the amount of heat applied to the formation from a heat source that heats the formation per meter of the heat source. Heat applied to the formation from the production well may increase formation permeability adjacent to the production well by vaporizing and removing liquid phase fluid adjacent to the production well and\/or by increasing the permeability of the formation adjacent to the production well by formation of macro and\/or micro fractures.","More than one heat source may be positioned in the production well. A heat source in a lower portion of the production well may be turned off when superposition of heat from adjacent heat sources heats the formation sufficiently to counteract benefits provided by heating the formation with the production well. In some embodiments, the heat source in an upper portion of the production well may remain on after the heat source in the lower portion of the production well is deactivated. The heat source in the upper portion of the well may inhibit condensation and reflux of formation fluid.","In some embodiments, the heat source in production well  allows for vapor phase removal of formation fluids from the formation. Providing heating at or through the production well may: (1) inhibit condensation and\/or refluxing of production fluid when such production fluid is moving in the production well proximate the overburden, (2) increase heat input into the formation, (3) increase production rate from the production well as compared to a production well without a heat source, (4) inhibit condensation of high carbon number compounds (Chydrocarbons and above) in the production well, and\/or (5) increase formation permeability at or proximate the production well.","Subsurface pressure in the formation may correspond to the fluid pressure generated in the formation. As temperatures in the heated portion of the formation increase, the pressure in the heated portion may increase as a result of thermal expansion of in situ fluids, increased fluid generation and vaporization of water. Controlling rate of fluid removal from the formation may allow for control of pressure in the formation. Pressure in the formation may be determined at a number of different locations, such as near or at production wells, near or at heat sources, or at monitor wells.","In some hydrocarbon containing formations, production of hydrocarbons from the formation is inhibited until at least some hydrocarbons in the formation have been mobilized and\/or pyrolyzed. Formation fluid may be produced from the formation when the formation fluid is of a selected quality. In some embodiments, the selected quality includes an API gravity of at least about 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0, or 40\u00b0. Inhibiting production until at least some hydrocarbons are mobilized and\/or pyrolyzed may increase conversion of heavy hydrocarbons to light hydrocarbons. Inhibiting initial production may minimize the production of heavy hydrocarbons from the formation. Production of substantial amounts of heavy hydrocarbons may require expensive equipment and\/or reduce the life of production equipment.","In some hydrocarbon containing formations, hydrocarbons in the formation may be heated to mobilization and\/or pyrolysis temperatures before substantial permeability has been generated in the heated portion of the formation. An initial lack of permeability may inhibit the transport of generated fluids to production wells . During initial heating, fluid pressure in the formation may increase proximate heat sources . The increased fluid pressure may be released, monitored, altered, and\/or controlled through one or more heat sources . For example, selected heat sources  or separate pressure relief wells may include pressure relief valves that allow for removal of some fluid from the formation.","In some embodiments, pressure generated by expansion of mobilized fluids, pyrolysis fluids or other fluids generated in the formation may be allowed to increase although an open path to production wells  or any other pressure sink may not yet exist in the formation. The fluid pressure may be allowed to increase towards a lithostatic pressure. Fractures in the hydrocarbon containing formation may form when the fluid approaches the lithostatic pressure. For example, fractures may form from heat sources  to production wells  in the heated portion of the formation. The generation of fractures in the heated portion may relieve some of the pressure in the portion. Pressure in the formation may have to be maintained below a selected pressure to inhibit unwanted production, fracturing of the overburden or underburden, and\/or coking of hydrocarbons in the formation.","After mobilization and\/or pyrolysis temperatures are reached and production from the formation is allowed, pressure in the formation may be varied to alter and\/or control a composition of formation fluid produced, to control a percentage of condensable fluid as compared to non-condensable fluid in the formation fluid, and\/or to control an API gravity of formation fluid being produced. For example, decreasing pressure may result in production of a larger condensable fluid component. The condensable fluid component may contain a larger percentage of olefins.","In some in situ heat treatment process embodiments, pressure in the formation may be maintained high enough to promote production of formation fluid with an API gravity of greater than 20\u00b0. Maintaining increased pressure in the formation may inhibit formation subsidence during in situ heat treatment. Maintaining increased pressure may reduce or eliminate the need to compress formation fluids at the surface to transport the fluids in collection conduits to treatment facilities.","Maintaining increased pressure in a heated portion of the formation may surprisingly allow for production of large quantities of hydrocarbons of increased quality and of relatively low molecular weight. Pressure may be maintained so that formation fluid produced has a minimal amount of compounds above a selected carbon number. The selected carbon number may be at most 25, at most 20, at most 12, or at most 8. Some high carbon number compounds may be entrained in vapor in the formation and may be removed from the formation with the vapor. Maintaining increased pressure in the formation may inhibit entrainment of high carbon number compounds and\/or multi-ring hydrocarbon compounds in the vapor. High carbon number compounds and\/or multi-ring hydrocarbon compounds may remain in a liquid phase in the formation for significant time periods. The significant time periods may provide sufficient time for the compounds to pyrolyze to form lower carbon number compounds.","Generation of relatively low molecular weight hydrocarbons is believed to be due, in part, to autogenous generation and reaction of hydrogen in a portion of the hydrocarbon containing formation. For example, maintaining an increased pressure may force hydrogen generated during pyrolysis into the liquid phase within the formation. Heating the portion to a temperature in a pyrolysis temperature range may pyrolyze hydrocarbons in the formation to generate liquid phase pyrolyzation fluids. The generated liquid phase pyrolyzation fluids components may include double bonds and\/or radicals. Hydrogen (H) in the liquid phase may reduce double bonds of the generated pyrolyzation fluids, thereby reducing a potential for polymerization or formation of long chain compounds from the generated pyrolyzation fluids. In addition, Hmay also neutralize radicals in the generated pyrolyzation fluids. Hin the liquid phase may inhibit the generated pyrolyzation fluids from reacting with each other and\/or with other compounds in the formation.","Formation fluid produced from production wells  may be transported through collection piping  to treatment facilities . Formation fluids may also be produced from heat sources . For example, fluid may be produced from heat sources  to control pressure in the formation adjacent to the heat sources. Fluid produced from heat sources  may be transported through tubing or piping to collection piping  or the produced fluid may be transported through tubing or piping directly to treatment facilities . Treatment facilities  may include separation units, reaction units, upgrading units, fuel cells, turbines, storage vessels, and\/or other systems and units for processing produced formation fluids. The treatment facilities may form transportation fuel from at least a portion of the hydrocarbons produced from the formation. In some embodiments, the transportation fuel may be jet fuel, such as JP-8.","Formation fluid may be hot when produced from the formation through the production wells. Hot formation fluid may be produced during solution mining processes and\/or during in situ heat treatment processes. In some embodiments, electricity may be generated using the heat of the fluid produced from the formation. Also, heat recovered from the formation after the in situ process may be used to generate electricity. The generated electricity may be used to supply power to the in situ heat treatment process. For example, the electricity may be used to power heaters, or to power a refrigeration system for forming or maintaining a low temperature barrier. Electricity may be generated using a Kalina cycle, Rankine cycle or other thermodynamic cycle. In some embodiments, the working fluid for the cycle used to generate electricity is aqua ammonia.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0517","num":"0516"},"figref":["FIGS. 2-8","FIGS. 2"],"b":["7","8","212","214","216","218","220","216"]},"Formation fluid  enters fluid separation unit  and is separated into in situ heat treatment process liquid stream , in situ heat treatment process gas , and aqueous stream .

As produced formation fluid enters the quench zone, quenching fluid such as water, nonpotable water, hydrocarbon diluent, and\/or other components may be added to the formation fluid to quench and\/or cool the formation fluid to a temperature suitable for handling in downstream processing equipment. Quenching the formation fluid may inhibit formation of compounds that contribute to physical and\/or chemical instability of the fluid (for example, inhibit formation of compounds that may precipitate from solution, contribute to corrosion, and\/or fouling of downstream equipment and\/or piping). The quenching fluid may be introduced into the formation fluid as a spray and\/or a liquid stream. In some embodiments, the formation fluid is introduced into the quenching fluid. In some embodiments, the formation fluid is cooled by passing the fluid through a heat exchanger to remove some heat from the formation fluid. The quench fluid may be added to the cooled formation fluid when the temperature of the formation fluid is near or at the dew point of the quench fluid. Quenching the formation fluid near or at the dew point of the quench fluid may enhance solubilization of salts that may cause chemical and\/or physical instability of the quenched fluid (for example, ammonium salts). In some embodiments, an amount of water used in the quench is minimal so that salts of inorganic compounds and\/or other components do not separate from the mixture. In separation unit , at least a portion of the quench fluid may be separated from the quench mixture and recycled to the quench zone with a minimal amount of treatment. Heat produced from the quench may be captured and used in other facilities. In some embodiments, vapor may be produced during the quench.

The physical treatment system may include, but is not limited to, a membrane unit, a pressure swing adsorption unit, a liquid absorption unit, and\/or a cryogenic unit. The chemical treatment system may include units that use amines (for example, diethanolamine or di-isopropanolamine), zinc oxide, sulfolane, water, or mixtures thereof in the treatment process. In some embodiments, gas separation unit  uses a Sulfinol gas treatment process for removal of sulfur compounds. Carbon dioxide may be removed using Catacarb\u00ae (Catacarb, Overland Park, Kans., U.S.A.) and\/or Benfield (UOP, Des Plaines, Ill., U.S.A.) gas treatment processes. In some embodiments, the gas separation unit is a rectified adsorption and high pressure fractionation unit. In some embodiments, in situ heat treatment process gas is treated to remove at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or at least 90% by volume of ammonia present in the gas stream.","In situ heat treatment process gas  may include one or more carbon oxides and sulfur compounds that render the in situ heat treatment process gas unacceptable for sale, transportation, and\/or use as a fuel. The in situ heat treatment process gas  may be processed as described herein to produce a gas stream acceptable for sale, transportation, and\/or use as a fuel. It would be advantageous to separate the in situ treatment process gas  at the treatment site to produce streams useable as energy sources to lower overall energy costs. For example, streams containing hydrocarbons and\/or hydrogen may be used as fuel for burners and\/or process equipment. Streams containing sulfur compounds may be used as fuel for burners. Streams containing one or more carbon oxides and\/or hydrocarbons may be used to form barriers around a treatment site. Streams containing hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at most 2 may be provided to ammonia processing facilities and\/or barrier well systems. In situ heat treatment process gas  may include a sufficient amount of hydrogen such that the freezing point of carbon dioxide is depressed. Depression of the freezing point of carbon dioxide may allow cryogenic separation of hydrogen and\/or hydrocarbons from the carbon dioxide using distillation methods instead of removing the carbon dioxide by cryogenic precipitation methods. In some embodiments, the freezing point of carbon dioxide may be depressed by adjusting the concentration of molecular hydrogen and\/or addition of heavy hydrocarbons to the process gas stream.","As shown in , in situ heat treatment process gas  may enter compressor  of gas separation unit  to form compressed gas stream  and heavy stream . Heavy stream  may be transported to one or more liquid separation units for further processing. Compressor  may be any compressor suitable for compressing gas. In certain embodiments, compressor  is a multistage compressor (for example 2 to 3 compressor trains) having an outlet pressure of about 40 bars.

In some embodiments, hydrocarbon stream  may have a boiling range distribution between about 200\u00b0 C. and about 350\u00b0 C., between about 220\u00b0 C. and 340\u00b0 C., between about 230\u00b0 C. and 330\u00b0 C. or between about 240\u00b0 C. and 320\u00b0 C.","In some embodiments, at least 50%, at least 70%, or at least 90% by weight of the total hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon stream  have a carbon number from 8 to 13. About 50% to about 100%, about 60% to about 95%, about 70% to about 90%, or about 75% to 85% by weight of liquid stream may have a carbon number distribution from 8 to 13. At least 50% by weight of the total hydrocarbons in the separated liquid stream may have a carbon number from about 9 to 12 or from 10 to 11.","In some embodiments, hydrocarbon stream  has at most 15%, at most 10%, at most 5% by weight of naphthenes; at least 70%, at least 80%, or at least 90% by weight total paraffins; at most 5%, at most 3%, or at most 1% by weight olefins; and at most 30%, at most 20%, or at most 10% by weight aromatics.","In some embodiments, hydrocarbon stream  has a nitrogen compound content of at least 0.01%, at least 0.1% or at least 0.4% by weight nitrogen compound. The separated liquid stream may have a sulfur compound content of at least 0.01%, at least 0.5% or at least 1% by weight sulfur compound.","Hydrocarbon stream  enters hydrotreating unit . In hydrotreating unit , liquid stream  may be hydrotreated to form compounds suitable for processing to hydrogen and\/or commercial products.","Liquid hydrocarbon stream  from liquid separation unit  may include hydrocarbons having a boiling point up to 260\u00b0 C. Liquid hydrocarbon stream  may include entrained asphaltenes and\/or other compounds that may contribute to the instability of hydrocarbon streams. For example, liquid hydrocarbon stream  is a naphtha\/kerosene fraction that includes entrained, partially dissolved, and\/or dissolved asphaltenes and\/or high molecular weight compounds that may contribute to phase instability of the liquid hydrocarbon stream. In some embodiments, liquid hydrocarbon stream  may include at least 0.5% by weight asphaltenes, 1% by weight asphaltenes or at least 5% by weight asphaltenes.","As properties of the liquid hydrocarbon stream  are changed during processing (for example, TAN, asphaltenes, P-value, olefin content, mobilized fluids content, visbroken fluids content, pyrolyzed fluids content, or combinations thereof), the asphaltenes and other components may become less soluble in the liquid hydrocarbon stream. In some instances, components in the produced fluids and\/or components in the separated hydrocarbons may form two phases and\/or become insoluble. Formation of two phases, through flocculation of asphaltenes, change in concentration of components in the produced fluids, change in concentration of components in separated hydrocarbons, and\/or precipitation of components may cause processing problems (for example, plugging) and\/or result in hydrocarbons that do not meet pipeline, transportation, and\/or refining specifications. In some embodiments, further treatment of the produced fluids and\/or separated hydrocarbons is necessary to produce products with desired properties.","During processing, the P-value of the separated hydrocarbons may be monitored and the stability of the produced fluids and\/or separated hydrocarbons may be assessed. Typically, a P-value that is at most 1.0 indicates that flocculation of asphaltenes from the separated hydrocarbons may occur. If the P-value is initially at least 1.0 and such P-value increases or is relatively stable during heating, then this indicates that the separated hydrocarbons are relatively stable.","Liquid hydrocarbon stream  may be treated to at least partially remove asphaltenes and\/or other compounds that may contribute to instability. Removal of the asphaltenes and\/or other compounds that may contribute to instability may inhibit plugging in downstream processing units. Removal of the asphaltenes and\/or other compounds that may contribute to instability may enhance processing unit efficiencies and\/or prevent plugging of transportation pipelines.","Liquid hydrocarbon stream  may enter filtration system . Filtration system  separates at least a portion of the asphaltenes and\/or other compounds that contribute to instability from liquid hydrocarbon stream . In some embodiments, filtration system  is skid mounted. Skid mounting filtration system  may allow the filtration system to be moved from one processing unit to another. In some embodiments, filtration system  includes one or more membrane separators, for example, one or more nanofiltration membranes or one or more reverse osmosis membranes. Use of a filtration system that operates at below ambient, ambient, or slightly higher than ambient temperatures may reduce energy costs as compared to conventional catalytic and\/or thermal methods to remove asphaltenes from a hydrocarbon stream.","The membranes may be ceramic membranes and\/or polymeric membranes. The ceramic membranes may be ceramic membranes having a molecular weight cut off of at most 2000 Daltons (Da), at most 1000 Da, or at most 500 Da. Ceramic membranes may not swell during removal of the desired materials from a substrate (for example, asphaltenes from the liquid stream). In addition, ceramic membranes may be used at elevated temperatures. Examples of ceramic membranes include, but are not limited to, mesoporous titania, mesoporous gamma-alumina, mesoporous zirconia, mesoporous silica, and combinations thereof.","Polymeric membranes may include top layers made of dense membrane and base layers (supports) made of porous membranes. The polymeric membranes may be arranged to allow the liquid stream (permeate) to flow first through the top layers and then through the base layer so that the pressure difference over the membrane pushes the top layer onto the base layer. The polymeric membranes are organophilic or hydrophobic membranes so that water present in the liquid stream is retained or substantially retained in the retentate.","The dense membrane layer of the polymeric membrane may separate at least a portion or substantially all of the asphaltenes from liquid hydrocarbon stream . In some embodiments, the dense polymeric membrane has properties such that liquid hydrocarbon stream  passes through the membrane by dissolving in and diffusing through the structure of dense membrane. At least a portion of the asphaltenes may not dissolve and\/or diffuse through the dense membrane, thus they are removed. The asphaltenes may not dissolve and\/or diffuse through the dense membrane because of the complex structure of the asphaltenes and\/or their high molecular weight. The dense membrane layer may include cross-linked structure as described in WO 96\/27430 to Schmidt et al., which is incorporated by reference herein. A thickness of the dense membrane layer may range from 1 micrometer to 15 micrometers, from 2 micrometers to 10 micrometers, or from 3 micrometers to 5 micrometers.","The dense membrane may be made from polysiloxane, poly-di-methyl siloxane, poly-octyl-methyl siloxane, polyimide, polyaramide, poly-tri-methyl silyl propyne, or mixtures thereof. Porous base layers may be made of materials that provide mechanical strength to the membrane. The porous base layers may be any porous membranes used for ultra filtration, nanofiltration, and\/or reverse osmosis. Examples of such materials are polyacrylonitrile, polyamideimide in combination with titanium oxide, polyetherimide, polyvinylidenedifluoroide, polytetrafluoroethylene, or combinations thereof.","During separation of asphaltenes from liquid stream , the pressure difference across the membrane may range from about 0.5 MPa to about 6 MPa, from about 1 MPa to about 5 MPa, or from about 2 MPa to about 4 MPa. A temperature of the unit during separation may range from the pour point of liquid hydrocarbon stream  up to 100\u00b0 C., from about \u221220\u00b0 C. to about 100\u00b0 C., from about 10\u00b0 C. to about 90\u00b0 C., or from about 20\u00b0 C. to about 85\u00b0 C. During continuous operation, the permeate flux rate may be at most 50% of the initial flux, at most 70% of the initial flux, or at most 90% of the initial flux. A weight recovery of the permeate on feed may range from about 50% by weight to 97% by weight, from about 60% by weight to 90% by weight, or from about 70% by weight to 80% by weight.","Filtration system  may include one or more membrane separators. The membrane separators may include one or more membrane modules. When two or more membrane separators are used, the separators may be arranged in a parallel configuration to allow feed (retentate) from a first membrane separator to flow into a second membrane separator. Examples of membrane modules include, but are not limited to, spirally wound modules, plate and frame modules, hollow fibers, and tubular modules. Membrane modules are described in Encyclopedia of Chemical Engineering, 4b Ed., 1995, John Wiley & Sons Inc., Vol. 16, pages 158-164. Examples of spirally wound modules are described in, for example, WO\/2006\/040307 to Boestert et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,102,551 to Pasternak; U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,002 to Pasternak; U.S. Pat. No. 5,275,726 to Feimer et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,774 to Mannapperuma; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,150,118 to Finkle et al, all of which are incorporated by reference herein.","In some embodiments, a spirally wound module is used when a dense membrane is used in filtration system . A spirally wound module may include a membrane assembly of two membrane sheets between which a permeate spacer sheet is sandwiched. The membrane assembly may be sealed at three sides. The fourth side is connected to a permeate outlet conduit such that the area between the membranes is in fluid communication with the interior of the conduit. A feed spacer sheet may be arranged on top of one of the membranes. The assembly with feed spacer sheet is rolled up around the permeate outlet conduit to form a substantially cylindrical spirally wound membrane module. The feed spacer may have a thickness of at least 0.6 mm, at least 1 mm, or at least 3 mm to allow sufficient membrane surface to be packed into the spirally wound module. In some embodiments, the feed spacer is a woven feed spacer. During operation, the feed mixture may be passed from one end of the cylindrical module between the membrane assemblies along the feed spacer sheet sandwiched between feed sides of the membranes. Part of the feed mixture passes through either one of the membrane sheets to the permeate side. The resulting permeate flows along the permeate spacer sheet into the permeate outlet conduit.","In some embodiments, the membrane separation is a continuous process. Liquid stream  passes over the membrane due to the pressure difference to obtain filtered liquid stream  (permeate) and\/or recycle liquid stream  (retentate). In some embodiments, filtered liquid stream  may have reduced concentrations of asphaltenes and\/or high molecular weight compounds that may contribute to phase instability. Continuous recycling of recycle liquid stream  through the filter system can increase the production of filtered liquid stream  to as much as 95% of the original volume of filtered liquid stream . Recycle liquid stream  may be continuously recycled through a spirally wound membrane module for at least 10 hours, for at least one day, or for at least one week without cleaning the feed side of the membrane. Upon completion of the filtration, asphaltene enriched stream  (retentate) may include a high concentration of asphaltenes and\/or high molecular weight compounds.","In some embodiments, liquid stream  is contacted with hydrogen in the presence of one or more catalysts to change one or more desired properties of the crude feed to meet transportation and\/or refinery specifications using known hydrodemetallation, hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrofication techniques. Other methods to change one or more desired properties of the crude feed are described in U.S. Published Patent Applications Nos. 2005-0133414; 2006-0231465; and 2007-0000810 to Bhan et al.; 2005-0133405 to Wellington et al.; and 2006-0289340 to Brownscombe et al., all of which are incorporated by reference herein.","In some embodiments, the hydrotreated liquid stream has a nitrogen compound content of at most 200 ppm by weight, at most 150 ppm, at most 110 ppm, at most 50 ppm, or at most 10 ppm of nitrogen compounds. The separated liquid stream may have a sulfur compound content of at most 1000 ppm, at most 500 ppm, at most 300 ppm, at most 100 ppm, or at most 10 ppm by weight of sulfur compounds.","As shown in  and , liquid stream  and\/or filtered liquid stream  may enter hydrotreating unit . In some embodiments, hydrogen source  enters hydrotreating unit  in addition to liquid stream  and\/or filtered liquid stream . In some embodiments, the hydrogen source is not needed. Liquid stream  and\/or filtered liquid stream  may be selectively hydrogenated in hydrotreating unit  such that di-olefins are reduced to mono-olefins. For example, liquid stream  and\/or filtered liquid stream  is contacted with hydrogen in the presence of DN-200 (Criterion Catalysts & Technologies, Houston Tex., U.S.A.) at temperatures ranging from 100\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C. and total pressures of 0.1 MPa to 40 MPa to produce liquid stream . In some embodiments, filtered liquid stream  is hydrotreated at a temperature ranging from about 190\u00b0 C. to about 200\u00b0 C. at a pressure of at least 6 MPa. Liquid stream  includes a reduced content of di-olefins and an increased content of mono-olefins relative to the di-olefin and mono-olefin content of liquid stream . In some embodiments, the conversion of di-olefins to mono-olefins under these conditions is at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 80% or at least 90%. Liquid stream  exits hydrotreating unit  and enters one or more processing units positioned downstream of hydrotreating unit . The units positioned downstream of hydrotreating unit  may include distillation units, catalytic reforming units, hydrocracking units, hydrotreating units, hydrogenation units, hydrodesulfurization units, catalytic cracking units, delayed coking units, gasification units, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, hydrotreating prior to fractionation is not necessary. In some embodiments, liquid stream  may be severely hydrotreated to remove undesired compounds from the liquid stream prior to fractionation. In certain embodiments, liquid stream  may be fractionated and the produced streams may each be hydrotreated to meet industry standards and\/or transportation standards.","Liquid stream  may exit hydrotreating unit  and enter fractionation unit . In fractionation unit , liquid stream  may be distilled to form one or more crude products. Crude products include, but are not limited to, C-Chydrocarbon stream , naphtha stream , kerosene stream , diesel stream , and bottoms stream . Fractionation unit  may be operated at atmospheric and\/or under vacuum conditions.","In some embodiments, hydrotreated liquid streams and\/or streams produced from fractions (for example, aromatic rich streams, distillates and\/or naphtha) are blended with the in situ heat treatment process liquid and\/or formation fluid to produce a blended fluid. The blended fluid may have enhanced physical stability and chemical stability as compared to the formation fluid. The blended fluid may have a reduced amount of reactive species (for example, di-olefins, other olefins and\/or compounds containing oxygen, sulfur and\/or nitrogen) relative to the formation fluid. Thus, chemical stability of the blended fluid is enhanced. The blended fluid may decrease an amount of asphaltenes relative to the formation fluid. Thus, physical stability of the blended fluid is enhanced. The blended fluid may be a more a fungible feed than the formation fluid and\/or the liquid stream produced from the in situ heat treatment process. The blended feed may be more suitable for transportation, for use in chemical processing units and\/or for use in refining units than formation fluid.","In some embodiments, a fluid produced by methods described herein from an oil shale formation may be blended with heavy oil\/tar sands in situ heat treatment process (IHTP) fluid. Blended fluids may have properties (for example, viscosity and\/or P-value) that make the blended fluid more acceptable for transportation and\/or distribution to processing units. In some embodiments, produced oil shale fluid may be blended with bitumen to produce a blended bitumen having acceptable viscosity and\/or stability properties. Thus, the blended bitumen may be transported and\/or distributed to processing units.","As shown in  and , C-Chydrocarbon stream  produced from fractionation unit  and\/or hydrocarbon gas stream  enter alkylation unit . In alkylation unit , reaction of the olefins in hydrocarbon gas stream  (for example, propylene, butylenes, amylenes, or combinations thereof) with the iso-paraffins in C-Chydrocarbon stream  produces hydrocarbon stream . In some embodiments, the olefin content in hydrocarbon gas stream  is acceptable and an additional source of olefins is not needed. Hydrocarbon stream  includes hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at least 4. Hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at least 4 include, but are not limited to, butanes, pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, and octanes. In certain embodiments, hydrocarbons produced from alkylation unit  have an octane number greater than 70, greater than 80, or greater than 90. In some embodiments, hydrocarbon stream  is suitable for use as gasoline without further processing.","In some embodiments, and as depicted in  and , bottoms stream  may be hydrocracked to produce naphtha and\/or other products. The resulting naphtha may, however, need reformation to alter the octane level so that the product may be sold commercially as gasoline. Alternatively, bottoms stream  may be treated in a catalytic cracker to produce naphtha and\/or feed for an alkylation unit. In some embodiments, naphtha stream , kerosene stream , and diesel stream  have an imbalance of paraffinic hydrocarbons, olefinic hydrocarbons, and\/or aromatic hydrocarbons. The streams may not have a suitable quantity of olefins and\/or aromatics for use in commercial products. This imbalance may be changed by combining at least a portion of the streams to form combined stream  which has a boiling range distribution from about 38\u00b0 C. to about 343\u00b0 C. Catalytically cracking combined stream  may produce olefins and\/or other streams suitable for use in an alkylation unit and\/or other processing units. In some embodiments, naphtha stream  is hydrocracked to produce olefins.","Combined stream  and bottoms stream  from fractionation unit  enter catalytic cracking unit . Under controlled cracking conditions (for example, controlled temperatures and pressures), catalytic cracking unit  produces additional C-Chydrocarbon stream \u2032, gasoline hydrocarbons stream , and additional kerosene stream \u2032.","Additional C-Chydrocarbon stream \u2032 may be sent to alkylation unit , combined with C-Chydrocarbon stream , and\/or combined with hydrocarbon gas stream  to produce gasoline suitable for commercial sale. In some embodiments, the olefin content in hydrocarbon gas stream  is acceptable and an additional source of olefins is not needed.","Many wells are needed for treating the hydrocarbon formation using the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments, vertical or substantially vertical wells are formed in the formation. In some embodiments, horizontal or U-shaped wells are formed in the formation. In some embodiments, combinations of horizontal and vertical wells are formed in the formation.","A manufacturing approach for forming wellbores in the formation may be used due to the large number of wells that need to be formed for the in situ heat treatment process. The manufacturing approach may be particularly applicable for forming wells for in situ heat treatment processes that utilize u-shaped wells or other types of wells that have long non-vertically oriented sections. Surface openings for the wells may be positioned in lines running along one or two sides of the treatment area.  depicts a schematic representation of an embodiment of a system for forming wellbores of the in situ heat treatment process.","The manufacturing approach for forming wellbores may include: 1) delivering flat rolled steel to near site tube manufacturing plant that forms coiled tubulars and\/or pipe for surface pipelines; 2) manufacturing large diameter coiled tubing that is tailored to the required well length using electrical resistance welding (ERW), wherein the coiled tubing has customized ends for the bottom hole assembly (BHA) and hang off at the wellhead; 3) deliver the coiled tubing to a drilling rig on a large diameter reel; 4) drill to total depth with coil and a retrievable bottom hole assembly; 5) at total depth, disengage the coil and hang the coil on the wellhead; 6) retrieve the BHA; 7) launch an expansion cone to expand the coil against the formation; 8) return empty spool to the tube manufacturing plant to accept a new length of coiled tubing; 9) move the gantry type drilling platform to the next well location; and 10) repeat.","In situ heat treatment process locations may be distant from established cities and transportation networks. Transporting formed pipe or coiled tubing for wellbores to the in situ process location may be untenable due to the lengths and quantity of tubulars needed for the in situ heat treatment process. One or more tube manufacturing facilities  may be formed at or near to the in situ heat treatment process location. The tubular manufacturing facility may form plate steel into coiled tubing. The plate steel may be delivered to tube manufacturing facilities  by truck, train, ship or other transportation system. In some embodiments, different sections of the coiled tubing may be formed of different alloys. The tubular manufacturing facility may use ERW to longitudinally weld the coiled tubing.","Tube manufacturing facilities  may be able to produce tubing having various diameters. Tube manufacturing facilities may initially be used to produce coiled tubing for forming wellbores. The tube manufacturing facilities may also be used to produce heater components, piping for transporting formation fluid to surface facilities, and other piping and tubing needs for the in situ heat treatment process.","Tube manufacturing facilities  may produce coiled tubing used to form wellbores in the formation. The coiled tubing may have a large diameter. The diameter of the coiled tubing may be from about 4 inches to about 8 inches in diameter. In some embodiments, the diameter of the coiled tubing is about 6 inches in diameter. The coiled tubing may be placed on large diameter reels. Large diameter reels may be needed due to the large diameter of the tubing. The diameter of the reel may be from about 10 m to about 50 m. One reel may hold all of the tubing needed for completing a single well to total depth.","In some embodiments, tube manufacturing facilities  has the ability to apply expandable zonal inflow profiler (EZIP) material to one or more sections of the tubing that the facility produces. The EZIP material may be placed on portions of the tubing that are to be positioned near and next to aquifers or high permeability layers in the formation. When activated, the EZIP material forms a seal against the formation that may serve to inhibit migration of formation fluid between different layers. The use of EZIP layers may inhibit saline formation fluid from mixing with non-saline formation fluid.","The size of the reels used to hold the coiled tubing may prohibit transport of the reel using standard moving equipment and roads. Because tube manufacturing facility  is at or near the in situ heat treatment location, the equipment used to move the coiled tubing to the well sites does not have to meet existing road transportation regulations and can be designed to move large reels of tubing. In some embodiments the equipment used to move the reels of tubing is similar to cargo gantries used to move shipping containers at ports and other facilities. In some embodiments, the gantries are wheeled units. In some embodiments, the coiled tubing may be moved using a rail system or other transportation system.","The coiled tubing may be moved from the tubing manufacturing facility to the well site using gantries . Drilling gantry  may be used at the well site. Several drilling gantries  may be used to form wellbores at different locations. Supply systems for drilling fluid or other needs may be coupled to drilling gantries  from central facilities .","Drilling gantry  or other equipment may be used to set the conductor for the well. Drilling gantry  takes coiled tubing, passes the coiled tubing through a straightener, and a BHA attached to the tubing is used to drill the wellbore to depth. In some embodiments, a composite coil is positioned in the coiled tubing at tube manufacturing facility . The composite coil allows the wellbore to be formed without having drilling fluid flowing between the formation and the tubing. The composite coil also allows the BHA to be retrieved from the wellbore. The composite coil may be pulled from the tubing after wellbore formation. The composite coil may be returned to the tubing manufacturing facility to be placed in another length of coiled tubing. In some embodiments, the BHAs are not retrieved from the wellbores.","In some embodiments, drilling gantry  takes the reel of coiled tubing from gantry . In some embodiments, gantry  is coupled to drilling gantry  during the formation of the wellbore. For example, the coiled tubing may be fed from gantry  to drilling gantry , or the drilling gantry lifts the gantry to a feed position and the tubing is fed from the gantry to the drilling gantry.","The wellbore may be formed using the bottom hole assembly, coiled tubing and the drilling gantry. The BHA may be self-seeking to the destination. The BHA may form the opening at a fast rate. In some embodiments, the BHA forms the opening at a rate of about 100 meters per hour.","After the wellbore is drilled to total depth, the tubing may be suspended from the wellhead. An expansion cone may be used to expand the tubular against the formation. In some embodiments, the drilling gantry is used to install a heater and\/or other equipment in the wellbore.","When drilling gantry  is finished at well site , the drilling gantry may release gantry  with the empty reel or return the empty reel to the gantry. Gantry  may take the empty reel back to tube manufacturing facility  to be loaded with another coiled tube. Gantries  may move on looped path  from tube manufacturing facility  to well sites  and back to the tube manufacturing facility.","Drilling gantry  may be moved to the next well site. Global positioning satellite information, lasers and\/or other information may be used to position the drilling gantry at desired locations. Additional wellbores may be formed until all of the wellbores for the in situ heat treatment process are formed.","In some embodiments, positioning and\/or tracking system may be utilized to track gantries , drilling gantries , coiled tubing reels and other equipment and materials used to develop the in situ heat treatment location. Tracking systems may include bar code tracking systems to ensure equipment and materials arrive where and when needed.","Directionally drilled wellbores may be formed using steerable motors. Deviations in wellbore trajectory may be made using slide drilling systems or using rotary steerable systems. During use of slide drilling systems, the mud motor rotates the bit downhole with little or no rotation of the drilling string from the surface during trajectory changes. The bottom hole assembly is fitted with a bent sub and\/or a bent housing mud motor for directional drilling. The bent sub and the drill bit are oriented in the desired direction. With little or no rotation of the drilling string, the drill bit is rotated with the mud motor to set the trajectory. When the desired trajectory is obtained, the entire drilling string is rotated and drills straight rather than at an angle. Drill bit direction changes may be made by utilizing torque\/rotary adjusting to control the drill bit in the desired direction.","By controlling the amount of wellbore drilled in the sliding and rotating modes, the wellbore trajectory may be controlled. Torque and drag during sliding and rotating modes may limit the capabilities of slide mode drilling. Steerable motors may produce tortuosity in the slide mode. Tortuosity may make further sliding more difficult. Many methods have been developed, or are being developed, to improve slide drilling systems. Examples of improvements to slide drilling systems include agitators, low weight bits, slippery muds, and torque\/toolface control systems.","Limitations in slide drilling led to the development of rotary steerable systems. Rotary steerable systems allow directional drilling with continuous rotation from the surface, thus making the need to slide the drill string unnecessary. Continuous rotation transfers weight to the drill bit more efficiently, thus increasing the rate of penetration. Current rotary steerable systems may be mechanically and\/or electrically complicated with a high cost of delivery due to service companies requiring a high rate of return and due to relatively high failure rates for the systems.","In some embodiments, a dual motor rotary steerable system is used. The dual motor rotary steerable system allows a bent sub and\/or bent housing mud motor to change the trajectory of the drilling while the drilling string remains in rotary mode. The dual motor rotary steerable system uses a second motor in the bottom hole assembly to rotate a portion of the bottom hole assembly in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation of the drilling string. The addition of the second motor may allow continuous forward rotation of a drilling string while simultaneously controlling the drill bit and, thus, the directional response of the bottom hole assembly. In some embodiments, the rotation speed of the drilling string is used in achieving drill bit control.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0617","num":"0616"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["418","420","418","420","420","422","422","422","422","424","422","418","422","422","422","420","426","422","422"]},"As noted above, motor B may rotate in a direction opposite to the rotation of drilling string . In this manner, portions of bottom hole assembly  beyond motor B may have less rotation in the direction of rotation of drilling string . The revolutions per minute (rpm) versus differential pressure relationship for bottom hole assembly  may be assessed prior to running drilling string  and the bottom hole assembly  in the formation to determine the differential pressure at neutral drilling speed (when the drilling string speed is equal and opposite to the speed of motor B). Measured differential pressure may be used by a control system during drilling to control the speed of the drilling string relative to the neutral drilling speed.","In some embodiments, motor B is operated at a substantially fixed speed. For example, motor B may be operated at a speed of 30 rpm. Other speeds may be used as desired.","In some embodiments, a mud motor is installed in a bottom hole assembly in an inverted orientation (for example, upside-down from the normal orientation). The inverted mud motor may be operated in a reverse direction of rotation relative to other mud motors, a drill bit, and\/or a drilling string. For example, motor B, shown in , may be installed in an inverted orientation to produce a relative counter-clockwise rotation in portions of bottom hole assembly  distal to motor B (see counterclockwise arrow). Installing a mud motor in an inverted orientation may allow for the use of off-the-shelf motors to produce counter-rotation and\/or non-rotation of selected elements of the bottom hole assembly. In one embodiment, a threading kit is used to adapt a threaded mounting for mud motor to ensure that a secure connection between an inverted mud motor and its mounting is maintained during drilling (e.g., by reversing the threads).","In some embodiments, the rotation speed of drilling string  is used to control the trajectory of the wellbore being formed. For example, drilling string  may initially be rotating at 40 rpm, and motor B rotates at 30 rpm. The counter-rotation of motor B and drilling string  results in a forward rotation speed (for example, an absolute forward rotation speed) of 10 rpm in the lower portion of bottom hole assembly  (the portion of the bottom hole assembly below motor B). When a directional course correction is to be made, the speed of drilling string  is changed to the neutral drilling speed. Because drilling string  is rotating, there is no need to lift drill bit  off the bottom of the borehole. Operating at neutral drilling speed may effectively cancel the torque of the drilling string so that drill bit  is subjected to torque induced by motor A and the formation.","The continuous rotation of drilling string  keeps windup of the drilling string consistent and stabilizes drill bit . Directional changes of drill bit  may be made by changing the speed of drilling string . Using a dual motor rotary steerable system allows the changing of the direction of the drilling string to occur while the drilling string rotates at or near the normal operating rotation speed of drilling string .  depicts time at drilling string rotation during direction change versus rotation speed (rpm) of the drilling string for a conventional steerable motor bottom hole assembly during a drill bit direction change.  depicts time at rotation speed during directional change versus change in drilling string rotating speed for the dual motor drilling string during the drill bit direction change. Drill bit control may be substantially the same as for conventional slide mode drilling where torque\/rotary adjustment is used to control the drill bit in the desired direction, but to the effect that 0 rpm on the x-axis of  becomes N (the neutral drilling string speed) in .","The connection of bottom hole assembly  to drilling string  of the dual motor rotary steerable system depicted in  may be subjected to the net effect of all the torque components required to rotate the entire bottom hole assembly (including torque generated at drill bit  during wellbore formation). Threaded connections along drilling string  may include profile-matched sleeves such as those known in the art for utilities drilling systems.","In some embodiments, a control system used to control wellbore formation includes a system that sets a desired rotation speed of drilling string  when direction changes in trajectory of the wellbore are to be implemented. The system may include fine tuning of the desired drilling string rotation speed.","In certain embodiments, drilling string  is integrated with position measurement and down hole tools (for example, sensing array ) to autonomously control the hole path along a designed geometry. An autonomous control system for controlling the path of drilling string  may utilize two or more domains of functionality. In one embodiment, a control system utilizes at least three domains of functionality including, but not limited to, measurement, trajectory, and control. Measurement may be made using sensor systems and\/or other equipment hardware that assess angles, distances, magnetic fields, and\/or other data. Trajectory may include flight path calculation and algorithms that utilize physical measurements to calculate angular and spatial offsets of the drilling string. The control system may implement actions to keep the drilling string in the proper path. The control system may include tools that utilize software\/control interfaces built into an operating system of the drilling equipment, drilling string and\/or bottom hole assembly.","In certain embodiments, the control system utilizes position and angle measurements to define spatial and angular offsets from the desired drilling geometry. The defined offsets may be used to determine a steering solution to move the trajectory of the drilling string (thus, the trajectory of the borehole) back into convergence with the desired drilling geometry. The steering solution may be based on an optimum alignment solution in which a desired rate of curvature of the borehole path is set, and required angle change segments and angle change directions for the path are assessed (for example, by computation).","In some embodiments, the control system uses a fixed angle change rate associated with the drilling string, assesses the lengths of the sections of the drilling string, and assesses the desired directions of the drilling to autonomously execute and control movement of the drilling string. Thus, the control system assesses position measurements and controls of the drilling string to control the direction of the drilling string.","In some embodiments, differential pressure or torque across motor A and\/or motor B is used to control the rate of penetration. A relationship between rate of penetration, weight-on-bit, and torque may be assessed for drilling string . Measurements of torque and the rate of penetration\/weight-on-bit\/torque relationship may be used to control the feed rate of drilling string  into the formation.","Accuracy and efficiency in forming wellbores in subsurface formations may be affected by the density and quality of directional data during drilling. The quality of directional data may be diminished by vibrations and angular accelerations during rotary drilling, especially during rotary drilling segments of wellbore formation using slide mode drilling.","In certain embodiments, the quality of the data assessed during rotary drilling is increased by installing directional sensors in a non-rotating housing.  depicts an embodiment of drilling string  with non-rotating sensor .

In some embodiments, non-rotating sensor  is run on a bottom hole assembly for improved data assessment. In an embodiment, a non-rotating sensor is coupled to and\/or driven by a motor that produces relative counter-rotation of the sensor relative to other components of the bottom hole assembly. For example, a sensor may be coupled to motor having a rotation speed equal and opposite to that of bottom hole assembly housing to which it is attached so that the absolute rotation speed of the sensor is or is substantially zero. In certain embodiments, the motor for a sensor is a mud motor installed in an inverted orientation such as described above relative to .","In certain embodiments, non-rotating sensor  includes one or more transceivers for communicating data either into drilling string  within the bottom hole assembly or to similar transceivers in nearby boreholes.

Using two or more sensors  in wellbore A may also allow the sensors to be used as gradiometers. In some embodiments, sensors  are positioned in advance (ahead of) magnets . Positioning sensors  in advance of magnets  allows the magnets to traverse past the sensors so that the magnet's position (the position of wellbore B) is measurable continuously or \u201clive\u201d during drilling of wellbore B. Sensing array  may be moved intermittently (at selected intervals) to move sensors  ahead of magnets . Positioning sensors  in advance of magnets  also allows the sensors to measure, store, and zero the Earth's field before sensing the magnetic fields of the magnets. The Earth's field may be zeroed by, for example, using a null function before arrival of the magnets, calculating background components from a known sensor attitude, or using paired sensors that function as gradiometers.","The relative position of wellbore B versus wellbore A may be used to adjust the drilling of wellbore B using drilling string . For example, the direction of drilling for wellbore B may be adjusted so that wellbore B remains a set distance away from wellbore A and the wellbores remain substantially parallel. In certain embodiments, the drilling of wellbore B is continuously adjusted based on continuous position assessments made by sensors . Data from drilling string  (for example, orientation, attitude, and\/or gravitational data) may be combined or synchronized with data from sensors  to continuously assess the relative positions of the wellbores and adjust the drilling of wellbore B accordingly.

In some embodiments, the voltage signal is provided by an electrical conductor that is part of a heater or production equipment located in wellbore A. Wire , or other electrical conductors used to provide the voltage signal, may be grounded so that there is no current return along the wire or in the wellbore. Return current may cancel the electromagnetic field produced by the wire.","Where return current exists, the current may be measured and modeled to generate a \u201cnet current\u201d from which a resultant electromagnetic field may be resolved. For example, in some areas, a 600 A signal current may only yield a 3-6 A net current. In some embodiments where it is not feasible to eliminate sufficient return current along the wellbore containing the conductor, two conductors may be installed in separate wellbores. In this method, signal wires from each of the existing wellbores are connected to opposite voltage terminals of the signal generator. The return current path is in this way guided through the earth from the contactor region of one conductor to the other. In certain embodiments, calculations are used to assess (determine) the amount of voltage needed to conduct current through the formation.","In certain embodiments, the reference voltage signal is turned on and off (pulsed) so that multiple measurements are taken by sensor  over a selected time period. The multiple measurements may be averaged to reduce or eliminate resolution error in sensing the reference voltage signal.

A method for resolving the signal field from the general background field on a continuous basis may include: 1.) calculating background components based on the known attitude of the sensors and the known value background field strength and dip; 2.) a synchronized \u201cnull\u201d function to be applied immediately before the reference field is switched \u201con\u201d; 3.) Synchronized sampling of forward and reversed DC polarities (the subtraction of these sampled values may effectively remove the background field yielding the reference total current field); and\/or 4.) Sampling values of background magnetic field at one or more fixed sampling frequencies and storing them for subtraction from the reference signal \u201con\u201d data.","In some embodiments, slight changes in the sensor roll position and\/or movement of the sensor between sampling steps (for example, between samples of signal off and signal on data) is compensated or counteracted by rotating the sensor data coordinate system to a reference attitude (for example, a \u201czero\u201d) after each sample is taken or after a set of data is taken. For example, the sensor data coordinate system may be rotated to a tensor coordinate system. Parameters such as position, inclination, roll, and\/or azimuth of the sensor may be calculated using sensor data rotated to the tensor coordinate system.

Parallel well tracking may utilize magnets of a known strength and a known length positioned in the pre-drilled second wellbore. Magnetic sensors positioned in the active first wellbore may be used to measure the field from the magnets in the second wellbore. Measuring the generated magnetic field in the second wellbore with sensors in the first wellbore may assess distance and direction of the active first wellbore. In some embodiments, magnets positioned in the second wellbore may be carefully positioned and multiple static measurements taken to resolve any general \u201cbackground\u201d magnetic field.

If 10 W is transmitted at a 12 Hz frequency in 20 ohm-m formation , the power received amounts to approximately 9.10 W at 30 m distance. The resistivity was chosen at random and may vary depending on where you are in the ground. If a higher resistivity was chosen at the given frequency, such as 100 ohm-m formation , a lower attenuation is observed, and a low characterization occurs whereupon it receives 9.58 W at 30 m distance. Thus, high resistivity, although transmitting power desirably, shows a negative affect in electromagnetic ranging possibilities. Since the main influence in attenuation is the distance itself, calculations may be made solving for the distance between a source and a point of measurement.","The frequency of the electromagnetic source operates on is another factor that affects attenuation. Typically, the higher the frequency, the higher the attenuation and vice versa. A strategy for choosing between various frequencies may depend on the formation chosen. For example, while the attenuation at a resistivity of 100 ohm-m may be good for data communications, it may not be sufficient for distance calculations. Thus, a higher frequency may be chosen to increase attenuation. Alternatively, a lower frequency may be chosen for the opposite purpose. In some embodiments, a combination of different frequencies is used in sequence to optimize for both low and high frequency functions.","Wireless data communications in ground may allow an opportunity for electromagnetic ranging and the variable frequency it operates on must be observed to balance out benefits for both functionalities. Benefits of wireless data communication may include, but are not be limited to: 1) automatic depth sync through the use of ranging and telemetry; 2) fast communications with a dedicated coil for a transceiving antenna running in the second wellbore that is hardwired (for example, with optic fiber); 3) functioning as an alternative method for fast communication when hardwire in the first wellbore is not available; 4) functioning in under balanced and over balanced drilling; 5) providing a similar method for transmitting control commands to a bottom hole assembly; 6) reusing sensors to reduce costs and waste; 7) decreasing noise measurement functions split between the first wellbore and the second wellbore; and\/or 8) using simultaneous multiple position measurement techniques to provide real time best estimates of position and attitude.","In some embodiments, it may be advisable to employ sensors able to compensate for magnetic fields produced internally by carbon steel casing built in the vertical section of a reference hole (for example, high range magnetometers). In some embodiments, modification may be made to account for problems with wireless antenna communications between wellbores penetrating through wellbore casings.","Pieces of formation or rock may protrude or fall into the wellbore due to various failures including rock breakage or plastic deformation during and\/or after wellbore formation. Protrusions may interfere with drilling string movement and\/or the flow of drilling fluids. Protrusions may prevent running tubulars into the wellbore after the drilling string has been removed from the wellbore. Significant amounts of material entering or protruding into the wellbore may cause wellbore integrity failure and\/or lead to the drilling string becoming stuck in the wellbore. Some causes of wellbore integrity failure may be in situ stresses and high pore pressures. Mud weight may be increased to hold back the formation and inhibit wellbore integrity failure during wellbore formation. When increasing the mud weight is not practical, the wellbore may be reamed.","Reaming the wellbore may be accomplished by moving the drilling string up and down one joint while rotating and circulating. Picking the drilling string up can be difficult because of material protruding into the borehole above the bit or BHA (bottom hole assembly). Picking up the drilling string may be facilitated by placing upward facing cutting structures on the drill bit. Without upward facing cutting structures on the drill bit, the rock protruding into the borehole above the drill bit must be broken by grinding or crushing rather than by cutting. Grinding or crushing may induce additional wellbore failure.","Moving the drilling string up and down may induce surging or pressure pulses that contribute to wellbore failure. Pressure surging or fluctuations may be aggravated or made worse by blockage of normal drilling fluid flow by protrusions into the wellbore. Thus, attempts to clear the borehole of debris may cause even more debris to enter the wellbore.","When the wellbore fails further up the drilling string than one joint from the drill bit, the drilling string must be raised more than one joint. Lifting more than one joint in length may require that joints be removed from the drilling string during lifting and placed back on the drilling string when lowered. Removing and adding joints requires additional time and labor, and increases the risk of surging as circulation is stopped and started for each joint connection.","In some embodiments, cutting structures may be positioned at various points along the drilling string.

The ability to ream while drilling may avoid pressure surges in the wellbore caused by lifting the drilling string. Reaming while drilling allows the wellbore to be reamed without interrupting normal drilling operation. Reaming while drilling allows the wellbore to be formed in less time because a separate reaming operation is avoided.

For example, the cutting element of the cutting structure may include threading and a locking ring that allows for positioning and setting of the cutting element.","In some wellbores, a wash over or over-coring operation may be needed to free or recover an object in the wellbore that is stuck in the wellbore due to caving, closing, or squeezing of the formation around the object. The object may be a canister, tool, drilling string, or other item. A wash-over pipe with downward facing cutting structures at the bottom of the pipe may be used. The wash over pipe may also include upward facing cutting structures and downward facing cutting structures at locations near the end of the wash-over pipe. The additional upward facing cutting structures and downward facing cutting structures may facilitate freeing and\/or recovery of the object stuck in the wellbore. The formation holding the object may be cut away rather than broken by relying on hydraulics and force to break the portion of the formation holding the stuck object.","A problem in some formations is that the formed borehole begins to close soon after the drilling string is removed from the borehole. Boreholes which close up soon after being formed make it difficult to insert objects such as tubulars, canisters, tools, or other equipment into the wellbore. In some embodiments, reaming while drilling applied to the core drilling string allows for emplacement of the objects in the center of the core drill pipe. The core drill pipe includes one or more upward facing cutting structures in addition to cutting structures located at the end of the core drill pipe. The core drill pipe may be used to form the wellbore for the object to be inserted in the formation. The object may be positioned in the core of the core drill pipe. Then, the core drill pipe may be removed from the formation. Any parts of the formation that may inhibit removal of the core drill pipe are cut by the upward facing cutting structures as the core drill pipe is removed from the formation.","Replacement canisters may be positioned in the formation using over core drill pipe. First, the existing canister to be replaced is over cored. The existing canister is then pulled from within the core drill pipe without removing the core drill pipe from the borehole. The replacement canister is then run inside of the core drill pipe. Then, the core drill pipe is removed from the borehole. Upward facing cutting structures positioned along the length of the core drill pipe cut portions of the formation that may inhibit removal of the core drill pipe.","During some in situ heat treatment processes, wellbores may need to be formed in heated formations. Wellbores may also need to be formed in hot portions of geothermally heated or other high temperature formations. Certain formations may be heated by heat sources (for example, heaters) to temperatures above ambient temperatures of the formations. In some embodiments, formations are heated to temperatures significantly above ambient temperatures of the formations. For example, a formation may be heated to a temperature at least about 50\u00b0 C. above ambient temperature, at least about 100\u00b0 C. above ambient temperature, at least about 200\u00b0 C. above ambient temperature, or at least about 500\u00b0 C. above ambient temperature. Wellbores drilled into hot formation may be additional or replacement heater wells, additional or replacement production wells, and\/or monitor wells.","Cooling while drilling may enhance wellbore stability, safety, and longevity of drilling tools. When the drilling fluid is liquid, significant wellbore cooling can occur due to the circulation of the drilling fluid. Downhole cooling does not have to be applied all the way to the bottom of the wellbore to have beneficial effects. Applying cooling to only part of the drilling string and\/or downhole equipment may be a trade off between benefit and the effort involved to apply the cooling to the drilling string and downhole equipment. The target of the cooling may be the formation, the drill bit, and\/or the bottom hole assembly. In some embodiments, cooling of the formation is inhibited to promote wellbore stability. Cooling of the formation may be inhibited by using insulation to inhibit heat transfer from the formation to the drilling string, bottom hole assembly, and\/or the drill bit. In some embodiments, insulation is used to inhibit heat transfer and\/or phase changes of drilling fluid and\/or cooling fluid in portions of the drilling string, bottom hole assembly, and\/or the drill bit.","In some in situ heat treatment process embodiments, a barrier formed around all or a portion of the in situ heat treatment process is formed by freeze wells that form a low temperature zone around the freeze wells. A portion of the cooling capacity of the freeze well equipment may be utilized to cool the equipment needed to drill into the hot formation. A closed loop circulation system may be used to cool drilling bits and\/or other downhole equipment. Drilling bits may be advanced slowly in hot sections to ensure that the formed wellbore cools sufficiently to preclude drilling problems and\/or to enhance borehole stability.","When using conventional circulation, drilling fluid flows down the inside of the drilling string and back up the outside of the drilling string. Other circulation systems, such as reverse circulation, may also be used. In some embodiments, the drill pipe may be positioned in a pipe-in-pipe configuration, or a pipe-in-pipe-in-pipe configuration (for example, when a closed loop circulation system is used to cool downhole equipment).","The drilling string used to form the wellbore may function as a counter-flow heat exchanger. The deeper the well, the more the drilling fluid heats up on the way down to the drill bit as the drilling string passes through heated portions of the formation. When normal circulation does not deliver low enough temperatures drilling fluid to the drill bit to provide adequate cooling, two options may be employed to enhance cooling: mud coolers on the surface can be used to reduce the inlet temperature of the drilling fluid being pumped downhole; and, if cooling is still inadequate, an at least partially insulated drilling string can be used to reduce the counter-flow heat exchanger effect.","For various reasons including, but not limited to, lost circulation, wells are frequently drilled with gas (for example, air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, and other light hydrocarbon gases) or gas\/liquid mixtures. Gas\/liquid mixtures are used as the drilling fluid primarily to maintain a low equivalent circulating density (low downhole pressure gradient). Gas has low potential for cooling the wellbore because mass flow rates of gas drilling are much lower than when liquid drilling fluid is used. Also, gas has a low heat capacity compared to liquid. As a result of heat flow from the outside to the inside of the drilling string, the gas arrives at the drill bit at close to formation temperature. Controlling the inlet temperature of the gas (analogous to using mud coolers when drilling with liquid) or using insulated drilling string may marginally reduce the counter-flow heat exchanger effect when gas drilling. Some gases are more effective than others at transferring heat, but the use of gasses with better heat transfer properties may not significantly improve wellbore cooling while gas drilling.","Gas drilling may deliver the drilling fluid to the drill bit at close to the formation temperature. The gas may have little capacity to absorb heat. A feature of gas drilling is the low density column in the annulus. The benefits of gas drilling can be accomplished if the drilling fluid or a cooling fluid is liquid while flowing down the drilling string and gas while flowing back up the annulus. The heat of vaporization may be used to cool the drill bit and the formation rather than using the sensible heat of the drilling fluid to cool.","An advantage of this approach may be that even though the liquid arrives at the bit at close to formation temperature, the liquid can absorb heat by vaporizing. The heat of vaporization is typically larger than the heat that can be absorbed by a temperature rise. As a comparison, a 7\u215e\u2033 wellbore is drilled with a 3\u00bd\u2033 drilling string circulating low density mud at about 203 gpm with about a 100 ft\/min typical annular velocity. Drilling through a 450\u00b0 F. zone at 1000 feet will result in a mud exit temperature about 8\u00b0 F. hotter than the inlet temperature. This results in the removal of about 14,000 Btu\/min. The removal of this heat lowers the bit temperature from about 450\u00b0 F. to about 285\u00b0 F. If liquid water is injected down the drilling string and allowed to boil at the bit and steam is produced up the annulus, the mass flow required to remove \u00bd\u2033 cuttings is about 34 lb\/min assuming the back pressure is about 100 psia. At 34 lb\/min, the heat removed from the wellbore would be about 34 lb\/min\u00d7(1187-180) Btu\/lb, or about 34,000 Btu\/min. This heat removal amount is about 2.4 times the liquid cooling case. Thus, at reasonable annular steam flow rates, a significant amount of heat may be removed by vaporization.","The high velocities required for gas drilling may be achieved by the expansion that occurs during vaporization rather than by employing compressors on the surface. Eliminating or minimizing the need for compressors may simplify the drilling process, eliminate or lower compression costs, and eliminate or reduce a source of heat applied to the drilling fluid on the way to the drill bit.","In some embodiments, it is helpful to inhibit vaporization within the drilling string. If the drilling fluid flowing downwards vaporizes before reaching the drill bit, the heat of vaporization tends to extract heat from the drilling fluid flowing up the annulus. The heat transferred from the annulus (outside the drilling string) to inside the drilling string is heat that is not rejected from the well when drilling fluid reaches the surface. Vaporization that occurs inside of the drilling string before the drilling fluid reaches the bottom of the hole is less beneficial to drill bit and\/or wellbore cooling.  depicts drilling fluid flow in drilling string  in wellbore  with no control of vaporization of the fluid. Liquid drilling fluid flows down drilling string  as indicated by arrow . Liquid changes to vapor at interface . Vapor flows down drilling string  below interface  as indicated by arrow . In certain embodiments, interface  is a region instead of an abrupt change from liquid to vapor. Vapor and cuttings may flow up the annular region between drilling string  and formation  in the directions indicated by arrows . Heat transfers from formation  to the vapor moving up drilling string  and to the drilling string. Heat from drilling string  transfers to liquid and vapor flowing down the drilling string.","If the pressure in the drilling string is maintained above the boiling pressure for a given temperature by use of a back pressure device, then the transfer of heat from outside the drilling string to fluid on the inside of the drilling string can be limited so that the fluid on the inside of the drilling string does not change phases. Fluid downstream of the back pressure device may be allowed to change phase. The fluid downstream the back pressure device may be partially or totally vaporized. Vaporization may result in the drilling fluid absorbing the heat of vaporization from the drill bit and formation. For example, if the back pressure device is set to allow flow only when the back pressure is above a selected pressure (for example, 250 psi for water or another pressure depending on the fluid), the fluid within the drilling string may not vaporize unless the temperature is above a selected temperature (for example, 400\u00b0 F. for water or another temperature depending on the fluid). If the temperature of the formation is above the selected temperature (for example, the temperature is about 500\u00b0 F.), steps may be taken to inhibit vaporization of the fluid on the way down to the drill bit. In an embodiment, the back pressure device is set to maintain a back pressure that inhibits vaporization of the drilling fluid at the temperature of the formation (for example, 580 psi to inhibit vaporization up to a temperature of 500\u00b0 F. for water). In another embodiment, the drilling pipe is insulated and\/or the drilling fluid is cooled so that the back pressure device is able to maintain any drilling fluid that reaches the drill bit as a liquid.","Examples of two back pressure devices that may be used to maintain elevated pressure within the drilling string are a choke and a pressure activated valve. Other types of back pressure devices may also be used. Chokes have a restriction in the flow area that creates back pressure by resisting flow. Resisting the flow results in increased upstream pressure to force the fluid through the restriction. Pressure activated valves may not open until a minimum upstream pressure is obtained. The pressure difference across a pressure activated valve may determine if the pressure activated valve is open to allow flow or the valve is closed.","In some embodiments, both a choke and a pressure activated valve may be used. A choke can be the bit nozzles allowing the liquid to be jetted toward the drill bit and the bottom of the hole. The bit nozzles may enhance drill bit cleaning and help inhibit fouling of the drill bit and pressure activated valve. Fouling may occur if boiling in the drill bit or pressure activated valve causes solids to precipitate. The pressure activated valve may inhibit premature vaporization at low flow rates such as flow rates below which the chokes are effective.","In some embodiments, additives are added to the cooling fluid or the drilling fluid. The additives may modify the properties of the fluids in the liquid phase and\/or the gas phase. Additives may include, but are not limited to, surfactants to foam the fluid, additives to chemically alter the interaction of the fluid with the formations (for example, to stabilize the formation), additives to control corrosion, and additives for other benefits.","In some embodiments, a non-condensable gas is added to the cooling fluid or the drilling fluid pumped down the drilling string. The non-condensable gas may be, but is not limited to, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, air, and mixtures thereof. Adding the non-condensable gas results in pumping a two phase mixture down the drilling string. One reason for adding the non-condensable gas may be to enhance the flow of the fluid out of the formation. The presence of the non-condensable gas may inhibit condensation of the vaporized cooling or drilling fluid and\/or help to carry cuttings out of the formation. In some embodiments, one or more heaters are present at one or more locations in the wellbore to provide heat that inhibits condensation and reflux of cooling or drilling fluid leaving the formation.","In certain embodiments, managed pressure drilling and\/or managed volumetric drilling is used during the formation of wellbores. The back pressure on the wellbore may be held to a prescribed value to control the downhole pressure. Similarly, the volume of fluid entering and exiting the wellbore may be balanced such that there is no or minimally controlled net influx or out-flux of drilling fluid into the formation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0709","num":"0708"},"figref":"FIG. 32","b":["428","524","420","1704","420","1712","1712","1712","1712","420","420","1712","1712","1712","420"]},"The desired pressure may be a pressure sufficient to maintain cooling or drilling fluid as a liquid phase to cool drill bit  when the liquid phase of the cooling or drilling fluid is vaporized.

Use of an auto-positioning control and\/or measurement system in combination with a rack and pinion drilling system may allow wellbores to be drilled more accurately than drilling using manual positioning and calibration. For example, the auto-positioning system may be continuously and\/or semi-continuously calibrated during drilling.  depicts a schematic of a portion of a system including a rack and pinion drive system. Rack and pinion drive system  includes, but is not limited to, rack , carriage , chuck drive system , and circulating sleeve . Chuck drive system  may hold tubular . Push\/pull capacity of a rack and pinion type system may allow enough force (for example, about 5 tons) to push tubulars into wellbores so that rotation of the tubulars is not necessary. A rack and pinion system may apply downward force on the drill bit. The force applied to the drill bit may be independent of the weight of the drilling string and\/or collars. In certain embodiments, collar size and weight is reduced because the weight of the collars is not needed to enable drilling operations. Drilling wellbores with long horizontal portions may be performed using rack and pinion drilling systems because of the ability of the drilling systems to apply force to the drilling bit.","Rack and pinion drive system  may be coupled to auto-positioning control system . Auto-positioning control system  may include, but is not limited to, rotary steerable systems, dual motor rotary steerable systems, and\/or hole measurement systems. In some embodiments, heaters are included in tubular . In some embodiments, auto-positioning measurement tools are positioned in the heaters. In some embodiments, a measurement system includes magnetic ranging and\/or a non-rotating sensor.","In some embodiments, a hole measuring system includes canted accelerometers. Use of canted accelerometers may allow for surveying of a shallow portion of the formation. For example, shallow portions of the formation may have steel casing strings from drilling operations and\/or other wells. The steel casings may affect the use of magnetic survey tools in determining the direction of deflection incurred during drilling. Canted accelerometers may be positioned in a bottom hole assembly with the surface as reference of string rotational position. Positioning the canted accelerometers in a bottom hole assembly may allow accurate measurement of inclination and direction of a hole regardless of the influence of nearby magnetic interference sources (for example, casing strings). In some embodiments, the relative rotational position of the tubular is monitored by measuring and tracking incremental rotation of the shaft. By monitoring the relative rotation of tubulars added to existing tubulars, more accurate positioning of tubulars may be achieved. Such monitoring may allow tubulars to be added in a continuous manner. In some embodiments, a method of drilling using a rack and pinion system includes continuous downhole measurement. A measurement system may be operated using a predetermined and constant current signal. Distance and direction are calculated continuously downhole. The results of the calculations are filtered and averaged. A best estimate final distance and direction is reported to the surface. When received on surface, the known along hole depth and source location may be combined with the calculated distance and direction to calculate X, Y & Z position data.","During drilling with jointed pipes, the time taken to shut down circulation, add the next pipe, re-establish circulation, and hole making may require a substantial amount of time, particularly when using two-phase circulation. Handling tubulars (for example, pipes) has historically been a key safety risk area where manual handling techniques have been used. Coiled tubing drilling has had some success in eliminating the need for making connections and manual tubular handling, however, the inability to rotate and the limitations on practical coil diameters may limit the extent to which it can be used.","In some embodiments, a drilling sequence is used in which tubulars are added to a string without interrupting the drilling process. Such a sequence may allow continuous rotary drilling with large diameter tubulars. A continuous rotary drilling system may include a drilling platform, which includes, but is not limited to, one or more platforms, a top drive system, and a bottom drive system. The platform may include a rack to allow multiple independent traversing of components. The top drive system may include an extended drive sub (for example, an extended drive system manufactured by American Augers, West Salem, Ohio, U.S.A.).

The wellbores may be formed at penetration rates that are many times faster than the penetration rates using conventional drilling with drilling bits. The high penetration rate allows separate equipment to accomplish drilling and casing operations in a more efficient manner than using a one-rig approach. The high penetration rate requires accurate, near real time directional drilling control in three dimensions.","In some embodiments, high penetration rates may be attained using composite coiled tubing in combination with particle jet drilling. Particle jet drilling forms an opening in a formation by impacting the formation with high velocity fluid containing particles to remove material from the formation. The particles may function as abrasives. In addition to composite coiled tubing and particle jet drilling, a downhole electric orienter, bubble entrained mud, downhole inertial navigation, and a computer control system may be needed. Other types of drilling fluid and drilling fluid systems may be used instead of using bubble entrained mud. Such drilling fluid systems may include, but are not limited to, straight liquid circulation systems, multiphase circulation systems using liquid and gas, and\/or foam circulation systems.","Composite coiled tubing has a fatigue life that is significantly greater than the fatigue life of steel coiled tubing. Composite coiled tubing is available from Airborne Composites BV (The Hague, The Netherlands). Composite coiled tubing can be used to form many boreholes in a formation. The composite coiled tubing may include integral power lines for providing electricity to downhole tools. The composite coiled tubing may include integral data lines for providing real time information regarding downhole conditions to the computer control system and for sending real time control information from the computer control system to the downhole equipment. The primary computer control system may be downhole or may be at surface.","The coiled tubing may include an abrasion resistant outer sheath. The outer sheath may inhibit damage to the coiled tubing due to sliding experienced by the coiled tubing during deployment and retrieval. In some embodiments, the coiled tubing may be rotated during use in lieu of or in addition to having an abrasion resistant outer sheath to minimize uneven wear of the composite coiled tubing.","Particle jet drilling may advantageously allow for stepped changes in the drilling rate. Drill bits are no longer needed and downhole motors are eliminated. Particle jet drilling may decouple cutting formation to form the borehole from the bottom hole assembly (BHA). Decoupling cutting formation to form the borehole from the BHA reduces the impact that variable formation properties (for example, formation dip, vugs, fractures and transition zones) have on wellbore trajectory. The decoupling lowers the required torque and thrust that would normally be required if conventional drilling bits were used to form a borehole in the formation. By decoupling cutting formation to form the borehole from the BHA, directional drilling may be reduced to orienting one or more particle jet nozzles in appropriate directions. The orientation of the BHA becomes easier with the reduced torque on the assembly from the hole making process. Additionally, particle jet drilling may be used to under ream one or more portions of a wellbore to form a larger diameter opening.","Particles may be introduced into a pressurized injection stream during particle jet drilling. The ability to achieve and circulate high particle laden fluid under pressure may facilitate the successful use of particle jet drilling. Traditional oilfield drilling and\/or servicing pumps are not designed to handle the abrasive nature of the particles used for particle jet drilling for extended periods of time. Wear on the pump components may be high resulting in impractical maintenance and repairs. One type of pump that may be used for particle jet drilling is a heavy duty piston membrane pump. Heavy duty piston membrane pumps may be available from ABEL GmbH & Co. KG (Buchen, Germany). Piston membrane pumps have been used for long term, continuous pumping of slurries containing high total solids in the mining and power industries. Piston membrane pumps are similar to triplex pumps used for drilling operations in the oil and gas industry except heavy duty preformed membranes separate the slurry from the hydraulic side of the pump. In this fashion, the solids laden fluid is brought up to pressure in the injection line in one step and circulated downhole without damaging the internal mechanisms of the pump.","Another type of pump that may be used for particle jet drilling is an annular pressure exchange pump. Annular pressure exchange pumps may be available from Macmahon Mining Services Pty Ltd (Lonsdale, Australia). Annular pressure exchange pumps have been used for long term, continuous pumping of slurries containing high total solids in the mining industry. Annular pressure exchange pumps use hydraulic oil to compress a hose inside a high-strength pressure chamber in a peristaltic like way to displace the contents of the hose. Annular pressure exchange pumps may obtain continuous flow by having twin chambers. One chamber fills while the other chamber is purged.","The BHA may include a downhole electric orienter. The downhole electric orienter may allow for directional drilling by directing one or more jets or particle jet drilling nozzles in an appropriate fashion to facilitate forward hole making progress in the desired direction. The downhole electric orienter may be coupled to a computer control system through one or more integral data lines of the composite coiled tubing. Power for the downhole electric orienter may be supplied through an integral power line of the composite coiled tubing or through a battery system in the BHA.","Bubble entrained mud may be used as the drilling fluid. Bubble entrained mud may allow for particle jet drilling without raising the equivalent circulating density to unacceptable levels. A form of managed pressure drilling may be affected by varying the density of bubble entrainment. In some embodiments, particles in the drilling fluid may be separated from the drilling fluid using magnetic recovery when the particles include iron or alloys that may be influenced by magnetic fields. Bubble entrained mud may be used because using air or other gas as the drilling fluid may result in excessive wear of components from high velocity particles in the return stream. The density of the bubble entrained mud going downhole as a function of real time gains and losses of fluid may be automated using the computer control system.","In some embodiments, multiphase systems are used. For example, if gas injection rates are low enough that wear rates are acceptable, a gas-liquid circulating system may be used. Bottom hole circulating pressures may be adjusted by the computer control system. The computer control system may adjust the gas and\/or liquid injection rates.","In some embodiments, pipe-in-pipe drilling is used. Pipe-in-pipe drilling may include circulating fluid through the space between the outer pipe and the inner pipe instead of between the wellbore and the drill string. Pipe-in-pipe drilling may be used if contact of the drilling fluid with one or more fresh water aquifers is not acceptable. Pipe-in-pipe drilling may be used if the density of the drilling fluid cannot be adjusted low enough to effectively reduce potential lost circulation issues.","Downhole inertial navigation may be part of the BHA. The use of downhole inertial navigation allows for determination of the position (including depth, azimuth and inclination) without magnetic sensors. Magnetic interference from casings and\/or emissions from the high density of wells in the formation may interfere with a system that determines the position of the BHA based on magnet sensors.","The computer control system may receive information from the BHA. The computer control system may process the information to determine the position of the BHA.

Additional wellbore may be formed by directing particle jets through the jet head while extending ram .","In some embodiments, robots are used to perform a task in a wellbore formed or being formed using composite coiled tubing. The task may be, but is not limited to, providing traction to move the coiled tubing, surveying, removing cuttings, logging, and\/or freeing pipe. For example, a robot may be used when drilling a horizontal opening if enough weight cannot be applied to the BHA to advance the coiled tubing and BHA in the formed borehole. The robot may be sent down the borehole. The robot may clamp to the composite coiled tubing or BHA. Portions of the robot may extend to engage the formation. Traction between the robot and the formation may be used to advance the robot forward so that the composite coiled tubing and the BHA advance forward. The displacement data from the forward advancement of the BHA using the robot may be supplied directly to the inertial navigation system to improve accuracy of the opening being formed.","The robots may be battery powered. To use the robot, drilling could be stopped, and the robot could be connected to the outside of the composite coiled tubing. The robot would run along the outside of the composite coiled tubing to the bottom of the hole. If needed, the robot could electrically couple to the BHA. The robot could couple to a contact plate on the BHA. The BHA may include a step-down transformer that brings the high voltage, low current electricity supplied to the BHA to a lower voltage and higher current (for example, one third the voltage and three times the amperage supplied to the BHA). The lower voltage, higher current electricity supplied from the step-down transformer may be used to recharge the batteries of the robot. In some embodiments, the robot may function while coupled to the BHA. The batteries may supply sufficient energy for the robot to travel to the drill bit and back to the surface.","A robot may be run integral to the BHA on the end of the composite coiled tubing. Portions of the robot may extend to engage the formation. Traction between the robot and the formation may be used to advance the robot forward so that the composite coiled tubing and the BHA advance forward.

Heat sources in the treatment area may heat hydrocarbons in the formation within the treatment area. The perimeter barrier may be, but is not limited to, a low temperature or frozen barrier formed by freeze wells, a wax barrier formed in the formation, dewatering wells, a grout wall formed in the formation, a sulfur cement barrier, a barrier formed by a gel produced in the formation, a barrier formed by precipitation of salts in the formation, a barrier formed by a polymerization reaction in the formation, and\/or sheets driven into the formation. Heat sources, production wells, injection wells, dewatering wells, and\/or monitoring wells may be installed in the treatment area defined by the barrier prior to, simultaneously with, or after installation of the barrier.","A low temperature zone around at least a portion of a treatment area may be formed by freeze wells. In an embodiment, refrigerant is circulated through freeze wells to form low temperature zones around each freeze well. The freeze wells are placed in the formation so that the low temperature zones overlap and form a low temperature zone around the treatment area. The low temperature zone established by freeze wells is maintained below the freezing temperature of aqueous fluid in the formation. Aqueous fluid entering the low temperature zone freezes and forms the frozen barrier. In other embodiments, the freeze barrier is formed by batch operated freeze wells. A cold fluid, such as liquid nitrogen, is introduced into the freeze wells to form low temperature zones around the freeze wells. The fluid is replenished as needed.","In some embodiments, two or more rows of freeze wells are located about all or a portion of the perimeter of the treatment area to form a thick interconnected low temperature zone. Thick low temperature zones may be formed adjacent to areas in the formation where there is a high flow rate of aqueous fluid in the formation. The thick barrier may ensure that breakthrough of the frozen barrier established by the freeze wells does not occur.","In some embodiments, a double barrier system is used to isolate a treatment area. The double barrier system may be formed with a first barrier and a second barrier. The first barrier may be formed around at least a portion of the treatment area to inhibit fluid from entering or exiting the treatment area. The second barrier may be formed around at least a portion of the first barrier to isolate an inter-barrier zone between the first barrier and the second barrier. The inter-barrier zone may have a thickness from about 1 m to about 300 m. In some embodiments, the thickness of the inter-barrier zone is from about 10 m to about 100 m, or from about 20 m to about 50 m.","The double barrier system may allow greater project depths than a single barrier system. Greater depths are possible with the double barrier system because the stepped differential pressures across the first barrier and the second barrier is less than the differential pressure across a single barrier. The smaller differential pressures across the first barrier and the second barrier make a breach of the double barrier system less likely to occur at depth for the double barrier system as compared to the single barrier system. In some embodiments, additional barriers may be positioned to connect the inner barrier to the outer barrier. The additional barriers may further strengthen the double barrier system and define compartments that limit the amount of fluid that can pass from the inter-barrier zone to the treatment area should a breach occur in the first barrier.","The first barrier and the second barrier may be the same type of barrier or different types of barriers. In some embodiments, the first barrier and the second barrier are formed by freeze wells. In some embodiments, the first barrier is formed by freeze wells, and the second barrier is a grout wall. The grout wall may be formed of cement, sulfur, sulfur cement, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, a portion of the first barrier and\/or a portion of the second barrier is a natural barrier, such as an impermeable rock formation.","In some embodiments, one or both barriers may be formed from wellbores positioned in the formation. The position of the wellbores used to form the second barrier may be adjusted relative to the wellbores used to form the first barrier to limit a separation distance between a breach or portion of the barrier that is difficult to form and the nearest wellbore. For example, if freeze wells are used to form both barriers of a double barrier system, the position of the freeze wells may be adjusted to facilitate formation of the barriers and limit the distance between a potential breach and the closest wells to the breach. Adjusting the position of the wells of the second barrier relative to the wells of the first barrier may also be used when one or more of the barriers are barriers other than freeze barriers (for example, dewatering wells, cement barriers, grout barriers, and\/or wax barriers).","In some embodiments, wellbores for forming the first barrier are formed in a row in the formation. During formation of the wellbores, logging techniques and\/or analysis of cores may be used to determine the principal fracture direction and\/or the direction of water flow in one or more layers of the formation. In some embodiments, two or more layers of the formation may have different principal fracture directions and\/or the directions of water flow that need to be addressed. In such formations, three or more barriers may need to be formed in the formation to allow for formation of the barriers that inhibit inflow of formation fluid into the treatment area or outflow of formation fluid from the treatment area. Barriers may be formed to isolate particular layers in the formation.","The principal fracture direction and\/or the direction of water flow may be used to determine the placement of wells used to form the second barrier relative to the wells used to form the first barrier. The placement of the wells may facilitate formation of the first barrier and the second barrier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0757","num":"0756"},"figref":"FIG. 48","b":["200","200","1802","200","200","200","200"],"br":{},"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["od=S\/","\u2212d","A"]},"Using the od according to EQN. 1 maintains a maximum separation distance of s\/4 between a barrier well and a regular fracture extending between the barriers.

Having a maximum separation distance of s\/4 by adjusting the offset distance of wells of the second barrier relative to the wells of the first barrier based on the principal fracture direction and\/or the direction of water flow may reduce the time needed to reform the first barrier and\/or the second barrier should a breach of the first barrier and\/or the second barrier occur.","In some embodiments, od may be set at a value between the value generated by EQN. 1 and the worst case value. The worst case value of od may be if barrier wells  of the first freeze barrier and barrier wells \u2032 of the second barrier are located along the principal fracture direction and\/or direction of water flow (i.e., along arrow ).

For example, a 260 m initial length of polyethylene conduit subjected to a temperature of about \u221225\u00b0 C. may contract by 6 m or more. If a high density polyethylene conduit, or other polymer conduit, is used, the large thermal contraction of the material must be taken into account in determining the final depth of the freeze well.

The material may fill cavities (vugs) in the formation and reduces the permeability of the formation. The material may have higher thermal conductivity than gas and\/or formation fluid that fills cavities in the formation. Placing material in the cavities may allow for faster low temperature zone formation. The material may form a perpetual barrier in the formation that may strengthen the formation. The use of material to form the barrier in unconsolidated or substantially unconsolidated formation material may allow for larger well spacing than is possible without the use of the material. The combination of the material and the low temperature zone formed by freeze wells may constitute a double barrier for environmental regulation purposes. In some embodiments, the material is introduced into the formation as a liquid, and the liquid sets in the formation to form a solid. The material may be, but is not limited to, fine cement, micro fine cement, sulfur, sulfur cement, viscous thermoplastics, and\/or waxes. The material may include surfactants, stabilizers or other chemicals that modify the properties of the material. For example, the presence of surfactant in the material may promote entry of the material into small openings in the formation.","Material may be introduced into the formation through freeze well wellbores. The material may be allowed to set. The integrity of the wall formed by the material may be checked. The integrity of the material wall may be checked by logging techniques and\/or by hydrostatic testing. If the permeability of a section formed by the material is too high, additional material may be introduced into the formation through freeze well wellbores. After the permeability of the section is sufficiently reduced, freeze wells may be installed in the freeze well wellbores.","Material may be injected into the formation at a pressure that is high, but below the fracture pressure of the formation. In some embodiments, injection of material is performed in 16 m increments in the freeze wellbore. Larger or smaller increments may be used if desired. In some embodiments, material is only applied to certain portions of the formation. For example, material may be applied to the formation through the freeze wellbore only adjacent to aquifer zones and\/or to relatively high permeability zones (for example, zones with a permeability greater than about 0.1 darcy). Applying material to aquifers may inhibit migration of water from one aquifer to a different aquifer. For material placed in the formation through freeze well wellbores, the material may inhibit water migration between aquifers during formation of the low temperature zone. The material may also inhibit water migration between aquifers when an established low temperature zone is allowed to thaw.","In some embodiments, the material used to form a barrier may be fine cement and micro fine cement. Cement may provide structural support in the formation. Fine cement may be ASTM type 3 Portland cement. Fine cement may be less expensive than micro fine cement. In an embodiment, a freeze wellbore is formed in the formation. Selected portions of the freeze wellbore are grouted using fine cement. Then, micro fine cement is injected into the formation through the freeze wellbore. The fine cement may reduce the permeability down to about 10 millidarcy. The micro fine cement may further reduce the permeability to about 0.1 millidarcy. After the grout is introduced into the formation, a freeze wellbore canister may be inserted into the formation. The process may be repeated for each freeze well that will be used to form the barrier.","In some embodiments, fine cement is introduced into every other freeze wellbore. Micro fine cement is introduced into the remaining wellbores. For example, grout may be used in a formation with freeze wellbores set at about 5 m spacing. A first wellbore is drilled and fine cement is introduced into the formation through the wellbore. A freeze well canister is positioned in the first wellbore. A second wellbore is drilled 10 m away from the first wellbore. Fine cement is introduced into the formation through the second wellbore. A freeze well canister is positioned in the second wellbore. A third wellbore is drilled between the first wellbore and the second wellbore. In some embodiments, grout from the first and\/or second wellbores may be detected in the cuttings of the third wellbore. Micro fine cement is introduced into the formation through the third wellbore. A freeze wellbore canister is positioned in the third wellbore. The same procedure is used to form the remaining freeze wells that will form the barrier around the treatment area.","In some embodiments, material including wax is used to form a barrier in a formation. Wax barriers may be formed in wet, dry, or oil wetted formations. Wax barriers may be formed above, at the bottom of, and\/or below the water table. Material including liquid wax introduced into the formation may permeate into adjacent rock and fractures in the formation. The material may permeate into rock to fill microscopic as well as macroscopic pores and vugs in the rock. The wax solidifies to form a barrier that inhibits fluid flow into or out of a treatment area. A wax barrier may provide a minimal amount of structural support in the formation. Molten wax may reduce the strength of poorly consolidated soil by reducing inter-grain friction so that the poorly consolidated soil sloughs or liquefies. Poorly consolidated layers may be consolidated by use of cement or other binding agents before introduction of molten wax.","In some embodiments, the formation where a wax barrier is to be established is dewatered before and\/or during formation of the wax barrier. In some embodiments, the portion of the formation where the wax barrier is to form is dewatered or diluted to remove or reduce saline water that could adversely affect the properties of the material introduced into the formation to form the wax barrier.","In some embodiments, water is introduced into the formation during formation of the wax barrier. Water may be introduced into the formation when the barrier is to be formed below the water table or in a dry portion of the formation. The water may be used to heat the formation to a desired temperature before introducing the material that forms the wax barrier. The water may be introduced at an elevated temperature and\/or the water may be heated in the formation from one or more heaters.","The wax of the barrier may be a branched paraffin to inhibit biological degradation of the wax. The wax may include stabilizers, surfactants or other chemicals that modify the physical and\/or chemical properties of the wax. The physical properties may be tailored to meet specific needs. The wax may melt at a relative low temperature (for example, the wax may have a typical melting point of about 52\u00b0 C.). The temperature at which the wax congeals may be at least 5\u00b0 C., 10\u00b0 C., 20\u00b0 C., or 30\u00b0 C. above the ambient temperature of the formation prior to any heating of the formation. When molten, the wax may have a relatively low viscosity (for example, 4 to 10 cp at about 99\u00b0 C.). The flash point of the wax may be relatively high (for example, the flash point may be over 204\u00b0 C.). The wax may have a density less than the density of water and may have a heat capacity that is less than half the heat capacity of water. The solid wax may have a low thermal conductivity (for example, about 0.18 W\/m \u00b0 C.) so that the solid wax is a thermal insulator. Waxes suitable for forming a barrier are available as WAXFIX\u2122 from Carter Technologies Company (Sugar Land, Tex., U.S.A.). WAXFIX\u2122 is very resistant to microbial attack. WAXFIX\u2122 may have a half life of greater than 5000 years.","In some embodiments, a wax barrier or wax barriers may be used as the barriers for the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments, a wax barrier may be used in conjunction with freeze wells that form a low temperature barrier around the treatment area. In some embodiments, the wax barrier is formed and freeze wells are installed in the wellbores used for introducing wax into the formation. In some embodiments, the wax barrier is formed in wellbores offset from the freeze well wellbores. The wax barrier may be on the outside or the inside of the freeze wells. In some embodiments, a wax barrier may be formed on both the inside and outside of the freeze wells. The wax barrier may inhibit water flow in the formation that would inhibit the formation of the low temperature zone by the freeze wells. In some embodiments, a wax barrier is formed in the inter-barrier zone between two freeze barriers of a double barrier system.","Material used to form the wax barrier may be introduced into the formation through wellbores. The wellbores may include vertical wellbores, slanted wellbores, and\/or horizontal wellbores (for example, wellbores with sections that are horizontally or near horizontally oriented). The use of vertical wellbores, slanted wellbores, and\/or horizontal wellbores for forming the wax barrier allows the formation of a barrier that seals both horizontal and vertical fractures.","Wellbores may be formed in the formation around the treatment area at a close spacing. In some embodiments, the spacing is from about 1.5 m to about 4 m. Larger or smaller spacings may be used. Low temperature heaters may be inserted in the wellbores. The heaters may operate at temperatures from about 260\u00b0 C. to about 320\u00b0 C. so that the temperature at the formation face is below the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. The heaters may be activated to heat the formation until the overlap between two adjacent heaters raises the temperature of the zone between the two heaters above the melting temperature of the wax. Heating the formation to obtain superposition of heat with a temperature above the melting temperature of the wax may take one month, two months, or longer. After heating, the heaters may be turned off. In some embodiments, the heaters are downhole antennas that operate at about 10 MHz to heat the formation.","After heating, the material used to form the wax barrier may be introduced into the wellbores to form the barrier. The material may flow into the formation and fill any fractures and porosity that has been heated. The wax in the material congeals when the wax flows to cold regions beyond the heated circumference. This wax barrier formation method may form a more complete barrier than some other methods of wax barrier formation, but the time for heating may be longer than for some of the other methods. Also, if a low temperature barrier is to be formed with the freeze wells placed in the wellbores used for injection of the material used to form the barrier, the freeze wells will have to remove the heat supplied to the formation to allow for introduction of the material used to form the barrier. The low temperature barrier may take longer to form.","In some embodiments, the wax barrier may be formed using a conduit placed in the wellbore.  depicts an embodiment of a system for forming a wax barrier in a formation. Wellbore  may extend into one or more layers  below overburden . Wellbore  may be an open wellbore below overburden . One or more of the layers  may include fracture systems . One or more of the layers may be vuggy so that the layer or a portion of the layer has a high porosity. Conduit  may be positioned in wellbore . In some embodiments, low temperature heater  may be strapped or attached to conduit . In some embodiments, conduit  may be a heater element. Heater  may be operated so that the heater does not cause pyrolysis of hydrocarbons adjacent to the heater. At least a portion of wellbore  may be filled with fluid. The fluid may be formation fluid or water. Heater  may be activated to heat the fluid. A portion of the heated fluid may move outwards from heater  into the formation. The heated fluid may be injected into the fractures and permeable vuggy zones. The heated fluid may be injected into the fractures and permeable vuggy zones by introducing heated barrier material into wellbore  in the annular space between conduit  and the wellbore. The introduced material flows to the areas heated by the fluid and congeals when the fluid reaches cold regions not heated by the fluid. The material fills fracture systems  and permeable vuggy pathways heated by the fluid, but the material may not permeate through a significant portion of the rock matrix as when the hot material is introduced into a heated formation as described above. The material flows into fracture systems  a sufficient distance to join with material injected from an adjacent well so that a barrier to fluid flow through the fracture systems forms when the wax congeals. A portion of material may congeal along the wall of a fracture or a vug without completely blocking the fracture or filling the vug. The congealed material may act as an insulator and allow additional liquid wax to flow beyond the congealed portion to penetrate deeply into the formation and form blockages to fluid flow when the material cools below the melting temperature of the wax in the material.","Material in the annular space of wellbore  between conduit  and the formation may be removed through conduit by displacing the material with water or other fluid. Conduit  may be removed and a freeze well may be installed in the wellbore. This method may use less material than the method described above. The heating of the fluid may be accomplished in less than a week or within a day. The small amount of heat input may allow for quicker formation of a low temperature barrier if freeze wells are to be positioned in the wellbores used to introduce material into the formation.","In some embodiments, a heater may be suspended in the well without a conduit that allows for removal of excess material from the wellbore. The material may be introduced into the well. After material introduction, the heater may be removed from the well. In some embodiments, a conduit may be positioned in the wellbore, but a heater may not be coupled to the conduit. Hot material may be circulated through the conduit so that the wax enters fractures systems and\/or vugs adjacent to the wellbore.","In some embodiments, material may be used during the formation of a wellbore to improve inter-zonal isolation and protect a low-pressure zone from inflow from a high-pressure zone. During wellbore formation where a high pressure zone and a low pressure zone are penetrated by a common wellbore, it is possible for fluid from the high pressure zone to flow into the low pressure zone and cause an underground blowout. To avoid this, the wellbore may be formed through the first zone. Then, an intermediate casing may be set and cemented through the first zone. Setting casing may be time consuming and expensive. Instead of setting a casing, material may be introduced to form a wax barrier that seals the first zone. The material may also inhibit or prevent mixing of high salinity brines from lower, high pressure zones with fresher brines in upper, lower pressure zones.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0792","num":"0791"},"figref":["FIG. 52A","FIG. 52B"],"b":["428","524","428","518","428","518","428","518","428","518","524","428","428","524","428","428","518","518","428","526","524"]},"In some embodiments, a material including wax may be used to contain and inhibit migration in a subsurface formation that has liquid hydrocarbon contaminants (for example, compounds such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene) condensed in fractures in the formation. The location of the contaminants may be surrounded with heated injection wells. The material may be introduced into the wells to form an outer wax barrier. The material injected into the fractures from the injection wells may mix with the contaminants. The contaminants may be solubilized into the material. When the material congeals, the contaminants may be permanently contained in the solid wax phase of the material.","In some embodiments, a portion or all of the wax barrier may be removed after completion of the in situ heat treatment process. Removing all or a portion of the wax barrier may allow fluid to flow into and out of the treatment area of the in situ heat treatment process. Removing all or a portion of the wax barrier may return flow conditions in the formation to substantially the same conditions as existed before the in situ heat treatment process. To remove a portion or all of the wax barrier, heaters may be used to heat the formation adjacent to the wax barrier. In some embodiments, the heaters raise the temperature above the decomposition temperature of the material forming the wax barrier. In some embodiments, the heaters raise the temperature above the melting temperature of the material forming the wax barrier. Fluid (for example water) may be introduced into the formation to drive the molten material to one or more production wells positioned in the formation. The production wells may remove the material from the formation.","In some embodiments, a composition that includes a cross-linkable polymer may be used with or in addition to a material that includes wax to form the barrier. Such composition may be provided to the formation as is described above for the material that includes wax. The composition may be configured to react and solidify after a selected time in the formation, thereby allowing the composition to be provided as a liquid to the formation. The cross-linkable polymer may include, for example, acrylates, methacrylates, urethanes, and\/or epoxies. A cross-linking initiator may be included in the composition. The composition may also include a cross-linking inhibitor. The cross-linking inhibitor may be configured to degrade while in the formation, thereby allowing the composition to solidify.","In situ heat treatment processes and solution mining processes may heat the treatment area, remove mass from the treatment area, and greatly increase the permeability of the treatment area. In certain embodiments, the treatment area after being treated may have a permeability of at least 0.1 darcy. In some embodiments, the treatment area after being treated has a permeability of at least 1 darcy, of at least 10 darcy, or of at least 100 darcy. The increased permeability allows the fluid to spread in the formation into fractures, microfractures, and\/or pore spaces in the formation. Outside of the treatment area, the permeability may remain at the initial permeability of the formation. The increased permeability allows fluid introduced to flow easily within the formation.","In certain embodiments, a barrier may be formed in the formation after a solution mining process and\/or an in situ heat treatment process by introducing a fluid into the formation. The barrier may inhibit formation fluid from entering the treatment area after the solution mining and\/or in situ heat treatment processes have ended. The barrier formed by introducing fluid into the formation may allow for isolation of the treatment area.","The fluid introduced into the formation to form a barrier may include wax, bitumen, heavy oil, sulfur, polymer, gel, saturated saline solution, and\/or one or more reactants that react to form a precipitate, solid or high viscosity fluid in the formation. In some embodiments, bitumen, heavy oil, reactants and\/or sulfur used to form the barrier are obtained from treatment facilities associated with the in situ heat treatment process. For example, sulfur may be obtained from a Claus process used to treat produced gases to remove hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur compounds.","The fluid may be introduced into the formation as a liquid, vapor, or mixed phase fluid. The fluid may be introduced into a portion of the formation that is at an elevated temperature. In some embodiments, the fluid is introduced into the formation through wells located near a perimeter of the treatment area. The fluid may be directed away from the treatment area. The elevated temperature of the formation maintains or allows the fluid to have a low viscosity so that the fluid moves away from the wells. A portion of the fluid may spread outwards in the formation towards a cooler portion of the formation. The relatively high permeability of the formation allows fluid introduced from one wellbore to spread and mix with fluid introduced from other wellbores. In the cooler portion of the formation, the viscosity of the fluid increases, a portion of the fluid precipitates, and\/or the fluid solidifies or thickens so that the fluid forms the barrier to flow of formation fluid into or out of the treatment area.","In some embodiments, a low temperature barrier formed by freeze wells surrounds all or a portion of the treatment area. As the fluid introduced into the formation approaches the low temperature barrier, the temperature of the formation becomes colder. The colder temperature increases the viscosity of the fluid, enhances precipitation, and\/or solidifies the fluid to form the barrier to the flow of formation fluid into or out of the formation. The fluid may remain in the formation as a highly viscous fluid or a solid after the low temperature barrier has dissipated.","In certain embodiments, saturated saline solution is introduced into the formation. Components in the saturated saline solution may precipitate out of solution when the solution reaches a colder temperature. The solidified particles may form the barrier to the flow of formation fluid into or out of the formation. The solidified components may be substantially insoluble in formation fluid.","In certain embodiments, brine is introduced into the formation as a reactant. A second reactant, such as carbon dioxide, may be introduced into the formation to react with the brine. The reaction may generate a mineral complex that grows in the formation. The mineral complex may be substantially insoluble to formation fluid. In an embodiment, the brine solution includes a sodium and aluminum solution. The second reactant introduced in the formation is carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide reacts with the brine solution to produce dawsonite. The minerals may solidify and form the barrier to the flow of formation fluid into or out of the formation.","In some embodiments, the barrier may be formed around a treatment area using sulfur. Advantageously, elemental sulfur is insoluble in water. Liquid and\/or solid sulfur in the formation may form a barrier to formation fluid flow into or out of the treatment area.","A sulfur barrier may be established in the formation during or before initiation of heating to heat the treatment area of the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments, sulfur may be introduced into wellbores in the formation that are located between the treatment area and a first barrier (for example, a low temperature barrier established by freeze wells). The formation adjacent to the wellbores that the sulfur is introduced into may be dewatered. In some embodiments, the formation adjacent to the wellbores that the sulfur is introduced into is heated to facilitate removal of water and to prepare the wellbores and adjacent formation for the introduction of sulfur. The formation adjacent to the wellbores may be heated to a temperature below the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. The formation may be heated so that the temperature of a portion of the formation between two adjacent heaters is influenced by both heaters. In some embodiments, the heat may increase the permeability of the formation so that a first wellbore is in fluid communication with an adjacent wellbore.","After the formation adjacent to the wellbores is heated, molten sulfur at a temperature below the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation is introduced into the formation. Over a certain temperature range, the viscosity of molten sulfur increases with increasing temperature. The molten sulfur introduced into the formation may be near the melting temperature of sulfur (about 115\u00b0 C.) so that the sulfur has a relatively low viscosity (about 4-10 cp). Heaters in the wellbores may be temperature limited heaters with Curie temperatures near the melting temperature of sulfur so that the temperature of the molten sulfur stays relatively constant and below temperatures resulting in the formation of viscous molten sulfur. In some embodiments, the region adjacent to the wellbores may be heated to a temperature above the melting point of sulfur, but below the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. The heaters may be turned off and the temperature in the wellbores may be monitored (for example, using a fiber optic temperature monitoring system). When the temperature in the wellbore cools to a temperature near the melting temperature of sulfur, molten sulfur may be introduced into the formation.","The sulfur introduced into the formation is allowed to flow and diffuse into the formation from the wellbores. As the sulfur enters portions of the formation below the melting temperature, the sulfur solidifies and forms a barrier to fluid flow in the formation. Sulfur may be introduced until the formation is not able to accept additional sulfur. Heating may be stopped, and the formation may be allowed to naturally cool so that the sulfur in the formation solidifies. After introduction of the sulfur, the integrity of the formed barrier may be tested using pulse tests and\/or tracer tests.","A barrier may be formed around the treatment area after the in situ heat treatment process. The sulfur may form a substantially permanent barrier in the formation. In some embodiments, a low temperature barrier formed by freeze wells surrounds the treatment area. Sulfur may be introduced on one or both sides of the low temperature barrier to form a barrier in the formation. The sulfur may be introduced into the formation as vapor or a liquid. As the sulfur approaches the low temperature barrier, the sulfur may condense and\/or solidify in the formation to form the barrier.","In some embodiments, the sulfur may be introduced in the heated portion of the portion. The sulfur may be introduced into the formation through wells located near the perimeter of the treatment area. The temperature of the formation may be hotter than the vaporization temperature of sulfur (about 445\u00b0 C.). The sulfur may be introduced as a liquid, vapor or mixed phase fluid. If a part of the introduced sulfur is in the liquid phase, the heat of the formation may vaporize the sulfur. The sulfur may flow outwards from the introduction wells towards cooler portions of the formation. The sulfur may condense and\/or solidify in the formation to form the barrier.","In some embodiments, the Claus reaction may be used to form sulfur in the formation after the in situ heat treatment process. The Claus reaction is a gas phase equilibrium reaction. The Claus reaction is:\n\n4HS+2SO3S+4HO\u2003\u2003(EQN. 2)\n","Hydrogen sulfide may be obtained by separating the hydrogen sulfide from the produced fluid of an ongoing in situ heat treatment process. A portion of the hydrogen sulfide may be burned to form the needed sulfur dioxide. Hydrogen sulfide may be introduced into the formation through a number of wells in the formation. Sulfur dioxide may be introduced into the formation through other wells. The wells used for injecting sulfur dioxide or hydrogen sulfide may have been production wells, heater wells, monitor wells or other type of well during the in situ heat treatment process. The wells used for injecting sulfur dioxide or hydrogen sulfide may be near the perimeter of the treatment area. The number of wells may be enough so that the formation in the vicinity of the injection wells does not cool to a point where the sulfur dioxide and the hydrogen sulfide can form sulfur and condense, rather than remain in the vapor phase. The wells used to introduce the sulfur dioxide into the formation may also be near the perimeter of the treatment area. In some embodiments, the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide may be introduced into the formation through the same wells (for example, through two conduits positioned in the same wellbore). The hydrogen sulfide and the sulfur dioxide may react in the formation to form sulfur and water. The sulfur may flow outwards in the formation and condense and\/or solidify to form the barrier in the formation.","The sulfur barrier may form in the formation beyond the area where hydrocarbons in formation fluid generated by the heat treatment process condense in the formation. Regions near the perimeter of the treated area may be at lower temperatures than the treated area. Sulfur may condense and\/or solidify from the vapor phase in these lower temperature regions. Additional hydrogen sulfide, and\/or sulfur dioxide may diffuse to these lower temperature regions. Additional sulfur may form by the Claus reaction to maintain an equilibrium concentration of sulfur in the vapor phase. Eventually, a sulfur barrier may form around the treated zone. The vapor phase in the treated region may remain as an equilibrium mixture of sulfur, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, water vapor and other vapor products present or evolving from the formation.","The conversion to sulfur is favored at lower temperatures, so the conversion of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide to sulfur may take place a distance away from the wells that introduce the reactants into the formation. The Claus reaction may result in the formation of sulfur where the temperature of the formation is cooler (for example where the temperature of the formation is at temperatures from about 180\u00b0 C. to about 240\u00b0 C.).","A temperature monitoring system may be installed in wellbores of freeze wells and\/or in monitor wells adjacent to the freeze wells to monitor the temperature profile of the freeze wells and\/or the low temperature zone established by the freeze wells. The monitoring system may be used to monitor progress of low temperature zone formation. The monitoring system may be used to determine the location of high temperature areas, potential breakthrough locations, or breakthrough locations after the low temperature zone has formed. Periodic monitoring of the temperature profile of the freeze wells and\/or low temperature zone established by the freeze wells may allow additional cooling to be provided to potential trouble areas before breakthrough occurs. Additional cooling may be provided at or adjacent to breakthroughs and high temperature areas to ensure the integrity of the low temperature zone around the treatment area. Additional cooling may be provided by increasing refrigerant flow through selected freeze wells, installing an additional freeze well or freeze wells, and\/or by providing a cryogenic fluid, such as liquid nitrogen, to the high temperature areas. Providing additional cooling to potential problem areas before breakthrough occurs may be more time efficient and cost efficient than sealing a breach, reheating a portion of the treatment area that has been cooled by influx of fluid, and\/or remediating an area outside of the breached frozen barrier.","In some embodiments, a traveling thermocouple may be used to monitor the temperature profile of selected freeze wells or monitor wells. In some embodiments, the temperature monitoring system includes thermocouples placed at discrete locations in the wellbores of the freeze wells, in the freeze wells, and\/or in the monitoring wells. In some embodiments, the temperature monitoring system comprises a fiber optic temperature monitoring system.","Fiber optic temperature monitoring systems are available from Sensornet (London, United Kingdom), Sensa (Houston, Tex., U.S.A.), Luna Energy (Blacksburg, Va., U.S.A.), Lios Technology GMBH (Cologne, Germany), Oxford Electronics Ltd. (Hampshire, United Kingdom), and Sabeus Sensor Systems (Calabasas, Calif., U.S.A.). The fiber optic temperature monitoring system includes a data system and one or more fiber optic cables. The data system includes one or more lasers for sending light to the fiber optic cable; and one or more computers, software and peripherals for receiving, analyzing, and outputting data. The data system may be coupled to one or more fiber optic cables.","A single fiber optic cable may be several kilometers long. The fiber optic cable may be installed in many freeze wells and\/or monitor wells. In some embodiments, two fiber optic cables may be installed in each freeze well and\/or monitor well. The two fiber optic cables may be coupled. Using two fiber optic cables per well allows for compensation due to optical losses that occur in the wells and allows for better accuracy of measured temperature profiles.","The fiber optic temperature monitoring system may be used to detect the location of a breach or a potential breach in a frozen barrier. The search for potential breaches may be performed at scheduled intervals, for example, every two or three months. To determine the location of the breach or potential breach, flow of formation refrigerant to the freeze wells of interest is stopped. In some embodiments, the flow of formation refrigerant to all of the freeze wells is stopped. The rise in the temperature profiles, as well as the rate of change of the temperature profiles, provided by the fiber optic temperature monitoring system for each freeze well can be used to determine the location of any breaches or hot spots in the low temperature zone maintained by the freeze wells. The temperature profile monitored by the fiber optic temperature monitoring system for the two freeze wells closest to the hot spot or fluid flow will show the quickest and greatest rise in temperature. A temperature change of a few degrees Centigrade in the temperature profiles of the freeze wells closest to a troubled area may be sufficient to isolate the location of the trouble area. The shut down time of flow of circulation fluid in the freeze wells of interest needed to detect breaches, potential breaches, and hot spots may be on the order of a few hours or days, depending on the well spacing and the amount of fluid flow affecting the low temperature zone.","Fiber optic temperature monitoring systems may also be used to monitor temperatures in heated portions of the formation during in situ heat treatment processes. Temperature monitoring systems positioned in production wells, heater wells, injection wells, and\/or monitor wells may be used to measure temperature profiles in treatment areas subjected to in situ heat treatment processes. The fiber of a fiber optic cable used in the heated portion of the formation may be clad with a reflective material to facilitate retention of a signal or signals transmitted down the fiber. In some embodiments, the fiber is clad with gold, copper, nickel, aluminum and\/or alloys thereof. The cladding may be formed of a material that is able to withstand chemical and temperature conditions in the heated portion of the formation. For example, gold cladding may allow an optical sensor to be used up to temperatures of 700\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the fiber is clad with aluminum. The fiber may be dipped in or run through a bath of liquid aluminum. The clad fiber may then be allowed to cool to secure the aluminum to the fiber. The gold or aluminum cladding may reduce hydrogen darkening of the optical fiber.","A potential source of heat loss from the heated formation is due to reflux in wells. Refluxing occurs when vapors condense in a well and flow into a portion of the well adjacent to the heated portion of the formation. Vapors may condense in the well adjacent to the overburden of the formation to form condensed fluid. Condensed fluid flowing into the well adjacent to the heated formation absorbs heat from the formation. Heat absorbed by condensed fluids cools the formation and necessitates additional energy input into the formation to maintain the formation at a desired temperature. Some fluids that condense in the overburden and flow into the portion of the well adjacent to the heated formation may react to produce undesired compounds and\/or coke. Inhibiting fluids from refluxing may significantly improve the thermal efficiency of the in situ heat treatment system and\/or the quality of the product produced from the in situ heat treatment system.","For some well embodiments, the portion of the well adjacent to the overburden section of the formation is cemented to the formation. In some well embodiments, the well includes packing material placed near the transition from the heated section of the formation to the overburden. The packing material inhibits formation fluid from passing from the heated section of the formation into the section of the wellbore adjacent to the overburden. Cables, conduits, devices, and\/or instruments may pass through the packing material, but the packing material inhibits formation fluid from passing up the wellbore adjacent to the overburden section of the formation.","In some embodiments, one or more baffle systems may be placed in the wellbores to inhibit reflux. The baffle systems may be obstructions to fluid flow into the heated portion of the formation. In some embodiments, refluxing fluid may revaporize on the baffle system before coming into contact with the heated portion of the formation.","In some embodiments, a gas may be introduced into the formation through wellbores to inhibit reflux in the wellbores. In some embodiments, gas may be introduced into wellbores that include baffle systems to inhibit reflux of fluid in the wellbores. The gas may be carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen or other desired gas. In some embodiments, the introduction of gas may be used in conjunction with one or more baffle systems in the wellbores. The introduced gas may enhance heat exchange at the baffle systems to help maintain top portions of the baffle systems colder than the lower portions of the baffle systems.","The flow of production fluid up the well to the surface is desired for some types of wells, especially for production wells. Flow of production fluid up the well is also desirable for some heater wells that are used to control pressure in the formation. The overburden, or a conduit in the well used to transport formation fluid from the heated portion of the formation to the surface, may be heated to inhibit condensation on or in the conduit. Providing heat in the overburden, however, may be costly and\/or may lead to increased cracking or coking of formation fluid as the formation fluid is being produced from the formation.","To avoid the need to heat the overburden or to heat the conduit passing through the overburden, one or more diverters may be placed in the wellbore to inhibit fluid from refluxing into the wellbore adjacent to the heated portion of the formation. In some embodiments, the diverter retains fluid above the heated portion of the formation. Fluids retained in the diverter may be removed from the diverter using a pump, gas lifting, and\/or other fluid removal technique. In certain embodiments, two or more diverters that retain fluid above the heated portion of the formation may be located in the production well. Two or more diverters provide a simple way of separating initial fractions of condensed fluid produced from the in situ heat treatment system. A pump may be placed in each of the diverters to remove condensed fluid from the diverters.","In some embodiments, the diverter directs fluid to a sump below the heated portion of the formation. An inlet for a lift system may be located in the sump. In some embodiments, the intake of the lift system is located in casing in the sump. In some embodiments, the intake of the lift system is located in an open wellbore. The sump is below the heated portion of the formation. The intake of the pump may be located 1 m, 5 m, 10 m, 20 m or more below the deepest heater used to heat the heated portion of the formation. The sump may be at a cooler temperature than the heated portion of the formation. The sump may be more than 10\u00b0 C., more than 50\u00b0 C., more than 75\u00b0 C., or more than 100\u00b0 C. below the temperature of the heated portion of the formation. A portion of the fluid entering the sump may be liquid. A portion of the fluid entering the sump may condense within the sump. The lift system moves the fluid in the sump to the surface.","Production well lift systems may be used to efficiently transport formation fluid from the bottom of the production wells to the surface. Production well lift systems may provide and maintain the maximum required well drawdown (minimum reservoir producing pressure) and producing rates. The production well lift systems may operate efficiently over a wide range of high temperature\/multiphase fluids (gas\/vapor\/steam\/water\/hydrocarbon liquids) and production rates expected during the life of a typical project. Production well lift systems may include dual concentric rod pump lift systems, chamber lift systems and other types of lift systems.","Temperature limited heaters may be in configurations and\/or may include materials that provide automatic temperature limiting properties for the heater at certain temperatures. In certain embodiments, ferromagnetic materials are used in temperature limited heaters. Ferromagnetic material may self-limit temperature at or near the Curie temperature of the material and\/or the phase transformation temperature range to provide a reduced amount of heat when a time-varying current is applied to the material. In certain embodiments, the ferromagnetic material self-limits temperature of the temperature limited heater at a selected temperature that is approximately the Curie temperature and\/or in the phase transformation temperature range. In certain embodiments, the selected temperature is within about 35\u00b0 C., within about 25\u00b0 C., within about 20\u00b0 C., or within about 10\u00b0 C. of the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. In certain embodiments, ferromagnetic materials are coupled with other materials (for example, highly conductive materials, high strength materials, corrosion resistant materials, or combinations thereof) to provide various electrical and\/or mechanical properties. Some parts of the temperature limited heater may have a lower resistance (caused by different geometries and\/or by using different ferromagnetic and\/or non-ferromagnetic materials) than other parts of the temperature limited heater. Having parts of the temperature limited heater with various materials and\/or dimensions allows for tailoring the desired heat output from each part of the heater.","Temperature limited heaters may be more reliable than other heaters. Temperature limited heaters may be less apt to break down or fail due to hot spots in the formation. In some embodiments, temperature limited heaters allow for substantially uniform heating of the formation. In some embodiments, temperature limited heaters are able to heat the formation more efficiently by operating at a higher average heat output along the entire length of the heater. The temperature limited heater operates at the higher average heat output along the entire length of the heater because power to the heater does not have to be reduced to the entire heater, as is the case with typical constant wattage heaters, if a temperature along any point of the heater exceeds, or is about to exceed, a maximum operating temperature of the heater. Heat output from portions of a temperature limited heater approaching a Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the heater automatically reduces without controlled adjustment of the time-varying current applied to the heater. The heat output automatically reduces due to changes in electrical properties (for example, electrical resistance) of portions of the temperature limited heater. Thus, more power is supplied by the temperature limited heater during a greater portion of a heating process.","In certain embodiments, the system including temperature limited heaters initially provides a first heat output and then provides a reduced (second heat output) heat output, near, at, or above the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of an electrically resistive portion of the heater when the temperature limited heater is energized by a time-varying current. The first heat output is the heat output at temperatures below which the temperature limited heater begins to self-limit. In some embodiments, the first heat output is the heat output at a temperature about 50\u00b0 C., about 75\u00b0 C., about 100\u00b0 C., or about 125\u00b0 C. below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic material in the temperature limited heater.","The temperature limited heater may be energized by time-varying current (alternating current or modulated direct current) supplied at the wellhead. The wellhead may include a power source and other components (for example, modulation components, transformers, and\/or capacitors) used in supplying power to the temperature limited heater. The temperature limited heater may be one of many heaters used to heat a portion of the formation.","In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater includes a conductor that operates as a skin effect or proximity effect heater when time-varying current is applied to the conductor. The skin effect limits the depth of current penetration into the interior of the conductor. For ferromagnetic materials, the skin effect is dominated by the magnetic permeability of the conductor. The relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials is typically between 10 and 1000 (for example, the relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials is typically at least 10 and may be at least 50, 100, 500, 1000 or greater). As the temperature of the ferromagnetic material is raised above the Curie temperature, or the phase transformation temperature range, and\/or as the applied electrical current is increased, the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material decreases substantially and the skin depth expands rapidly (for example, the skin depth expands as the inverse square root of the magnetic permeability). The reduction in magnetic permeability results in a decrease in the AC or modulated DC resistance of the conductor near, at, or above the Curie temperature, the phase transformation temperature range, and\/or as the applied electrical current is increased. When the temperature limited heater is powered by a substantially constant current source, portions of the heater that approach, reach, or are above the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range may have reduced heat dissipation. Sections of the temperature limited heater that are not at or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range may be dominated by skin effect heating that allows the heater to have high heat dissipation due to a higher resistive load.","Curie temperature heaters have been used in soldering equipment, heaters for medical applications, and heating elements for ovens (for example, pizza ovens). Some of these uses are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,579,575 to Lamome et al.; 5,065,501 to Henschen et al.; and 5,512,732 to Yagnik et al., all of which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. U.S. Pat. No. 4,849,611 to Whitney et al., which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes a plurality of discrete, spaced-apart heating units including a reactive component, a resistive heating component, and a temperature responsive component.","An advantage of using the temperature limited heater to heat hydrocarbons in the formation is that the conductor is chosen to have a Curie temperature and\/or a phase transformation temperature range in a desired range of temperature operation. Operation within the desired operating temperature range allows substantial heat injection into the formation while maintaining the temperature of the temperature limited heater, and other equipment, below design limit temperatures. Design limit temperatures are temperatures at which properties such as corrosion, creep, and\/or deformation are adversely affected. The temperature limiting properties of the temperature limited heater inhibit overheating or burnout of the heater adjacent to low thermal conductivity \u201chot spots\u201d in the formation. In some embodiments, the temperature limited heater is able to lower or control heat output and\/or withstand heat at temperatures above 25\u00b0 C., 37\u00b0 C., 100\u00b0 C., 250\u00b0 C., 500\u00b0 C., 700\u00b0 C., 800\u00b0 C., 900\u00b0 C., or higher up to 1131\u00b0 C., depending on the materials used in the heater.","The temperature limited heater allows for more heat injection into the formation than constant wattage heaters because the energy input into the temperature limited heater does not have to be limited to accommodate low thermal conductivity regions adjacent to the heater. For example, in Green River oil shale there is a difference of at least a factor of 3 in the thermal conductivity of the lowest richness oil shale layers and the highest richness oil shale layers. When heating such a formation, substantially more heat is transferred to the formation with the temperature limited heater than with the conventional heater that is limited by the temperature at low thermal conductivity layers. The heat output along the entire length of the conventional heater needs to accommodate the low thermal conductivity layers so that the heater does not overheat at the low thermal conductivity layers and burn out. The heat output adjacent to the low thermal conductivity layers that are at high temperature will reduce for the temperature limited heater, but the remaining portions of the temperature limited heater that are not at high temperature will still provide high heat output. Because heaters for heating hydrocarbon formations typically have long lengths (for example, at least 10 m, 100 m, 300 m, 500 m, 1 km or more up to about 10 km), the majority of the length of the temperature limited heater may be operating below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range while only a few portions are at or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the temperature limited heater.","The use of temperature limited heaters allows for efficient transfer of heat to the formation. Efficient transfer of heat allows for reduction in time needed to heat the formation to a desired temperature. For example, in Green River oil shale, pyrolysis typically requires 9.5 years to 10 years of heating when using a 12 m heater well spacing with conventional constant wattage heaters. For the same heater spacing, temperature limited heaters may allow a larger average heat output while maintaining heater equipment temperatures below equipment design limit temperatures. Pyrolysis in the formation may occur at an earlier time with the larger average heat output provided by temperature limited heaters than the lower average heat output provided by constant wattage heaters. For example, in Green River oil shale, pyrolysis may occur in 5 years using temperature limited heaters with a 12 m heater well spacing. Temperature limited heaters counteract hot spots due to inaccurate well spacing or drilling where heater wells come too close together. In certain embodiments, temperature limited heaters allow for increased power output over time for heater wells that have been spaced too far apart, or limit power output for heater wells that are spaced too close together. Temperature limited heaters also supply more power in regions adjacent the overburden and underburden to compensate for temperature losses in these regions.","Temperature limited heaters may be advantageously used in many types of formations. For example, in tar sands formations or relatively permeable formations containing heavy hydrocarbons, temperature limited heaters may be used to provide a controllable low temperature output for reducing the viscosity of fluids, mobilizing fluids, and\/or enhancing the radial flow of fluids at or near the wellbore or in the formation. Temperature limited heaters may be used to inhibit excess coke formation due to overheating of the near wellbore region of the formation.","In some embodiments, the use of temperature limited heaters eliminates or reduces the need for expensive temperature control circuitry. For example, the use of temperature limited heaters eliminates or reduces the need to perform temperature logging and\/or the need to use fixed thermocouples on the heaters to monitor potential overheating at hot spots.","In certain embodiments, phase transformation (for example, crystalline phase transformation or a change in the crystal structure) of materials used in a temperature limited heater change the selected temperature at which the heater self-limits. Ferromagnetic material used in the temperature limited heater may have a phase transformation (for example, a transformation from ferrite to austenite) that decreases the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material. This reduction in magnetic permeability is similar to reduction in magnetic permeability due to the magnetic transition of the ferromagnetic material at the Curie temperature. The Curie temperature is the magnetic transition temperature of the ferrite phase of the ferromagnetic material. The reduction in magnetic permeability results in a decrease in the AC or modulated DC resistance of the temperature limited heater near, at, or above the temperature of the phase transformation and\/or the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material.","The phase transformation of the ferromagnetic material may occur over a temperature range. The temperature range of the phase transformation depends on the ferromagnetic material and may vary, for example, over a range of about 5\u00b0 C. to a range of about 200\u00b0 C. Because the phase transformation takes place over a temperature range, the reduction in the magnetic permeability due to the phase transformation takes place over the temperature range. The reduction in magnetic permeability may also occur hysteretically over the temperature range of the phase transformation. In some embodiments, the phase transformation back to the lower temperature phase of the ferromagnetic material is slower than the phase transformation to the higher temperature phase (for example, the transition from austenite back to ferrite is slower than the transition from ferrite to austenite). The slower phase transformation back to the lower temperature phase may cause hysteretic operation of the heater at or near the phase transformation temperature range that allows the heater to slowly increase to higher resistance after the resistance of the heater reduces due to high temperature.","In some embodiments, the phase transformation temperature range overlaps with the reduction in the magnetic permeability when the temperature approaches the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material. The overlap may produce a faster drop in electrical resistance versus temperature than if the reduction in magnetic permeability is solely due to the temperature approaching the Curie temperature. The overlap may also produce hysteretic behavior of the temperature limited heater near the Curie temperature and\/or in the phase transformation temperature range.","In certain embodiments, the hysteretic operation due to the phase transformation is a smoother transition than the reduction in magnetic permeability due to magnetic transition at the Curie temperature. The smoother transition may be easier to control (for example, electrical control using a process control device that interacts with the power supply) than the sharper transition at the Curie temperature. In some embodiments, the Curie temperature is located inside the phase transformation range for selected metallurgies used in temperature limited heaters. This phenomenon provides temperature limited heaters with the smooth transition properties of the phase transformation in addition to a sharp and definite transition due to the reduction in magnetic properties at the Curie temperature. Such temperature limited heaters may be easy to control (due to the phase transformation) while providing finite temperature limits (due to the sharp Curie temperature transition). Using the phase transformation temperature range instead of and\/or in addition to the Curie temperature in temperature limited heaters increases the number and range of metallurgies that may be used for temperature limited heaters.","In certain embodiments, alloy additions are made to the ferromagnetic material to adjust the temperature range of the phase transformation. For example, adding carbon to the ferromagnetic material may increase the phase transformation temperature range and lower the onset temperature of the phase transformation. Adding titanium to the ferromagnetic material may increase the onset temperature of the phase transformation and decrease the phase transformation temperature range. Alloy compositions may be adjusted to provide desired Curie temperature and phase transformation properties for the ferromagnetic material. The alloy composition of the ferromagnetic material may be chosen based on desired properties for the ferromagnetic material (such as, but not limited to, magnetic permeability transition temperature or temperature range, resistance versus temperature profile, or power output). Addition of titanium may allow higher Curie temperatures to be obtained when adding cobalt to 410 stainless steel by raising the ferrite to austenite phase transformation temperature range to a temperature range that is above, or well above, the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material.","In some embodiments, temperature limited heaters are more economical to manufacture or make than standard heaters. Typical ferromagnetic materials include iron, carbon steel, or ferritic stainless steel. Such materials are inexpensive as compared to nickel-based heating alloys (such as nichrome, Kanthal\u2122 (Bulten-Kanthal AB, Sweden), and\/or LOHM\u2122 (Driver-Harris Company, Harrison, N.J., U.S.A.)) typically used in insulated conductor (mineral insulated cable) heaters. In one embodiment of the temperature limited heater, the temperature limited heater is manufactured in continuous lengths as an insulated conductor heater to lower costs and improve reliability.","In some embodiments, the temperature limited heater is placed in the heater well using a coiled tubing rig. A heater that can be coiled on a spool may be manufactured by using metal such as ferritic stainless steel (for example, 409 stainless steel) that is welded using electrical resistance welding (ERW). U.S. Pat. No. 7,032,809 to Hopkins, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describes forming seam-welded pipe. To form a heater section, a metal strip from a roll is passed through a former where it is shaped into a tubular and then longitudinally welded using ERW.","In some embodiments, a composite tubular may be formed from the seam-welded tubular. The seam-welded tubular is passed through a second former where a conductive strip (for example, a copper strip) is applied, drawn down tightly on the tubular through a die, and longitudinally welded using ERW. A sheath may be formed by longitudinally welding a support material (for example, steel such as 347H or 347HH) over the conductive strip material. The support material may be a strip rolled over the conductive strip material. An overburden section of the heater may be formed in a similar manner.","In certain embodiments, the overburden section uses a non-ferromagnetic material such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel instead of a ferromagnetic material. The heater section and overburden section may be coupled using standard techniques such as butt welding using an orbital welder. In some embodiments, the overburden section material (the non-ferromagnetic material) may be pre-welded to the ferromagnetic material before rolling. The pre-welding may eliminate the need for a separate coupling step (for example, butt welding). In an embodiment, a flexible cable (for example, a furnace cable such as a MGT 1000 furnace cable) may be pulled through the center after forming the tubular heater. An end bushing on the flexible cable may be welded to the tubular heater to provide an electrical current return path. The tubular heater, including the flexible cable, may be coiled onto a spool before installation into a heater well. In an embodiment, the temperature limited heater is installed using the coiled tubing rig. The coiled tubing rig may place the temperature limited heater in a deformation resistant container in the formation. The deformation resistant container may be placed in the heater well using conventional methods.","Temperature limited heaters may be used for heating hydrocarbon formations including, but not limited to, oil shale formations, coal formations, tar sands formations, and formations with heavy viscous oils. Temperature limited heaters may also be used in the field of environmental remediation to vaporize or destroy soil contaminants. Embodiments of temperature limited heaters may be used to heat fluids in a wellbore or sub-sea pipeline to inhibit deposition of paraffin or various hydrates. In some embodiments, a temperature limited heater is used for solution mining a subsurface formation (for example, an oil shale or a coal formation). In certain embodiments, a fluid (for example, molten salt) is placed in a wellbore and heated with a temperature limited heater to inhibit deformation and\/or collapse of the wellbore. In some embodiments, the temperature limited heater is attached to a sucker rod in the wellbore or is part of the sucker rod itself. In some embodiments, temperature limited heaters are used to heat a near wellbore region to reduce near wellbore oil viscosity during production of high viscosity crude oils and during transport of high viscosity oils to the surface. In some embodiments, a temperature limited heater enables gas lifting of a viscous oil by lowering the viscosity of the oil without coking the oil. Temperature limited heaters may be used in sulfur transfer lines to maintain temperatures between about 110\u00b0 C. and about 130\u00b0 C.","The ferromagnetic alloy or ferromagnetic alloys used in the temperature limited heater determine the Curie temperature of the heater. Curie temperature data for various metals is listed in \u201cAmerican Institute of Physics Handbook,\u201d Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, pages 5-170 through 5-176. Ferromagnetic conductors may include one or more of the ferromagnetic elements (iron, cobalt, and nickel) and\/or alloys of these elements. In some embodiments, ferromagnetic conductors include iron-chromium (Fe\u2014Cr) alloys that contain tungsten (W) (for example, HCM12A and SAVE12 (Sumitomo Metals Co., Japan) and\/or iron alloys that contain chromium (for example, Fe\u2014Cr alloys, Fe\u2014Cr\u2014W alloys, Fe\u2014Cr\u2014V (vanadium) alloys, and Fe\u2014Cr\u2014Nb (Niobium) alloys). Of the three main ferromagnetic elements, iron has a Curie temperature of approximately 770\u00b0 C.; cobalt (Co) has a Curie temperature of approximately 1131\u00b0 C.; and nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 358\u00b0 C. An iron-cobalt alloy has a Curie temperature higher than the Curie temperature of iron. For example, iron-cobalt alloy with 2% by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of approximately 800\u00b0 C.; iron-cobalt alloy with 12% by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of approximately 900\u00b0 C.; and iron-cobalt alloy with 20% by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of approximately 950\u00b0 C. Iron-nickel alloy has a Curie temperature lower than the Curie temperature of iron. For example, iron-nickel alloy with 20% by weight nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 720\u00b0 C., and iron-nickel alloy with 60% by weight nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 560\u00b0 C.","Some non-ferromagnetic elements used as alloys raise the Curie temperature of iron. For example, an iron-vanadium alloy with 5.9% by weight vanadium has a Curie temperature of approximately 815\u00b0 C. Other non-ferromagnetic elements (for example, carbon, aluminum, copper, silicon, and\/or chromium) may be alloyed with iron or other ferromagnetic materials to lower the Curie temperature. Non-ferromagnetic materials that raise the Curie temperature may be combined with non-ferromagnetic materials that lower the Curie temperature and alloyed with iron or other ferromagnetic materials to produce a material with a desired Curie temperature and other desired physical and\/or chemical properties. In some embodiments, the Curie temperature material is a ferrite such as NiFeO. In other embodiments, the Curie temperature material is a binary compound such as FeNior FeAl.","In some embodiments, the improved alloy includes carbon, cobalt, iron, manganese, silicon, or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the improved alloy includes, by weight: about 0.1% to about 10% cobalt; about 0.1% carbon, about 0.5% manganese, about 0.5% silicon, with the balance being iron. In certain embodiments, the improved alloy includes, by weight: about 0.1% to about 10% cobalt; about 0.1% carbon, about 0.5% manganese, about 0.5% silicon, with the balance being iron.","In some embodiments, the improved alloy includes chromium, carbon, cobalt, iron, manganese, silicon, titanium, vanadium, or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the improved alloy includes, by weight: about 5% to about 20% cobalt, about 0.1% carbon, about 0.5% manganese, about 0.5% silicon, about 0.1% to about 2% vanadium with the balance being iron. In some embodiments, the improved alloy includes, by weight: about 12% chromium, about 0.1% carbon, about 0.5% silicon, about 0.1% to about 0.5% manganese, above 0% to about 15% cobalt, above 0% to about 2% vanadium, above 0% to about 1% titanium, with the balance being iron. In some embodiments, the improved alloy includes, by weight: about 12% chromium, about 0.1% carbon, about 0.5% silicon, about 0.1% to about 0.5% manganese, above 0% to about 2% vanadium, above 0% to about 1% titanium, with the balance being iron. In some embodiments, the improved alloy includes, by weight: about 12% chromium, about 0.1% carbon, about 0.5% silicon, about 0.1% to about 0.5% manganese, above 0% to about 2% vanadium, with the balance being iron. In certain embodiments, the improved alloy includes, by weight: about 12% chromium, about 0.1% carbon, about 0.5% silicon, about 0.1% to about 0.5% manganese, above 0% to about 15% cobalt, above 0% to about 1% titanium, with the balance being iron. In certain embodiments, the improved alloy includes, by weight: about 12% chromium, about 0.1% carbon, about 0.5% silicon, about 0.1% to about 0.5% manganese, above 0% to about 15% cobalt, with the balance being iron. The addition of vanadium may allow for use of higher amounts of cobalt in the improved alloy.","Certain embodiments of temperature limited heaters may include more than one ferromagnetic material. Such embodiments are within the scope of embodiments described herein if any conditions described herein apply to at least one of the ferromagnetic materials in the temperature limited heater.","Ferromagnetic properties generally decay as the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range is approached. The \u201cHandbook of Electrical Heating for Industry\u201d by C. James Erickson (IEEE Press, 1995) shows a typical curve for 1% carbon steel (steel with 1% carbon by weight). The loss of magnetic permeability starts at temperatures above 650\u00b0 C. and tends to be complete when temperatures exceed 730\u00b0 C. Thus, the self-limiting temperature may be somewhat below the actual Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. The skin depth for current flow in 1% carbon steel is 0.132 cm at room temperature and increases to 0.445 cm at 720\u00b0 C. From 720\u00b0 C. to 730\u00b0 C., the skin depth sharply increases to over 2.5 cm. Thus, a temperature limited heater embodiment using 1% carbon steel begins to self-limit between 650\u00b0 C. and 730\u00b0 C.","Skin depth generally defines an effective penetration depth of time-varying current into the conductive material. In general, current density decreases exponentially with distance from an outer surface to the center along the radius of the conductor. The depth at which the current density is approximately 1\/e of the surface current density is called the skin depth. For a solid cylindrical rod with a diameter much greater than the penetration depth, or for hollow cylinders with a wall thickness exceeding the penetration depth, the skin depth, 6, is:\n\n\u03b4=1981.5*(\u03c1\/(\u03bc));\u2003\u2003(EQN. 3)\n\nin which:\n\n","Materials used in the temperature limited heater may be selected to provide a desired turndown ratio. Turndown ratios of at least 1.1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 10:1, 30:1, or 50:1 may be selected for temperature limited heaters. Larger turndown ratios may also be used. A selected turndown ratio may depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the type of formation in which the temperature limited heater is located (for example, a higher turndown ratio may be used for an oil shale formation with large variations in thermal conductivity between rich and lean oil shale layers) and\/or a temperature limit of materials used in the wellbore (for example, temperature limits of heater materials). In some embodiments, the turndown ratio is increased by coupling additional copper or another good electrical conductor to the ferromagnetic material (for example, adding copper to lower the resistance above the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range).","The temperature limited heater may provide a maximum heat output (power output) below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the heater. In certain embodiments, the maximum heat output is at least 400 W\/m (Watts per meter), 600 W\/m, 700 W\/m, 800 W\/m, or higher up to 2000 W\/m. The temperature limited heater reduces the amount of heat output by a section of the heater when the temperature of the section of the heater approaches or is above the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. The reduced amount of heat may be substantially less than the heat output below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. In some embodiments, the reduced amount of heat is at most 400 W\/m, 200 W\/m, 100 W\/m or may approach 0 W\/m.","In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater operates substantially independently of the thermal load on the heater in a certain operating temperature range. \u201cThermal load\u201d is the rate that heat is transferred from a heating system to its surroundings. It is to be understood that the thermal load may vary with temperature of the surroundings and\/or the thermal conductivity of the surroundings. In an embodiment, the temperature limited heater operates at or above the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the temperature limited heater such that the operating temperature of the heater increases at most by 3\u00b0 C., 2\u00b0 C., 1.5\u00b0 C., 1\u00b0 C., or 0.5\u00b0 C. for a decrease in thermal load of 1 W\/m proximate to a portion of the heater. In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater operates in such a manner at a relatively constant current.","The AC or modulated DC resistance and\/or the heat output of the temperature limited heater may decrease as the temperature approaches the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range and decrease sharply near or above the Curie temperature due to the Curie effect and\/or phase transformation effect. In certain embodiments, the value of the electrical resistance or heat output above or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range is at most one-half of the value of electrical resistance or heat output at a certain point below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. In some embodiments, the heat output above or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range is at most 90%, 70%, 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%, or less (down to 1%) of the heat output at a certain point below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range (for example, 30\u00b0 C. below the Curie temperature, 40\u00b0 C. below the Curie temperature, 50\u00b0 C. below the Curie temperature, or 100\u00b0 C. below the Curie temperature). In certain embodiments, the electrical resistance above or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range decreases to 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, or less (down to 1%) of the electrical resistance at a certain point below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range (for example, 30\u00b0 C. below the Curie temperature, 40\u00b0 C. below the Curie temperature, 50\u00b0 C. below the Curie temperature, or 100\u00b0 C. below the Curie temperature).","In some embodiments, AC frequency is adjusted to change the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material. For example, the skin depth of 1% carbon steel at room temperature is 0.132 cm at 60 Hz, 0.0762 cm at 180 Hz, and 0.046 cm at 440 Hz. Since heater diameter is typically larger than twice the skin depth, using a higher frequency (and thus a heater with a smaller diameter) reduces heater costs. For a fixed geometry, the higher frequency results in a higher turndown ratio. The turndown ratio at a higher frequency is calculated by multiplying the turndown ratio at a lower frequency by the square root of the higher frequency divided by the lower frequency. In some embodiments, a frequency between 100 Hz and 1000 Hz, between 140 Hz and 200 Hz, or between 400 Hz and 600 Hz is used (for example, 180 Hz, 540 Hz, or 720 Hz). In some embodiments, high frequencies may be used. The frequencies may be greater than 1000 Hz.","To maintain a substantially constant skin depth until the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the temperature limited heater is reached, the heater may be operated at a lower frequency when the heater is cold and operated at a higher frequency when the heater is hot. Line frequency heating is generally favorable, however, because there is less need for expensive components such as power supplies, transformers, or current modulators that alter frequency. Line frequency is the frequency of a general supply of current. Line frequency is typically 60 Hz, but may be 50 Hz or another frequency depending on the source for the supply of the current. Higher frequencies may be produced using commercially available equipment such as solid state variable frequency power supplies. Transformers that convert three-phase power to single-phase power with three times the frequency are commercially available. For example, high voltage three-phase power at 60 Hz may be transformed to single-phase power at 180 Hz and at a lower voltage. Such transformers are less expensive and more energy efficient than solid state variable frequency power supplies. In certain embodiments, transformers that convert three-phase power to single-phase power are used to increase the frequency of power supplied to the temperature limited heater.","In certain embodiments, modulated DC (for example, chopped DC, waveform modulated DC, or cycled DC) may be used for providing electrical power to the temperature limited heater. A DC modulator or DC chopper may be coupled to a DC power supply to provide an output of modulated direct current. In some embodiments, the DC power supply may include means for modulating DC. One example of a DC modulator is a DC-to-DC converter system. DC-to-DC converter systems are generally known in the art. DC is typically modulated or chopped into a desired waveform. Waveforms for DC modulation include, but are not limited to, square-wave, sinusoidal, deformed sinusoidal, deformed square-wave, triangular, and other regular or irregular waveforms.","The modulated DC waveform generally defines the frequency of the modulated DC. Thus, the modulated DC waveform may be selected to provide a desired modulated DC frequency. The shape and\/or the rate of modulation (such as the rate of chopping) of the modulated DC waveform may be varied to vary the modulated DC frequency. DC may be modulated at frequencies that are higher than generally available AC frequencies. For example, modulated DC may be provided at frequencies of at least 1000 Hz. Increasing the frequency of supplied current to higher values advantageously increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater.","In certain embodiments, the modulated DC waveform is adjusted or altered to vary the modulated DC frequency. The DC modulator may be able to adjust or alter the modulated DC waveform at any time during use of the temperature limited heater and at high currents or voltages. Thus, modulated DC provided to the temperature limited heater is not limited to a single frequency or even a small set of frequency values. Waveform selection using the DC modulator typically allows for a wide range of modulated DC frequencies and for discrete control of the modulated DC frequency. Thus, the modulated DC frequency is more easily set at a distinct value whereas AC frequency is generally limited to multiples of the line frequency. Discrete control of the modulated DC frequency allows for more selective control over the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. Being able to selectively control the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater allows for a broader range of materials to be used in designing and constructing the temperature limited heater.","In some embodiments, the modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency is adjusted to compensate for changes in properties (for example, subsurface conditions such as temperature or pressure) of the temperature limited heater during use. The modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency provided to the temperature limited heater is varied based on assessed downhole conditions. For example, as the temperature of the temperature limited heater in the wellbore increases, it may be advantageous to increase the frequency of the current provided to the heater, thus increasing the turndown ratio of the heater. In an embodiment, the downhole temperature of the temperature limited heater in the wellbore is assessed.","In certain embodiments, the modulated DC frequency, or the AC frequency, is varied to adjust the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. The turndown ratio may be adjusted to compensate for hot spots occurring along a length of the temperature limited heater. For example, the turndown ratio is increased because the temperature limited heater is getting too hot in certain locations. In some embodiments, the modulated DC frequency, or the AC frequency, are varied to adjust a turndown ratio without assessing a subsurface condition.","At or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic material, a relatively small change in voltage may cause a relatively large change in current to the load. The relatively small change in voltage may produce problems in the power supplied to the temperature limited heater, especially at or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. The problems include, but are not limited to, reducing the power factor, tripping a circuit breaker, and\/or blowing a fuse. In some cases, voltage changes may be caused by a change in the load of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments, an electrical current supply (for example, a supply of modulated DC or AC) provides a relatively constant amount of current that does not substantially vary with changes in load of the temperature limited heater. In an embodiment, the electrical current supply provides an amount of electrical current that remains within 15%, within 10%, within 5%, or within 2% of a selected constant current value when a load of the temperature limited heater changes.","Temperature limited heaters may generate an inductive load. The inductive load is due to some applied electrical current being used by the ferromagnetic material to generate a magnetic field in addition to generating a resistive heat output. As downhole temperature changes in the temperature limited heater, the inductive load of the heater changes due to changes in the ferromagnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials in the heater with temperature. The inductive load of the temperature limited heater may cause a phase shift between the current and the voltage applied to the heater.","A reduction in actual power applied to the temperature limited heater may be caused by a time lag in the current waveform (for example, the current has a phase shift relative to the voltage due to an inductive load) and\/or by distortions in the current waveform (for example, distortions in the current waveform caused by introduced harmonics due to a non-linear load). Thus, it may take more current to apply a selected amount of power due to phase shifting or waveform distortion. The ratio of actual power applied and the apparent power that would have been transmitted if the same current were in phase and undistorted is the power factor. The power factor is always less than or equal to 1. The power factor is 1 when there is no phase shift or distortion in the waveform.","Actual power applied to a heater due to a phase shift may be described by EQN. 4:\n\n\u00d7cos(\u03b8);\u2003\u2003(EQN. 4)\n\nin which P is the actual power applied to a heater; I is the applied current; V is the applied voltage; and \u03b8 is the phase angle difference between voltage and current. Other phenomena such as waveform distortion may contribute to further lowering of the power factor. If there is no distortion in the waveform, then cos(\u03b8) is equal to the power factor.\n","In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater includes an inner conductor inside an outer conductor. The inner conductor and the outer conductor are radially disposed about a central axis. The inner and outer conductors may be separated by an insulation layer. In certain embodiments, the inner and outer conductors are coupled at the bottom of the temperature limited heater. Electrical current may flow into the temperature limited heater through the inner conductor and return through the outer conductor. One or both conductors may include ferromagnetic material.","The insulation layer may comprise an electrically insulating ceramic with high thermal conductivity, such as magnesium oxide, aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, beryllium oxide, boron nitride, silicon nitride, or combinations thereof. The insulating layer may be a compacted powder (for example, compacted ceramic powder). Compaction may improve thermal conductivity and provide better insulation resistance. For lower temperature applications, polymer insulation made from, for example, fluoropolymers, polyimides, polyamides, and\/or polyethylenes, may be used. In some embodiments, the polymer insulation is made of perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) or polyetheretherketone (PEEK\u2122 (Victrex Ltd, England)). The insulating layer may be chosen to be substantially infrared transparent to aid heat transfer from the inner conductor to the outer conductor. In an embodiment, the insulating layer is transparent quartz sand. The insulation layer may be air or a non-reactive gas such as helium, nitrogen, or sulfur hexafluoride. If the insulation layer is air or a non-reactive gas, there may be insulating spacers designed to inhibit electrical contact between the inner conductor and the outer conductor. The insulating spacers may be made of, for example, high purity aluminum oxide or another thermally conducting, electrically insulating material such as silicon nitride. The insulating spacers may be a fibrous ceramic material such as Nextel\u2122 312 (3M Corporation, St. Paul, Minn., U.S.A.), mica tape, or glass fiber. Ceramic material may be made of alumina, alumina-silicate, alumina-borosilicate, silicon nitride, boron nitride, or other materials.","The insulation layer may be flexible and\/or substantially deformation tolerant. For example, if the insulation layer is a solid or compacted material that substantially fills the space between the inner and outer conductors, the temperature limited heater may be flexible and\/or substantially deformation tolerant. Forces on the outer conductor can be transmitted through the insulation layer to the solid inner conductor, which may resist crushing. Such a temperature limited heater may be bent, dog-legged, and spiraled without causing the outer conductor and the inner conductor to electrically short to each other. Deformation tolerance may be important if the wellbore is likely to undergo substantial deformation during heating of the formation.","In certain embodiments, an outermost layer of the temperature limited heater (for example, the outer conductor) is chosen for corrosion resistance, yield strength, and\/or creep resistance. In one embodiment, austenitic (non-ferromagnetic) stainless steels such as 201, 304H, 347H, 347HH, 316H, 310H, 347HP, NF709 (Nippon Steel Corp., Japan) stainless steels, or combinations thereof may be used in the outer conductor. The outermost layer may also include a clad conductor. For example, a corrosion resistant alloy such as 800H or 347H stainless steel may be clad for corrosion protection over a ferromagnetic carbon steel tubular. If high temperature strength is not required, the outermost layer may be constructed from ferromagnetic metal with good corrosion resistance such as one of the ferritic stainless steels. In one embodiment, a ferritic alloy of 82.3% by weight iron with 17.7% by weight chromium (Curie temperature of 678\u00b0 C.) provides desired corrosion resistance.","The Metals Handbook, vol. 8, page 291 (American Society of Materials (ASM)) includes a graph of Curie temperature of iron-chromium alloys versus the amount of chromium in the alloys. In some temperature limited heater embodiments, a separate support rod or tubular (made from 347H stainless steel) is coupled to the temperature limited heater made from an iron-chromium alloy to provide yield strength and\/or creep resistance. In certain embodiments, the support material and\/or the ferromagnetic material is selected to provide a 100,000 hour creep-rupture strength of at least 20.7 MPa at 650\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the 100,000 hour creep-rupture strength is at least 13.8 MPa at 650\u00b0 C. or at least 6.9 MPa at 650\u00b0 C. For example, 347H steel has a favorable creep-rupture strength at or above 650\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the 100,000 hour creep-rupture strength ranges from 6.9 MPa to 41.3 MPa or more for longer heaters and\/or higher earth or fluid stresses.","In temperature limited heater embodiments with both an inner ferromagnetic conductor and an outer ferromagnetic conductor, the skin effect current path occurs on the outside of the inner conductor and on the inside of the outer conductor. Thus, the outside of the outer conductor may be clad with the corrosion resistant alloy, such as stainless steel, without affecting the skin effect current path on the inside of the outer conductor.","A ferromagnetic conductor with a thickness of at least the skin depth at the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range allows a substantial decrease in resistance of the ferromagnetic material as the skin depth increases sharply near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. In certain embodiments when the ferromagnetic conductor is not clad with a highly conducting material such as copper, the thickness of the conductor may be 1.5 times the skin depth near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range, 3 times the skin depth near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range, or even 10 or more times the skin depth near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. If the ferromagnetic conductor is clad with copper, thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor may be substantially the same as the skin depth near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic conductor clad with copper has a thickness of at least three-fourths of the skin depth near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range.","In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater includes a composite conductor with a ferromagnetic tubular and a non-ferromagnetic, high electrical conductivity core. The non-ferromagnetic, high electrical conductivity core reduces a required diameter of the conductor. For example, the conductor may be composite 1.19 cm diameter conductor with a core of 0.575 cm diameter copper clad with a 0.298 cm thickness of ferritic stainless steel or carbon steel surrounding the core. The core or non-ferromagnetic conductor may be copper or copper alloy. The core or non-ferromagnetic conductor may also be made of other metals that exhibit low electrical resistivity and relative magnetic permeabilities near 1 (for example, substantially non-ferromagnetic materials such as aluminum and aluminum alloys, phosphor bronze, beryllium copper, and\/or brass). A composite conductor allows the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater to decrease more steeply near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. As the skin depth increases near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range to include the copper core, the electrical resistance decreases very sharply.","The composite conductor may increase the conductivity of the temperature limited heater and\/or allow the heater to operate at lower voltages. In an embodiment, the composite conductor exhibits a relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile at temperatures below a region near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor of the composite conductor. In some embodiments, the temperature limited heater exhibits a relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile between 100\u00b0 C. and 750\u00b0 C. or between 300\u00b0 C. and 600\u00b0 C. The relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile may also be exhibited in other temperature ranges by adjusting, for example, materials and\/or the configuration of materials in the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments, the relative thickness of each material in the composite conductor is selected to produce a desired resistivity versus temperature profile for the temperature limited heater.","In certain embodiments, the relative thickness of each material in a composite conductor is selected to produce a desired resistivity versus temperature profile for a temperature limited heater. In an embodiment, the composite conductor is an inner conductor surrounded by 0.127 cm thick magnesium oxide powder as an insulator. The outer conductor may be 304H stainless steel with a wall thickness of 0.127 cm. The outside diameter of the heater may be about 1.65 cm.","A composite conductor (for example, a composite inner conductor or a composite outer conductor) may be manufactured by methods including, but not limited to, coextrusion, roll forming, tight fit tubing (for example, cooling the inner member and heating the outer member, then inserting the inner member in the outer member, followed by a drawing operation and\/or allowing the system to cool), explosive or electromagnetic cladding, arc overlay welding, longitudinal strip welding, plasma powder welding, billet coextrusion, electroplating, drawing, sputtering, plasma deposition, coextrusion casting, magnetic forming, molten cylinder casting (of inner core material inside the outer or vice versa), insertion followed by welding or high temperature braising, shielded active gas welding (SAG), and\/or insertion of an inner pipe in an outer pipe followed by mechanical expansion of the inner pipe by hydroforming or use of a pig to expand and swage the inner pipe against the outer pipe. In some embodiments, a ferromagnetic conductor is braided over a non-ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments, composite conductors are formed using methods similar to those used for cladding (for example, cladding copper to steel). A metallurgical bond between copper cladding and base ferromagnetic material may be advantageous. Composite conductors produced by a coextrusion process that forms a good metallurgical bond (for example, a good bond between copper and 446 stainless steel) may be provided by Anomet Products, Inc. (Shrewsbury, Mass., U.S.A.).","In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to form a composite conductor by various methods including longitudinal strip welding. In some embodiments, however, it may be difficult to use longitudinal strip welding techniques if the desired thickness of a layer of a first material has such a large thickness, in relation to the inner core\/layer onto which such layer is to be bended, that it does not effectively and\/or efficiently bend around an inner core or layer that is made of a second material. In such circumstances, it may be beneficial to use multiple thinner layers of the first material in the longitudinal strip welding process such that the multiple thinner layers can more readily be employed in a longitudinal strip welding process and coupled together to form a composite of the first material with the desired thickness. So, for example, a first layer of the first material may be bent around an inner core or layer of second material, and then a second layer of the first material may be bent around the first layer of the first material, with the thicknesses of the first and second layers being such that the first and second layers will readily bend around the inner core or layer in a longitudinal strip welding process. Thus, the two layers of the first material may together form the total desired thickness of the first material.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0882","num":"0885"},"figref":"FIGS. 53-74"},"The temperature limited heaters may be used in conductor-in-conduit heaters.

These non-linear functions may cause strong inductive effects and distortion that lead to decreased power factor in the temperature limited heater at temperatures below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. These effects may render the electrical power supply to the temperature limited heater difficult to control and may result in additional current flow through surface and\/or overburden power supply conductors. Expensive and\/or difficult to implement control systems such as variable capacitors or modulated power supplies may be used to compensate for these effects and to control temperature limited heaters where the majority of the resistive heat output is provided by current flow through the ferromagnetic material.","In certain temperature limited heater embodiments, the ferromagnetic conductor confines a majority of the flow of electrical current to an electrical conductor coupled to the ferromagnetic conductor when the temperature limited heater is below or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. The electrical conductor may be a sheath, jacket, support member, corrosion resistant member, or other electrically resistive member. In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic conductor confines a majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor positioned between an outermost layer and the ferromagnetic conductor. The ferromagnetic conductor is located in the cross section of the temperature limited heater such that the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor at or below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor confine the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor. The majority of the flow of electrical current is confined to the electrical conductor due to the skin effect of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus, the majority of the current is flowing through material with substantially linear resistive properties throughout most of the operating range of the heater.","In certain embodiments, the ferromagnetic conductor and the electrical conductor are located in the cross section of the temperature limited heater so that the skin effect of the ferromagnetic material limits the penetration depth of electrical current in the electrical conductor and the ferromagnetic conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus, the electrical conductor provides a majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments, the dimensions of the electrical conductor may be chosen to provide desired heat output characteristics.","Because the majority of the current flows through the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range, the temperature limited heater has a resistance versus temperature profile that at least partially reflects the resistance versus temperature profile of the material in the electrical conductor. Thus, the resistance versus temperature profile of the temperature limited heater is substantially linear below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor if the material in the electrical conductor has a substantially linear resistance versus temperature profile. For example, the temperature limited heater in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range may have a resistance versus temperature profile similar to the profile shown in . The resistance of the temperature limited heater has little or no dependence on the current flowing through the heater until the temperature nears the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. The majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range.","Resistance versus temperature profiles for temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor also tend to exhibit sharper reductions in resistance near or at the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. For example, the reduction in resistance shown in  is sharper than the reduction in resistance shown in . The sharper reductions in resistance near or at the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range are easier to control than more gradual resistance reductions near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range because little current is flowing through the ferromagnetic material.","In certain embodiments, the material and\/or the dimensions of the material in the electrical conductor are selected so that the temperature limited heater has a desired resistance versus temperature profile below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor.","Temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range are easier to predict and\/or control. Behavior of temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range may be predicted by, for example, the resistance versus temperature profile and\/or the power factor versus temperature profile. Resistance versus temperature profiles and\/or power factor versus temperature profiles may be assessed or predicted by, for example, experimental measurements that assess the behavior of the temperature limited heater, analytical equations that assess or predict the behavior of the temperature limited heater, and\/or simulations that assess or predict the behavior of the temperature limited heater.","In certain embodiments, assessed or predicted behavior of the temperature limited heater is used to control the temperature limited heater. The temperature limited heater may be controlled based on measurements (assessments) of the resistance and\/or the power factor during operation of the heater. In some embodiments, the power, or current, supplied to the temperature limited heater is controlled based on assessment of the resistance and\/or the power factor of the heater during operation of the heater and the comparison of this assessment versus the predicted behavior of the heater. In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater is controlled without measurement of the temperature of the heater or a temperature near the heater. Controlling the temperature limited heater without temperature measurement eliminates operating costs associated with downhole temperature measurement. Controlling the temperature limited heater based on assessment of the resistance and\/or the power factor of the heater also reduces the time for making adjustments in the power or current supplied to the heater compared to controlling the heater based on measured temperature.","As the temperature of the temperature limited heater approaches or exceeds the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor, reduction in the ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor allows electrical current to flow through a greater portion of the electrically conducting cross section of the temperature limited heater. Thus, the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater is reduced and the temperature limited heater automatically provides reduced heat output at or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments, a highly electrically conductive member is coupled to the ferromagnetic conductor and the electrical conductor to reduce the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater at or above the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. The highly electrically conductive member may be an inner conductor, a core, or another conductive member of copper, aluminum, nickel, or alloys thereof.","The ferromagnetic conductor that confines the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range may have a relatively small cross section compared to the ferromagnetic conductor in temperature limited heaters that use the ferromagnetic conductor to provide the majority of resistive heat output up to or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. A temperature limited heater that uses the electrical conductor to provide a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range has low magnetic inductance at temperatures below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range because less current is flowing through the ferromagnetic conductor as compared to the temperature limited heater where the majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range is provided by the ferromagnetic material. Magnetic field (H) at radius (r) of the ferromagnetic conductor is proportional to the current (I) flowing through the ferromagnetic conductor and the core divided by the radius, or:\n\n\u2003\u2003(EQN. 5)\n\nSince only a portion of the current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor for a temperature limited heater that uses the outer conductor to provide a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range, the magnetic field of the temperature limited heater may be significantly smaller than the magnetic field of the temperature limited heater where the majority of the current flows through the ferromagnetic material. The relative magnetic permeability (\u03bc) may be large for small magnetic fields.\n","The skin depth (\u03b4) of the ferromagnetic conductor is inversely proportional to the square root of the relative magnetic permeability (\u03bc):\n\n\u03b4\u221d(1\/\u03bc).\u2003\u2003(EQN. 6)\n\nIncreasing the relative magnetic permeability decreases the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor. However, because only a portion of the current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor for temperatures below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range, the radius (or thickness) of the ferromagnetic conductor may be decreased for ferromagnetic materials with large relative magnetic permeabilities to compensate for the decreased skin depth while still allowing the skin effect to limit the penetration depth of the electrical current to the electrical conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. The radius (thickness) of the ferromagnetic conductor may be between 0.3 mm and 8 mm, between 0.3 mm and 2 mm, or between 2 mm and 4 mm depending on the relative magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic conductor. Decreasing the thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor decreases costs of manufacturing the temperature limited heater, as the cost of ferromagnetic material tends to be a significant portion of the cost of the temperature limited heater. Increasing the relative magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic conductor provides a higher turndown ratio and a sharper decrease in electrical resistance for the temperature limited heater at or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor.\n","Ferromagnetic materials (such as purified iron or iron-cobalt alloys) with high relative magnetic permeabilities (for example, at least 200, at least 1000, at least 1\u00d710, or at least 1\u00d710) and\/or high Curie temperatures (for example, at least 600\u00b0 C., at least 700\u00b0 C., or at least 800\u00b0 C.) tend to have less corrosion resistance and\/or less mechanical strength at high temperatures. The electrical conductor may provide corrosion resistance and\/or high mechanical strength at high temperatures for the temperature limited heater. Thus, the ferromagnetic conductor may be chosen primarily for its ferromagnetic properties.","Confining the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor reduces variations in the power factor. Because only a portion of the electrical current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range, the non-linear ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor have little or no effect on the power factor of the temperature limited heater, except at or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. Even at or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range, the effect on the power factor is reduced compared to temperature limited heaters in which the ferromagnetic conductor provides a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. Thus, there is less or no need for external compensation (for example, variable capacitors or waveform modification) to adjust for changes in the inductive load of the temperature limited heater to maintain a relatively high power factor.","In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater, which confines the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor, maintains the power factor above 0.85, above 0.9, or above 0.95 during use of the heater. Any reduction in the power factor occurs only in sections of the temperature limited heater at temperatures near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. Most sections of the temperature limited heater are typically not at or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range during use. These sections have a high power factor that approaches 1.0. The power factor for the entire temperature limited heater is maintained above 0.85, above 0.9, or above 0.95 during use of the heater even if some sections of the heater have power factors below 0.85.","Maintaining high power factors allows for less expensive power supplies and\/or control devices such as solid state power supplies or SCRs (silicon controlled rectifiers). These devices may fail to operate properly if the power factor varies by too large an amount because of inductive loads. With the power factors maintained at high values; however, these devices may be used to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Solid state power supplies have the advantage of allowing fine tuning and controlled adjustment of the power supplied to the temperature limited heater.","In some embodiments, transformers are used to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Multiple voltage taps may be made into the transformer to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Multiple voltage taps allow the current supplied to switch back and forth between the multiple voltages. This maintains the current within a range bound by the multiple voltage taps.","The highly electrically conductive member, or inner conductor, increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments, thickness of the highly electrically conductive member is increased to increase the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In some embodiments, the thickness of the electrical conductor is reduced to increase the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments, the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater is between 1.1 and 10, between 2 and 8, or between 3 and 6 (for example, the turndown ratio is at least 1.1, at least 2, or at least 3).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0925","num":"0928"},"figref":"FIG. 71","b":["542","542","542","542","546","572","542","572","548","546","546","546","546"],"sub":"2"},"In certain embodiments, electrical conductor  provides support for ferromagnetic conductor  and the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments, electrical conductor  is a material that is corrosion resistant and provides electrically resistive heat output below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of ferromagnetic conductor . For example, electrical conductor  is 825 stainless steel or 347H stainless steel. In some embodiments, electrical conductor  has a small thickness (for example, on the order of 0.5 mm).","In , core  is highly electrically conductive material such as copper or aluminum.

Inner conductor  is highly electrically conductive material such as copper or aluminum.","In some embodiments, a relatively thin conductive layer is used to provide the majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. Such a temperature limited heater may be used as the heating member in an insulated conductor heater. The heating member of the insulated conductor heater may be located inside a sheath with an insulation layer between the sheath and the heating member.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0935","num":"0938"},"figref":"FIGS. 74A and 74B","b":["574","542","546","532","534","540","542","546"]},"Inner conductor  is a relatively thin conductive layer of non-ferromagnetic material with a higher electrical conductivity than ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments, inner conductor  is copper. Inner conductor  may be a copper alloy. Copper alloys typically have a flatter resistance versus temperature profile than pure copper. A flatter resistance versus temperature profile may provide less variation in the heat output as a function of temperature up to the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range. In some embodiments, inner conductor  is copper with 6% by weight nickel (for example, CuNi6 or LOHM\u2122). In some embodiments, inner conductor  is CuNi10Fe1Mn alloy. Below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of ferromagnetic conductor , the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor confine the majority of the flow of electrical current to inner conductor . Thus, inner conductor  provides the majority of the resistive heat output of insulated conductor  below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range.","In certain embodiments, inner conductor  is dimensioned, along with core  and ferromagnetic conductor , so that the inner conductor provides a desired amount of heat output and a desired turndown ratio. For example, inner conductor  may have a cross-sectional area that is around 2 or 3 times less than the cross-sectional area of core . Typically, inner conductor  has to have a relatively small cross-sectional area to provide a desired heat output if the inner conductor is copper or copper alloy. In an embodiment with copper inner conductor , core  has a diameter of 0.66 cm, ferromagnetic conductor  has an outside diameter of 0.91 cm, inner conductor  has an outside diameter of 1.03 cm, electrical insulator  has an outside diameter of 1.53 cm, and jacket  has an outside diameter of 1.79 cm. In an embodiment with a CuNi6 inner conductor , core  has a diameter of 0.66 cm, ferromagnetic conductor  has an outside diameter of 0.91 cm, inner conductor  has an outside diameter of 1.12 cm, electrical insulator  has an outside diameter of 1.63 cm, and jacket  has an outside diameter of 1.88 cm. Such insulated conductors are typically smaller and cheaper to manufacture than insulated conductors that do not use the thin inner conductor to provide the majority of heat output below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range.","Electrical insulator  may be magnesium oxide, aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, beryllium oxide, boron nitride, silicon nitride, or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, electrical insulator  is a compacted powder of magnesium oxide. In some embodiments, electrical insulator  includes beads of silicon nitride.","In certain embodiments, a small layer of material is placed between electrical insulator  and inner conductor  to inhibit copper from migrating into the electrical insulator at higher temperatures. For example, a small layer of nickel (for example, about 0.5 mm of nickel) may be placed between electrical insulator  and inner conductor .","Jacket  is made of a corrosion resistant material such as, but not limited to, 347 stainless steel, 347H stainless steel, 446 stainless steel, or 825 stainless steel. In some embodiments, jacket  provides some mechanical strength for insulated conductor  at or above the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments, jacket  is not used to conduct electrical current.","For long vertical temperature limited heaters (for example, heaters at least 300 m, at least 500 m, or at least 1 km in length), the hanging stress becomes important in the selection of materials for the temperature limited heater. Without the proper selection of material, the support member may not have sufficient mechanical strength (for example, creep-rupture strength) to support the weight of the temperature limited heater at the operating temperatures of the heater.","In certain embodiments, materials for the support member are varied to increase the maximum allowable hanging stress at operating temperatures of the temperature limited heater and, thus, increase the maximum operating temperature of the temperature limited heater. Altering the materials of the support member affects the heat output of the temperature limited heater below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range because changing the materials changes the resistance versus temperature profile of the support member. In certain embodiments, the support member is made of more than one material along the length of the heater so that the temperature limited heater maintains desired operating properties (for example, resistance versus temperature profile below the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range) as much as possible while providing sufficient mechanical properties to support the heater. In some embodiments, transition sections are used between sections of the heater to provide strength that compensates for the difference in temperature between sections of the heater. In certain embodiments, one or more portions of the temperature limited heater have varying outside diameters and\/or materials to provide desired properties for the heater.","In certain embodiments of temperature limited heaters, three temperature limited heaters are coupled together in a three-phase wye configuration. Coupling three temperature limited heaters together in the three-phase wye configuration lowers the current in each of the individual temperature limited heaters because the current is split between the three individual heaters. Lowering the current in each individual temperature limited heater allows each heater to have a small diameter. The lower currents allow for higher relative magnetic permeabilities in each of the individual temperature limited heaters and, thus, higher turndown ratios. In addition, there may be no return current path needed for each of the individual temperature limited heaters. Thus, the turndown ratio remains higher for each of the individual temperature limited heaters than if each temperature limited heater had its own return current path.","In the three-phase wye configuration, individual temperature limited heaters may be coupled together by shorting the sheaths, jackets, or canisters of each of the individual temperature limited heaters to the electrically conductive sections (the conductors providing heat) at their terminating ends (for example, the ends of the heaters at the bottom of a heater wellbore). In some embodiments, the sheaths, jackets, canisters, and\/or electrically conductive sections are coupled to a support member that supports the temperature limited heaters in the wellbore.","In certain embodiments, coupling multiple heaters (for example, mineral insulated conductor heaters) to a single power source, such as a transformer, is advantageous. Coupling multiple heaters to a single transformer may result in using fewer transformers to power heaters used for a treatment area as compared to using individual transformers for each heater. Using fewer transformers reduces surface congestion and allows easier access to the heaters and surface components. Using fewer transformers reduces capital costs associated with providing power to the treatment area. In some embodiments, at least 4, at least 5, at least 10, at least 25 heaters, at least 35 heaters, or at least 45 heaters are powered by a single transformer. Additionally, powering multiple heaters (in different heater wells) from the single transformer may reduce overburden losses because of reduced voltage and\/or phase differences between each of the heater wells powered by the single transformer. Powering multiple heaters from the single transformer may inhibit current imbalances between the heaters because the heaters are coupled to the single transformer.","To provide power to multiple heaters using the single transformer, the transformer may have to provide power at higher voltages to carry the current to each of the heaters effectively. In certain embodiments, the heaters are floating (ungrounded) heaters in the formation. Floating the heaters allows the heaters to operate at higher voltages. In some embodiments, the transformer provides power output of at least about 3 kV, at least about 4 kV, at least about 5 kV, or at least about 6 kV.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0947","num":"0950"},"figref":"FIG. 75","b":["438","574","570","438","570","574","574","542","534","540","574","542","534","540","540"]},"In some embodiments, core  and\/or jacket  include ferromagnetic materials.

In some embodiments, electrical insulator \u2032 inside conduit  has at least the thickness of electrical insulators  in insulated conductors .

The single assembly may be built in long lengths and may operate at high voltages (for example, voltages of 4000 V nominal). In certain embodiments, the individual insulated conductor heaters are enclosed in corrosive resistant jackets to resist damage from the external environment. The jackets may be, for example, seam welded stainless steel armor similar to that used on type MC\/CWCMC cable.","In some embodiments, three insulated conductor heaters are cabled and the insulating filler added in conventional methods known in the art. The insulated conductor heaters may include one or more heater sections that resistively heat and provide heat to formation adjacent to the heater sections. The insulated conductors may include one or more other sections that provide electricity to the heater sections with relatively small heat loss. The individual insulated conductor heaters may be wrapped with high temperature fiber tapes before being placed on a take-up reel (for example, a coiled tubing rig). The reel assembly may be moved to another machine for application of an outer metallic sheath or outer protective conduit.","In some embodiments, the fillers include glass, ceramic or other temperature resistant fibers that withstand operating temperature of 760\u00b0 C. or higher. In addition, the insulated conductor cables may be wrapped in multiple layers of a ceramic fiber woven tape material. By wrapping the tape around the cabled insulated conductor heaters prior to application of the outer metallic sheath, electrical isolation is provided between the insulated conductor heaters and the outer sheath. This electrical isolation inhibits leakage current from the insulated conductor heaters passing into the subsurface formation and forces any leakage currents to return directly to the power source on the individual insulated conductor sheaths and\/or on a lead-in conductor or lead-out conductor coupled to the insulated conductors. The lead-in or lead-out conductors may be coupled to the insulated conductors when the insulated conductors are placed into an assembly with the outer metallic sheath.","In certain embodiments, the insulated conductor heaters are wrapped with a metallic tape or other type of tape instead of the high temperature ceramic fiber woven tape material. The metallic tape holds the insulated conductor heaters together. A widely-spaced wide pitch spiral wrapping of a high temperature fiber rope may be wrapped around the insulated conductor heaters. The fiber rope may provide electrical isolation between the insulated conductors and the outer sheath. The fiber rope may be added at any stage during assembly. For example, the fiber rope may be added as a part of the final assembly when the outer sheath is added. Application of the fiber rope may be simpler than other electrical isolation methods because application of the fiber rope is done with only a single layer of rope instead of multiple layers of ceramic tape. The fiber rope may be less expensive than multiple layers of ceramic tape. The fiber rope may increase heat transfer between the insulated conductors and the outer sheath and\/or reduce interference with any welding process used to weld the outer sheath around the insulated conductors (for example, seam welding).","In certain embodiments, an insulated conductor or another type of heater is installed in a wellbore or opening in the formation using outer tubing coupled to a coiled tubing rig.  depicts outer tubing  partially unspooled from coiled tubing rig .

For example, flexible cups  may have flexible edges that provide limited mechanical resistance as heater  is pushed into outer tubing  but remain in contact with the inner walls of outer tubing  as the heater is pushed so that pressure is maintained between the heater and the outer tubing. Maintaining at least some pressure in outer tubing  between flexible cups  allows heater  to be continuously pushed into the outer tubing with lower pump pressures. Without flexible cups , higher pressures may be needed to push heater  into outer tubing .

Molten metals may be highly thermal conductive, but may block radiant heat transfer from the insulated conductor and\/or have relatively small heat transfer by natural convection.","Material  may be or include molten salts such as solar salt, salts presented in Table 1, or other salts. The molten salts may be infrared transparent to aid in heat transfer from the insulated conductor to the canister. In some embodiments, solar salt includes sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate (for example, about 60% by weight sodium nitrate and about 40% by weight potassium nitrate). Solar salt melts at about 220\u00b0 C. and is chemically stable up to temperatures of about 593\u00b0 C.

Some molten salts may have good thermal conductivity, may have high heat density, and may result in large heat transfer by natural convection.","In fluid mechanics, the Rayleigh number is a dimensionless number associated with heat transfer in a fluid. When the Rayleigh number is below the critical value for the fluid, heat transfer is primarily in the form of conduction; and when the Rayleigh number is above the critical value, heat transfer is primarily in the form of convection. The Rayleigh number is the product of the Grashof number (which describes the relationship between buoyancy and viscosity in a fluid) and the Prandtl number (which describes the relationship between momentum diffusivity and thermal diffusivity). For the same size insulated conductors in conduits, and where the temperature of the conduit is 500\u00b0 C., the Rayleigh number for solar salt in the conduit is about 10 times the Rayleigh number for tin in the conduit. The higher Rayleigh number implies that the strength of natural convection in the molten solar salt is much stronger than the strength of the natural convection in molten tin. The stronger natural convection of molten salt may distribute heat and inhibit the formation of hot spots at locations along the length of the conduit. Hot spots may be caused by coke build up at isolated locations adjacent to or on the conduit, contact of the conduit by the formation at isolated locations, and\/or other high thermal load situations.","Conduit  may be a carbon steel or stainless steel canister. In some embodiments, conduit  may include cladding on the outer surface to inhibit corrosion of the conduit by formation fluid. Conduit  may include cladding on an inner surface of the conduit that is corrosion resistant to material  in the conduit. Cladding applied to conduit  may be a coating and\/or a liner. If the conduit contains a metal salt, the inner surface of the conduit may include coating of nickel, or the conduit may be or include a liner of a corrosion resistant metal such as Alloy N. If the conduit contains a molten metal, the conduit may include a corrosion resistant metal liner or coating, and\/or a ceramic coating (for example, a porcelain coating or fired enamel coating). In an embodiment, conduit  is a canister of 410 stainless steel with an outside diameter of about 6 cm. Conduit  may not need a thick wall because material  may provide internal pressure that inhibits deformation or crushing of the conduit due to external stresses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0998","num":"1001"},"figref":"FIG. 95","b":["742","524","574","552","590","552","590","552","552"]},"In some embodiments, two or more insulated conductors are placed in the conduit. In some embodiments, only one of the insulated conductors is energized. Should the energized conductor fail, one of the other conductors may be energized to maintain the material in a molten phase.

The ribbed conduit may improve the heat transfer characteristics of the conduit as compared to a cylindrical conduit.  depicts a cross-sectional representation of ribbed conduit .  depicts a perspective view of a portion of ribbed conduit . Ribbed conduit  may include rings  and ribs . Rings  and ribs  may improve the heat transfer characteristics of ribbed conduit . In an embodiment, the cylinder of conduit has an inner diameter of about 5.1 cm and a wall thickness of about 0.57 cm. Rings  may be spaced about every 3.8 cm. Rings  may have a height of about 1.9 cm and a thickness of about 0.5 cm. Six ribs  may be spaced evenly about conduit . Ribs  may have a thickness of about 0.5 cm and a height of about 1.6 cm. Other dimensions for the cylinder, rings and ribs may be used. Ribbed conduit  may be formed from two or more rolled pieces that are welded together to form the ribbed conduit. Other types of conduit with extra surface area to enhance heat transfer from the conduit to the formation may be used.","In some embodiments, the ribbed conduit may be used as the conduit of a conductor-in-conduit heater. For example, the conductor may be a 3.05 cm 410 stainless steel rod and the conduit has dimensions as described above. In other embodiments, the conductor is an insulated conductor and a fluid is positioned between the conductor and the ribbed conduit. The fluid may be a gas or liquid at operating temperatures of the insulated conductor.","In some embodiments, the heat source for the heater is not an insulated conductor. For example, the heat source may be hot fluid circulated through an inner conduit positioned in an outer conduit. The material may be positioned between the inner conduit and the outer conduit. Convection currents in the material may help to more evenly distribute heat to the formation and may inhibit or limit formation of a hot spot where insulation that limits heat transfer to the overburden ends. In some embodiments, the heat sources are downhole oxidizers. The material is placed between an outer conduit and an oxidizer conduit. The oxidizer conduit may be an exhaust conduit for the oxidizers or the oxidant conduit if the oxidizers are positioned in a u-shaped wellbore with exhaust gases exiting the formation through one of the legs of the u-shaped conduit. The material may help inhibit the formation of hot spots adjacent to the oxidizers of the oxidizer assembly.","The material to be heated by the insulated conductor may be placed in an open wellbore.  depicts material  in open wellbore  in formation  with insulated conductor  in the wellbore. In some embodiments, a gas (for example, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and\/or helium) is placed in wellbore  above material . The gas may inhibit oxidation or other chemical changes of material . The gas may inhibit vaporization of material .","Material  may have a melting point that is above the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. The melting point of material  may be above 375\u00b0 C., above 400\u00b0 C., or above 425\u00b0 C. The insulated conductor may be energized to heat the formation. Heat from the insulated conductor may pyrolyze hydrocarbons in the formation. Adjacent the wellbore, the heat from insulated conductor  may result in coking that reduces the permeability and plugs the formation near wellbore . The plugged formation inhibits material  from leaking from wellbore  into formation  when the material is a liquid. In some embodiments, material  is a salt.","In some embodiments, material  leaking from wellbore  into formation  may be self-healing and\/or self-sealing. Material  flowing away from wellbore  may travel until the temperature becomes less than the solidification temperature of the material. Temperature may drop rapidly a relatively small distance away from the heater used to maintain material  in a liquid state. The rapid drop off in temperature may result in migrating material  solidifying close to wellbore . Solidified material  may inhibit migration of additional material from wellbore , and thus self-heal and\/or self-seal the wellbore.","Return electrical current for insulated conductor  may return through jacket  of the insulated conductor. Any current that passes through material  may pass to ground. Above the level of material , any remaining return electrical current may be confined to jacket  of insulated conductor .","Using liquid material in open wellbores heated by heaters may allow for delivery of high power rates (for example, up to about 2000 W\/m) to the formation with relatively low heater surface temperatures. Hot spot generation in the formation may be reduced or eliminated due to convection smoothing out the temperature profile along the length of the heater. Natural convection occurring in the wellbore may greatly enhance heat transfer from the heater to the formation. Also, the large gap between the formation and the heater may prevent thermal expansion of the formation from harming the heater.","In some embodiments, an 8\u2033 (20.3 cm) wellbore may be formed in the formation. In some embodiments, casing may be placed through all or a portion of the overburden. A 0.6 inch (1.5 cm) diameter insulated conductor heater may be placed in the wellbore. The wellbore may be filled with solid material (for example, solid particles of salt). A packer may be placed near an interface between the treatment area and the overburden. In some embodiments, a pass through conduit in the packer may be included to allow for the addition of more material to the treatment area. A non-reactive or substantially non-reactive gas (for example, carbon dioxide and\/or nitrogen) may be introduced into the wellbore. The insulated conductor may be energized to begin the heating that melts the solid material and heats the treatment area.","In some embodiments, other types of heat sources besides for insulated conductors are used to heat the material placed in the open wellbore. The other types of heat sources may include gas burners, pipes through which hot heat transfer fluid flows, or other types of heaters.","In some embodiments, heat pipes are placed in the formation. The heat pipes may reduce the number of active heat sources needed to heat a treatment area of a given size. The heat pipes may reduce the time needed to heat the treatment area of a given size to a desired average temperature. A heat pipe is a closed system that utilizes phase change of fluid in the heat pipe to transport heat applied to a first region to a second region remote from the first region. The phase change of the fluid allows for large heat transfer rates. Heat may be applied to the first region of the heat pipes from any type of heat source, including but not limited to, electric heaters, oxidizers, heat provided from geothermal sources, and\/or heat provided from nuclear reactors.","Heat pipes are passive heat transport systems that include no moving parts. Heat pipes may be positioned in near horizontal to vertical configurations.

Varying the ferromagnetic materials of the temperature limited heater allows for lower temperature heating. In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic conductor is made of material with a lower Curie temperature than that of 446 stainless steel. For example, the ferromagnetic conductor may be an alloy of iron and nickel. The alloy may have between 30% by weight and 42% by weight nickel with the rest being iron. In one embodiment, the alloy is Invar 36. Invar 36 is 36% by weight nickel in iron and has a Curie temperature of 277\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, an alloy is a three component alloy with, for example, chromium, nickel, and iron. For example, an alloy may have 6% by weight chromium, 42% by weight nickel, and 52% by weight iron. A 2.5 cm diameter rod of Invar 36 has a turndown ratio of approximately 2 to 1 at the Curie temperature. Placing the Invar 36 alloy over a copper core may allow for a smaller rod diameter. A copper core may result in a high turndown ratio. The insulator in lower temperature heater embodiments may be made of a high performance polymer insulator (such as PFA or PEEK\u2122) when used with alloys with a Curie temperature that is below the melting point or softening point of the polymer insulator.","In certain embodiments, a conductor-in-conduit temperature limited heater is used in lower temperature applications by using lower Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range ferromagnetic materials. For example, a lower Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range ferromagnetic material may be used for heating inside sucker pump rods. Heating sucker pump rods may be useful to lower the viscosity of fluids in the sucker pump or rod and\/or to maintain a lower viscosity of fluids in the sucker pump rod. Lowering the viscosity of the oil may inhibit sticking of a pump used to pump the fluids. Fluids in the sucker pump rod may be heated up to temperatures less than about 250\u00b0 C. or less than about 300\u00b0 C. Temperatures need to be maintained below these values to inhibit coking of hydrocarbon fluids in the sucker pump system.","In certain embodiments, a temperature limited heater includes a flexible cable (for example, a furnace cable) as the inner conductor. For example, the inner conductor may be a 27% nickel-clad or stainless steel-clad stranded copper wire with four layers of mica tape surrounded by a layer of ceramic and\/or mineral fiber (for example, alumina fiber, aluminosilicate fiber, borosilicate fiber, or aluminoborosilicate fiber). A stainless steel-clad stranded copper wire furnace cable may be available from Anomet Products, Inc. The inner conductor may be rated for applications at temperatures of 1000\u00b0 C. or higher.

The conduit may be covered with a layer of copper, or other electrical conductor, with a thickness of about 0.3 cm or any other suitable thickness. The assembly may be placed inside a support conduit (for example, a 1\u00bc\u2033 Schedule 80 347H or 347HH stainless steel tubular). The support conduit may provide additional creep-rupture strength and protection for the copper and the inner conductor. For uses at temperatures greater than about 1000\u00b0 C., the inner copper conductor may be plated with a more corrosion resistant alloy (for example, Incoloy\u00ae 825) to inhibit oxidation.

High temperature porcelain enamels may include silicon dioxide, boron oxide, alumina, and alkaline earth oxides (CaO or MgO), and minor amounts of alkali oxides (NaO, KO, LiO). The enamel coating may be applied as a finely ground slurry by dipping the heating element into the slurry or spray coating the heating element with the slurry. The coated heating element is then heated in a furnace until the glass transition temperature is reached so that the slurry spreads over the surface of the heating element and makes the porcelain enamel coating. The porcelain enamel coating contracts when cooled below the glass transition temperature so that the coating is in compression. Thus, when the coating is heated during operation of the heater, the coating is able to expand with the heater without cracking.","The thin electrically insulating layer has low thermal impedance allowing heat transfer from the heating element to the formation while inhibiting current leakage between heating elements in adjacent openings and\/or current leakage into the formation.

HDPEs with working temperatures in a range for use in overburden  include HDPEs available from Dow Chemical Co., Inc. (Midland, Mich., U.S.A.). A non-metallic casing may also eliminate the need for an insulated overburden conductor. In some embodiments, casings  include carbon steel coupled on the inside diameter of a non-ferromagnetic metal (for example, carbon steel clad with copper or aluminum) to inhibit ferromagnetic effects or inductive effects in the carbon steel. Other non-ferromagnetic metals include, but are not limited to, manganese steels with at least 10% by weight manganese, iron aluminum alloys with at least 18% by weight aluminum, and austentitic stainless steels such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel.","In certain embodiments, one or more non-ferromagnetic materials used in casings  are used in a wellhead coupled to the casings and legs , , .

Legs A, B, C are arranged such that a phase leg (for example, leg A) in a given triad is about two triad heights from a same phase leg (leg A) in an adjacent triad. The triad height is the distance from a vertex of the triad to a midpoint of the line intersecting the other two vertices of the triad. In certain embodiments, the phases of triads  are arranged to inhibit net current flow between individual triads. There may be some leakage of current within an individual triad but little net current flows between two triads due to the substantial electrical isolation of the triads and, in certain embodiments, the arrangement of the triad phases.","In the early stages of heating, an exposed heating element (for example, heating element  depicted in ) may leak some current to water or other fluids that are electrically conductive in the formation so that the formation itself is heated. After water or other electrically conductive fluids are removed from the wellbore (for example, vaporized or produced), the heating elements become electrically isolated from the formation. Later, when water is removed from the formation, the formation becomes even more electrically resistant and heating of the formation occurs even more predominantly via thermally conductive and\/or radiative heating. Typically, the formation (the hydrocarbon layer) has an initial electrical resistance that averages at least 10 ohm m. In some embodiments, the formation has an initial electrical resistance of at least 100 ohm\u00b7m or of at least 300 ohm m.","Using the temperature limited heaters as the heating elements limits the effect of water saturation on heater efficiency. With water in the formation and in heater wellbores, there is a tendency for electrical current to flow between heater elements at the top of the hydrocarbon layer where the voltage is highest and cause uneven heating in the hydrocarbon layer. This effect is inhibited with temperature limited heaters because the temperature limited heaters reduce localized overheating in the heating elements and in the hydrocarbon layer.","In certain embodiments, production wells are placed at a location at which there is relatively little or zero voltage potential.

Current leakage from the heaters into the formation electrically heats the formation directly. The formation is heated by direct electrical heating in addition to conductive heat provided by the heaters.

In some embodiments, the formation has an initial electrical resistance of at least 100 ohm\u00b7m or of at least 300 ohm\u00b7m. Direct electrical heating is achieved by having opposite potentials applied to adjacent heaters in the hydrocarbon layer. Current may be allowed to leak into the formation until a selected temperature is reached in the heaters or in the formation. The selected temperature may be below or near the temperature that water proximate one or more heaters boils off. After water boils off, the hydrocarbon layer is substantially electrically isolated from the heaters and direct heating of the formation is inefficient. After the selected temperature is reached, the voltage potential is applied in the opposite polarity and substantially equal magnitude manner described above for  so that adjacent heaters will have the same voltage potential along their lengths.","Current is allowed to leak into the formation by reversing the polarity of one or more heaters shown in  so that a first group of heaters has a positive voltage potential at first location  and a second group of heaters has a negative voltage potential at the first location.

The first end portions, at first location , of the second group of heaters (for example, heaters C, F, , L) are applied with a negative voltage potential that is substantially equal in magnitude to the positive voltage potential applied to the first end portions of the first group of heaters. Similarly, the second end portions, at second location , of the second group of heaters are applied with a positive voltage potential substantially equal in magnitude to the negative potential applied to the second end portions of the first group of heaters.

In some embodiments, the thin electrically insulating layer is aluminum oxide or thermal spray coated aluminum oxide. In some embodiments, the thin electrically insulating layer is an enamel coating of a ceramic composition. The thin electrically insulating layer may inhibit heating elements of a three-phase heater from leaking current between the elements, from leaking current into the formation, and from leaking current to other heaters in the formation. Thus, the three-phase heater may have a longer heater length.","In certain embodiments, a plurality of substantially horizontal (or inclined) heaters are coupled to a single substantially horizontal bus bar in the subsurface formation. Having the plurality of substantially horizontal heaters connected to a single bus bar in the subsurface reduces the overall footprint of heaters on the surface of the formation and the number of wells drilled in the formation. In addition, the amount of subsurface space used to couple the heaters may be minimized so that more of the formation is treated with heat to recover hydrocarbons (for example, there is less unheated depth in the formation).

Drilling from both sides towards the middle of hydrocarbon layer  allows longer openings to be formed in the hydrocarbon layer. Thus, longer heaters may be installed in hydrocarbon layer . For example, heaters A, B, C may have lengths of at least about 1500 m, at least about 3000 m, or at least about 4500 m.","Having multiple long, substantially horizontal or inclined heaters extending from only two wellbores in hydrocarbon layer  reduces the footprint of wells on the surface needed for heating the formation. The number of overburden wellbores that need to be drilled in the formation is reduced, which reduces capital costs per heater in the formation. Heating the formation with long, substantially horizontal or inclined heaters also reduces overall heat losses in overburden  when heating the formation because of the reduced number of overburden sections used to treat the formation (for example, losses in overburden  are a smaller fraction of total power supplied to the formation).","In some embodiments, heaters A, B, C are installed in wellbores A, B and openings A, B, C by pulling the heaters through the wellbores and the openings from one end to the other. For example, an installation tool may be pushed through the openings and coupled to a heater in wellbore A.

The heaters may each be coupled to one phase of transformer . Using three-phase power to power the heaters may be more efficient than using single-phase power. Using three-phase connections for the heaters allows the magnetic fields of the heaters in wellbore A to cancel each other. The cancelled magnetic fields may allow overburden casing A to be ferromagnetic (for example, carbon steel). Using ferromagnetic casings in the wellbores may be less expensive and\/or easier to install than non-ferromagnetic casings (such as fiberglass casings).","In some embodiments, the overburden section of heaters A, B, C are coated with an insulator, such as a polymer or an enamel coating, to inhibit shorting between the overburden sections of the heaters.

For example, heaters A, B, C may have varying dimensions (for example, thicknesses or diameters) along the lengths of the heater. The varying thicknesses may provide different electrical resistances along the length of the heater and, thus, different heat outputs along the length of the heaters.","In some embodiments, heaters A, B, C are divided into two or more sections of heating. In some embodiments, the heaters are divided into repeating sections of different heat outputs (for example, alternating sections of two different heat outputs that are repeated). In some embodiments, the repeating sections of different heat outputs may be used to heat the formation in stages. In one embodiment, the halves of the heaters closest to wellbore A may provide heat in a first section of hydrocarbon layer  and the halves of the heaters closest to wellbore B may provide heat in a second section of hydrocarbon layer . Hydrocarbons in the formation may be mobilized by the heat provided in the first section. Hydrocarbons in the second section may be heated to higher temperatures than the first section to upgrade the hydrocarbons in the second section (for example, the hydrocarbons may be further mobilized and\/or pyrolyzed).

For example, a drive fluid may be provided through wellbore A to move the first section mobilized hydrocarbons to the second section.","In some embodiments, more than three heaters extend from wellbore A and\/or B. If multiples of three heaters extend from the wellbores and are coupled to transformer , the magnetic fields may cancel in the overburden sections of the wellbores as in the case of three heaters in the wellbores.

Heaters A, B, C and heaters D, E, F may be coupled to a single, three-phase transformer so that magnetic fields are cancelled in wellbore A.","In some embodiments, heaters A, B, C may have different heat outputs from heaters D, E, F so that hydrocarbon layer  is divided into two heating sections with different heating rates and\/or temperatures (for example, a mobilization and a pyrolyzation section). In some embodiments, heaters A, B, C and\/or heaters D, E, F may have heat outputs that vary along the lengths of the heaters to further divide hydrocarbon layer  into more heating sections.

For example, tubular  may hang, drape, or otherwise touch electrical conductor . In some embodiments, electrical conductor  includes electrical insulation (for example, magnesium oxide or porcelain enamel) that insulates the current carrying portion of the electrical conductor from tubular . The electrical insulation inhibits current from flowing between the current carrying portion of electrical conductor  and tubular  if the electrical conductor and the tubular are in physical contact with each other.","In some embodiments, electrical conductor  is an exposed metal conductor heater or a conductor-in-conduit heater. In certain embodiments, electrical conductor  is an insulated conductor such as a mineral insulated conductor. The insulated conductor may have a copper core, copper alloy core, or a similar electrically conductive, low resistance core that has low electrical losses. In some embodiments, the core is a copper core with a diameter between about 0.5\u2033 (1.27 cm) and about 1\u2033 (2.54 cm). The sheath or jacket of the insulated conductor may be a non-ferromagnetic, corrosion resistant steel such as 347 stainless steel, 625 stainless steel, 825 stainless steel, 304 stainless steel, or copper with a protective layer (for example, a protective cladding). The sheath may have an outer diameter of between about 1\u2033 (2.54 cm) and about 1.25\u2033 (3.18 cm).","In some embodiments, the sheath or jacket of the insulated conductor is in physical contact with the tubular  (for example, the tubular is in physical contact with the sheath along the length of the tubular) or the sheath is electrically connected to the tubular. In such embodiments, the electrical insulation of the insulated conductor electrically insulates the core of the insulated conductor from the jacket and the tubular.  depicts an embodiment of an induction heater with the sheath of an insulated conductor in electrical contact with tubular . Electrical conductor  is the insulated conductor. The sheath of the insulated conductor is electrically connected to tubular  using electrical contactors . In some embodiments, electrical contactors  are sliding contactors. In certain embodiments, electrical contactors  electrically connect the sheath of the insulated conductor to tubular  at or near the ends of the tubular. Electrically connecting at or near the ends of tubular  substantially equalizes the voltage along the tubular with the voltage along the sheath of the insulated conductor. Equalizing the voltages along tubular  and along the sheath may inhibit arcing between the tubular and the sheath.","Tubular , such as the tubular shown in , , and , may be ferromagnetic or include ferromagnetic materials. Tubular  may have a thickness such that when electrical conductor  induces electrical current flow on the surfaces of tubular  when the electrical conductor is energized with time-varying current. The electrical conductor induces electrical current flow due to the ferromagnetic properties of the tubular. Current flow is induced on both the inside surface of the tubular and the outside surface of tubular . Tubular  may operate as a skin effect heater when current flow is induced in the skin depth of one or more of the tubular surfaces. In certain embodiments, the induced current circulates axially (longitudinally) on the inside and\/or outside surfaces of tubular . Longitudinal flow of current through electrical conductor  induces primarily longitudinal current flow in tubular  (the majority of the induced current flow is in the longitudinal direction in the tubular). Having primarily longitudinal induced current flow in tubular  may provide a higher resistance per foot than if the induced current flow is primarily angular current flow.","In certain embodiments, current flow in tubular  is induced with low frequency current in electrical conductor  (for example, from 50 Hz or 60 Hz up to about 1000 Hz). In some embodiments, induced currents on the inside and outside surfaces of tubular  are substantially equal.","In certain embodiments, tubular  has a thickness that is greater than the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material in the tubular at or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material or at or near the phase transformation temperature of the ferromagnetic material. For example, tubular  may have a thickness of at least 2.1, at least 2.5 times, at least 3 times, or at least 4 times the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material in the tubular near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature of the ferromagnetic material. In certain embodiments, tubular  has a thickness of at least 2.1 times, at least 2.5 times, at least 3 times, or at least 4 times the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material in the tubular at about 50\u00b0 C. below the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature of the ferromagnetic material.","In certain embodiments, tubular  is carbon steel. In some embodiments, tubular  is coated with a corrosion resistant coating (for example, porcelain or ceramic coating) and\/or an electrically insulating coating. In some embodiments, electrical conductor  has an electrically insulating coating. Examples of the electrically insulating coating on tubular  and\/or electrical conductor  include, but are not limited to, a porcelain enamel coating, an alumina coating, or an alumina-titania coating.","In some embodiments, tubular  and\/or electrical conductor  are coated with a coating such as polyethylene or another suitable low friction coefficient coating that may melt or decompose when the heater is energized. The coating may facilitate placement of the tubular and\/or the electrical conductor in the formation.","In some embodiments, tubular  includes corrosion resistant ferromagnetic material such as, but not limited to, 410 stainless steel, 446 stainless steel, T\/P91 stainless steel, T\/P92 stainless steel, alloy 52, alloy 42, and Invar 36. In some embodiments, tubular  is a stainless steel tubular with cobalt added (for example, between about 3% by weight and about 10% by weight cobalt added) and\/or molybdenum (for example, about 0.5% molybdenum by weight).","At or near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature of the ferromagnetic material in tubular , the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material decreases rapidly. When the magnetic permeability of tubular  decreases at or near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature, there is little or no current flow in the tubular because, at these temperatures, the tubular is essentially non-ferromagnetic and electrical conductor  is unable to induce current flow in the tubular. With little or no current flow in tubular , the temperature of the tubular will drop to lower temperatures until the magnetic permeability increases and the tubular becomes ferromagnetic. Thus, tubular  self-limits at or near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature and operates as a temperature limited heater due to the ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic material in the tubular. Because current is induced in tubular , the turndown ratio may be higher and the drop in current sharper for the tubular than for temperature limited heaters that apply current directly to the ferromagnetic material. For example, heaters with current induced in tubular  may have turndown ratios of at least about 5, at least about 10, or at least about 20 while temperature limited heaters that apply current directly to the ferromagnetic material may have turndown ratios that are at most about 5.","When current is induced in tubular , the tubular provides heat to hydrocarbon layer  and defines the heating zone in the hydrocarbon layer. In certain embodiments, tubular  heats to temperatures of at least about 300\u00b0 C., at least about 500\u00b0 C., or at least about 700\u00b0 C. Because current is induced on both the inside and outside surfaces of tubular , the heat generation of the tubular is increased as compared to temperature limited heaters that have current directly applied to the ferromagnetic material and current flow is limited to one surface. Thus, less current may be provided to electrical conductor  to generate the same heat as heaters that apply current directly to the ferromagnetic material. Using less current in electrical conductor  decreases power consumption and reduces power losses in the overburden of the formation.","In certain embodiments, tubulars  have large diameters. The large diameters may be used to equalize or substantially equalize high pressures on the tubular from either the inside or the outside of the tubular. In some embodiments, tubular  has a diameter in a range between about 1.5\u2033 (about 3.8 cm) and about 6\u2033 (about 15.2 cm). In some embodiments, tubular  has a diameter in a range between about 3 cm and about 13 cm, between about 4 cm and about 12 cm, or between about 5 cm and about 11 cm. Increasing the diameter of tubular  may provide more heat output to the formation by increasing the heat transfer surface area of the tubular.","In certain embodiments, tubular  has surfaces that are shaped to increase the resistance of the tubular.  depicts an embodiment of a heater with tubular  having radial grooved surfaces. Heater  may include electrical conductors A,B coupled to tubular . Electrical conductors A,B may be insulated conductors. Electrical contactors may electrically and physically couple electrical conductors A,B to tubular . In certain embodiments, the electrical contactors are attached to ends of electrical conductors A,B. The electrical contactors have a shape such that when the ends of electrical conductors A,B are pushed into the ends of tubular , the electrical contactors physically and electrically couple the electrical conductors to the tubular. For example, the electrical contactors may be cone shaped. Heater  generates heat when current is applied directly to tubular . Current is provided to tubular  using electrical conductors A,B. Grooves  may increase the heat transfer surface area of tubular .","In some embodiments, one or more surfaces of the tubular of an induction heater may be textured to increase the resistance of the heater and increase the heat transfer surface area of the tubular.  depicts heater  that is an induction heater. Electrical conductor  extends through tubular .","Tubular  may include grooves . In some embodiments, grooves  are cut in tubular . In some embodiments, fins are coupled to tubular to form ridges and grooves . The fins may be welded or otherwise attached to the tubular. In an embodiment, the fins are coupled to a tubular sheath that is placed over the tubular. The sheath is physically and electrically coupled to the tubular to form tubular .","In certain embodiments, grooves  are on the outer surface of tubular . In some embodiments, the grooves are on the inner surface of the tubular. In some embodiments, the grooves are on both the inner and outer surfaces of the tubular.","In certain embodiments, grooves  are radial grooves (grooves that wrap around the circumference of tubular ). In certain embodiments, grooves  are straight, angled, or spiral grooves or protrusions. In some embodiments, grooves  are evenly spaced grooves along the surface of tubular . In some embodiments, grooves  are part of a threaded surface on tubular  (the grooves are formed as a winding thread on the surface). Grooves  may have a variety of shapes as desired. For example, grooves  may have square edges, rectangular edges, v-shaped edges, u-shaped edges, or have rounded edges.","Grooves  increase the effective resistance of tubular  by increasing the path length of induced current on the surface of the tubular. Grooves  increase the effective resistance of tubular  as compared to a tubular with the same inside and outside diameters with smooth surfaces. Because induced current travels axially, the induced current has to travel up and down the grooves along the surface of the tubular. Thus, the depth of grooves  may be varied to provide a selected resistance in tubular . For example, increasing the grooves depth increases the path length and the resistance.","Increasing the resistance of tubular  with grooves  increases the heat generation of the tubular as compared to a tubular with smooth surfaces. Thus, the same electrical current in electrical conductor  will provide more heat output in the radial grooved surface tubular than the smooth surface tubular. Therefore, to provide the same heat output with the radial grooved surface tubular as the smooth surface tubular, less current is needed in electrical conductor  with the radial grooved surface tubular.","In some embodiments, grooves  are filled with materials that decompose at lower temperatures to protect the grooves during installation of tubular . For example, grooves  may be filled with polyethylene or asphalt. The polyethylene or asphalt may melt and\/or desorb when heater  reaches normal operating temperatures of the heater.","It is to be understood that grooves  may be used in other embodiments of tubulars  described herein to increase the resistance of such tubulars.

Hydrocarbons in the first section may be mobilized by the heat provided by the first portion of the heater. Hydrocarbons in the second section may be heated by the second portion of the heater to a higher temperature than the first section. The higher temperature in the second section may upgrade hydrocarbons in the second section relative to the first section. For example, the hydrocarbons may be mobilized, visbroken, and\/or pyrolyzed in the second section. Hydrocarbons from the first section may be moved into the second section by, for example, a drive fluid provided to the first section. As another example, heater  may have end sections that provide higher heat outputs to counteract heat losses at the ends of the heater to maintain a more constant temperature in the heated portion of the formation.","In certain embodiments, three, or multiples of three, electrical conductors enter and exit the formation through common wellbores with tubulars surrounding the electrical conductors in the portion of the formation to be heated.  depicts an embodiment of three electrical conductors A,B,C entering the formation through first common wellbore A and exiting the formation through second common wellbore C with three tubulars A,B,C surrounding the electrical conductors in hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments, electrical conductors A,B,C are powered by a single, three-phase wye transformer. Tubulars A,B,C and portions of electrical conductors A,B,C may be in three separate wellbores in hydrocarbon layer . The three separate wellbores may be formed by drilling the wellbores from first common wellbore A to second common wellbore B, vice versa, or drilling from both common wellbores and connecting the drilled openings in the hydrocarbon layer.","Having multiple induction heaters extending from only two wellbores in hydrocarbon layer  reduces the footprint of wells on the surface needed for heating the formation. The number of overburden wellbores drilled in the formation is reduced, which reduces capital costs per heater in the formation. Power losses in the overburden may be a smaller fraction of total power supplied to the formation because of the reduced number of wells through the overburden used to treat the formation. In addition, power losses in the overburden may be smaller because the three phases in the common wellbores substantially cancel each other and inhibit induced currents in the casings or other structures of the wellbores.","In some embodiments, three, or multiples of three, electrical conductors and tubulars are located in separate wellbores in the formation.  depicts an embodiment of three electrical conductors A,B,C and three tubulars A,B,C in separate wellbores in the formation. Electrical conductors A,B,C may be powered by single, three-phase wye transformer  with each electrical conductor coupled to one phase of the transformer. In some embodiments, the single, three-phase wye transformer is used to power , , , or other multiples of three electrical conductors. Connecting multiples of three electrical conductors to the single, three-phase wye transformer may reduce equipment costs for providing power to the induction heaters.","In some embodiments, two, or multiples of two, electrical conductors enter the formation from a first common wellbore and exit the formation from a second common wellbore with tubulars surrounding each electrical conductor in the hydrocarbon layer. The multiples of two electrical conductors may be powered by a single, two-phase transformer. In such embodiments, the electrical conductors may be homogenous electrical conductors (for example, insulated conductors using the same materials throughout) in the overburden sections and heating sections of the insulated conductor. The reverse flow of current in the overburden sections may reduce power losses in the overburden sections of the wellbores because the currents reduce or cancel inductive effects in the overburden sections.","In certain embodiments, tubulars  depicted in  include multiple layers of ferromagnetic materials separated by electrical insulators.  depicts an embodiment of a multilayered induction tubular. Tubular  includes ferromagnetic layers A,B,C separated by electrical insulators A,B. Three ferromagnetic layers and two layers of electrical insulators are shown in . Tubular  may include additional ferromagnetic layers and\/or electrical insulators as desired. For example, the number of layers may be chosen to provide a desired heat output from the tubular.","Ferromagnetic layers A,B,C are electrically insulated from electrical conductor  by, for example, an air gap. Ferromagnetic layers A,B,C are electrically insulated from each other by electrical insulator A and electrical insulator B. Thus, direct flow of current is inhibited between ferromagnetic layers A,B,C and electrical conductor . When current is applied to electrical conductor , electrical current flow is induced in ferromagnetic layers A,B,C because of the ferromagnetic properties of the layers. Having two or more electrically insulated ferromagnetic layers provides multiple current induction loops for the induced current. The multiple current induction loops may effectively appear as electrical loads in series to a power source for electrical conductor . The multiple current induction loops may increase the heat generation per unit length of tubular  as compared to a tubular with only one current induction loop. For the same heat output, the tubular with multiple layers may have a higher voltage and lower current as compared to the single layer tubular.","In certain embodiments, ferromagnetic layers A,B,C include the same ferromagnetic material.

In some embodiments, fluids are circulated through the tubulars to add heat to the formation. For example, fluids may be circulated through the tubulars to preheat the formation prior to energizing the tubulars (providing current to the heating system). In some embodiments, fluids are circulated through the tubulars to recover heat from the formation. The recovered heat may be used to provide heat to other portions of the formation and\/or surface processes used to treat fluids produced from the formation.

In certain embodiments, jacket  includes carbon steel or another ferromagnetic steel (for example, 410 stainless steel, 446 stainless steel, T\/P91 stainless steel, T\/P92 stainless steel, alloy 52, alloy 42, and Invar 36). In some embodiments, jacket  includes an outer layer of corrosion resistant material (for example, stainless steel such as 347H stainless steel or 304 stainless steel). The outer layer may be clad to the ferromagnetic material or otherwise coupled to the ferromagnetic material using methods known in the art.","In certain embodiments, jacket  has a thickness of at least about 2 skin depths of the ferromagnetic material in the jacket. In some embodiments, jacket  has a thickness of at least about 3 skin depths, at least about 4 skin depths, or at least about 5 skin depths. Increasing the thickness of jacket  may increase the heat output from insulated conductor .","In one embodiment, core  is copper with a diameter of about 0.5\u2033 (1.27 cm), electrical insulator  is magnesium oxide with a thickness of about 0.20\u2033 (0.5 cm) (the outside diameter is about 0.9\u2033 (2.3 cm)), and jacket  is carbon steel with an outside diameter of about 1.6\u2033 (4.1 cm) (the thickness is about 0.35\u2033 (0.88 cm)). A thin layer (about 0.1\u2033 (0.25 cm) thickness (outside diameter of about 1.7\u2033 (4.3 cm)) of corrosion resistant material 347H stainless steel may be clad on the outside of jacket .","In another embodiment, core  is copper with a diameter of about 0.338\u2033 (0.86 cm), electrical insulator  is magnesium oxide with a thickness of about 0.096\u2033 (0.24 cm) (the outside diameter is about 0.53\u2033 (1.3 cm)), and jacket  is carbon steel with an outside diameter of about 1.13\u2033 (2.9 cm) (the thickness is about 0.30\u2033 (0.76 cm)).

Core , electrical insulator , and the thin copper layer of jacket  may be obtained as a single piece of insulated conductor. Such insulated conductors may be obtained as long pieces of insulated conductors (for example, lengths of about 500\u2032 (about 150 m) or more). The carbon steel layer of jacket  may be added by drawing down the carbon steel over the long insulated conductor. Such an insulated conductor may only generate heat on the outside of jacket  as the thin copper layer in the jacket shorts to the inside surface of the jacket.","In some embodiments, jacket  is made of multiple layers of ferromagnetic material. The multiple layers may be the same ferromagnetic material or different ferromagnetic materials. For example, in one embodiment, jacket  is a 0.35\u2033 (0.88 cm) thick carbon steel jacket made from three layers of carbon steel. The first and second layers are 0.10\u2033 (0.25 cm) thick and the third layer is 0.15\u2033 (0.38 cm) thick.

Core  may be electrically coupled to a single power source with each end of the core being coupled to one pole of the power source. For example, insulated conductor  may be a u-shaped heater located in a u-shaped wellbore with each end of core  being coupled to one pole of the power source.","When core  is energized with time-varying current, the core induces electrical current flow on the surfaces of jacket  (as shown by the arrows in ) due to the ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic material in the jacket. In certain embodiments, current flow is induced on both the inside and outside surfaces of jacket . In these induction heater embodiments, jacket  operates as the heating element of insulated conductor .","At or near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature of the ferromagnetic material in jacket , the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material decreases rapidly. When the magnetic permeability of jacket  decreases at or near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature, there is little or no current flow in the jacket because, at these temperatures, the jacket is essentially non-ferromagnetic and core  is unable to induce current flow in the jacket. With little or no current flow in jacket , the temperature of the jacket will drop to lower temperatures until the magnetic permeability increases and the jacket becomes ferromagnetic. Thus, jacket  self-limits at or near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature and insulated conductor  operates as a temperature limited heater due to the ferromagnetic properties of the jacket. Because current is induced in jacket , the turndown ratio may be higher and the drop in current sharper for the jacket than if current is directly applied to the jacket.","In certain embodiments, portions of jacket  in the overburden of the formation do not include ferromagnetic material (for example, are non-ferromagnetic). Having the overburden portions of jacket  made of non-ferromagnetic material inhibits current induction in the overburden portions of the jackets.

The electrically insulating coating may inhibit the currents in one jacket from affecting current in the other jacket or vice versa (for example, current in one jacket cancelling out current in the other jacket). Electrically insulating the jackets from each other may inhibit the turndown ratio of the heater from being reduced by the interaction of induced currents in the jackets.","Because core A and core B are electrically coupled in series to a single transformer (transformer ), insulated conductor  may be located in a wellbore that terminates in the formation (for example, a wellbore with a single surface opening such as an L-shaped or J-shaped wellbore). Insulated conductor , as depicted in , may be operated as a subsurface termination induction heater with electrical connections between the heater and the power source (the transformer) being made through one surface opening.","Portions of jackets A,B in the overburden and\/or adjacent to portions of the formation that are not to be significantly heated (for example, thick shale breaks between two hydrocarbon layers) may be non-ferromagnetic to inhibit induction currents in such portions. The jacket may include one or more sections that are electrically insulating to restrict induced current flow to heater portions of the insulated conductor. Inhibiting induction currents in the overburden portion of the jackets inhibits inductive heating and\/or power losses in the overburden.

Increasing the surface area of casing  reduces the induced current in the casing for a given current flux. Power losses associated with inductive heating in casing  are reduced as compared to a casing with smooth surfaces because of the reduced induced current. Thus, the same electrical current will provide less heat output from inductive heating in the axial grooved surface casing than the smooth surface casing. Reducing the heat output in the overburden section of the heater will increase the efficiency of, and reduce the costs associated with, operating the heater.

Jacket  has a thickness at least 2 or 3 times the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material used in the jacket at 25\u00b0 C. and at the design current frequency so that most of the current is confined to the inside surface of the jacket and little or no current flows on the outside diameter of the jacket. Thus, there is little or no voltage potential on the outside of jacket . Having little or no voltage potential on the outside surface of insulated conductor  does not expose the formation to any high voltages, inhibits current leakage to the formation, and reduces or eliminates the need for isolation transformers, which decrease energy efficiency.","Because core  is made of a highly conductive material such as copper and jacket  is made of more resistive ferromagnetic material, a majority of the heat generated by insulated conductor  is generated in the jacket.

Using copper in core  allows the heating section of the heater and the overburden section to have identical core materials. Thus, the heater may be made from one long core assembly. The long single core assembly reduces or eliminates the need for welding joints in the core, which can be unreliable and susceptible to failure. Additionally, the long, single core assembly heater may be manufactured remote from the installation site and transported in a final assembly (ready to install assembly) to the installation site.

Some materials (such as polymers) may be extruded into a mold or reaction injection molded (RIM) into the shape of the wellhead. Forming the wellhead from a mold may be a less expensive method of making the wellhead and save in capital costs for providing wellheads to a treatment site. Using non-ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead may inhibit undesired heating of components in the wellhead. Ferromagnetic materials used in the wellhead may be electrically and\/or thermally insulated from other components of the wellhead. In some embodiments, an inert gas (for example, nitrogen or argon) is purged inside the wellhead and\/or inside of casings to inhibit reflux of heated gases into the wellhead and\/or the casings.","In some embodiments, ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead are electrically coupled to a non-ferromagnetic material (for example, copper) to inhibit skin effect heat generation in the ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead. The non-ferromagnetic material is in electrical contact with the ferromagnetic material so that current flows through the non-ferromagnetic material. In certain embodiments, as shown in , non-ferromagnetic material  is coupled (and electrically coupled) to the inside walls of conduit  and wellhead walls . In some embodiments, copper may be plasma sprayed, coated, clad, or lined on the inside and\/or outside walls of the wellhead. In some embodiments, a non-ferromagnetic material such as copper is welded, brazed, clad, or otherwise electrically coupled to the inside and\/or outside walls of the wellhead. For example, copper may be swaged out to line the inside walls in the wellhead. Copper may be liquid nitrogen cooled and then allowed to expand to contact and swage against the inside walls of the wellhead. In some embodiments, the copper is hydraulically expanded or explosively bonded to contact against the inside walls of the wellhead.","In some embodiments, two or more substantially horizontal wellbores are branched off of a first substantially vertical wellbore drilled downwards from a first location on a surface of the formation. The substantially horizontal wellbores may be substantially parallel through a hydrocarbon layer. The substantially horizontal wellbores may reconnect at a second substantially vertical wellbore drilled downwards at a second location on the surface of the formation. Having multiple wellbores branching off of a single substantially vertical wellbore drilled downwards from the surface reduces the number of openings made at the surface of the formation.","In certain embodiments, a horizontal heater, or a heater at an incline is installed in more than one part.  depicts an embodiment of heater  that has been installed in two parts. Heater  includes heating section A and lead-in section B. Heating section A may be located horizontally or at an incline in a hydrocarbon layer in the formation. Lead-in section B may be the overburden section or low resistance section of the heater (for example, the section of the heater with little or no electrical heat output).","During installation of heater , heating section A may be installed first into the formation. Heating section A may be installed by pushing the heating section into the opening in the formation using a drill pipe or other installation tool that pushes the heating section into the opening. After installation of heating section A, the installation tool may be removed from the opening in the formation. Installing only heating section A with the installation tool at this time may allow the heating section to be installed further into the formation than if the heating section and the lead-in section are installed together because a higher compressive strength may be applied to the heating section alone (for example, the installation tool only has to push in the horizontal or inclined direction).","In some embodiments, heating section A is coupled to mechanical connector . Connector  may be used to hold heating section A in the opening. In some embodiments, connector  includes copper or other electrically conductive materials so that the connector is used as an electrical connector (for example, as an electrical ground). In some embodiments, connector  is used to couple heating section A to a bus bar or electrical return rod located in an opening perpendicular to the opening of the heating section.","Lead-in section B may be installed after installation of heating section A. Lead-in section B may be installed with a drill pipe or other installation tool. In some embodiments, the installation tool may be the same tool used to install heating section A.","Lead-in section B may couple to heating section A as the lead-in section is installed into the opening. In certain embodiments, coupling joint  is used to couple lead-in section B to heating section A. Coupling joint  may be located on either lead-in section B or heating section A. In some embodiments, coupling joint  includes portions located on both sections. Coupling joint  may be a coupler such as, but not limited to, a wet connect or wet stab. In some embodiments, heating section A includes a catcher or other tool that guides an end of lead-in section B to form coupling joint .","In some embodiments, coupling joint  includes a container (for example, a can) located on heating section A that accepts the end of lead-in section B. Electrically conductive beads (for example, balls, spheres, or pebbles) may be located in the container. The beads may move around as the end of lead-in section B is pushed into the container to make electrical contact between the lead-in section and heating section A. The beads may be made of, for example, copper or aluminum. The beads may be coated or covered with a corrosion inhibitor such as nickel. In some embodiments, the beads are coated with a solder material that melts at lower temperatures (for example, below the boiling point of water in the formation). A high electrical current may be applied to the container to melt the solder. The melted solder may flow and fill void spaces in the container and be allowed to solidify before energizing the heater. In some embodiments, sacrificial beads are put in the container. The sacrificial beads may corrode first so that copper or aluminum beads in the container are less likely to be corroded during operation of the heater.","Power supplies are used to provide power to downhole power devices (downhole loads) such as, but not limited to, reservoir heaters, electric submersible pumps (ESPs), compressors, electric drills, electrical tools for construction and maintenance, diagnostic systems, sensors, or acoustic wave generators. Surface based power supplies may have long supply cabling (power cables) that contribute to problems such as voltage drops and electrical losses. Thus, it may be necessary to provide power to the downhole loads at high voltages to reduce electrical losses. However, many downhole loads are limited by an acceptable supply voltage level to the load. Therefore, an efficient high-voltage energy supply may not be viable without further conditioning. In such cases, a system for stepping down the voltage from the high voltage supply cable to the low voltage load may be necessary. The system may be a transformer.","The electrical power supply for downhole loads is typically provided using alternating current voltage (AC voltage) from supply grids of 50 Hz or 60 Hz frequency. The voltage of the supply grid may correspond to the voltage of the downhole load. High supply voltages may reduce loss and voltage drop in the supply cable and\/or allow the use of supply cables with relatively small cross sections. High supply voltages, however, may cause technical difficulties and require cost intensive isolation efforts at the load. Voltage drops, electrical losses, and supply cable cross section limits may limit the length of the supply cable and, thus, the wellbore depth or depth of the downhole load. Locating the transformer downhole may reduce the amount of cabling needed to provide power to the downhole loads and allow deeper wellbore depths and\/or downhole load depths while minimizing voltage drops and electrical losses in the power system.","Current technical solutions for offshore-applications make use of sea-bed mounted step-down transformers to reduce cable loss (for example, \u201cConverter-Fed Subsea Motor Drives\u201d, Raad, R. O.; Henriksen, T.; Raphael, H. B.; Hadler-Jacobsen, A.; Industry Applications, IEEE Transactions on Volume 32, Issue 5, September-October 1996 Page(s): 1069-1079, which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein). However, these sea-bed mounted transformers may not be useful to drive downhole loads under solid ground (for example, in a subsurface wellbore).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1230","num":"1233"},"figref":["FIGS. 169 and 170","FIG. 169","FIG. 170"],"b":["580","580","580","580","738","738","738","738"]},"Core  may include two half-shell core sections A and B around primary windings A and secondary windings B. In certain embodiments, core sections A and B are semicircular, symmetric shells. Core sections A and B may be single pieces that extend the full length of transformer  or the core sections may be assembled from multiple shell segments put together (for example, multiple pieces strung together to make the core sections). In certain embodiments, a core section is formed by putting together the section from two halves. The two halves of the core section may be put together after the windings, which may be pre-fabricated, are placed in the transformer.","In certain embodiments, core sections A and B have about the same cross section on the circumference of transformer  so that the core properly guides the magnetic flux in the transformer. Core sections A and B may be made of several layers of core material. Certain orientations of these layers may be designed to minimize eddy current losses in transformer . In some embodiments, core sections A and B are made of continuous ribbons and windings A and B are wound into the core sections.","Transformer  may have certain advantages over current transformer configurations (such as a toroid core design with the winding on the outside of the cores). Core sections A and B have outer surfaces that offer large surface areas for cooling transformer . Additionally, transformer  may be sealed so that a cooling liquid may be continuously run across the outer surfaces of the transformer to cool the transformer. Transformer  may be sealed so that cooling liquids do not directly contact the inside of the core and\/or the windings. In certain embodiments, transformer is sealed in an epoxy resin or other electrically insulating sealing material. Cooling transformer  allows the transformer to operate at higher power densities. In certain embodiments, windings A and B are substantially isolated from core sections A and B so that the outside surfaces of transformer  may touch the walls of a wellbore without causing electrical problems in the wellbore.","In some embodiments, the profile of the core of transformer  and\/or the winding window profile are made with clearances to allow for additional cooling devices, mechanical supports, and\/or electrical contacts on the transformer. In some embodiments, transformer  is coupled to one or more additional transformers in the subsurface wellbore to increase power in the wellbore and\/or phase options in the wellbore. Transformer  and\/or the phases of the transformer may be coupled to the additional transformers, and\/or the varying phases of the additional transformers, in either series or parallel configurations as needed to provide power to the downhole load.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1235","num":"1238"},"figref":"FIG. 171","b":["580","742","580","742","742","564","564","742","566","742","566","742"]},"Power lead  may be coupled to transformer  and pass through packing material  to provide power to the downhole load (for example, a downhole heater). In certain embodiments, cooling fluid  is located in wellbore . Transformer  may be immersed in cooling fluid . Cooling fluid  may cool transformer  by removing heat from the transformer and moving the heat away from the transformer. Cooling fluid  may be circulated in wellbore  to increase heat transfer between transformer  and the cooling fluid. In some embodiments, cooling fluid  is circulated to a chiller or other heat exchanger to remove heat from the cooling fluid and maintain a temperature of the cooling fluid at a selected temperature. Maintaining cooling fluid  at a selected temperature may provide efficient heat transfer between the cooling fluid and transformer  so that the transformer is maintained at a desired operating temperature.","In certain embodiments, cooling fluid  maintains a temperature of transformer  below a selected temperature. The selected temperature may be a maximum operating temperature of the transformer. In some embodiments, the selected temperature is a maximum temperature that allows for a selected operational efficiency of the transformer. In some embodiments, transformer  operates at an efficiency of at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 80%, or at least 70% when the transformer operates below the selected temperature.","In certain embodiments, cooling fluid  is water. In some embodiments, cooling fluid  is another heat transfer fluid such as, but not limited to, oil, ammonia, helium, or Freon\u00ae (E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, Del., U.S.A.). In some embodiments, the wellbore adjacent to the overburden functions as a heat pipe. Transformer  boils cooling fluid . Vaporized cooling fluid  rises in the wellbore, condenses, and flows back to transformer . Vaporization of cooling fluid  transfers heat to the cooling fluid and condensation of the cooling fluid allows heat to transfer to the overburden. Transformer  may operate near the vaporization temperature of cooling fluid .","In some embodiments, cooling fluid is circulated in a pipe that surrounds the transformer. The pipe may be in direct thermal contact with the transformer so that heat is removed from the transformer into the cooling fluid circulating through the pipe. In some embodiments, the transformer includes fans, heat sinks, fins, or other devices that assist in transferring heat away from the transformer. In some embodiments, the transformer is, or includes, a solid state transformer device such as an AC to DC converter.","In certain embodiments, the cooling fluid for the downhole transformer is circulated using a heat pipe in the wellbore.  depicts an embodiment of transformer  in wellbore  with heat pipes A,B. Lid  is placed at the top of a reservoir of cooling fluid  that surrounds transformer . Heated cooling fluid expands and flows up heat pipe A. The heated cooling fluid  cools adjacent to the overburden and flows back to lid . The cooled cooling fluid  flows back into the reservoir through heat pipe B. Heat pipes A,B act to create a flow path for the cooling fluid so that the cooling fluid circulates around transformer  and maintains a temperature of the transformer below the selected temperature.","Computational analysis has shown that a circulated water column was sufficient to cool a 60 Hz transformer that was 125 feet in length and generated 80 W\/ft of heat. The transformer and the formation were initially at ambient temperatures. The water column was initially at an elevated temperature. The water column and transformer cooled over a period of about 1 to 2 hours. The transformer initially heated up (but was still at operable temperatures) but then was cooled by the water column to lower operable temperatures. The computations also showed that the transformer would be cooled by the water column when the transformer and the formation were initially at higher than normal temperatures.","Modern utility voltage regulators have microprocessor controllers that monitor output voltage and adjust taps up or down to match a desired setting. Typical controllers include current monitoring and may be equipped with remote communications capabilities. The controller firmware may be modified for current based control (for example, control desired for maintaining constant wattage as heater resistances vary with temperature). Load resistance monitoring as well as other electrical analysis based evaluation and control are a possibility because of the availability of both current and voltage sensing by the controller. In addition to current, sensed electrical properties including, but not limited to power, voltage, power factor, resistance or harmonics may be used as control parameters. Typical tap changers have a 200% of nominal, short time current rating. Thus, the regulator controller may be programmed to respond to overload currents by means of tap changer operation.","Electronic heater controls such as silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs) may be used to provide power to and control subsurface heaters. SCRs may be expensive to use and may waste electrical energy in the power circuit. SCRs may also produce harmonic distortions during power control of the subsurface heaters. Harmonic distortion may put noise on the power line and stress heaters. In addition, SCRs may overly stress heaters by switching the power between being full on and full off rather than regulating the power at or near the ideal current setting. Thus, there may be significant overshooting and\/or undershooting at the target current for temperature limited heaters (for example, heaters using ferromagnetic materials for self-limiting temperature control).","A variable voltage, load tap changing transformer, which is based on a load tap changing regulator design, may be used to provide power to and control subsurface heaters more simply and without the harmonic distortion associated with electronic heater control. The variable voltage transformer may be connected to power distribution systems by simple, inexpensive fused cutouts. The variable voltage transformer may provide a cost effective, stand alone, full function heater controller and isolation transformer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1245","num":"1248"},"figref":"FIG. 173","b":["752","752","752","754","756","754","756","756","758","760","760","758","756","760"]},"Tap changer  contacts either one tap  or bridges between two taps to provide a midpoint between the two tap voltages.

In certain embodiments, the secondary winding in tap changer section  steps down the voltage from primary winding  to the second voltage that is between 5% and 20% of the first voltage across the primary winding. In some embodiments, the secondary winding in tap changer section  steps down the voltage from primary winding  to the second voltage that is between 1% and 30% or between 3% and 25% of the first voltage across the primary winding. In one embodiment, the secondary winding in tap changer section  steps down the voltage from primary winding  to the second voltage that is 10% of the first voltage across the primary winding. For example, a first voltage of 7200 V across the primary winding may be stepped down to a second voltage of 720 V across the secondary winding in tap changer section .","In some embodiments, the step down percentage in tap changer section  is preset. In some embodiments, the step down percentage in tap changer section  may be adjusted as needed for desired operation of a load coupled to transformer .","Taps A-H (or any other number of taps) divide the second voltage on the secondary winding in tap changer section  into voltage steps. The second voltage is divided into voltage steps from a selected minimum percentage of the second voltage up to the full value of the second voltage. In certain embodiments, the second voltage is divided into equivalent voltage steps between the selected minimum percentage and the full second voltage value. In some embodiments, the selected minimum percentage is 0% of the second voltage. For example, the second voltage may be equally divided by the taps in voltage steps ranging between 0 V and 720 V. In some embodiments, the selected minimum percentage is 25% or 50% of the second voltage.","Transformer  includes tap changer  that contacts either one tap  or bridges between two taps to provide a midpoint between the two tap voltages. The position of tap changer  on the taps determines the voltage provided to an electrical load coupled to bushings , . As an example, an arrangement with 8 taps in tap changer section  provides 16 voltage steps for tap changer  to couple to in tap changer section . Thus, the electrical load may be provided with 16 different voltages varying between the selected minimum percentage and the second voltage.","In certain embodiments of transformer , the voltage steps divide the range between the selected minimum percentage and the second voltage equally (the voltage steps are equivalent). For example, eight taps may divide a second voltage of 720 V into 16 voltage steps between 0 V and 720 V so that each tap increments the voltage provided to the electrical load by 45V. In some embodiments, the voltage steps divide the range between the selected minimum percentage and the second voltage in non-equal increments (the voltage steps are not equivalent).","Switch  may be used to electrically disconnect bushing  from the secondary winding and taps . Electrically isolating bushing  from the secondary winding turns off the power (voltage) provided to the electrical load coupled to bushings , . Thus, switch  provides an internal disconnect in transformer  to electrically isolate and turn off power (voltage) to the electrical load coupled to the transformer.","In transformer , voltage transformer , control power transformer , and current transformer  are electrically isolated from primary winding . Electrical isolation protects voltage transformer , control power transformer , and current transformer  from current and\/or voltage overloads caused by primary winding .","In certain embodiments, transformer  is used to provide power to a variable electrical load (for example, a subsurface heater such as, but not limited to, a temperature limited heater using ferromagnetic material that self-limits at the Curie temperature or a phase transition temperature range). Transformer  allows power to the electrical load to be adjusted in small voltage increments (voltage steps) by moving tap changer  between taps . Thus, the voltage supplied to the electrical load may be adjusted incrementally to provide constant current to the electrical load in response to changes in the electrical load (for example, changes in resistance of the electrical load). Voltage to the electrical load may be controlled from a minimum voltage (the selected minimum percentage) up to full potential (the second voltage) in increments. The increments may be equal increments or non-equal increments. Thus, power to the electrical load does not have to be turned full on or off to control the electrical load such as is done with a SCR controller. Using small increments may reduce cycling stress on the electrical load and may increase the lifetime of the device that is the electrical load. Transformer  changes the voltage using mechanical operation instead of the electrical switching used in SCRs. Electrical switching can add harmonics and\/or noise to the voltage signal provided to the electrical load. The mechanical switching of transformer  provides clean, noise free, incrementally adjustable control of the voltage provided to the electrical load.","Transformer  may be controlled by controller . Controller  may be a microprocessor controller. Controller  may be powered by control power transformer . Controller  may assess properties of transformer , including tap changer section , and\/or the electrical load coupled to the transformer. Examples of properties that may be assessed by controller  include, but are not limited to, voltage, current, power, power factor, harmonics, tap change operation count, maximum and minimum value recordings, wear of the tap changer contacts, and electrical load resistance.","In certain embodiments, controller  is coupled to the electrical load to assess properties of the electrical load. For example, controller  may be coupled to the electrical load using an optical fiber. The optical fiber allows measurement of properties of the electrical load such as, but not limited to, electrical resistance, impedance, capacitance, and\/or temperature. In some embodiments, controller  is coupled to voltage transformer  and\/or current transformer  to assess the voltage and\/or current output of transformer . In some embodiments, the voltage and current are used to assess a resistance of the electrical load over one or more selected time periods. In some embodiments, the voltage and current are used to assess or diagnose other properties of the electrical load (for example, temperature).","In certain embodiments, controller  adjusts the voltage output of transformer  in response to changes in the electrical load coupled to the transformer or other changes in the power distribution system such as, but not limited to, input voltage to the primary winding or other power supply changes. For example, controller  may adjust the voltage output of transformer  in response to changes in the electrical resistance of the electrical load. Controller  may adjust the output voltage by controlling the movement of control tap changer  between taps  to adjust the voltage output of transformer . In some embodiments, controller  adjusts the voltage output of transformer  so that the electrical load (for example, a subsurface heater) is operated at a relatively constant current. In some embodiments, controller  may adjust the voltage output of transformer  by moving tap changer  to a new tap, assess the resistance and\/or power at the new tap, and move the tap changer to another new tap if needed.","In some embodiments, controller  assesses the electrical resistance of the load (for example, by measuring the voltage and current using the voltage and current transformers or by measuring the resistance of the electrical load using the optical fiber) and compares the assessed electrical resistance to a theoretical resistance. Controller  may adjust the voltage output of transformer  in response to differences between the assessed resistance and the theoretical resistance. In some embodiments, the theoretical resistance is an ideal resistance for operation of the electrical load. In some embodiments, the theoretical resistance varies over time due to other changes in the electrical load (for example, temperature of the electrical load).","In some embodiments, controller  is programmable to cycle tap changer  between two or more taps  to achieve intermediate voltage outputs (for example, a voltage output between two tap voltage outputs). Controller  may adjust the time tap changer  is on each of the taps cycled between to obtain an average voltage at or near the desired intermediate voltage output. For example, controller  may keep tap changer  at two taps approximately 50% of the time each to maintain an average voltage approximately midway between the voltages at the two taps.","In some embodiments, controller  is programmable to limit the numbers of voltage changes (movement of tap changer  between taps  or cycles of tap changes) over a period of time. For example, controller  may only allow 1 tap change every 30 minutes or 2 tap changes per hour. Limiting the number of tap changes over the period of time reduces the stress on the electrical load (for example, a heater) from changes in voltage to the load. Reducing the stresses applied to the electrical load may increase the lifetime of the electrical load. Limiting the number of tap changes may also increase the lifetime of the tap changer apparatus. In some embodiments, the number of tap changes over the period of time is adjustable using the controller. For example, a user may be allowed to adjust the cycle limit for tap changes on transformer .","In some embodiments, controller  is programmable to power the electrical load in a start up sequence. For example, subsurface heaters may require a certain start up protocol (such as high current during early times of heating and lower current as the temperature of the heater reaches a set point). Ramping up power to the heaters in a desired procedure may reduce mechanical stresses on the heaters from materials expanding at different rates. In some embodiments, controller  ramps up power to the electrical load with controlled increases in voltage steps over time. In some embodiments, controller  ramps up power to the electrical load with controlled increases in watts per hour. Controller  may be programmed to automatically start up the electrical load according to a user input start up procedure or a pre-programmed start up procedure.","In some embodiments, controller  is programmable to turn off power to the electrical load in a shut down sequence. For example, subsurface heaters may require a certain shut down protocol to inhibit the heaters from cooling to quickly. Controller  may be programmed to automatically shut down the electrical load according to a user input shut down procedure or a pre-programmed shut down procedure.","In some embodiments, controller  is programmable to power the electrical load in a moisture removal sequence. For example, subsurface heaters or motors may require start up at second voltages to remove moisture from the system before application of higher voltages. In some embodiments, controller  inhibits increases in voltage until required electrical load resistance values are met. Limiting increases in voltage may inhibit transformer  from applying voltages that cause shorting due to moisture in the system. Controller  may be programmed to automatically start up the electrical load according to a user input moisture removal sequence or a pre-programmed moisture removal procedure.","In some embodiments, controller  is programmable to reduce power to the electrical load based on changes in the voltage input to primary winding . For example, the power to the electrical load may be reduced during brownouts or other power supply shortages. Reducing the power to the electrical load may compensate for the reduced power supply.","In some embodiments, controller  is programmable to protect the electrical load from being overloaded. Controller  may be programmed to automatically and immediately reduce the voltage output if the current to the electrical load increases above a selected value. The voltage output may be stepped down as fast as possible while sensing the current. Sensing of the current occurs on a faster time scale than the step downs in voltage so the voltage may be stepped down as fast as possible until the current drops below a selected level. In some embodiments, tap changes (voltage steps) may be inhibited above higher current levels. At the higher current levels, secondary fusing may be used to limit the current. Reducing the tap setting in response to the higher current levels may allow for continued operation of the transformer even after partial failure or quenching of electrical loads such as heaters.","In some embodiments, controller  records or tracks data from the operation of the electrical load and\/or transformer . For example, controller  may record changes in the resistance or other properties of the electrical load or transformer . In some embodiments, controller  records faults in operation of transformer  (for example, missed step changes).","In certain embodiments, controller  includes communication modules. The communication modules may be programmed to provide status, data, and\/or diagnostics for any device or system coupled to the controller such as the electrical load or transformer . The communication modules may communicate using RS485 serial communication, Ethernet, fiber, wireless, and\/or other communication technologies known in the art. The communication modules may be used to transmit information remotely to another site so that controller  and transformer  are operated in a self-contained or automatic manner but are able to report to another location (for example, a central monitoring location). The central monitoring location may monitor several controllers and transformers (for example, controllers and transformers located in a hydrocarbon processing field).

The three transformers may be monitored to assess if the tap positions in each transformer are in sync (at the same tap position). In some embodiments, one controller  is used to control the three transformers. The controller may monitor the transformers to ensure that the transformers are in sync.","In certain embodiments, a temperature limited heater is utilized for heavy oil applications (for example, treatment of relatively permeable formations or tar sands formations).

In an embodiment (for example, for a tar sands formation), a maximum temperature of the temperature limited heater is less than about 250\u00b0 C. to inhibit olefin generation and production of other cracked products. In some embodiments, a maximum temperature of the temperature limited heater is above about 250\u00b0 C. to produce lighter hydrocarbon products. In some embodiments, the maximum temperature of the heater may be at or less than about 500\u00b0 C.","A heater may heat a volume of formation adjacent to a production wellbore (a near production wellbore region) so that the temperature of fluid in the production wellbore and in the volume adjacent to the production wellbore is less than the temperature that causes degradation of the fluid. The heat source may be located in the production wellbore or near the production wellbore. In some embodiments, the heat source is a temperature limited heater. In some embodiments, two or more heat sources may supply heat to the volume. Heat from the heat source may reduce the viscosity of crude oil in or near the production wellbore. In some embodiments, heat from the heat source mobilizes fluids in or near the production wellbore and\/or enhances the flow of fluids to the production wellbore. In some embodiments, reducing the viscosity of crude oil allows or enhances gas lifting of heavy oil (at most about 10\u00b0 API gravity oil) or intermediate gravity oil (approximately 12\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 API gravity oil) from the production wellbore.

Reducing the viscosity of oil at or near the production wellbore in the formation to a viscosity of 0.05 Pa\u00b7s (50 cp), 0.03 Pa\u00b7s (30 cp), 0.02 Pa\u00b7s (20 cp), 0.01 Pa\u00b7s (10 cp), or less (down to 0.001 Pa\u00b7s (1 cp) or lower) lowers the amount of natural gas or other fluid needed to lift oil from the formation. In some embodiments, reduced viscosity oil is produced by other methods such as pumping.","The rate of production of oil from the formation may be increased by raising the temperature at or near a production wellbore to reduce the viscosity of the oil in the formation in and adjacent to the production wellbore. In certain embodiments, the rate of production of oil from the formation is increased by 2 times, 3 times, 4 times, or greater over standard cold production with no external heating of formation during production. Certain formations may be more economically viable for enhanced oil production using the heating of the near production wellbore region. Formations that have a cold production rate approximately between 0.05 m\/(day per meter of wellbore length) and 0.20 m\/(day per meter of wellbore length) may have significant improvements in production rate using heating to reduce the viscosity in the near production wellbore region. In some formations, production wells up to 775 m, up to 1000 m, or up to 1500 m in length are used. Thus, a significant increase in production is achievable in some formations. Heating the near production wellbore region may be used in formations where the cold production rate is not between 0.05 m\/(day per meter of wellbore length) and 0.20 m\/(day per meter of wellbore length), but heating such formations may not be as economically favorable. Higher cold production rates may not be significantly increased by heating the near wellbore region, while lower production rates may not be increased to an economically useful value.","Using the temperature limited heater to reduce the viscosity of oil at or near the production well inhibits problems associated with non-temperature limited heaters and heating the oil in the formation due to hot spots. One possible problem is that non-temperature limited heaters can cause coking of oil at or near the production well if the heater overheats the oil because the heaters are at too high a temperature. Higher temperatures in the production well may also cause brine to boil in the well, which may lead to scale formation in the well. Non-temperature limited heaters that reach higher temperatures may also cause damage to other wellbore components (for example, screens used for sand control, pumps, or valves). Hot spots may be caused by portions of the formation expanding against or collapsing on the heater. In some embodiments, the heater (either the temperature limited heater or another type of non-temperature limited heater) has sections that are lower because of sagging over long heater distances. These lower sections may sit in heavy oil or bitumen that collects in lower portions of the wellbore. At these lower sections, the heater may develop hot spots due to coking of the heavy oil or bitumen. A standard non-temperature limited heater may overheat at these hot spots, thus producing a non-uniform amount of heat along the length of the heater. Using the temperature limited heater may inhibit overheating of the heater at hot spots or lower sections and provide more uniform heating along the length of the wellbore.","In certain embodiments, fluids in the relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons are produced with little or no pyrolyzation of hydrocarbons in the formation. In certain embodiments, the relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons is a tar sands formation. For example, the formation may be a tar sands formation such as the Athabasca tar sands formation in Alberta, Canada or a carbonate formation such as the Grosmont carbonate formation in Alberta, Canada. The fluids produced from the formation are mobilized fluids. Producing mobilized fluids may be more economical than producing pyrolyzed fluids from the tar sands formation. Producing mobilized fluids may also increase the total amount of hydrocarbons produced from the tar sands formation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1278","num":"1281"},"figref":["FIGS. 176-179","FIGS. 176-179","FIG. 176","FIG. 177","FIG. 176","FIG. 178","FIG. 177","FIG. 179"],"b":["438","484","484","482"]},"In , heaters  are placed in an alternating triangular pattern in hydrocarbon layer . In , , and , heaters  are placed in an alternating triangular pattern in hydrocarbon layer  that repeats vertically to encompass a majority or all of the hydrocarbon layer. In , the alternating triangular pattern of heaters  in hydrocarbon layer  repeats uninterrupted across shale break . In , heaters  may be equidistantly spaced from each other. In the embodiments depicted in , the number of vertical rows of heaters  depends on factors such as, but not limited to, the desired spacing between the heaters, the thickness of hydrocarbon layer , and\/or the number and location of shale breaks . In some embodiments, heaters  are arranged in other patterns. For example, heaters  may be arranged in patterns such as, but not limited to, hexagonal patterns, square patterns, or rectangular patterns.","In the embodiments depicted in , heaters  provide heat that mobilizes hydrocarbons (reduces the viscosity of the hydrocarbons) in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments, heaters  provide heat that reduces the viscosity of the hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon layer  below about 0.50 Pa\u00b7s (500 cp), below about 0.10 Pa\u00b7s (100 cp), or below about 0.05 Pa\u00b7s (50 cp). The spacing between heaters  and\/or the heat output of the heaters may be designed and\/or controlled to reduce the viscosity of the hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon layer  to desirable values. Heat provided by heaters  may be controlled so that little or no pyrolyzation occurs in hydrocarbon layer . Superposition of heat between the heaters may create one or more drainage paths (for example, paths for flow of fluids) between the heaters. In certain embodiments, production wells A and\/or production wells B are located proximate heaters  so that heat from the heaters superimposes over the production wells. The superimposition of heat from heaters  over production wells A and\/or production wells B creates one or more drainage paths from the heaters to the production wells. In certain embodiments, one or more of the drainage paths converge. For example, the drainage paths may converge at or near a bottommost heater and\/or the drainage paths may converge at or near production wells A and\/or production wells B. Fluids mobilized in hydrocarbon layer  tend to flow towards the bottommost heaters , production wells A and\/or production wells B in the hydrocarbon layer because of gravity and the heat and pressure gradients established by the heaters and\/or the production wells. The drainage paths and\/or the converged drainage paths allow production wells A and\/or production wells B to collect mobilized fluids in hydrocarbon layer .","In certain embodiments, hydrocarbon layer  has sufficient permeability to allow mobilized fluids to drain to production wells A and\/or production wells B. For example, hydrocarbon layer  may have a permeability of at least about 0.1 darcy, at least about 1 darcy, at least about 10 darcy, or at least about 100 darcy. In some embodiments, hydrocarbon layer  has a relatively large vertical permeability to horizontal permeability ratio (K\/K). For example, hydrocarbon layer  may have a K\/Kratio between about 0.01 and about 2, between about 0.1 and about 1, or between about 0.3 and about 0.7.","In certain embodiments, fluids are produced through production wells A located near heaters  in the lower portion of hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments, fluids are produced through production wells B located below and approximately midway between heaters  in the lower portion of hydrocarbon layer . At least a portion of production wells A and\/or production wells B may be oriented substantially horizontal in hydrocarbon layer  (as shown in , the production wells have horizontal portions that go into and out of the page). Production wells A and\/or B may be located proximate lower portion heaters  or the bottommost heaters.","In some embodiments, production wells A are positioned substantially vertically below the bottommost heaters in hydrocarbon layer . Production wells A may be located below heaters  at the bottom vertex of a pattern of the heaters (for example, at the bottom vertex of the triangular pattern of heaters depicted in ). Locating production wells A substantially vertically below the bottommost heaters may allow for efficient collection of mobilized fluids from hydrocarbon layer .","In certain embodiments, the bottommost heaters are located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the bottom of hydrocarbon layer , between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer, or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer. In certain embodiments, production wells A and\/or production wells B are located at a distance from the bottommost heaters  that allows heat from the heaters to superimpose over the production wells but at a distance from the heaters that inhibits coking at the production wells. Production wells A and\/or production wells B may be located a distance from the nearest heater (for example, the bottommost heater) of at most \u00be of the spacing between heaters in the pattern of heaters (for example, the triangular pattern of heaters depicted in ). In some embodiments, production wells A and\/or production wells B are located a distance from the nearest heater of at most \u2154, at most \u00bd, or at most \u2153 of the spacing between heaters in the pattern of heaters. In certain embodiments, production wells A and\/or production wells B are located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the bottommost heaters, between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottommost heaters, or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the bottommost heaters. Production wells A and\/or production wells B may be located between about 0.5 m and about 8 m from the bottom of hydrocarbon layer , between about 1 m and about 5 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer, or between about 2 m and about 4 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer.","In some embodiments, at least some production wells A are located substantially vertically below heaters  near shale break , as depicted in . Production wells A may be located between heaters  and shale break  to produce fluids that flow and collect above the shale break. Shale break  may be an impermeable barrier in hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments, shale break  has a thickness between about 1 m and about 6 m, between about 2 m and about 5 m, or between about 3 m and about 4 m. Production wells A between heaters  and shale break  may produce fluids from the upper portion of hydrocarbon layer  (above the shale break) and production wells A below the bottommost heaters in the hydrocarbon layer may produce fluids from the lower portion of the hydrocarbon layer (below the shale break), as depicted in . In some embodiments, two or more shale breaks may exist in a hydrocarbon layer. In such an embodiment, production wells are placed at or near each of the shale breaks to produce fluids flowing and collecting above the shale breaks.","In some embodiments, shale break  breaks down (is desiccated or decomposes) as the shale break is heated by heaters  on either side of the shale break. As shale break  breaks down, the permeability of the shale break increases and fluids flow through the shale break. Once fluids are able to flow through shale break , production wells above the shale break may not be needed for production as fluids can flow to production wells at or near the bottom of hydrocarbon layer  and be produced there.","In certain embodiments, the bottommost heaters above shale break  are located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the shale break, between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottom of the shale break, or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the shale break. Production wells A may be located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the bottommost heaters above shale break , between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottommost heaters above the shale break, or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the bottommost heaters above the shale break. Production wells A may be located between about 0.5 m and about 8 m from shale break , between about 1 m and about 5 m from the shale break, or between about 2 m and about 4 m from the shale break.","In some embodiments, heat is provided in production wells A and\/or production wells B, depicted in . Providing heat in production wells A and\/or production wells B may maintain and\/or enhance the mobility of the fluids in the production wells. Heat provided in production wells A and\/or production wells B may superimpose with heat from heaters  to create the flow path from the heaters to the production wells. In some embodiments, production wells A and\/or production wells B include a pump to move fluids to the surface of the formation. In some embodiments, the viscosity of fluids (oil) in production wells A and\/or production wells B is lowered using heaters and\/or diluent injection (for example, using a conduit in the production wells for injecting the diluent).","In certain embodiments, in situ heat treatment of the relatively permeable formation containing hydrocarbons (for example, the tar sands formation) includes heating the formation to visbreaking temperatures. For example, the formation may be heated to temperatures between about 100\u00b0 C. and 260\u00b0 C., between about 150\u00b0 C. and about 250\u00b0 C., between about 200\u00b0 C. and about 240\u00b0 C., between about 205\u00b0 C. and 230\u00b0 C., between about 210\u00b0 C. and 225\u00b0 C. In one embodiment, the formation is heated to a temperature of about 220\u00b0 C. In one embodiment, the formation is heated to a temperature of about 230\u00b0 C. At visbreaking temperatures, fluids in the formation have a reduced viscosity (versus their initial viscosity at initial formation temperature) that allows fluids to flow in the formation. The reduced viscosity at visbreaking temperatures may be a permanent reduction in viscosity as the hydrocarbons go through a step change in viscosity at visbreaking temperatures (versus heating to mobilization temperatures, which may only temporarily reduce the viscosity). The visbroken fluids may have API gravities that are relatively low (for example, at most about 10\u00b0, about 12\u00b0, about 15\u00b0, or about 19\u00b0 API gravity), but the API gravities are higher than the API gravity of non-visbroken fluid from the formation. The non-visbroken fluid from the formation may have an API gravity of 7\u00b0 or less.","In some embodiments, heaters in the formation are operated at full power output to heat the formation to visbreaking temperatures or higher temperatures. Operating at full power may rapidly increase the pressure in the formation. In certain embodiments, fluids are produced from the formation to maintain a pressure in the formation below a selected pressure as the temperature of the formation increases. In some embodiments, the selected pressure is a fracture pressure of the formation. In certain embodiments, the selected pressure is between about 1000 kPa and about 15000 kPa, between about 2000 kPa and about 10000 kPa, or between about 2500 kPa and about 5000 kPa. In one embodiment, the selected pressure is about 10000 kPa. Maintaining the pressure as close to the fracture pressure as possible may minimize the number of production wells needed for producing fluids from the formation.","In certain embodiments, treating the formation includes maintaining the temperature at or near visbreaking temperatures (as described above) during the entire production phase while maintaining the pressure below the fracture pressure. The heat provided to the formation may be reduced or eliminated to maintain the temperature at or near visbreaking temperatures. Heating to visbreaking temperatures but maintaining the temperature below pyrolysis temperatures or near pyrolysis temperatures (for example, below about 230\u00b0 C.) inhibits coke formation and\/or higher level reactions. Heating to visbreaking temperatures at higher pressures (for example, pressures near but below the fracture pressure) keeps produced gases in the liquid oil (hydrocarbons) in the formation and increases hydrogen reduction in the formation with higher hydrogen partial pressures. Heating the formation to only visbreaking temperatures also uses less energy input than heating the formation to pyrolysis temperatures.","Fluids produced from the formation may include visbroken fluids, mobilized fluids, and\/or pyrolyzed fluids. In some embodiments, a produced mixture that includes these fluids is produced from the formation. The produced mixture may have assessable properties (for example, measurable properties). The produced mixture properties are determined by operating conditions in the formation being treated (for example, temperature and\/or pressure in the formation). In certain embodiments, the operating conditions may be selected, varied, and\/or maintained to produce desirable properties in hydrocarbons in the produced mixture. For example, the produced mixture may include hydrocarbons that have properties that allow the mixture to be easily transported (for example, sent through a pipeline without adding diluent or blending the mixture and\/or resulting hydrocarbons with another fluid).","In some embodiments, after the formation reaches visbreaking temperatures, the pressure in the formation is reduced. In certain embodiments, the pressure in the formation is reduced at temperatures above visbreaking temperatures. Reducing the pressure at higher temperatures allows more of the hydrocarbons in the formation to be converted to higher quality hydrocarbons by visbreaking and\/or pyrolysis. Allowing the formation to reach higher temperatures before pressure reduction, however, may increase the amount of carbon dioxide produced and\/or the amount of coking in the formation. For example, in some formations, coking of bitumen (at pressures above 700 kPa) begins at about 280\u00b0 C. and reaches a maximum rate at about 340\u00b0 C. At pressures below about 700 kPa, the coking rate in the formation is minimal. Allowing the formation to reach higher temperatures before pressure reduction may decrease the amount of hydrocarbons produced from the formation.","In certain embodiments, the temperature in the formation (for example, an average temperature of the formation) when the pressure in the formation is reduced is selected to balance one or more factors. The factors considered may include: the quality of hydrocarbons produced, the amount of hydrocarbons produced, the amount of carbon dioxide produced, the amount hydrogen sulfide produced, the degree of coking in the formation, and\/or the amount of water produced. Experimental assessments using formation samples and\/or simulated assessments based on the formation properties may be used to assess results of treating the formation using the in situ heat treatment process. These results may be used to determine a selected temperature, or temperature range, for when the pressure in the formation is to be reduced. The selected temperature, or temperature range, may also be affected by factors such as, but not limited to, hydrocarbon or oil market conditions and other economic factors. In certain embodiments, the selected temperature is in a range between about 275\u00b0 C. and about 305\u00b0 C., between about 280\u00b0 C. and about 300\u00b0 C., or between about 285\u00b0 C. and about 295\u00b0 C.","In certain embodiments, an average temperature in the formation is assessed from an analysis of fluids produced from the formation. For example, the average temperature of the formation may be assessed from an analysis of the fluids that have been produced to maintain the pressure in the formation below the fracture pressure of the formation.","In some embodiments, values of the hydrocarbon isomer shift in fluids (for example, gases) produced from the formation is used to indicate the average temperature in the formation. Experimental analysis and\/or simulation may be used to assess one or more hydrocarbon isomer shifts and relate the values of the hydrocarbon isomer shifts to the average temperature in the formation. The assessed relation between the hydrocarbon isomer shifts and the average temperature may then be used in the field to assess the average temperature in the formation by monitoring one or more of the hydrocarbon isomer shifts in fluids produced from the formation. In some embodiments, the pressure in the formation is reduced when the monitored hydrocarbon isomer shift reaches a selected value. The selected value of the hydrocarbon isomer shift may be chosen based on the selected temperature, or temperature range, in the formation for reducing the pressure in the formation and the assessed relation between the hydrocarbon isomer shift and the average temperature. Examples of hydrocarbon isomer shifts that may be assessed include, but are not limited to, n-butane-\u03b4Cpercentage versus propane-\u03b4Cpercentage, n-pentane-\u03b4Cpercentage versus propane-\u03b4Cpercentage, n-pentane-\u03b4Cpercentage versus n-butane-\u03b4Cpercentage, and i-pentane-\u03b4Cpercentage versus i-butane-\u03b4Cpercentage. In some embodiments, the hydrocarbon isomer shift in produced fluids is used to indicate the amount of conversion (for example, amount of pyrolysis) that has taken place in the formation.","In some embodiments, weight percentages of saturates in fluids produced from the formation is used to indicate the average temperature in the formation. Experimental analysis and\/or simulation may be used to assess the weight percentage of saturates as a function of the average temperature in the formation. For example, SARA (Saturates, Aromatics, Resins, and Asphaltenes) analysis (sometimes referred to as Asphaltene\/Wax\/Hydrate Deposition analysis) may be used to assess the weight percentage of saturates in a sample of fluids from the formation. In some formations, the weight percentage of saturates has a linear relationship to the average temperature in the formation. The relation between the weight percentage of saturates and the average temperature may then be used in the field to assess the average temperature in the formation by monitoring the weight percentage of saturates in fluids produced from the formation. In some embodiments, the pressure in the formation is reduced when the monitored weight percentage of saturates reaches a selected value. The selected value of the weight percentage of saturates may be chosen based on the selected temperature, or temperature range, in the formation for reducing the pressure in the formation and the relation between the weight percentage of saturates and the average temperature. In some embodiments, the selected value of weight percentage of saturates is between about 20% and about 40%, between about 25% and about 35%, or between about 28% and about 32%. For example, the selected value may be about 30% by weight saturates.","In some embodiments, weight percentages of n-Cin fluids produced from the formation is used to indicate the average temperature in the formation. Experimental analysis and\/or simulation may be used to assess the weight percentages of n-Cas a function of the average temperature in the formation. In some formations, the weight percentages of n-Chas a linear relationship to the average temperature in the formation. The relation between the weight percentages of n-Cand the average temperature may then be used in the field to assess the average temperature in the formation by monitoring the weight percentages of n-Cin fluids produced from the formation. In some embodiments, the pressure in the formation is reduced when the monitored weight percentage of n-Creaches a selected value. The selected value of the weight percentage of n-Cmay be chosen based on the selected temperature, or temperature range, in the formation for reducing the pressure in the formation and the relation between the weight percentage of n-Cand the average temperature. In some embodiments, the selected value of weight percentage of n-Cis between about 50% and about 70%, between about 55% and about 65%, or between about 58% and about 62%. For example, the selected value may be about 60% by weight n-C.","The pressure in the formation may be reduced by producing fluids (for example, visbroken fluids and\/or mobilized fluids) from the formation. In some embodiments, the pressure is reduced below a pressure at which fluids coke in the formation to inhibit coking at pyrolysis temperatures. For example, the pressure is reduced to a pressure below about 1000 kPa, below about 800 kPa, or below about 700 kPa (for example, about 690 kPa). In certain embodiments, the selected pressure is at least about 100 kPa, at least about 200 kPa, or at least about 300 kPa. The pressure may be reduced to inhibit coking of asphaltenes or other high molecular weight hydrocarbons in the formation. In some embodiments, the pressure may be maintained below a pressure at which water passes through a liquid phase at downhole (formation) temperatures to inhibit liquid water and dolomite reactions. After reducing the pressure in the formation, the temperature may be increased to pyrolysis temperatures to begin pyrolyzation and\/or upgrading of fluids in the formation. The pyrolyzed and\/or upgraded fluids may be produced from the formation.","In certain embodiments, the amount of fluids produced at temperatures below visbreaking temperatures, the amount of fluids produced at visbreaking temperatures, the amount of fluids produced before reducing the pressure in the formation, and\/or the amount of upgraded or pyrolyzed fluids produced may be varied to control the quality and amount of fluids produced from the formation and the total recovery of hydrocarbons from the formation. For example, producing more fluid during the early stages of treatment (for example, producing fluids before reducing the pressure in the formation) may increase the total recovery of hydrocarbons from the formation while reducing the overall quality (lowering the overall API gravity) of fluid produced from the formation. The overall quality is reduced because more heavy hydrocarbons are produced by producing more fluids at the lower temperatures. Producing less fluids at the lower temperatures may increase the overall quality of the fluids produced from the formation but may lower the total recovery of hydrocarbons from the formation. The total recovery may be lower because more coking occurs in the formation when less fluids are produced at lower temperatures.","In certain embodiments, the formation is heated using isolated cells of heaters (cells or sections of the formation that are not interconnected for fluid flow). The isolated cells may be created by using larger heater spacings in the formation. For example, large heater spacings may be used in the embodiments depicted in . These isolated cells may be produced during early stages of heating (for example, at temperatures below visbreaking temperatures). Because the cells are isolated from other cells in the formation, the pressures in the isolated cells are high and more liquids are producible from the isolated cells. Thus, more liquids may be produced from the formation and a higher total recovery of hydrocarbons may be reached. During later stages of heating, the heat gradient may interconnect the isolated cells and pressures in the formation will drop.","In certain embodiments, the heat gradient in the formation is modified so that a gas cap is created at or near an upper portion of the hydrocarbon layer. For example, the heat gradient made by heaters  depicted in the embodiments depicted in  may be modified to create the gas cap at or near overburden  of hydrocarbon layer . The gas cap may push or drive liquids to the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer so that more liquids may be produced from the formation. In situ generation of the gas cap may be more efficient than introducing pressurized fluid into the formation. The in situ generated gas cap applies force evenly through the formation with little or no channeling or fingering that may reduce the effectiveness of introduced pressurized fluid.","In certain embodiments, the number and\/or location of production wells in the formation is varied based on the viscosity of fluid in the formation. The viscosities in the zones may be assessed before placing the production wells in the formation, before heating the formation, and\/or after heating the formation. In some embodiments, more production wells are located in zones in the formation that have lower viscosities. For example, in certain formations, upper portions, or zones, of the formation may have lower viscosities. In some embodiments, more production wells are located in the upper zones. Producing through production wells in the less viscous zones of the formation may result in production of higher quality (more upgraded) oil from the formation.","In some embodiments, more production wells are located in zones in the formation that have higher viscosities. Pressure propagation may be slower in the zones with higher viscosities. The slower pressure propagation may make it more difficult to control pressure in the zones with higher viscosities. Thus, more production wells may be located in the zones with higher viscosities to provide better pressure control in these zones.","In some embodiments, zones in the formation with different assessed viscosities are heated at different rates. In certain embodiments, zones in the formation with higher viscosities are heated at higher heating rates than zones with lower viscosities. Heating the zones with higher viscosities at the higher heating rates mobilizes and\/or upgrades these zones at a faster rate so that these zones may \u201ccatch up\u201d in viscosity and\/or quality to the slower heated zones.","In some embodiments, the heater spacing is varied to provide different heating rates to zones in the formation with different assessed viscosities. For example, denser heater spacings (less spaces between heaters) may be used in zones with higher viscosities to heat these zones at higher heating rates. In some embodiments, a production well (for example, a substantially vertical production well) is located in the zones with denser heater spacings and higher viscosities. The production well may be used to remove fluids from the formation and relieve pressure from the higher viscosity zones. In some embodiments, one or more substantially vertical openings, or production wells, are located in the higher viscosity zones to allow fluids to drain in the higher viscosity zones. The draining fluids may be produced from the formation through production wells located near the bottom of the higher viscosity zones.","In certain embodiments, production wells are located in more than one zone in the formation. The zones may have different initial permeabilities. In certain embodiments, a first zone has an initial permeability of at least about 1 darcy and a second zone has an initial permeability of at most about 0.1 darcy. In some embodiments, the first zone has an initial permeability of between about 1 darcy and about 10 darcy. In some embodiments, the second zone has an initial permeability between about 0.01 darcy and 0.1 darcy. The zones may be separated by a substantially impermeable barrier (with an initial permeability of about 10 \u03bcdarcy or less). Having the production well located in both zones allows for fluid communication (permeability) between the zones and\/or pressure equalization between the zones.","In some embodiments, openings (for example, substantially vertical openings) are formed between zones with different initial permeabilities that are separated by a substantially impermeable barrier. Bridging the zones with the openings allows for fluid communication (permeability) between the zones and\/or pressure equalization between the zones. In some embodiments, openings in the formation (such as pressure relief openings and\/or production wells) allow gases or low viscosity fluids to rise in the openings. As the gases or low viscosity fluids rise, the fluids may condense or increase viscosity in the openings so that the fluids drain back down the openings to be further upgraded in the formation. Thus, the openings may act as heat pipes by transferring heat from the lower portions to the upper portions where the fluids condense. The wellbores may be packed and sealed near or at the overburden to inhibit transport of formation fluid to the surface.","In some embodiments, production of fluids is continued after reducing and\/or turning off heating of the formation. The formation may be heated for a selected time. The formation may be heated until it reaches a selected average temperature. Production from the formation may continue after the selected time. Continuing production may produce more fluid from the formation as fluids drain towards the bottom of the formation and\/or as fluids are upgraded by passing by hot spots in the formation. In some embodiments, a horizontal production well is located at or near the bottom of the formation (or a zone of the formation) to produce fluids after heating is turned down and\/or off.","In certain embodiments, initially produced fluids (for example, fluids produced below visbreaking temperatures), fluids produced at visbreaking temperatures, and\/or other viscous fluids produced from the formation are blended with diluent to produce fluids with lower viscosities. In some embodiments, the diluent includes upgraded or pyrolyzed fluids produced from the formation. In some embodiments, the diluent includes upgraded or pyrolyzed fluids produced from another portion of the formation or another formation. In certain embodiments, the amount of fluids produced at temperatures below visbreaking temperatures and\/or fluids produced at visbreaking temperatures that are blended with upgraded fluids from the formation is adjusted to create a fluid suitable for transportation and\/or use in a refinery. The amount of blending may be adjusted so that the fluid has chemical and physical stability. Maintaining the chemical and physical stability of the fluid may allow the fluid to be transported, reduce pre-treatment processes at a refinery and\/or reduce or eliminate the need for adjusting the refinery process to compensate for the fluid.","In certain embodiments, formation conditions (for example, pressure and temperature) and\/or fluid production are controlled to produce fluids with selected properties. For example, formation conditions and\/or fluid production may be controlled to produce fluids with a selected API gravity and\/or a selected viscosity. The selected API gravity and\/or selected viscosity may be produced by combining fluids produced at different formation conditions (for example, combining fluids produced at different temperatures during the treatment as described above). As an example, formation conditions and\/or fluid production may be controlled to produce fluids with an API gravity of about 19\u00b0 and a viscosity of about 0.35 Pa\u00b7s (350 cp) at 5\u00b0 C.","In certain embodiments, a drive process (for example, a steam injection process such as cyclic steam injection, a steam assisted gravity drainage process (SAGD), a solvent injection process, a vapor solvent and SAGD process, or a carbon dioxide injection process) is used to treat the tar sands formation in addition to the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments, heaters are used to create high permeability zones (or injection zones) in the formation for the drive process. Heaters may be used to create a mobilization geometry or production network in the formation to allow fluids to flow through the formation during the drive process. For example, heaters may be used to create drainage paths between the heaters and production wells for the drive process. In some embodiments, the heaters are used to provide heat during the drive process. The amount of heat provided by the heaters may be small compared to the heat input from the drive process (for example, the heat input from steam injection).","The concentration of components in the formation and\/or produced fluids may change during an in situ heat treatment process. As the concentration of the components in the formation and\/or produced fluids and\/or hydrocarbons separated from the produced fluid changes due to formation of the components, solubility of the components in the produced fluids and\/or separated hydrocarbons tends to change. Hydrocarbons separated from the produced fluid may be hydrocarbons that have been treated to remove salty water and\/or gases from the produced fluid. For example, the produced fluids and\/or separated hydrocarbons may contain components that are soluble in the condensable hydrocarbon portion of the produced fluids at the beginning of processing. As properties of the hydrocarbons in the produced fluids change (for example, TAN, asphaltenes, P-value, olefin content, mobilized fluids content, visbroken fluids content, pyrolyzed fluids content, or combinations thereof), the components may tend to become less soluble in the produced fluids and\/or in the hydrocarbon stream separated from the produced fluids. In some instances, components in the produced fluids and\/or components in the separated hydrocarbons may form two phases and\/or become insoluble. Formation of two phases, through flocculation of asphaltenes, change in concentration of components in the produced fluids, change in concentration of components in separated hydrocarbons, and\/or precipitation of components may result in hydrocarbons that do not meet pipeline, transportation, and\/or refining specifications. Additionally, the efficiency of the process may be reduced. For example, further treatment of the produced fluids and\/or separated hydrocarbons may be necessary to produce products with desired properties.","During processing, the P-value of the separated hydrocarbons may be monitored and the stability of the produced fluids and\/or separated hydrocarbons may be assessed. Typically, a P-value that is at most 1.0 indicates that flocculation of asphaltenes from the separated hydrocarbons generally occurs. If the P-value is initially at least 1.0, and such P-value increases or is relatively stable during heating, then this indicates that the separated hydrocarbons are relatively stable. Stability of separated hydrocarbons, as assessed by P-value, may be controlled by controlling operating conditions in the formation such as temperature, pressure, hydrogen uptake, hydrocarbon feed flow, or combinations thereof.","In some embodiments, change in API gravity may not occur unless the formation temperature is at least 100\u00b0 C. For some formations, temperatures of at least 220\u00b0 C. may be required to produce hydrocarbons that meet desired specifications. At increased temperatures coke formation may occur, even at elevated pressures. As the properties of the formation are changed, the P-value of the separated hydrocarbons may decrease below 1.0 and\/or sediment may form, causing the separated hydrocarbons to become unstable.","In some embodiments, olefins may form during heating of formation fluids to produce fluids having a reduced viscosity. Separated hydrocarbons that include olefins may be unacceptable for processing facilities. Olefins in the separated hydrocarbons may cause fouling and\/or clogging of processing equipment. For example, separated hydrocarbons that contains olefins may cause coking of distillation units in a refinery, which results in frequent down time to remove the coked material from the distillation units.","During processing, the olefin content of separated hydrocarbons may be monitored and quality of the separated hydrocarbons assessed. Typically, separated hydrocarbons having a bromine number of 3% and\/or a CAPP olefin number of 3% as 1-decene equivalent indicates that olefin production is occurring. If the olefin value decreases or is relatively stable during producing, then this indicates that a minimal or substantially low amount of olefins are being produced. Olefin content, as assessed by bromine value and\/or CAPP olefin number, may be controlled by controlling operating conditions in the formation such as temperature, pressure, hydrogen uptake, hydrocarbon feed flow, or combinations thereof.","In some embodiments, the P-value and\/or olefin content may be controlled by controlling operating conditions. For example, if the temperature increases above 225\u00b0 C. and the P-value drops below 1.0, the separated hydrocarbons may become unstable. Alternatively, the bromine number and\/or CAPP olefin number may increase to above 3%. If the temperature is maintained below 225\u00b0 C., minimal changes to the hydrocarbon properties may occur. In certain embodiments, operating conditions are selected, varied, and\/or maintained to produce separated hydrocarbons having a P-value of at least about 1, at least about 1.1, at least about 1.2, or at least about 1.3. In certain embodiments, operating conditions are selected, varied, and\/or maintained to produce separated hydrocarbons having a bromine number of at most about 3%, at most about 2.5%, at most about 2%, or at most about 1.5%. Heating of the formation at controlled operating conditions includes operating at temperatures between about 100\u00b0 C. and about 260\u00b0 C., between about 150\u00b0 C. and about 250\u00b0 C., between about 200\u00b0 C. and about 240\u00b0 C., between about 210\u00b0 C. and about 230\u00b0 C., or between about 215\u00b0 C. and about 225\u00b0 C. Pressures may be between about 1000 kPa and about 15000 kPa, between about 2000 kPa and about 10000 kPa, or between about 2500 kPa and about 5000 kPa or at or near a fracture pressure of the formation. In certain embodiments, the selected pressure of about 10000 kPa produces separated hydrocarbons having properties acceptable for transportation and\/or refineries (for example, viscosity, P-value, API gravity, and\/or olefin content within acceptable ranges).","Examples of produced mixture properties that may be measured and used to assess the separated hydrocarbon portion of the produced mixture include, but are not limited to, liquid hydrocarbon properties such as API gravity, viscosity, asphaltene stability (P-value), and olefin content (bromine number and\/or CAPP number). In certain embodiments, operating conditions in the formation are selected, varied, and\/or maintained to produce an API gravity of at least about 15\u00b0, at least about 17\u00b0, at least about 19\u00b0, or at least about 20\u00b0 in the produced mixture. In certain embodiments, operating conditions in the formation are selected, varied, and\/or maintained to produce a viscosity (measured at 1 atm and 5\u00b0 C.) of at most about 400 cp, at most about 350 cp, at most about 250 cp, or at most about 100 cp in the produced mixture. As an example, the initial viscosity of fluid in the formation is above about 1000 cp or, in some cases, above about 1 million cp. In certain embodiments, operating conditions are selected, varied, and\/or maintained to produce an asphaltene stability (P-value) of at least about 1, at least about 1.1, at least about 1.2, or at least about 1.3 in the produced mixture. In certain embodiments, operating conditions are selected, varied, and\/or maintained to produce a bromine number of at most about 3%, at most about 2.5%, at most about 2%, or at most about 1.5% in the produced mixture.","In certain embodiments, the mixture is produced from one or more production wells located at or near the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer being treated. In other embodiments, the mixture is produced from other locations in the hydrocarbon layer being treated (for example, from an upper portion of the layer or a middle portion of the layer).","In one embodiment, the formation is heated to 220\u00b0 C. or 230\u00b0 C. while maintaining the pressure in the formation below 10000 kPa. The separated hydrocarbon portion of the mixture produced from the formation may have several desirable properties such as, but not limited to, an API gravity of at least 19\u00b0, a viscosity of at most 350 cp, a P-value of at least 1.1, and a bromine number of at most 2%. Such separated hydrocarbons may be transportable through a pipeline without adding diluent or blending the mixture with another fluid. The mixture may be produced from one or more production wells located at or near the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer being treated.","The in situ heat treatment process may provide less heat to the formation (for example, use a wider heater spacing) if the in situ heat treatment process is followed by a drive process. The drive process may involve introducing a hot fluid into the formation to increase the amount of heat provided to the formation. In some embodiments, the heaters of the in situ heat treatment process may be used to pretreat the formation to establish injectivity for the subsequent drive process. In some embodiments, the in situ heat treatment process creates or produces the drive fluid in situ. The in situ produced drive fluid may move through the formation and move mobilized hydrocarbons from one portion of the formation to another portion of the formation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1323","num":"1326"},"figref":"FIG. 180","b":["788","206","438","788","438"]},"The vertical location of heaters  with respect to injection wells  and production wells  depends on, for example, the vertical permeability of the formation. In formations with at least some vertical permeability, injected steam will rise to the top of the permeable layer in the formation. In such formations, heaters  may be located near the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer , as shown in . In formations with very low vertical permeabilities, more than one horizontal heater may be used with the heaters stacked substantially vertically or with heaters at varying depths in the hydrocarbon layer (for example, heater patterns as shown in ). The vertical spacing between the horizontal heaters in such formations may correspond to the distance between the heaters and the injection wells. Heaters  are located in the vicinity of injection wells  and\/or production wells  so that sufficient energy is delivered by the heaters to provide flow rates for the drive process that are economically viable. The spacing between heaters  and injection wells  or production wells  may be varied to provide an economically viable drive process. The amount of preheating may also be varied to provide an economically viable process.","In some embodiments, the steam injection (or drive) process (for example, SAGD, cyclic steam soak, or another steam recovery process) is used to treat the formation and produce hydrocarbons from the formation. The steam injection process may recover a low amount of oil in place from the formation (for example, less than 20% recovery of oil in place from the formation). The in situ heat treatment process may be used following the steam injection process to increase the recovery of oil in place from the formation. In certain embodiments, the steam injection process is used until the steam injection process is no longer efficient at removing hydrocarbons from the formation (for example, until the steam injection process is no longer economically feasible). The in situ heat treatment process is used to produce hydrocarbons remaining in the formation after the steam injection process. Using the in situ heat treatment process after the steam injection process may allow recovery of at least about 25%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, or at least about 60% of oil in place in the formation.","In some embodiments, the formation has been at least somewhat heated by the steam injection process before treating the formation using the in situ heat treatment process. For example, the steam injection process may heat the formation to an average temperature between about 200\u00b0 C. and about 250\u00b0 C., between about 175\u00b0 C. and about 265\u00b0 C., or between about 150\u00b0 C. and about 270\u00b0 C. In certain embodiments, the heaters are placed in the formation after the steam injection process is at least 50% completed, at least 75% completed, or near 100% completed. The heaters provide heat for treating the formation using the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments, the heaters are already in place in the formation during the steam injection process. In such embodiments, the heaters may be energized after the steam injection process is completed or when production of hydrocarbons using the steam injection process is reduced below a desired level. In some embodiments, steam injection wells from the steam injection process are converted to heater wells for the in situ heat treatment process.","Treating the formation with the in situ heat treatment process after the steam injection process may be more efficient than only treating the formation with the in situ heat treatment process. The steam injection process may provide some energy (heat) to the formation with the steam. Any energy added to the formation during the steam injection process reduces the amount of energy needed to be supplied by heaters for the in situ heat treatment process. Reducing the amount of energy supplied by heaters reduces costs for treating the formation using the in situ heat treatment process.","In certain embodiments, treating the formation using the steam injection process does not treat the formation uniformly. For example, steam injection may not be uniform throughout the formation. Variations in the properties of the formation (for example, fluid injectivities, permeabilities, and\/or porosities) may result in non-uniform injection of the steam through the formation. Because of the non-uniform injection of the steam, the steam may remove hydrocarbons from different portions of the formation at different rates or with different results. For example, some portions of the formation may have little or no steam injectivity, which inhibits the hydrocarbon production from these portions. After the steam injection process is completed, the formation may have portions that have lower amounts of hydrocarbons produced (more hydrocarbons remaining) than other parts of the formation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1329","num":"1332"},"figref":"FIG. 182","b":["788","484","482","790","792","790","792","484","790","792"]},"In some embodiments, the portions with more hydrocarbons remaining (such as portion , depicted in ) are large portions of the formation. In some embodiments, the amount of hydrocarbons remaining in these portions is significantly higher than other portions of the formation (such as portions ). For example, portions  may have a recovery of at most about 10% of the oil in place and portions  may have a recovery of at least about 30% of the oil in place. In some embodiments, portions  have a recovery of between about 0% and about 10% of the oil in place, between about 0% and about 15% of the oil in place, or between about 0% and about 20% of the oil in place. The portions  may have a recovery of between about 20% and about 25% of the oil in place, between about 20% and about 40% of the oil in place, or between about 20% and about 50% of the oil in place. Coring, logging techniques, and\/or seismic imaging may be used to assess hydrocarbons remaining in the formation and assess the location of one or more of the first and\/or second portions.","In certain embodiments, during the in situ heat treatment process, more heat is provided to the first portions of the formation that have more hydrocarbons remaining than the second portions with less hydrocarbons remaining. In some embodiments, heaters are located in the first portions but not in the second portions. In some embodiments, heaters are located in both the first portions and the second portions but the heaters in the first portions are designed or operated to provide more heat than the heaters in the second portions. In some embodiments, heaters pass through both first portions and second portions and the heaters are designed or operated to provide more heat in the first portions than the second portions.","In some embodiments, steam injection is continued during the in situ heat treatment process. For example, steam injection may be continued while liquids are being produced from the formation. The steam injection may increase the production of liquids from the formation. In certain embodiments, steam injection may be reduced or stopped when gas production from the formation begins.","In some embodiments, the formation is treated using the in situ heat treatment process a significant time after the formation has been treated using the steam injection process. For example, the in situ heat treatment process is used 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, or longer (for example, 10 years to 20 years) after a formation has been treated using the steam injection process. During this dormant period, heat from the steam injection process may diffuse to cooler parts of the formation and result in a more uniform preheating of the formation prior to in situ heat treatment. The in situ heat treatment process may be used on formations that have been left dormant after the steam injection process treatment because further hydrocarbon production using the steam injection process is not possible and\/or not economically feasible. In some embodiments, the formation remains at least somewhat heated from the steam injection process even after the significant time.","In certain embodiments, a fluid is injected into the formation (for example, a drive fluid or an oxidizing fluid) to move hydrocarbons through the formation from a first section to a second section. In some embodiments, the hydrocarbons are moved from the first section to the second section through a third section.  depicts a side view representation of an embodiment using at least three treatment sections in a tar sands formation. Hydrocarbon layer  may be divide into three or more treatment sections. In certain embodiments, hydrocarbon layer  includes three different types of treatment sections: section A, section B, and section C. Section C and sections A are separated by sections B. Section C, sections A, and sections B may be horizontally displaced from each other in the formation. In some embodiments, one side of section C is adjacent to an edge of the treatment area of the formation or an untreated section of the formation is left on one side of section C before the same or a different pattern is formed on the opposite side of the untreated section.","In certain embodiments, sections A and C are heated at or near the same time to similar temperatures (for example, pyrolysis temperatures). Sections A and C may be heated to mobilize and\/or pyrolyze hydrocarbons in the sections. The mobilized and\/or pyrolyzed hydrocarbons may be produced (for example, through one or more production wells) from section A and\/or section C. Section B may be heated to lower temperatures (for example, mobilization temperatures). Little or no production of hydrocarbons to the surface may take place through section B. For example, sections A and C may be heated to average temperatures of about 300\u00b0 C. while section B is heated to an average temperature of about 100\u00b0 C. and no production wells are operated in section B.","In certain embodiments, heating and producing hydrocarbons from section C creates fluid injectivity in the section. After fluid injectivity has been created in section C, a fluid such as a drive fluid (for example, steam, water, or hydrocarbons) and\/or an oxidizing fluid (for example, air, oxygen, enriched air, or other oxidants) may be injected into the section. The fluid may be injected through heaters , a production well, and\/or an injection well located in section C. In some embodiments, heaters  continue to provide heat while the fluid is being injected. In other embodiments, heaters  may be turned down or off before or during fluid injection.","In some embodiments, providing oxidizing fluid such as air to section C causes oxidation of hydrocarbons in the section. For example, coked hydrocarbons and\/or heated hydrocarbons in section C may oxidize if the temperature of the hydrocarbons is above an oxidation ignition temperature. In some embodiments, treatment of section C with the heaters creates coked hydrocarbons with substantially uniform porosity and\/or substantially uniform injectivity so that heating of the section is controllable when oxidizing fluid is introduced to the section. The oxidation of hydrocarbons in section C will maintain the average temperature of the section or increase the average temperature of the section to higher temperatures (for example, about 400\u00b0 C. or above).","In some embodiments, injection of the oxidizing fluid is used to heat section C and a second fluid is introduced into the formation after or with the oxidizing fluid to create drive fluids in the section. During injection of oxidant, excess oxidant and\/or oxidation products may be removed from section C through one or more production wells. After the formation is raised to a desired temperature, a second fluid may be introduced into section C to react with coke and\/or hydrocarbons and generate drive fluid (for example, synthesis gas). In some embodiments, the second fluid includes water and\/or steam. Reactions of the second fluid with carbon in the formation may be endothermic reactions that cool the formation. In some embodiments, oxidizing fluid is added with the second fluid so that some heating of section C occurs simultaneous with the endothermic reactions. In some embodiments, section C may be treated in alternating steps of adding oxidant to heat the formation, and then adding second fluid to generate drive fluids.","The generated drive fluids in section C may include steam, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane, and\/or pyrolyzed hydrocarbons. The high temperature in section C and the generation of drive fluid in the section may increase the pressure of the section so the drive fluids move out of the section into adjacent sections. The increased temperature of section C may also provide heat to section B through conductive heat transfer and\/or convective heat transfer from fluid flow (for example, hydrocarbons and\/or drive fluid) to section B.","In some embodiments, hydrocarbons (for example, hydrocarbons produced from section C) are provided as a portion of the drive fluid. The injected hydrocarbons may include at least some pyrolyzed hydrocarbons such as pyrolyzed hydrocarbons produced from section C. In some embodiments, steam or water are provided as a portion of the drive fluid. Steam or water in the drive fluid may be used to control temperatures in the formation. For example, steam or water may be used to keep temperatures lower in the formation. In some embodiments, water injected as the drive fluid is turned into steam in the formation due to the higher temperatures in the formation. The conversion of water to steam may be used to reduce temperatures or maintain lower temperatures in the formation.","Fluids injected in section C may flow towards section B, as shown by the arrows in . Fluid movement through the formation transfers heat convectively through hydrocarbon layer  into sections B and\/or A. In addition, some heat may transfer conductively through the hydrocarbon layer between the sections.","Low level heating of section B mobilizes hydrocarbons in the section. The mobilized hydrocarbons in section B may be moved by the injected fluid through the section towards section A, as shown by the arrows in . Thus, the injected fluid is pushing hydrocarbons from section C through section B to section A. Mobilized hydrocarbons may be upgraded in section A due to the higher temperatures in the section. Pyrolyzed hydrocarbons that move into section A may also be further upgraded in the section. The upgraded hydrocarbons may be produced through production wells located in section A.","In certain embodiments, at least some hydrocarbons in section B are mobilized and drained from the section prior to injecting the fluid into the formation. Some formations may have high oil saturation (for example, the Grosmont formation has high oil saturation). The high oil saturation corresponds to low gas permeability in the formation that may inhibit fluid flow through the formation. Thus, mobilizing and draining (removing) some oil (hydrocarbons) from the formation may create gas permeability for the injected fluids.","Fluids in hydrocarbon layer  may preferentially move horizontally within the hydrocarbon layer from the point of injection because tar sands tend to have a larger horizontal permeability than vertical permeability. The higher horizontal permeability allows the injected fluid to move hydrocarbons between sections preferentially versus fluids draining vertically due to gravity in the formation. Providing sufficient fluid pressure with the injected fluid may ensure that fluids are moved to section A for upgrading and\/or production.","In certain embodiments, section B has a larger volume than section A and\/or section C. Section B may be larger in volume than the other sections so that more hydrocarbons are produced for less energy input into the formation. Because less heat is provided to section B (the section is heated to lower temperatures), having a larger volume in section B reduces the total energy input to the formation per unit volume. The desired volume of section B may depend on factors such as, but not limited to, viscosity, oil saturation, and permeability. In addition, the degree of coking is much less in section B due to the lower temperature so less hydrocarbons are coked in the formation when section B has a larger volume. In some embodiments, the lower degree of heating in section B allows for cheaper capital costs as lower temperature materials (cheaper materials) may be used for heaters used in section B.","In some embodiments, karsted formations or karsted layers in formations have vugs in one or more layers of the formations. The vugs may be filled with viscous fluids such as bitumen or heavy oil. In some embodiments, the karsted layers have a porosity of at least about 20 porosity units, at least about 30 porosity units, or at least about 35 porosity units. The karsted formation may have a porosity of at most about 15 porosity units, at most about 10 porosity units, or at most about 5 porosity units. Vugs filled with viscous fluids may inhibit steam or other fluids from being injected into the formation or the layers. In certain embodiments, the karsted formation or karsted layers of the formation are treated using the in situ heat treatment process.","Heating of these formations or layers may decrease the viscosity of the viscous fluids in the vugs and allow the fluids to drain (for example, mobilize the fluids). Formations with karsted layers may have sufficient permeability so that when the viscosity of fluids (hydrocarbons) in the formation is reduced, the fluids drain and\/or move through the formation relatively easily (for example, without a need for creating higher permeability in the formation).","In some embodiments, the relative amount (the degree) of karst in the formation is assessed using techniques known in the art (for example, 3D seismic imaging of the formation). The assessment may give a profile of the formation showing layers or portions with varying amounts of karst in the formation. In certain embodiments, more heat is provided to selected karsted portions of the formation than other karsted portions of the formation. In some embodiments, selective amounts of heat are provided to portions of the formation as a function of the degree of karst in the portions. Amounts of heat may be provided by varying the number and\/or density of heaters in the portions with varying degrees of karst.","In certain embodiments, the hydrocarbon fluids in karsted portions have higher viscosities than hydrocarbons in other non-karsted portions of the formation. Thus, more heat may be provided to the karsted portions to reduce the viscosity of the hydrocarbons in the karsted portions.","In certain embodiments, only the karsted layers of the formation are treated using the in situ heat treatment process. Other non-karsted layers of the formation may be used as seals for the in situ heat treatment process. For example, karsted layers with different quantities of hydrocarbons in the layers may be treated while other layers are used as natural seals for the treatment process. In some embodiments, karsted layers with low quantities of hydrocarbons as compared to the other karsted and\/or non-karsted layers are used as seals for the treatment process. The quantity of hydrocarbons in the Karsted layer may be determined using logging methods and\/or Dean Stark distillation methods. The quantity of hydrocarbons may be reported as a volume percent of hydrocarbons per volume percent of rock, or as volume of hydrocarbons per mass of rock.","In some embodiments, karsted layers with fewer hydrocarbons are treated along with karsted layers with more hydrocarbons. In some embodiments, karsted layers with fewer hydrocarbons are above and below a karsted layer with more hydrocarbons (the middle karsted layer). Less heat may be provided to the upper and lower karsted layers than the middle karsted layer. Less heat may be provided in the upper and lower karsted layers by having greater heat spacing and\/or less heaters in the upper and lower karsted layers as compared to the middle karsted layer. In some embodiments, less heating of the upper and lower karsted layers includes heating the layers to mobilization and\/or visbreaking temperatures, but not to pyrolysis temperatures. In some embodiments, the upper and\/or lower karsted layers are heated with heaters and the residual heat from the upper and\/or lower layers transfers to the middle layer.","One or more production wells may be located in the middle karsted layer. Mobilized and\/or visbroken hydrocarbons from the upper karsted layer may drain to the production wells in the middle karsted layer. Heat provided to the lower karsted layer may create a thermal expansion drive and\/or a gas pressure drive in the lower karsted layer. The thermal expansion and\/or gas pressure may drive fluids from the lower karsted layer to the middle karsted layer. These fluids may be produced through the production wells in the middle karsted layer. Providing some heat to the upper and lower karsted layers may increase the total recovery of fluids from the formation by, for example, 25% or more.","In some embodiments, the karsted layers with fewer hydrocarbons are further heated to pyrolysis temperatures after production from the karsted layer with more hydrocarbons is completed or almost completed. The karsted layers with fewer hydrocarbons may also be further treated by producing fluids through production wells located in the layers.","In some embodiments, a drive process, a solvent injection process and\/or a pressurizing fluid process is used after the in situ heat treatment of the karsted formation or karsted layers. A drive process may include injection of a drive fluid such as steam. A drive process includes, but is not limited to, a steam injection process such as cyclic steam injection, a steam assisted gravity drainage process (SAGD), and a vapor solvent and SAGD process. A drive process may drive fluids from one portion of the formation towards a production well.","A solvent injection process may include injection of a solvating fluid. A solvating fluid includes, but is not limited to, water, emulsified water, hydrocarbons, surfactants, alkaline water solutions (for example, sodium carbonate solutions), caustic, polymers, carbon disulfide, carbon dioxide, or mixtures thereof. The solvation fluid may mix with, solvate and\/or dilute the hydrocarbons to form a mixture of condensable hydrocarbons and solvation fluids. The mixture may have a reduced viscosity as compared to the initial viscosity of the fluids in the formation. The mixture may flow and\/or be mobilized towards production wells in the formation.","A pressurizing process may include moving hydrocarbons in the formation by injection of a pressurized fluid. The pressurizing fluid may include, but is not limited to, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, steam, methane, and\/or mixtures thereof.","In some embodiments, the drive process (for example, the steam injection process) is used to mobilize fluids before the in situ heat treatment process. Steam injection may be used to get hydrocarbons (oil) away from rock or other strata in the formation. The steam injection may mobilize the hydrocarbons without significantly heating the rock.","In some embodiments, fluid injected in the formation (for example, steam and\/or carbon dioxide) may absorb heat from the formation and cool the formation depending on the pressure in the formation and the temperature of the injected fluid. In some embodiments, the injected fluid is used to recover heat from the formation. The recovered heat may be used in surface processing fluids and\/or to preheat other portions of the formation using the drive process.","In some embodiments, heaters are used to preheat the karsted formation or karsted layers to create injectivity in the formation. In situ heat treatment of karsted formations and\/or karsted layers may allow for drive fluid injection, solvent injection and\/or pressurizing fluid injection where it was previously unfavorable or unmanageable. Typically, karsted formations were unfavorable for drive processes because channeling of the fluid injected in the formation inhibited pressure build-up in the formation. In situ heat treatment of karsted formations may allow for injection of a drive fluid, a solvent and\/or a pressurizing fluid by reducing the viscosity of hydrocarbons in the formation and allowing pressure to build in the formations without significant bypass of the fluid through channels in the formations. For example, heating a section of the formation using in situ heat treatment may heat and mobilize heavy hydrocarbons (bitumen) by reducing the viscosity of the heavy hydrocarbons in the karsted layer. Some of the heated less viscous heavy hydrocarbons may flow from the karsted layer into other portions of the formation that are cooler than the heated karsted portion. The heated less viscous heavy hydrocarbons may flow through channels and\/or fractures. The heated heavy hydrocarbons may cool and solidify in the channels, thus creating a temporary seal for the drive fluid, solvent, and\/or pressurizing fluid.","In certain embodiments, the karsted formation or karsted layers are heated to temperatures below the decomposition temperature of minerals in the formation (for example, rock minerals such as dolomite and\/or clay minerals such as kaolinite, illite, or smectite). In some embodiments, the karsted formation or karsted layers are heated to temperatures of at most 400\u00b0 C., at most 450\u00b0 C., or at most 500\u00b0 C. (for example, to a temperature below a dolomite decomposition temperature at formation pressure). In some embodiments, the karsted formation or karsted layers are heated to temperatures below a decomposition temperature of clay minerals (such as kaolinite) at formation pressure.","In some embodiments, heat is preferentially provided to portions of the formation with low weight percentages of clay minerals (for example, kaolinite) as compared to the content of clay in other portions of the formation. For example, more heat may be provided to portions of the formation with at most 1% by weight clay minerals, at most 2% by weight clay minerals, or at most 3% by weight clay minerals than portions of the formation with higher weight percentages of clay minerals. In some embodiments, the rock and\/or clay mineral distribution is assessed in the formation prior to designing a heater pattern and installing the heaters. The heaters may be arranged to preferentially provide heat to the portions of the formation that have been assessed to have lower weight percentages of clay minerals as compared to other portions of the formation. In certain embodiments, the heaters are placed substantially horizontally in layers with low weight percentages of clay minerals.","Providing heat to portions of the formation with low weight percentages of clay minerals may minimize changes in the chemical structure of the clays. For example, heating clays to high temperatures may drive water from the clays and change the structure of the clays. The change in structure of the clay may adversely affect the porosity and\/or permeability of the formation. If the clays are heated in the presence of air, the clays may oxidize and the porosity and\/or permeability of the formation may be adversely affected. Portions of the formation with a high weight percentage of clay minerals may be inhibited from reaching temperatures above temperatures that effect the chemical composition of the clay minerals at formation pressures. For example, portions of the formation with large amounts of kaolinite relative to other portions of the formation may be inhibited from reaching temperatures above 240\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, portions of the formation with a high quantity of clay minerals relative to other portions of the formation may be inhibited from reaching temperatures above 200\u00b0 C., above 220\u00b0 C., above 240\u00b0 C., or above 300\u00b0 C.","In some embodiments, karsted formations may include water. Minerals (for example, carbonate minerals) in the formation may at least partially dissociate in the water to form carbonic acid. The concentration of carbonic acid in the water may be sufficient to make the water acidic. At pressure greater than ambient formation pressures, dissolution of minerals in the water may be enhanced, thus formation of acidic water is enhanced. Acidic water may react with other minerals in the formation such as dolomite (MgCa(CO)) and increase the solubility of the minerals. Water at lower pressures, or non-acidic water, may not solubilize the minerals in the formation. Dissolution of the minerals in the formation may form fractures in the formation. Thus, controlling the pressure and\/or the acidity of water in the formation may control the solubilization of minerals in the formation. In some embodiments, other inorganic acids in the formation enhance the solubilization of minerals such as dolomite.","In some embodiments, the karsted formation or karsted layers are heated to temperatures above the decomposition temperature of minerals in the formation. At temperatures above the minerals decomposition temperature, the minerals may decompose to produce carbon dioxide or other products. The decomposition of the minerals and the carbon dioxide production may create permeability in the formation and mobilize viscous fluids in the formation. In some embodiments, the produced carbon dioxide is maintained in the formation to generate a gas cap in the formation. The carbon dioxide may be allowed to rise to the upper portions of the karsted layers to generate the gas cap.","In some embodiments, the production front of the drive process follows behind the heat front of the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments, areas behind the production front are further heated to produce more fluids from the formation. Further heating behind the production front may also maintain the gas cap behind the production front and\/or maintain quality in the production front of the drive process.","In certain embodiments, the drive process is used before the in situ heat treatment of the formation. In some embodiments, the drive process is used to mobilize fluids in a first section of the formation. The mobilized fluids may then be pushed into a second section by heating the first section with heaters. Fluids may be produced from the second section. In some embodiments, the fluids in the second section are pyrolyzed and\/or upgraded using the heaters.","In formations with low permeabilities, the drive process may be used to create a \u201cgas cushion\u201d or pressure sink before the in situ heat treatment process. The gas cushion may inhibit pressures from increasing quickly to fracture pressure during the in situ heat treatment process. The gas cushion may provide a path for gases to escape or travel during early stages of heating during the in situ heat treatment process.","In some embodiments, the drive process (for example, the steam injection process) is used to mobilize fluids before the in situ heat treatment process. Steam injection may be used to get hydrocarbons (oil) away from rock or other strata in the formation. The steam injection may mobilize the oil without significantly heating the rock.","In some embodiments, injection of a fluid (for example, steam or carbon dioxide) may consume heat in the formation and cool the formation depending on the pressure in the formation. In some embodiments, the injected fluid is used to recover heat from the formation. The recovered heat may be used in surface processing fluids and\/or to preheat other portions of the formation using the drive process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1370","num":"1373"},"figref":"FIG. 184","b":["484","484","484","484","788","206"]},"Heaters  are used to heat the second portion of hydrocarbon layer  to mobilization, visbreaking, and\/or pyrolysis temperatures.

In some embodiments, some of the hydrocarbons produced from the formation are used to provide gas for heaters , if the heaters utilize gas to provide heat to the formation. The amount of electricity and steam generated by facility  may be controlled to vary the production rate and\/or quality of hydrocarbons produced from the first portion and\/or the second portion of hydrocarbon layer . The production rate and\/or quality of hydrocarbons produced from the first portion and\/or the second portion may be varied to produce a selected API gravity in a mixture made by blending the first hydrocarbons with the second hydrocarbons. The first hydrocarbon and the second hydrocarbons may be blended after production to produce the selected API gravity. The production from the first portion and\/or the second portion may be varied in response to changes in the marketplace for either first hydrocarbons, second hydrocarbons, and\/or a mixture of the first and second hydrocarbons.","First hydrocarbons produced from production well A and\/or second hydrocarbons produced from production well B may be used as fuel for facility .

In some embodiments, coke or other hydrocarbon residue produced or removed from the formation (for example, mined from the formation) may provide fuel for facility . The hydrocarbon residue may be gasified or burned in a residue burning facility before providing the hydrocarbons to facility . The residue burning facility may produce hydrocarbon gases (such as natural gas) and\/or other products (such as carbon dioxide or syngas products (synthesis gas products)).

For example, in a karsted formation, different zones or layers in the formation may have different oil saturations, water saturations, porosities, and\/or permeabilities. Some layers may have good steam injectivities while others have near zero steam injectivity. The steam injectivity may depend on the water saturation of the zone and the permeability. Thus, varying the use of the steam injection process and the in situ heat treatment process in these layers may be economically advantageous by, for example, producing more hydrocarbons with less energy input into the formation.

Conduit  may include one or more openings (perforations) to allow fluid to flow into the production conduit. In certain embodiments, the openings in conduit  are in a portion of the conduit that remains below the liquid level in wellbore . For example, the openings are in a horizontal portion of conduit .","Heater  is located in conduit . In some embodiments, heater  is located outside conduit , as shown in . The heater located outside the production conduit may be coupled (strapped) to the production conduit. In some embodiments, more than one heater (for example, two, three, or four heaters) are placed about conduit . The use of more than one heater may reduce bowing or flexing of the production conduit caused by heating on only one side of the production conduit. In an embodiment, heater  is a temperature limited heater. Heater  provides heat to reduce the viscosity of fluid (such as oil or hydrocarbons) in and near wellbore . In certain embodiments, heater  raises the temperature of the fluid in wellbore  up to a temperature of 250\u00b0 C. or less (for example, 225\u00b0 C., 200\u00b0 C., or 150\u00b0 C.). Heater  may be at higher temperatures (for example, 275\u00b0 C., 300\u00b0 C., or 325\u00b0 C.) because the heater provides heat to conduit  and there is some temperature differential between the heater and the conduit. Thus, heat produced from the heater does not raise the temperature of fluids in the wellbore above 250\u00b0 C.","In certain embodiments, heater  includes ferromagnetic materials such as Carpenter Temperature Compensator \u201c32\u201d, Alloy 42-6, Alloy 52, Invar 36, or other iron-nickel or iron-nickel-chromium alloys. In certain embodiments, nickel or nickel-chromium alloys are used in heater . In some embodiments, heater  includes a composite conductor with a more highly conductive material such as copper on the inside of the heater to improve the turndown ratio of the heater. Heat from heater  heats fluids in or near wellbore  to reduce the viscosity of the fluids and increase a production rate through conduit .","In certain embodiments, portions of heater  above the liquid level in wellbore  (such as the vertical portion of the wellbore depicted in ) have a lower maximum temperature than portions of the heater located below the liquid level. For example, portions of heater  above the liquid level in wellbore  may have a maximum temperature of 100\u00b0 C. while portions of the heater located below the liquid level have a maximum temperature of 250\u00b0 C. In certain embodiments, such a heater includes two or more ferromagnetic sections with different Curie temperatures and\/or phase transformation temperature ranges to achieve the desired heating pattern. Providing less heat to portions of wellbore  above the liquid level and closer to the surface may save energy.","In certain embodiments, heater  is electrically isolated on the outside surface of the heater and allowed to move freely in conduit . In some embodiments, electrically insulating centralizers are placed on the outside of heater  to maintain a gap between conduit  and the heater.","In some embodiments, heater  is cycled (turned on and off) so that fluids produced through conduit  are not overheated. In an embodiment, heater  is turned on for a specified amount of time until a temperature of fluids in or near wellbore  reaches a desired temperature (for example, the maximum temperature of the heater). During the heating time (for example, 10 days, 20 days, or 30 days), production through conduit  may be stopped to allow fluids in the formation to \u201csoak\u201d and obtain a reduced viscosity. After heating is turned off or reduced, production through conduit  is started and fluids from the formation are produced without excess heat being provided to the fluids. During production, fluids in or near wellbore  will cool down without heat from heater  being provided. When the fluids reach a temperature at which production significantly slows down, production is stopped and heater  is turned back on to reheat the fluids. This process may be repeated until a desired amount of production is reached. In some embodiments, some heat at a lower temperature is provided to maintain a flow of the produced fluids. For example, low temperature heat (for example, 100\u00b0 C., 125\u00b0 C., or 150\u00b0 C.) may be provided in the upper portions of wellbore  to keep fluids from cooling to a lower temperature.","In some embodiments, a temperature limited heater positioned in a wellbore heats steam that is provided to the wellbore. The heated steam may be introduced into a portion of the formation. In certain embodiments, the heated steam may be used as a heat transfer fluid to heat a portion of the formation. In some embodiments, the steam is used to solution mine desired minerals from the formation. In some embodiments, the temperature limited heater positioned in the wellbore heats liquid water that is introduced into a portion of the formation.","In an embodiment, the temperature limited heater includes ferromagnetic material with a selected Curie temperature and\/or a selected phase transformation temperature range. The use of a temperature limited heater may inhibit a temperature of the heater from increasing beyond a maximum selected temperature (for example, a temperature at or about the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range). Limiting the temperature of the heater may inhibit potential burnout of the heater. The maximum selected temperature may be a temperature selected to heat the steam to above or near 100% saturation conditions, superheated conditions, or supercritical conditions. Using a temperature limited heater to heat the steam may inhibit overheating of the steam in the wellbore. Steam introduced into a formation may be used for synthesis gas production, to heat the hydrocarbon containing formation, to carry chemicals into the formation, to extract chemicals or minerals from the formation, and\/or to control heating of the formation.","A portion of the formation where steam is introduced or that is heated with steam may be at significant depths below the surface (for example, greater than about 1000 m, about 2500 m, or about 5000 m below the surface). If steam is heated at the surface of the formation and introduced to the formation through a wellbore, a quality of the heated steam provided to the wellbore at the surface may have to be relatively high to accommodate heat losses to the wellbore casing and\/or the overburden as the steam travels down the wellbore. Heating the steam in the wellbore may allow the quality of the steam to be significantly improved before the steam is provided to the formation. A temperature limited heater positioned in a lower section of the overburden and\/or adjacent to a target zone of the formation may be used to controllably heat steam to improve the quality of the steam injected into the formation and\/or inhibit condensation along the length of the heater. In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater improves the quality of the steam injected and\/or inhibits condensation in the wellbore for long steam injection wellbores (especially for long horizontal steam injection wellbores).","A temperature limited heater positioned in a wellbore may be used to heat the steam to above or near 100% saturation conditions or superheated conditions. In some embodiments, a temperature limited heater may heat the steam so that the steam is above or near supercritical conditions. The static head of fluid above the temperature limited heater may facilitate producing 100% saturation, superheated, and\/or supercritical conditions in the steam. Supercritical or near supercritical steam may be used to strip hydrocarbon material and\/or other materials from the formation. In certain embodiments, steam introduced into the formation may have a high density (for example, a specific gravity of about 0.8 or above). Increasing the density of the steam may improve the ability of the steam to strip hydrocarbon material and\/or other materials from the formation.","In some embodiments, the tar sands formation may be treated by the in situ heat treatment process to produce pyrolyzed product from the formation. A significant amount of carbon in the form of coke may remain in tar sands formation when production of pyrolysis product from the formation is complete. In some embodiments, the coke in the formation may be utilized to produce heat and\/or additional products from the heated coke containing portions of the formation.","In some embodiments, air, oxygen enriched air, and\/or other oxidants may be introduced into the treatment area that has been pyrolyzed to react with the coke in the treatment area. The temperature of the treatment area may be sufficiently hot to support burning of the coke without additional energy input from heaters. The oxidation of the coke may significantly heat the portion of the formation. Some of the heat may transfer to portions of the formation adjacent to the treatment area. The transferred heat may mobilize fluids in portions of the formation adjacent to the treatment area. The mobilized fluids may flow into and be produced from production wells near the perimeter of the treatment area.","Gases produced from the formation heated by combusting coke in the formation may be at high temperature. The hot gases may be utilized in an energy recovery cycle (for example, a Kalina cycle or a Rankine cycle) to produce electricity.","The air, oxygen enriched air and\/or other oxidants may be introduced into the formation for a sufficiently long period of time to heat a portion of the treatment area to a desired temperature sufficient to allow for the production of synthesis gas of a desired composition. The temperature may be from 500\u00b0 C. to about 1000\u00b0 C. or higher. When the temperature of the portion is at or near the desired temperature, a synthesis gas generating fluid, such as water, may be introduced into the formation to result in the formation of synthesis gas. Synthesis gas produced from the formation may be sent to a treatment facility and\/or be sent through a pipeline to a desired location. During introduction of the synthesis gas generating fluid, the introduction of air, oxygen enriched air, and\/or other oxidants may be stopped, reduced, or maintained. If the temperature of the formation reduces so that the synthesis gas produced from the formation does not have the desired composition, introduction of the syntheses gas generating fluid may be stopped or reduced, and the introduction of air, enriched air and\/or other oxidants may be started or increased so that oxidation of coke in the formation reheats portions of the treatment area. The introduction of oxidant to heat the formation and the introduction of synthesis gas generating fluid to produce synthesis gas may be cycled until all or a significant portion of the treatment area is treated.","In certain embodiments, a subsurface formation is treated in stages. The treatment may be initiated with electrical heating with further heating generated from oxidation of hydrocarbons and hot gas production from the formation. Hydrocarbons (e.g., heavy hydrocarbons and\/or bitumen) may be moved from one portion of the formation to another where the hydrocarbons are produced from the formation. By using a combination of heaters, oxidizing fluid and\/or drive fluid, the overall time necessary to initiate production from a formation may be decreased relative to times necessary to initiate production using heaters and\/or drive processes alone. By controlling a rate of oxidizing fluid injection and\/or drive fluid injection in conjunction with heating with heaters, a relatively uniform temperature distribution may be obtained in sections (portions) of the subsurface formation.","A method for treating a hydrocarbon containing formation with heaters in combination with an oxidizing fluid may include providing heat to a first portion of the formation from a plurality of heaters located in heater wells in the first portion.

The pressure in the formation may be controlled by controlling the production rate of fluids from the formation (for example, the production rate of oxidation gases and\/or syngas products from heater\/gas production wells ). Heating in the formation may be controlled so that there is enough hydrocarbon volume in the formation to maintain the oxidation reactions in the formation. Heating may be controlled so that the formation near the injection wells is at a temperature that will generate desired synthesis gas if a synthesis gas generating fluid such as water is included in the oxidation fluid. Heating in the formation may also be controlled so that enough heat is generated to conductively heat the formation to mobilize, visbreak, and\/or pyrolyze hydrocarbons in adjacent sections of the formation.","The process of injecting oxidizing fluid and\/or water in one section, producing oxidation gases and\/or syngas products in an adjacent section to heat the adjacent section, and producing upgraded hydrocarbons (mobilized, visbroken, and\/or pyrolyzed hydrocarbons) from a subsequent section may be continued in further sections of the tar sands formation.

Catalysts include, but are not limited to, alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal hydrides, alkali metal amides, alkali metal sulfides, alkali metal acetates, alkali metal oxalates, alkali metal formates, alkali metal pyruvates, alkaline-earth metal carbonates, alkaline-earth metal hydroxides, alkaline-earth metal hydrides, alkaline-earth metal amides, alkaline-earth metal sulfides, alkaline-earth metal acetates, alkaline-earth metal oxalates, alkaline-earth metal formates, alkaline-earth metal pyruvates, or commercially available fluid catalytic cracking catalysts, dolomite, silicon-alumina catalyst fines, zeolites, zeolite catalyst fines any catalyst that promotes formation of aromatic hydrocarbons, or mixtures thereof.","In some embodiments, fractions from surface facilities include catalyst fines. Surface facilities may include catalytic cracking units and\/or hydrotreating units. These fractions may be injected in section A to provide a source of catalyst for the section. Injection of the fractions in section A may provide an advantageous method for disposal and\/or upgrading of the fractions as compared to conventional disposal methods for fractions containing catalyst fines.","After injecting catalyst in section A, the average temperature in section A may be increased or maintained in a range from about 250\u00b0 C. to about 700\u00b0 C., from about 300\u00b0 C. to about 650\u00b0 C., or from about 350\u00b0 C. to about 600\u00b0 C. by injection of reaction fluids (for example, oxidizing fluid, steam, water and\/or combinations thereof). In some embodiments, heaters  are used to raise or maintain the temperature in section A in the desired range. In some embodiments, heaters  and the introduction of reaction fluids into section A are used to raise or maintain the temperature in the desired range. Hydrocarbon fluids may be introduced in section A once the desired temperature is obtained. In some embodiments, the catalyst system is slurried with a portion of the hydrocarbons, and the slurry is introduced to section A. In some embodiments, a portion of the hydrocarbon fluids are introduced to section A prior to introduction of the catalyst system. The introduced hydrocarbon fluids may be hydrocarbons in formation fluid from an adjacent portion of the formation, and\/or low value hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons may contact the catalyst system to produce desirable hydrocarbons (for example, visbroken hydrocarbons, cracked hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, or mixtures thereof). The desired temperature in section A may be maintained by turning on heaters in the section and\/or continuous injection of oxidizing fluid to cause exothermic reactions that heat the formation.","In some embodiments, hydrocarbons produced through thermal and\/or catalytic treatment in section A may be used as a diluent and\/or a solvent in the section. The produced hydrocarbons may include aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic enriched diluent may dilute or solubilize a portion of the heavy hydrocarbons in section A and\/or other sections in the formation (for example, sections B and\/or C) and form a mixture. The mixture may be produced from the formation (for example, produced from sections A and\/or C). In some embodiments, the mixture is produced from section B. In some embodiments, the mixture drains to a bottom portion of the section and solubilizes additional hydrocarbons at the bottom of the section. Solubilized hydrocarbons may be produced or mobilized from the formation. In some embodiments, fluids produced in section A (for example, diluent, desirable products, oxidized products, and\/or solubilized hydrocarbons) may be pushed towards section B as shown by the arrows in  by oxidizing fluid, drive fluid, and\/or created drive fluid.","In some embodiments, the temperatures in section A and the generation of drive fluid in section A increases the pressure of section A so the drive fluid pushes fluids through section B into section C. Hot fluids flowing from section A into section B may melt, solubilize, visbreak and\/or crack fluids in section B sufficiently to allow the fluids to move to section C. In section C, the fluids may be upgraded and\/or produced through production wells .","In some embodiments, a portion of the catalyst system from section A enters section B and\/or section C and contacts fluids in the sections. Contact of the catalyst with formation fluids in B and\/or section C may result in the production of hydrocarbons having a lower API gravity than the mobilized fluids.","The fluid mixture formed from contact of hydrocarbons, formation fluid and\/or mobilized fluids with the catalyst system may be produced from the formation. The liquid hydrocarbon portion of the fluid mixture may have an API gravity between 10\u00b0 and 25\u00b0, between 12\u00b0 and 23\u00b0 or between 15\u00b0 and 20\u00b0. In some embodiments, the produced mixture has at most 0.25 grams of aromatics per gram of total hydrocarbons. In some embodiments, the produced mixture includes some of the catalysts and\/or used catalysts.","In some embodiments, contact of the hydrocarbon fluids with the catalyst system produces coke in A. Oxidizing fluid may be introduced into section A. The oxidizing fluid may react with the coke to generate heat that maintains the average temperature of section A in a desired range. For some time intervals, additional oxidizing fluid may be added to section A to increase the oxidation reactions to regenerate catalyst in the section. The reaction of the oxidizing fluid with the coke may reduce the amount of coke and heat formation and\/or catalyst to temperatures sufficient to remove impurities on the catalyst. Coke, nitrogen containing compounds, sulfur containing compounds, and\/or metals such as nickel and\/or vanadium may be removed from the catalyst. Removing impurities from the catalyst in situ may enhance catalyst life. After catalyst regeneration, introduction of reaction fluids may be adjusted to allow section A to return to an average temperature in the desired temperature range. The average temperature in section A may the controlled to be in range from about 250\u00b0 C. to about 700\u00b0 C. Hydrocarbons may be introduced in section A to continue the cycle. Additional catalyst systems may be introduced into the formation as needed.","A method for treating a subsurface formation in stages may include using an in situ heat treatment process in combination with injection of an oxidizing fluid and\/or drive fluid in one or more portions (sections) of the formation. In some embodiments, hydrocarbons are produced from a first portion and\/or a third portion by an in situ heat treatment process. A second portion that separates the first and third portions may be heated with one or more heaters to an average temperature of at least about 100\u00b0 C. The heat provided to the first portion may be reduced or turned off after a selected time. Oxidizing fluid may be injected in the first portion to oxidize hydrocarbons in the first portion and raise the temperature of the first portion. A drive fluid and\/or additional oxidizing fluid may be injected and\/or created in the third portion to cause at least some hydrocarbons to move from the third portion through the second portion to the first portion of the hydrocarbon layer. Injection of the oxidizing fluid in the first portion may be reduced or discontinued and additional hydrocarbons and\/or syngas may be produced from the first portion of the formation. The additional hydrocarbons and\/or syngas may include at least some hydrocarbons from the second and third portions of the formation. Transportation fuel may be produced from the hydrocarbons produced from the first, second and\/or third portions of the formation. In some embodiments, a catalyst system is provided to the first portion and\/or third portion.","In certain embodiments, sections A and C are heated at or near the same time to similar temperatures (for example, pyrolysis temperatures) with heaters . Sections A and C may be heated to mobilize and\/or pyrolyze hydrocarbons in the sections. The mobilized and\/or pyrolyzed hydrocarbons may be produced (for example, through one or more production wells ) from section A and\/or section C. Section B may be heated to lower temperatures (for example, mobilization temperatures) by heaters . Sections D and E may not be heated. Little or no production of hydrocarbons to the surface may take place through section B, section D and\/or section E. For example, sections A and C may be heated to average temperatures of at least about 300\u00b0 C. or at least about 330\u00b0 C. while section B is heated to an average temperature of at least about 100\u00b0 C., sections D and E are not heated and no production wells are operated in section B, section D, and\/or section E. In some embodiments, heat from section A and\/or section C transfers to sections section D and\/or section E.","In some embodiments, heavy hydrocarbons in section B may be heated to mobilization temperatures and flow into sections A and C. The mobilized hydrocarbons may be produce from production wells  in sections A and C. After some or most of the fluids have been produced from sections A and C, production of formation fluids in the sections may be slowed and\/or discontinued.","In certain embodiments, heating and producing hydrocarbons from sections A and C creates fluid injectivity in the sections. After fluid injectivity has been created in section C, an oxidizing fluid may be injected into the section. For example, oxidizing fluid may be injected in section C after a majority of the hydrocarbons have been produced from the section. The fluid may be injected through heaters , production wells , and\/or injection wells located in section C. In some embodiments, heaters  continue to provide heat while the fluid is being injected. In certain embodiments, heaters  may be turned down or off before or during fluid injection.","During injection of oxidant, excess oxidant and\/or oxidation products may be removed from section C through one or more production wells  and\/or heater\/gas production wells. In some embodiments, after the formation is raised to a desired temperature, a second fluid may be introduced into section C. The second fluid may be steam and\/or water. Addition of the second fluid may cool the formation. For example, when the second fluid is steam and\/or water, the reactions of the second fluid with coke and\/or hydrocarbons are endothermic and produce synthesis gas. In some embodiments, oxidizing fluid is added with the second fluid so that some heating of section C occurs simultaneous with the endothermic reactions. In some embodiments, section C is treated in alternating steps of adding oxidant and second fluid to heat the formation for selected periods of time.","In certain embodiments, the pressure of the injected fluids and the pressure section C are controlled to control the heating in the formation. The pressure in section C may be controlled by controlling the production rate of fluids from the section (for example, the production rate of hydrocarbons, oxidation gases and\/or syngas products). Heating in section C may be controlled so that there is enough hydrocarbon volume in the section to maintain the oxidation reactions in the formation. Heating and\/or pressure in section C may also be controlled (for example, by producing a minimal amount of hydrocarbons, oxidation gases and\/or syngas products) so that enough pressure is generated to create fractures in sections adjacent to the section (for example, creation of fractures in section B). Creation of fractures in adjacent sections may allow fluids from adjacent sections to flow into section C and cool the section. Injection of oxidizing fluid may allow portions of the formation below the section heated by heaters to be heated, thus allowing heating of formation fluids in deeper and\/or inaccessible portions of the subsurface to be accessed. Section C may be cooled from temperatures that promote syngas production to temperatures that promote formation of visbroken and\/or upgrade products. Such control of heat and pressure in the section may improve efficiency and quality of products produced from the formation.","During heating of section C or after the section has reached a desired temperature (e.g., temperatures of at least 300\u00b0 C., at least about 400\u00b0 C., or at least about 500\u00b0 C.), an oxidizing fluid and\/or a drive fluid may be injected and\/or created in section A. The drive fluid includes, but is not limited to, steam, water, hydrocarbons, surfactants, polymers, carbon dioxide, air, or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the catalyst system described herein is injected in section A. In some embodiments, the catalyst system is injected prior to injecting the oxidizing fluid. In some embodiments, production of fluid from section A is discontinued prior to injecting fluids in the section. In some embodiments, heater wells in section A are converted to injection wells.","In some embodiments, drive fluids are created in section A. Created drive fluids may include air, steam, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane, pyrolyzed hydrocarbons and\/or diluent. In some embodiments, hydrocarbons (for example, hydrocarbons produced from section A and\/or section C, low value hydrocarbons and\/or or waste hydrocarbon streams) are provided as a portion of the drive fluid. In some embodiments, hydrocarbons are introduced into section A prior to injecting an oxidizing fluid and\/or the second fluid. Oxidation, catalytic cracking, and\/or thermal cracking of introduced hydrocarbon fluids may create the drive fluid and\/or a diluent.","In some embodiments, oxidizing fluid, steam or water are provided as a portion of the drive fluid. The addition of oxidizing fluid, steam, and\/or water in the drive fluid may be used to control temperatures in the sections. For example, the addition of steam or water may be cool the section. In some embodiments, water injected as the drive fluid is turned into steam in the formation due to the higher temperatures in the formation. The conversion of water to steam may be used to reduce temperatures or maintain temperatures in the sections between 270\u00b0 C. and 450\u00b0 C. Maintaining the temperature between 270\u00b0 C. and 450\u00b0 C. may produce higher quality hydrocarbons and\/or generate a minimal amount of non-condensable gases.","Residual hydrocarbons and\/or coke in section A may be melted, visbroken, upgraded and\/or oxidized to produce products that may be pushed towards section B as shown by the arrows in . In some embodiments, the temperature in section C and the generation of drive fluid in section A may increase the pressure of section A so the drive fluid pushes fluids through section B into section C. Hot fluids flowing from section A into section B may melt and\/or visbreak fluids in section B sufficiently to allow the fluids to move to section C. In section C, the fluids may be upgraded and\/or produced through production wells .","In some embodiments, oxidizing fluid injected in section A is controlled to raise the average temperature in the section to a desired temperature (for example, at least about 350\u00b0 C., or at least about 450\u00b0 C.). Injection of oxidizing fluid and\/or drive fluid in section A may continue until most or a substantial portion of the fluids from section A are moved through section B to section C. After a period of time, injection of oxidant and\/or drive fluid into A is slowed and\/or discontinued.","Injection of oxidizing fluid into section C may be slowed or stopped during injection and\/or creation of drive fluid and\/or creation of diluent in section A. In some embodiments, injection of oxidizing fluid in section C is continued to maintain an average temperature in the section of about 500\u00b0 C. during injection and\/or creation of drive fluid and\/or diluent in section A. In some embodiments, the catalyst system is injected in section C.","As section A and\/or section C are treated with oxidizing fluid, heaters in sections D and E may be turned on. In some embodiments, section D is heated through conductive heat transfer from section C and\/or convective heat transfer. Section E may be heated with heaters. For example, an average temperature in section E may be raised to above 300\u00b0 C. while an average temperature in section D is maintained between 80\u00b0 C. and 120\u00b0 C. (for example, at about 100\u00b0 C.).","As temperatures in section E reach a desired temperature (for example, above 300\u00b0 C.), production of formation fluids from section E through production wells  may be started. The temperature may be reached before, during or after oxidizing fluid and\/or drive fluid is injected and\/or drive fluid and\/or diluent is created in section A.","Once the desired temperature in section E has been obtained (for example, above 300\u00b0 C., or above 400\u00b0 C.), production may be slowed and\/or stopped in section C and oxidation fluid and\/or drive fluid is injected and\/or created in section C to move fluids from section C through cooler section D towards section E as shown by the arrows in . Injection and\/or creation of additional oxidation fluid and\/or drive fluid in section C may upgrade hydrocarbons from section B that are in section C and\/or may move fluids towards section E.","In some embodiments, heaters in combination with heating produced by oxidizing hydrocarbons in sections A, C and\/or section E allows for a reduction in the number of heaters to be used in the sections and\/or less capital costs as heaters made of less expensive materials may be used. The heating pattern may be repeated through the formation.","In some embodiments, fluids in hydrocarbon layer  (for example, layers in a tar sands formation) may preferentially move horizontally within the hydrocarbon layer from the point of injection because the layers tend to have a larger horizontal permeability than vertical permeability. The higher horizontal permeability allows the injected fluid to move hydrocarbons between sections preferentially versus fluids draining vertically due to gravity in the formation. Providing sufficient fluid pressure with the injected fluid may ensure that fluids are moved from section A through section B into section C for upgrading and\/or production or from section C through section D into section E for upgrading and\/or production. Increased heating in sections A, C, and E may mobilize fluids from sections B and D into adjacent sections. Increased heating may also mobilize fluids below section A through E and the fluid may flow from the colder sections into the heated sections for upgrading and\/or production due to pressure gradients established by producing fluid from the formation. In some embodiments, one or more production wells are placed in the formation below sections A through E to facilitate production of additional hydrocarbons.","In some embodiments, after sections A and C are heated to desired temperatures, the oxidizing fluid is injected into section C to increase the temperature in the section. The fluids in section C may move through section B into section A as indicated by the arrows in . The fluids may be produced from section A. Once a majority of the fluids have been produced from section A, the treatment process described in  and  may be repeated.","In some embodiments, treating a formation in stages includes heating a first portion from one or more heaters located in the first portion. Hydrocarbons may be produced from the first portion. Heat provided to the first portion may be reduced or turned off after a selected time. A second portion may be substantially adjacent to the first portion. An oxidizing fluid may be injected in the first portion to cause a temperature of the first portion to increase sufficiently to oxidize hydrocarbons in the first portion and a third portion, the third portion being substantially below the first portion. The second portion may be heated from heat provided from the first portion and\/or third portion and\/or one or more heaters located in the second portion such that an average temperature in the second portion is at least about 100\u00b0 C. Hydrocarbons may flow from the second portion into the first portion and\/or third portion. Injection of the oxidizing fluid may be reduced or discontinued in the first portion. The temperature of the first portion may cool to below 600\u00b0 C. to 700\u00b0 C. and additional hydrocarbons may be produced from the first portion of the formation. The additional hydrocarbons may include oxidized hydrocarbons from the first portion, at least some hydrocarbons from the second portion, at least some hydrocarbons from the third portion of the formation, or mixtures thereof. Transportation fuel may be produced from the hydrocarbons produced from the first, second and\/or third portions of the formation.","In some embodiments, in situ heat treatment followed by oxidation and\/or catalyst addition as described for horizontal sections is performed in vertical sections of the formation. Heating a bottom vertical layer followed by oxidation may create microfractures in middle sections thus allowing heavy hydrocarbons to flow from the \u201ccold\u201d middle section to the warmer bottom section. Lighter fluids may flow into the top section and continue to be upgraded and\/or produced through production wells. In some embodiments, two vertical sections are treated with heaters followed by oxidizing fluid.","In some embodiments, heaters in combination with an oxidizing fluid and\/or drive fluid are used in various patterns. For example, cylindrical patterns, square patterns, or hexagonal patterns may be used to heat and produce fluids from a subsurface formation.  and , depict various patterns for treatment of a subsurface formation.  depicts an embodiment of treating a subsurface formation using a cylindrical pattern.  depicts an embodiment of treating multiple sections of a subsurface formation in a rectangular pattern.  is a schematic top view of the pattern depicted in .","Hydrocarbon layer  may be separated into section A and section B. Section A represents a section of the subsurface formation that is to be produced using an in situ heat treatment process. Section B represents a section of formation that surrounds section A and is not heated during the in situ heat treatment process. In certain embodiments, section B has a larger volume than section A and\/or section C. Section A may be heated using heaters  to mobilize and\/or pyrolyze hydrocarbons in the section. The mobilized and\/or pyrolyzed hydrocarbons may be produced (for example, through one or more production wells ) from section A. After some or all of the hydrocarbons in section A have been produced, an oxidizing fluid may be injected into the section. The fluid may be injected through heaters , a production well, and\/or an injection well located in section A. In some embodiments, at least a portion of heaters  are used and\/or converted to injection wells. In some embodiments, heaters  continue to provide heat while the fluid is being injected. In other embodiments, heaters  may be turned down or off before or during fluid injection.","In some embodiments, providing oxidizing fluid such as air to section A causes oxidation of hydrocarbons in the section and in portions of section C. In some embodiments, treatment of section A with the heaters creates coked hydrocarbons and formation with substantially uniform porosity and\/or substantially uniform injectivity so that heating of the section is controllable when oxidizing fluid is introduced to the section. The oxidation of hydrocarbons in section A will maintain the average temperature of the section or increase the average temperature of the section to higher temperatures (for example, above 400\u00b0 C., above 500\u00b0 C., above 600\u00b0 C., or higher).","In some embodiments, an average temperature of section C that is located below section A increases due to heat generated through oxidation of hydrocarbons and\/or coke in section A. For example, an average temperature in section C may increase from formation temperature to above 500\u00b0 C. As the average temperature in section A and\/or section C increases through oxidation reactions, the temperature in section B increases and fluids may be mobilized towards section A as shown by the arrows in  and . In some embodiments, section B is heated by heaters to an average temperature of at least about 100\u00b0 C.","In section A, mobilized hydrocarbons are oxidized and\/or pyrolyzed to produce visbroken, oxidized, pyrolyzed products. For example, cold bitumen in section B may be heated to mobilization temperature of at least about 100\u00b0 C. so that it flows into section A and\/or section C. In section A and\/or section C, the bitumen is pyrolyzed to produce formation fluids. Fluids may be produced through production wells  and\/or heater\/gas production wells in section A. In some embodiments, no fluids are produced from section A during oxidation. Injection of oxidizing fluid may be reduced or discontinued in section A once a desired temperature is reached (for example, a temperature of at least 350\u00b0 C., at least 300\u00b0 C., or above 450\u00b0 C.). Once oxidizing fluid is slowed and\/or discontinued in sections A, C, the sections may cool (e.g. to temperatures below about 700\u00b0 C., about 600\u00b0 C., below 500\u00b0 C. or below 400\u00b0 C.) and remain at upgrading and\/or pyrolysis temperatures for a period of time. Fluids may continue to be upgraded and may be produced from section A through production wells.","In certain embodiments, section B and\/or section D as described in reference to  has a larger volume than section A, section C, and\/or section E. Section B and\/or section D may be larger in volume than the other sections so that more hydrocarbons are produced for less energy input into the formation. Because less heat is provided to section B and\/or section D (the section is heated to lower temperatures), having a larger volume in section B and\/or section D reduces the total energy input to the formation per unit volume. The desired volume of section B and\/or section D may depend on factors such as, but not limited to, viscosity, oil saturation, and permeability. In addition, the degree of coking is much less in section B and\/or section D due to the lower temperature so less hydrocarbons are coked in the formation when section B and\/or section D has a larger volume. In some embodiments, the lower degree of heating in section B and\/or section D allows for cheaper capital costs as lower temperature materials (cheaper materials) may be used for heaters used in section B and\/or section D.","Using the remaining hydrocarbons for heat generation and only using electrical heating for the initial heating stage may improve the overall energy use efficiency of treating the formation. Using electrical heating only in the initial step may decrease the electrical power needs for treating the formation. In addition, forming wells that are used for the combination of production, injection, and heating\/gas production may decrease well construction costs. In some embodiments, hot gases produced from the formation are provided to turbines. Providing the hot gases to turbines may recover some energy and improve the overall energy use efficiency of the process used to treat the formation.","Treating the subsurface formation, as shown by the embodiments of  may utilize carbon remaining after production of mobilized, visbroken, and\/or pyrolyzed hydrocarbons for heat generation in the formation. In some embodiment, treating hydrocarbons in the subsurface formation, as shown in by the embodiments in  creates products having economic value from hydrocarbons having low economic value and\/or from waste hydrocarbon streams from surface facilities.","A downhole heater assembly may include 5, 10, 20, 40, or more heaters coupled together. For example, a heater assembly may include between 10 and 40 heaters. Heaters in a downhole heater assembly may be coupled in series. In some embodiments, heaters in a heater assembly may be spaced from about 8 meters (about 25 feet) to about 60 meters (about 195 feet) apart. For example, heaters in a heater assembly may be spaced about 15 meters (about 50 feet) apart. Spacing between heaters in a heater assembly may be a function of heat transfer from the heaters to the formation. Spacing between heaters may be chosen to limit temperature variation along a length of a heater assembly to acceptable limits. Heaters in a heater assembly may include, but are not limited to, electrical heaters, flameless distributed combustors, natural distributed combustors, and\/or oxidizers.

The non-condensable gases may include combustible gases (for example, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon gases) and noncombustible gases (for example, carbon dioxide). The presence of noncombustible gases may inhibit coking of the fuel and\/or may reduce the flame zone temperature of oxidizers when the fuel is used as fuel for oxidizers of downhole oxidizer assemblies. The reduced flame zone temperature may inhibit formation of NOx compounds and\/or other undesired combustion products by the oxidizers.

After oxidizer ignition, steps may be taken to reduce coking. For example, steam or water may be added to the fuel conduit. In some embodiments, coking is inhibited by decreasing a residence time of fuel in the fuel conduit. The residence time of fuel in the fuel conduit may be decreased by varying the size of the fuel conduit. For example, one portion of the fuel conduit may be approximately \u00be inch (approximately 1.9 cm) in diameter while another portion may be approximately \u215c inch (approximately 0.95 cm) in diameter. Alternatively, the thickness and length of all or portions of the fuel conduit may be varied.","In some embodiments, coking is inhibited by insulating portions of the fuel conduit that pass through high temperature zones proximate the oxidizers.

(about 1300\u00b0 F.).","Oxidant may be supplied through the oxidant conduit to the oxidizers. Oxidizing fluid may include, but is not limited to, air, oxygen enriched air, and\/or hydrogen peroxide. Depletion of oxygen in the oxidant may occur toward a terminal end of an oxidizer assembly. In some embodiments, the amount of excess oxidant supplied to the oxidizers is reduced to less than about 50% excess oxidant by weight by controlling the pressure, temperature, and flow rate of the oxidant in the oxidant conduit. For example, after ignition, the amount of oxidant can be reduced when the temperature of the fuel conduit reaches about 650\u00b0 C. (about 1200\u00b0 F.). In some embodiments, the amount of excess oxidant is reduced to less than about 25% excess oxidant by weight. In other embodiments, the amount of excess oxidant is reduced to less than about 10% excess oxidant by weight.","In some embodiments, the amount of excess oxidant is reduced when the temperature downstream of the oxidizers becomes sufficiently hot to support reaction of oxidant and fuel outside of the oxidizers. Oxidant and fuel may react in regions between oxidizers. During such operation, the oxidizer assembly functions much like a flameless distributed combustor. Generating heat in the regions between the oxidizers may result in a smoother temperature profile along the length of the oxidizer assembly. The excess oxidant may be reduced such that the last oxidizer in the oxidizer assembly substantially eliminates the remaining oxidant in the oxidant conduit. The last oxidizer may be a catalytic oxidizer to minimize or eliminate oxidant remaining in the oxidant conduit.","When the temperature along the length of the oxidizer assembly increases to a temperature sufficient to support reaction of oxidant with fuel outside of the shields of the oxidizers, the mode of operation of the oxidizer assembly may shift from a series of individual oxidizers with aerodynamically staged flames to a more uniformly distributed or \u201creactor-stable\u201d mode of operation. During the reactor-stable mode of operation, combustion may take place outside the shield along the entire length of the oxidant conduit. Under this condition stability is achieved by balancing overall heat loss and heat generation over the broad reaction zone. Local recirculation of hot combustion products to incoming reactants enables minimum reaction temperature where fuel-oxidant mixtures will oxidize without aerodynamic stabilization. In this mode of operation, the oxidizers may still serve as a \u201csafety\u201d or means of continuing stabilization, if the temperature falls below the temperature needed to sustain oxidation of the fuel and oxidant in one or more regions of the oxidizer. During reactor-stable mode of operation, the amount of excess oxygen supplied to the oxidizer assembly may be reduced. Having the ability to reduce the amount of excess oxygen supplied to the oxidizer assembly may significantly improve the overall economics of the system used to heat the formation.","A common problem associated with the operation of gas burners employing a flame mechanism is that at high temperatures, particularly above about 1500\u00b0 C. (about 2730\u00b0 F.), oxygen and nitrogen present in the air combine by a thermal formation mechanism to form pollutants such as NO and NO, commonly referred to as NO. By controlling the flow of fuel and oxidant, and by maintaining a distributed temperature, the formation of NOmay be inhibited. In some embodiments, the flow of fuel and oxidant is controlled to produce less than about 10 parts per million by weight of NOfrom the gas burner. The flow of oxidant may be controlled by having openings in shields of the oxidizers sized to bring a sufficient flow rate to the flame zone to dilute the flame without causing the flame to be extinguished. Additionally, water added to the fuel conduit may inhibit NOformation.","In some embodiments, initiation of the burner assembly is accomplished by initializing combustion in a specified sequence beginning with the last oxidizer in the assembly. Referring to , oxidizer assembly  includes first oxidizer , last oxidizer , and second-to-last oxidizer . In some embodiments, fuel is supplied through fuel conduit , and oxidant is supplied through oxidant conduit  to provide a first combustible mixture to last oxidizer . Combustion is initiated in last oxidizer  and the supply of oxidant is adjusted to supply second-to-last oxidizer  with a second combustible mixture. Ignition of last oxidizer  is maintained as second-to-last oxidizer  is ignited. Thereafter this process of adjusting the supply of oxidant to provide a combustible fuel and oxidant mixture to the next unignited oxidizer and initiating combustion in the unignited oxidizer is repeated until first oxidizer  is ignited. In some embodiments, the fuel pressure is greater than the oxidant pressure at an oxidizer before initiating combustion in the oxidizer.","In an embodiment, the start up sequence is optimized by controlling the oxidant and fuel pressure differential along the length of the oxidizer assembly. Because the pressure differential varies over the length of the burner assembly, a planned sequential ignition from oxidizer to oxidizer, starting with last (most remote) oxidizer  may be achieved. In this embodiment, the fuel-oxidant mixture in the ignition region is optimized at last oxidizer , then at the second to last oxidizer , and so on, with the fuel-to-oxidant ratio being least optimal at first oxidizer . The profiles may be controlled to change the sequence of ignition. In an embodiment, the profiles may be reversed so that first oxidizer  is ignited first. Altering the profiles may comprise altering the pressure differential along the oxidizer assembly length by design of the fuel conduit diameter coupled with optimization of opening sizes that provide fuel to the oxidizers, of opening sizes that provide oxidant to the mix chambers of the oxidizers, and of openings in the shields that supply oxidant to the flame zone.

During heating, thermal expansion causing by the temperature difference between the outer relatively cool surface of insulating sleeve \u2032 and the inner surface of the insulating sleeve \u2032 may cause separation between the first portion of the insulating sleeve \u2032 and the second portion of the insulating sleeve. The separation may occur adjacent to the overburden portion of heater  above packer . Heat loss to the overburden may not cause much of an energy efficiency impact for the system.

The flow switcher may change the downward flow from the inner conduit to the annular region between the outer conduit and the inner conduit. The flow switcher may also change the upward flow from the inner conduit to the annular region. The use of the flow switcher may allow the heater to operate at a higher temperature adjacent to the treatment area without increasing the initial temperature of the heat transfer fluid provided to the heaters.","For vertical, slanted or L-shaped heaters where the flow of heat transfer fluid is directed down the inlet conduit and returns through the annular region between the inlet conduit and the outlet conduit, a temperature gradient may form in the heater with the hottest portion being located at a distal end of the heater.

For vertical or slanted heaters, flow switchers in selected heaters may allow the heaters to be arranged with the hottest portions used to heat the formation of first heaters adjacent to coldest portions used to heat the formation of second heaters.

In some embodiments, the entire ring of the treatment area, or a portion of the treatment area is treated in sections. For example, central circulation system or central circulation systems  may supply heat transfer fluid to a first set of heaters. The first set of heaters, along with a second set of return heaters may treat a first section of about one eighth (or 45\u00b0) of the treatment area. Other section sizes may be chosen. The heat transfer fluid from central circulation system or central circulation systems  may be received by one or more outer circulation systems \u2032. One or more outer circulation systems \u2032 may provide heat transfer fluid return to central circulation system or central circulation systems .

Changing the direction of heat transfer fluid flow through the formation allows each end of a u-shaped wellbore to initially receive the heat transfer fluid at the hottest temperature of the heat transfer fluid for a period of time, which may result in more uniform heating of the formation. The direction of heat transfer fluid may be changed at desired time intervals. The desired time interval may be about a year, about six months, about three months, about two months or any other desired time interval.","Gas at high pressure may be used as the heat transfer fluid in the circulation system. In some embodiments, the heat transfer fluid is carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is chemically stable at the required temperatures and pressures and has a relatively high molecular weight that results in a high volumetric heat capacity. Other fluids such as steam, air, helium and\/or nitrogen may also be used. The pressure of the heat transfer fluid entering the formation may be 3000 kPa or higher. The use of high pressure heat transfer fluid allows the heat transfer fluid to have a greater density, and therefore a greater capacity to transfer heat. Also, the pressure drop across the heaters is less for a system where the heat transfer fluid enters the heaters at a first pressure for a given mass flow rate than when the heat transfer fluid enters the heaters at a second pressure at the same mass flow rate when the first pressure is greater than the second pressure.","In some embodiments, a liquid heat transfer fluid is used as the heat transfer fluid. The liquid heat transfer fluid may be natural or synthetic oil, molten metal, molten salt, or other type of high temperature heat transfer fluid. A liquid heat transfer fluid may allow for smaller diameter piping and reduced pumping\/compression costs. In some embodiments, the piping is made of a material resistant to corrosion by the liquid heat transfer fluid. In some embodiments, the piping is lined with a material that is resistant to corrosion by the liquid heat transfer fluid. For example, if the heat transfer fluid is a molten fluoride salt, the piping may include a 10 mil thick nickel liner. The piping may be formed by roll bonding a nickel strip onto a strip of the piping material (for example, stainless steel), rolling the composite strip, and longitudinally welding the composite strip to form the piping. Other techniques may also be used. Corrosion of nickel by the molten fluoride salt may be less than 1 mil per year at a temperature of about 840\u00b0 C.","As depicted in , heat transfer fluid circulation system  may include heat supply , first heat exchanger , second heat exchanger , and fluid movers . Heat supply  heats the heat transfer fluid to a high temperature. Heat supply  may be a furnace, solar collector, chemical reactor, nuclear reactor, fuel cell, and\/or other high temperature source able to supply heat to the heat transfer fluid. If the heat transfer fluid is a gas, fluid movers  may be compressors. If the heat transfer fluid is a liquid, fluid movers  may be pumps.","After exiting formation , the heat transfer fluid passes through first heat exchanger  and second heat exchanger  to fluid movers . First heat exchanger  transfers heat between heat transfer fluid exiting formation  and heat transfer fluid exiting fluid movers  to raise the temperature of the heat transfer fluid that enters heat supply  and reduce the temperature of the fluid exiting formation . Second heat exchanger  further reduces the temperature of the heat transfer fluid. In some embodiments, second heat exchanger  includes or is a storage tank for the heat transfer fluid.","Heat transfer fluid passes from second heat exchanger  to fluid movers . Fluid movers  may be located before heat supply  so that the fluid movers do not have to operate at a high temperature.","In an embodiment, the heat transfer fluid is carbon dioxide. Heat supply  is a furnace that heats the heat transfer fluid to a temperature in a range from about 700\u00b0 C. to about 920\u00b0 C., from about 770\u00b0 C. to about 870\u00b0 C., or from about 800\u00b0 C. to about 850\u00b0 C. In an embodiment, heat supply  heats the heat transfer fluid to a temperature of about 820\u00b0 C. The heat transfer fluid flows from heat supply  to heaters .

In an embodiment, the temperature of the heat transfer fluid exiting formation  is about 480\u00b0 C. The metallurgy of the piping used to form heat transfer fluid circulation system  may be varied to significantly reduce costs of the piping. High temperature steel may be used from heat supply  to a point where the temperature is sufficiently low so that less expensive steel can be used from that point to first heat exchanger . Several different steel grades may be used to form the piping of heat transfer fluid circulation system .","In an embodiment, the heat transfer fluid is a molten salt, such as solar salt. Heat supply is a furnace that heats the heat transfer fluid to a temperature of about 560\u00b0 C. The return temperature of the heat transfer fluid may be from about 350\u00b0 C. to about 450\u00b0 C. Piping from heat transfer fluid circulation system  may be insulated and\/or heat traced to facilitate startup and to ensure fluid flow.","In some embodiments, the diameter of the conduit through which the heat transfer fluid flows in overburden  may be smaller than the diameter of the conduit through the treatment area. For example, the diameter of the pipe in the overburden may be about 3 inches, and the diameter of the piping adjacent to the treatment area may be about 5 inches. The smaller diameter pipe through overburden  may allow for less heat transfer to the overburden. Reducing the amount of heat transfer to overburden  reduces the amount of cooling of the heat transfer fluid supplied to the conduit adjacent to hydrocarbon layer . The increased heat transfer in the smaller diameter pipe due to increased velocity of heat transfer fluid through the small diameter pipe is offset by the smaller surface area of the smaller diameter pipe and the decrease in residence time of the heat transfer fluid in the smaller diameter pipe.","Heat transfer fluid from heat supply  of heat transfer fluid circulation system  passes through overburden  of formation  to hydrocarbon layer . Portions of heaters  extending through overburden  may be insulated. In some embodiments, the insulation or part of the insulation is a polyimide insulating material. Inlet portions of heaters  in hydrocarbon layer  may have tapering insulation to reduce overheating of the hydrocarbon layer near the inlet of the heater into the hydrocarbon layer.","The overburden section may be insulated to prevent or inhibit heat loss into non-hydrocarbon bearing zones of the formation. Thermal insulation may be provided by a conduit-in-conduit design. The heat transfer fluid flows through the inner conduit. Insulation fills the space between the inner conduit and outer conduit. An effective insulation may be a combination of metal foil to inhibit radiative heat loss and microporous silica powder to inhibit conductive heat loss. Reducing the pressure in the space between the inner conduit and the outer conduit by pulling a vacuum during assembly and\/or with getters may further reduce heat losses when using the conduit-in-conduit configuration. To account for the differential thermal expansion of the inner conduit and the outer conduit, the inner conduit may be pre-stressed or made of a material with low thermal expansion (for example, Invar). The insulated conduit-in-conduit may be installed continuously in conjunction with coiled tubing installation. Insulated conduit-in-conduit systems may be available from Industrial Thermo Polymers Limited (Ontario, Canada), and Oil Tech Services, Inc. (Houston, Tex., U.S.A.).

The heat of the piping may significantly reduce the strength of the piping since Young's modulus and other strength characteristics vary with temperature. The high temperatures of the piping may raise creep concerns, may cause buckling conditions, and may move the piping from the elastic deformation region to the plastic deformation region.","Heating the piping will cause thermal expansion of the piping. For long heaters placed in the wellbore, the heater may expand 20 m or more. In some embodiments, the horizontal portion of the heater is cemented in the formation with thermally conductive cement. Care may need to be taken to ensure that there are no significant gaps in the cement so that piping does not expand in the gaps and fail.

Lifting systems  may be coupled to insulated portions  above wellheads . A non-reactive gas (for example, nitrogen and\/or carbon dioxide) may be introduced in subsurface annular region  between casings  and insulated portions  to inhibit gaseous formation fluid from rising to wellhead  and to provide an insulating gas blanket. Insulated portions  may be conduit-in-conduits with the heat transfer fluid of the circulation system flowing through the inner conduit. The outer conduit of each insulated portion  may be at a significantly lower temperature than the inner conduit. The lower temperature of the outer conduit allows the outer conduits to be used as a load bearing member for lifting heater . Differential expansion between the outer pipe and the inner pipe may be mitigated by internal bellows and\/or by sliding seals.","Lifting systems  may include hydraulic lifters, powered coiled tubing rigs, and\/or counterweight systems capable of supporting heater  and moving insulated portions  into or out of the formation. When lifting systems  include hydraulic lifters, the outer conduits of insulated portions  may be kept cool at the hydraulic lifters by dedicated slick transition joints. The hydraulic lifters may include two sets of slips. The first set of slips may be coupled to the heater. The hydraulic lifters may maintain a constant pressure against the heater for the full stroke of the hydraulic cylinder. The second set of slips may periodically be set against the outer conduit while the stroke of the hydraulic cylinder is reset. Lifting systems  may also include strain gauges and control systems. The strain gauges may be attached to the outer conduit of insulated portions , or the strain gauges may be attached to the inner conduits of the insulated portions below the insulation. Attaching the strain gauges to the outer conduit may be easier and the attachment may be more reliable.","Before heating begins, set points for the control systems may be established by using lifting systems  to lift heater  so that portions of the heater contact casing  in the bend portions of wellbore . The strain when heater  is lifted may be used as the set point for the control system. In other embodiments, the set point may be chosen in a different manner. When heating begins, heater portion  will begin expanding and some of the heater section will advance horizontally. If the expansion forces portions of heater  against casing , the weight of the heater will be supported at the contact points of insulated portions  and the casing. The strain measured by lifting system  will go towards zero. Additional thermal expansion may cause heater  to buckle and fail. Instead of allowing heater  to press against casing , hydraulic lifters of lifting systems  may move sections of insulated portions  upwards and out of the formation to keep the heater against the top of the casing. The control systems of lifting systems  may lift heater  to maintain the strain measured by the strain gauges near the set point value. Lifting system  may also be used to reintroduce insulated portions  into the formation when the formation cools to avoid damage to heater  during thermal contraction.","Thermal expansion of the heater may be complete in a relatively short time frame. In some embodiments, the position of the heater is fixed relative to the wellbore after thermal expansion is completed. The lifting systems may be removed from the heaters and used on other heaters that have not yet been heated. Lifting systems may be reattached to the heaters when the formation is cooled to accommodate thermal contraction of the heaters.","In some embodiments, the lifting systems may be controlled based on the hydraulic pressure of the lifters. Change in the tension of the pipe may result in a change in the hydraulic pressure. The control system may maintain the hydraulic pressure substantially at a set point hydraulic pressure to provide accommodation of thermal expansion of the heater in the formation.","In some embodiments, the circulation system uses a liquid to heat the formation. The use of liquid heat transfer fluid may allow for high overall energy efficiency for the system as compared to electrical heating or gas heaters due to the high energy efficiency of heat supplies used to heat the liquid heat transfer fluid. If furnaces are used to heat the liquid heat transfer fluid, the carbon dioxide footprint of the process may be reduced as compared to electrically heating or using gas burners positioned in wellbores due to the efficiencies of the furnaces. If nuclear power is used to heat the liquid heat transfer fluid, the carbon dioxide footprint of the process may be significantly reduced or eliminated. The surface facilities for the heating system may be formed from commonly available industrial equipment in simple layouts. The commonly available equipment in simple layouts increases the overall reliability of the system.","The liquid heat transfer fluid may be a molten salt or other liquid that has the potential to solidify if the temperature becomes too low. A secondary heating system may be needed to ensure that heat transfer fluid remains in liquid form and that the heat transfer fluid is at a temperature that allows the heat transfer fluid to flow through the heaters by the circulation system. The secondary heating system may not heat the heater and\/or the heat transfer fluid to a high temperature, but only to a temperature sufficient to melt and ensure flowability of the heat transfer fluid. The secondary heating system may only be needed for a short period of time during startup and or re-startup of the fluid circulation system. In some embodiments, the secondary heating system is removable from the heater. In some embodiments, the secondary heating systems are not made to last for the life of the heater.","In an embodiment, molten salt is used as the heat transfer fluid. Insulated return storage tanks receive return molten salt from the formation. Temperatures in the return storage tanks may be in the vicinity of about 350\u00b0 C. Pumps may move the molten salt to furnaces. Each of the pumps may need to move from 4 kg\/s to 30 kg\/s of the molten salt. Each furnace may provide heat to molten salt. The molten salt may pass from the piping to insulated feed storage tanks. Exit temperatures of the molten salt from the furnaces may be about 550\u00b0 C. The molten salt may pass from the furnaces to insulated feed storage tanks. Each feed storage stank may supply molten salt to 50 or more piping systems that enter into the formation. The molten salt flows through the formation and to return storage tanks. The furnaces may have efficiencies that are 90% or greater. Heat loss to the overburden may be 8% or less.","In some embodiments, the heaters for the circulation systems include insulation along the lengths of the heaters, including portions of the heaters that will be used to heat the treatment area. The insulation may facilitate insertion of the heaters into the formation. The insulation adjacent to portions that are to be used to heat the treatment area may be sufficient to provide insulation during preheating, but may decompose at temperatures provided by the heat transfer fluid during steady operation of the circulation system. In some embodiments, the insulation layer changes the emissivity of the heater so that radiative heat transfer from the heater is inhibited. After decomposition of the insulation, the emissivity of the heater may promote radiative heat transformation to the treatment area. The insulation may reduce the time needed to raise the temperature of the heaters and\/or the heat transfer fluid in the heaters to temperatures sufficient to ensure melt and flowability. In some embodiments, the insulation adjacent to portions of the heaters that will heat the treatment area may include polymer coatings. Insulation of portions of the heaters adjacent to the overburden is different than the insulation of the heaters adjacent to the portions of the heaters that are to heat the treatment area. The insulation of the heaters adjacent to the overburden is able to survive for the life of the heaters.","In some embodiments, degradable insulation material (for example, a polymer foam) may be introduced into the wellbore after or during placement of the heater. The degradable insulation may provide insulation adjacent to the portions of the heaters that are to heat the treatment area during preheating. The liquid heat transfer fluid used to heat the treatment area may raise the temperature sufficiently of the heater enough to degrade and eliminate the insulation layer.","In some embodiments, the secondary heating system may electrically heat the heaters of the fluid circulation system. In some embodiments, electricity is applied directly to the heat transfer fluid conduit to resistively heat the heat transfer fluid conduit. Directly heating the heat transfer fluid conduit may require large current because of the relatively low resistance of the heat transfer fluid conduit. A return current path may be needed.","In some embodiments, the heat transfer fluid conduit may include ferromagnetic material that allows the effective resistance of the heat transfer fluid conduit to be high due to the skin effect heating when time varying current is applied to the heat transfer fluid conduit. For example, the heat transfer fluid conduit may be made of steel with 9% to 13% by weight chromium, such as 410 stainless steel. A return current path may be needed.","Resistively heating the heater may require special considerations. Wellheads may need to include isolation flanges to ensure that the current path travels down the subsurface conduits and not through the surface pipe manifolds. Also, casings in the formation may need to be made of a non-ferromagnetic material (for example, non-ferromagnetic high manganese steel, fiberglass, or carbon fiber) to inhibit induction that heats the casing and surrounding formation. In some embodiments, the overburden section of the heater is a conduit-in-conduit configuration with a thermal barrier between the conduits. The insulation may limit the amount of heat transferred to the inner conduit and the molten salt. Making the outer conduit of a non-ferromagnetic material may allow for distribution of current between the inner conduit and the outer conduit that allows for adequate heating of the inner conduit and salt.

The current flowing through the insulated conductors may be used to induce currents in the heater so that the heater is resistively heated. In some embodiments, the insulated conductors may be wrapped with a coil that is inductively heated. The coil may be made of a material that has a Curie temperature limit or phase transition temperature limit slightly higher than the temperature needed to ensure melt and flowability of heat transfer fluid in the heaters.","In some embodiments, insulated conductors used as current paths or as heaters may be removable from heaters. After heat transfer fluid circulation in a heater is initiated and stabilizes, the heat transfer fluid will heat the adjacent formation to temperatures above the temperature needed to ensure melt and flowability of the heat transfer fluid. The heat of the formation and the heat of the heat transfer fluid may be sufficient to ensure melt and flowability of the heat transfer fluid should the circulation system temporarily be interrupted (for example, for a day, a week, or a month). For heaters with the insulated conductor positioned in the heater, the insulated conductors may be pulled out of the heater through seals in the wellhead that allow for electrical connection to the insulated conductors. The insulated conductors may be coiled and reused in heaters that have not been preheated. Should it be necessary, insulated conductor heaters may be reintroduced into the heaters.","In some embodiments of circulation systems that use molten salt or other liquid as the heat transfer fluid, the heater may be a single conduit in the formation. The conduit may be preheated to a temperature sufficient to ensure flowability of the heat transfer fluid. In some embodiments, a secondary heat transfer fluid is circulated through the conduit to preheat the conduit and\/or the formation adjacent to the conduit. After the temperature of the conduit and\/or the formation adjacent to the conduit is sufficiently hot, the fluid may be flushed from the conduit and the heat transfer fluid may be circulated through the pipe. In some embodiments, aqueous solutions of the salt composition that is to be used as the heat transfer fluid are used to preheat the conduit. The composition of the salt and\/or the pressure of the system may be adjusted to inhibit boiling of the aqueous solution as the temperature is increased. When the conduit is preheated to a temperature sufficient to ensure flowability of the molten salt, the remaining water may be removed from the aqueous solution to leave only the molten salt. The water may be removed by evaporation while the salt solution is in a storage tank of the circulation system. After the heater is raised to a temperature sufficient to ensure continued flow of heat transfer fluid through the heater, a vacuum may be drawn on the passageway for the second heat transfer fluid to inhibit heat transfer from the first passageway to the second passageway. In some embodiments, the passageway for the second heat transfer fluid is filled with insulating material and\/or is otherwise blocked.","In some embodiments of circulation systems that use molten salt or other liquid as the heat transfer fluid, the heater may have a conduit-in-conduit configuration. The liquid heat transfer fluid used to heat the formation may flow through a first passageway through the heater. A second heat transfer flow may flow through a second passageway through the conduit-in-conduit heater for preheating and\/or for flow assurance of the liquid heat transfer fluid. The passageways in the conduit of the conduit-in-conduit heater may include the inner conduit and the annular region between the inner conduit and the outer conduit.

In some embodiments, outer conduit  is heated by a secondary heat transfer fluid flowing through annular region  (for example, carbon dioxide or exhaust gas) before the heat transfer fluid that is to be used to heat the formation is introduced into the annular region. If exhaust gas or other high temperature fluid is used, another heat transfer fluid (for example, water or steam) may need to be passed through the heater to reduce the temperature below the upper working temperature limit of the liquid heat transfer fluid. The secondary heat transfer fluid may be displaced from the annular region when the liquid heat transfer fluid is introduced into the heater. The secondary heat transfer fluid in inner conduit  may be the same fluid or a different fluid than the secondary fluid used to preheat outer conduit  during preheating. Using two different secondary heat transfer fluids may allow for the identification of integrity problems in heater . Any integrity problems may be identified and fixed before the use of the molten salt is initiated.","In some embodiments, the secondary heat transfer fluid that flows through annular region  during preheating is an aqueous mixture of the salt to be used during normal operation.

Flowing secondary heat transfer fluid through inner pipe  may pre-heat heater  and ensure flow when liquid heat transfer fluid is first used and\/or when flow needs to be restarted after a stop of circulation. The large outer surface area of outer conduit  provides a large surface area for heat transfer to the formation, while still allowing for reduced amount of liquid heat transfer fluid needed for the circulation system because of the presence of inner conduit . The circulated liquid heat transfer fluid may deliver a better power injection rate distribution to the treatment area due to increased velocity of the liquid heat transfer fluid for the same mass flow rate. Reliability of the heater may be improved.","Having a conduit-in-conduit heater configuration allows flow switchers to be used that change the flow of heat transfer fluid in the heater from flow through the annular region between the outer conduit and the inner conduit while adjacent to the treatment area to flow through the inner conduit while adjacent to the overburden.  depicts a schematic representation of conduit-in-conduit heaters  that are used with fluid circulation systems , \u2032 to heat treatment area .

Table 2 shows the composition, melting point and upper temperature limit of several salt compositions. The lower melting temperature of the tertiary salt mixtures may decrease the preheating requirements and allow the use of pressurized water as a heat transfer fluid for preheating the piping of the circulation system. The corrosion rates of the metal of the heaters due to the tertiary salt compositions at 550\u00b0 C. is comparable to the corrosion rate of the metal of the heaters due to solar salt at 565\u00b0 C.","A portion of the heat input into a treatment area using circulated heat transfer fluid may recovered after the in suit heat treatment process is completed. Initially, the same heat transfer fluid used to heat the treatment area may be circulated through the formation without the heat source reheating the heat transfer fluid so that the heat transfer fluid absorbs heat from the treatment area.

Heating may be continued until fluid communication between heater wells and producer wells is established and a relatively large amount of coke develops around the heater wells. Circulation may be stopped and one or more of the conduits may be perforated. In an embodiment, the heater includes a perforated outer conduit and an inner liner that is chemically resistant to the heat transfer fluid. When heat transfer fluid is stopped, the liner may be withdrawn or chemically dissolved to allow fluid flow from the heater into the formation. In other embodiments, perforation guns may be used in the piping after flow of circulated heat transfer fluid is stopped. Nitrate salts or other oxidizers may be introduced into the formation through the perforations. The nitrate salts or other oxidizers may oxidize the coke to finish heating the reservoir to desired temperatures. The concentration and amount of nitrate salts or other oxidizers introduced into the formation may be controlled to control the heating of the formation. Oxidizing the coke in the formation may heat the formation efficiently and reduce the time for heating the formation to a desired temperature. Oxidation product gases may convectively transfer heat in the formation and provide a gas drive that moves formation fluid towards the production wells.","In some embodiments, nuclear energy is used to heat the heat transfer fluid used in a circulation system to heat a portion of the formation. Heat supply  in  may be a pebble bed reactor or other type of nuclear reactor, such as a light water reactor or a fissile metal hydride reactor. The use of nuclear energy provides a heat source with little or no carbon dioxide emissions. Also, in some embodiments, the use of nuclear energy is more efficient because energy losses resulting from the conversion of heat to electricity and electricity to heat are avoided by directly utilizing the heat produced from the nuclear reactions without producing electricity.","In some embodiments, a nuclear reactor heats a heat transfer fluid such as helium. For example, helium flows through a pebble bed reactor, and heat transfers to the helium. The helium may be used as the heat transfer fluid to heat the formation.

The portion of the subsurface formation may be part of a hydrocarbon treatment area. As opposed to using a nuclear reactor facility to heat a heat transfer fluid, which is then provided to the subsurface formation to heat the subsurface formation, one or more self-regulating nuclear heaters may be positioned underground to directly heat the subsurface formation. The self-regulating nuclear reactor may be positioned in or proximate to one or more tunnels.","In some embodiments, treatment of the subsurface formation requires heating the formation to a desired initial upper range (for example, between about 250\u00b0 C. and 350\u00b0 C.). After heating the subsurface formation to the desired temperature range, the temperature may be maintained in the range for a desired time (for example, until a percentage of hydrocarbons have been pyrolyzed or an average temperature in the formation reaches a selected value). As the formation temperature rises, the heater temperature may be slowly lowered over a period of time. Currently, certain nuclear reactors described (for example, nuclear pebble reactors), upon activation, reach a natural heat output limit of about 900\u00b0 C., eventually decaying as the uranium-235 fuel is depleted and resulting in lower temperatures at the heater produced over time. The natural energy output curve of certain nuclear reactors (for example, nuclear pebble reactors) may be used to provide a desired heating versus time profile for certain subsurface formations.","In some embodiments, nuclear energy is provided by a self-regulating nuclear reactor (for example, a pebble bed reactor or a fissile metal hydride reactor). The self-regulating nuclear reactor may not exceed a certain temperature based upon its design. The self-regulating nuclear reactor may be substantially compact relative to traditional nuclear reactors.

The small size and simple construction of the self-regulating nuclear reactor may have distinct advantages, especially relative to conventional commercial nuclear reactors used commonly throughout the world today. Advantages may include relative ease of manufacture, transportability, security, safety, and financial feasibility. The compact design of self-regulating nuclear reactors may allow for the reactor to be constructed at one facility and transported to a site of use, such as a hydrocarbon containing formation. Upon arrival and installation, the self-regulating nuclear reactor may be activated.","Self-regulating nuclear reactors may produce thermal power on the order of tens of megawatts per unit. Two or more self-regulating nuclear reactors may be used at the hydrocarbon containing formation. Self-regulating nuclear reactors may operate at a fuel temperature ranging between about 450\u00b0 C. and about 900\u00b0 C., between about 500\u00b0 C. and about 800\u00b0 C., or between about 550\u00b0 C. and about 650\u00b0 C.

Energy extraction system  may function to extract energy in the form of heat produced by the activated nuclear reactor. The energy extraction system may include a heat transfer fluid that circulates through piping A and B. At least a portion of the tubing may be positioned in the core of the nuclear reactor. A fluid circulation system may function to continuously circulate heat transfer fluid through the piping. Density and volume of piping positioned in the core may be dependent on the enrichment of the fissile metal hydride.","In some embodiments, the energy extraction system includes alkali metal (for example, potassium) heat pipes. Heat pipes may further simplify the self-regulating nuclear reactor by eliminating the need for mechanical pumps to convey a heat transfer fluid through the core. Any simplification of the self-regulating nuclear reactor may decrease the chances of any malfunctions and increase the safety of the nuclear reactor. The energy extraction system may include a heat exchanger coupled to the heat pipes. Heat transfer fluids may convey thermal energy from the heat exchanger.","The dimensions of the nuclear reactor may be determined by the enrichment of the fissile metal hydride. Nuclear reactors with a higher enrichment result in smaller relative reactors. Proper dimensions may be ultimately determined by particular specifications of a hydrocarbon containing formation and the formation's energy needs. In some embodiments, the fissile metal hydride is diluted with a fertile hydride. The fertile hydride may be formed from a different isotope of the fissile portion. The fissile metal hydride may include the fissile hydride Uand the fertile hydride may include the isotope U. In some embodiments, the core of the nuclear reactor may include the nuclear fuel including about 5% of Uand about 95% of U.","Other combinations of fissile metal hydrides mixed with fertile or non-fissile hydrides will also work. The fissile metal hydride may include plutonium. Plutonium's low melting temperature (about 640\u00b0 C.) makes the hydride particles less attractive as a reactor fuel to power a steam generator. The fissile metal hydride may include thorium hydride. Thorium permits higher temperature operation of the reactor because of its high melting temperature (about 1755\u00b0 C.). In some embodiments, different combinations of fissile metal hydride are used in order to achieve different energy output parameters.","In some embodiments, nuclear reactor  may include one or more hydrogen storage containers . A hydrogen storage container may include one or more non-fissile hydrogen absorbing materials to absorb the hydrogen expelled from the core. The non-fissile hydrogen absorbing material may include a non-fissile isotope of the core hydride. The non-fissile hydrogen absorbing material may have a hydride dissociation pressure close to that of the fissile material.","Core  and hydrogen storage containers  may be separated by insulation layer . The insulation layer may function as a neutron reflector to reduce neutron leakage from the core. The insulation layer may function to reduce thermal feedback. The insulation layer may function to protect the hydrogen storage containers from being heated by the nuclear core (for example, with radiative heating or with convective heating from the gas within the chamber).","The effective steady-state temperature of the core may be controlled by the ambient hydrogen gas pressure, which is controlled by the temperature at which the non-fissile hydrogen absorbing material is maintained. The temperature of the fissile metal hydride may be independent of the amount of energy being extracted. The energy output may be dependent on the ability of the energy extraction system to extract the power from the nuclear reactor.","Hydrogen gas in the reactor core may be monitored for purity and periodically repressurized to maintain the correct quantity and isotopic content. In some embodiments, the hydrogen gas is maintained via access to the core of the nuclear reactor through one or more pipes (for example, pipes A and B). The temperature of the self-regulating nuclear reactor may be controlled by controlling a pressure of hydrogen supplied to the self-regulating nuclear reactor. The pressure may be regulated based upon the temperature of the heat transfer fluid at one or more points (for example, at the point where the heat transfer fluid enters one or more wellbores). In some embodiments, the pressure may be regulated, and therefore the thermal energy produced by the self-regulating nuclear reactor, based on one or more conditions associated with the formation being treated. Formation conditions may include, for example, temperature of a portion of the formation, type of formation (for example, coal or tar sands), and\/or type of processing method being applied to the formation.","In some embodiments, the nuclear reaction occurring in the self-regulating nuclear reactor may be controlled by introducing a neutron-absorbing gas. The neutron-absorbing gas may, in sufficient quantities, quench the nuclear reaction in the self-regulating nuclear reactor (ultimately reducing the temperature of the reactor to ambient temperature). The neutron-absorbing gas may include xenon.","In some embodiments, the nuclear reaction of an activated self-regulating nuclear reactor is controlled using control rods. Control rods may be positioned at least partially in at least a portion of the nuclear core of the self-regulating nuclear reactor. Control rods may be formed from one or more neutron-absorbing material. Neutron-absorbing materials may include silver, indium, cadmium, boron, cobalt, hafnium, dysprosium, gadolinium, samarium, erbium, and\/or europium.","Currently, self-regulating nuclear reactors described herein, upon activation, reach a natural heat output limit of about 900\u00b0 C., eventually decaying as the fuel is depleted. The natural energy output curve of self-regulating nuclear reactors may be used to provide a desired heating versus time profile for certain subsurface formations.","In some embodiments, self-regulating nuclear reactors may have a natural energy output which decays at a rate of about 1\/E (E is sometimes referred to as Euler's number and is equivalent to about 2.71828). Typically, once a formation has been heated to a desired temperature, less heat is required and the amount of thermal energy put into the formation in order to heat the formation is reduced over time. In some embodiments, heat input to at least a portion of the formation over time approximately correlates to a rate of decay of the self-regulating nuclear reactor. Due to the natural decay of self-regulating nuclear reactors, heating systems may be designed such that the heating systems take advantage of the natural rate of decay of a nuclear reactor. Heaters are typically positioned in wellbores placed throughout the formation. Wellbores may include, for example, U-shaped and L-shaped wellbores or other shapes of wellbores. In some embodiments, spacing between wellbores is determined based on the decay rate of the energy output of self-regulating nuclear reactors.","The self-regulating nuclear reactor may initially provide, to at least a portion of the wellbores, an energy output of about 300 watts\/foot; and thereafter decreasing over a predetermined time period to about 120 watts\/foot. The predetermined time period may be determined by the design of the self-regulating nuclear reactor itself (for example, fuel used in the nuclear core as well as the enrichment of the fuel). The natural decrease in energy output may match energy injection time dependence of the formation. Either variable (for example, power output and\/or power injection) may be adjusted so that the two variables at least approximately correlate or match. The self-regulating nuclear reactor may be designed to decay over a period of 4-9 years, 5-7 years, or about 7 years. The decay period of the self-regulating nuclear reactor may correspond to an IUP (in situ upgrading process) and\/or an ICP (in situ conversion process) heating cycle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1691","num":"1694"},"figref":["FIG. 269","FIG. 270","FIG. 270"],"b":["1948","1960","1968","1964","1966","1968","1962","1960"]},"From the graph in , wellbore spacing represented by curve  may be the spacing which approximately correlates to the energy output over time of certain nuclear reactors (for example, nuclear reactors having an energy output which decays at a rate of about 1\/E). Curves -, in , depict the required energy output for heater wellbores with spacing ranging from about 12 meters to about 14.4 meters. Spacing between heater wellbores greater than about 12 meters may require more energy input than certain nuclear reactors may be able to provide.

In some embodiments, spacing between heater wellbores ranges between about 8 meters and about 11 meters, between about 9 meters and about 10 meters, or between about 9.4 meters and about 9.8 meters.","In certain situations, it may be advantageous to continue a particular level of energy output of the self-regulating nuclear reactor for a longer period than the natural decay of the fuel material in the nuclear core would normally allow. In some embodiments, in order to keep the level of output within a desired range, a second self-regulating nuclear reactor may be coupled to the formation being treated (for example, being heated). The second self-regulating nuclear reactor may, in some embodiments, have a decayed energy output. The energy output of the second reactor may have already decreased due to prior use. The energy output of the two self-regulating nuclear reactors may be substantially equivalent to the initial energy output of the first self-regulating nuclear reactor and\/or a desired energy output. Additional self-regulating nuclear reactors may be coupled to the formation as needed to achieve the desired energy output. Such a system may advantageously increase the effective useful lifetime of the self-regulating nuclear reactors.","The effective useful lifetime of self-regulating nuclear reactors may be extended by using the thermal energy produced by the nuclear reactor to produce steam which, depending upon the formation and\/or systems used, may require far less thermal energy than other uses outlined herein. Steam may be used for a number of purposes including, but not limited to, producing electricity, producing hydrogen on site, converting hydrocarbons, and\/or upgrading hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons may be converted and\/or mobilized in situ by injecting the produced steam in the formation.","A product stream (for example, including methane, hydrocarbons, and\/or heavy hydrocarbons) may be produced from a formation heated with heat transfer fluids heated by the nuclear reactor. Steam produced from heat generated by the nuclear reactor or a second nuclear reactor may be used to reform at least a portion of the product stream. The product stream may be reformed to make at least some molecular hydrogen.","The molecular hydrogen may be used to upgrade at least a portion of the product stream. The molecular hydrogen may be injected in the formation. The product stream may be produced from a surface upgrading process. The product stream may be produced from an in situ heat treatment process. The product stream may be produced from a subsurface steam heating process.","At least a portion of the steam may be injected in a subsurface steam heating process. At least some of the steam may be used to reform methane. At least some of the steam may be used for electrical generation. At least a portion of the hydrocarbons in the formation may be mobilized.","In some embodiments, self-regulating nuclear reactors may be used to produce electricity (for example, via steam driven turbines). The electricity may be used for any number of applications normally associated with electricity. Specifically, the electricity may be used for applications associated with IUP and ICP requiring energy. Electricity from self-regulating nuclear reactors may be used to provide energy for downhole electric heaters.","Converting heat from self-regulating nuclear reactors into electricity may not be the most efficient use of the thermal energy produced by the nuclear reactors. In some embodiments, thermal energy produced by self-regulating nuclear reactors is used to directly heat portions of a formation. In some embodiments, one or more self-regulating nuclear reactors are positioned underground in the formation such that thermal energy produced directly heats at least a portion of the formation. One or more self-regulating nuclear reactors may be positioned underground in the formation below the overburden thus increasing the efficient use of the thermal energy produced by the self-regulating nuclear reactors. Self-regulating nuclear reactors positioned underground may be encased in a material for further protection. For example, self-regulating nuclear reactors positioned underground may be encased in a concrete container.","In some embodiments, thermal energy produced by self-regulating nuclear reactors may be extracted using heat transfer fluids. Thermal energy produced by self-regulating nuclear reactors may be transferred to and distributed through at least a portion of the formation using heat transfer fluids. Heat transfer fluids may circulate through the piping of the energy extraction system of the self-regulating nuclear reactor. As heat transfer fluids circulate in and through the core of the self-regulating nuclear reactor, the heat produced from the nuclear reaction heats the heat transfer fluids.","In some embodiments, two or more heat transfer fluids may be employed to transfer thermal energy produced by self-regulating nuclear reactors. A first heat transfer fluid may circulate through the piping of the energy extraction system of the self-regulating nuclear reactor. The first heat transfer fluid may pass through a heat exchanger and used to heat a second heat transfer fluid. The second heat transfer fluid may be used for treating hydrocarbon fluids in situ, powering electrolysis unit, and\/or for other purposes. The first heat transfer fluid and the second heat transfer fluid may be different materials. Using two heat transfer fluids may reduce the risk of unnecessary exposure of systems and personnel to any radiation absorbed by the first heat transfer fluid. Heat transfer fluids that are resistant to absorbing nuclear radiation may be used (for example, nitrite salts, nitrate salts).","In some embodiments, the energy extraction system includes alkali metal (for example, potassium) heat pipes. Heat pipes may further simplify the self-regulating nuclear reactor by eliminating the need for mechanical pumps to convey a heat transfer fluid through the core. Any simplification of the self-regulating nuclear reactor may decrease the chances of any malfunctions and increase the safety of the nuclear reactor. The energy extraction system may include a heat exchanger coupled to the heat pipes. Heat transfer fluids may convey thermal energy from the heat exchanger.","Heat transfer fluids may include natural or synthetic oil, molten metal, molten salt, or other type of high temperature heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid may have a low viscosity and a high heat capacity at normal operating conditions. When the heat transfer fluid is a molten salt or other fluid that has the potential to solidify in the formation, piping of the system may be electrically coupled to an electricity source to resistively heat the piping when needed and\/or one or more heaters may be positioned in or adjacent to the piping to maintain the heat transfer fluid in a liquid state. In some embodiments, an insulated conductor heater is placed in the piping. The insulated conductor may melt solids in the pipe.","In some embodiments, heat transfer fluids include molten salts. Molten salts function well as heat transfer fluids due to their typically stable nature as a solid and a liquid, their relatively high heat capacity, and unlike water, their lack of expansion when they solidify. Molten salts have a fairly high melting point and typically a large range over which the salt is liquid before it reaches a temperature high enough to decompose. Due to the wide variety of salts, a salt with a desirable temperature range may be found. If necessary, a mixture of different salts may be used in order to achieve a molten salt mixture with the appropriate properties (for example, an appropriate temperature range).","In some embodiments, the molten salt includes a nitrite salt or a combination of nitrite salts. Examples of different nitrite salts may include lithium, sodium, and\/or potassium nitrite salts. The molten salt may include about 15 to about 50 wt. % potassium nitrite salts and about 50 to about 80 wt. % sodium nitrite salts. The molten salt may include a nitrate salt or a combination of nitrate salts. Examples of different nitrate salts may include lithium, sodium, and\/or potassium nitrate salts. The molten salt may include about 15 to about 60 wt. % potassium nitrate salts and about 40 to about 80 wt. % sodium nitrate salts. The molten salt may include a mixture of nitrite and nitrate salts. In some embodiments, the molten salt may include HITEC and\/or HITEC XL which are available from Coastal Chemical Co., L.L.C. located in Abbeville, La., U.S.A. HITEC may include a eutectic mixture of sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate. HITEC may include a recommended operating temperature range of between about 149\u00b0 C. and about 538\u00b0 C. HITEC XL may include a eutectic mixture of calcium nitrate, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate. In some embodiments, a manufacturing facility may be used to convert nitrite salts to nitrate salts and\/or nitrate salts to nitrite salts.","In some embodiments, the molten salt includes a customized mixture of different salts that achieve a desirable temperature range. A desirable temperature range may be dependent upon the formation and\/or material being heated with the molten salt. TABLE 2 depicts ranges of different mixtures of nitrate salts. TABLE 2 demonstrates how varying a ratio of a mixture of different salts may affect the salt's usable temperature range as a heat transfer fluid. For example, a lithium doped nitrate salt mixture (for example, Li:Na:K:NO) has several advantages over the non lithium doped nitrate salt mixture (for example, Na:K:NO). The Li:Na:K:NOsalt mixture may offer a large operating temperature range. The Li:Na:K:NOsalt mixture may have a lower melting point, which reduces the preheating requirements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1709","num":"1712"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Composition","Melting Point","Upper Limit"]},{"entry":[{},"NOSalts","(wt. %)","(\u00b0 C.)","(\u00b0 C.)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Na:K","60:40","230","565"]},{"entry":[{},"Li:Na:K","12:18:70","200","550"]},{"entry":[{},"Li:Na:K","20:28:52","150","550"]},{"entry":[{},"Li:Na:K","27:33:40","160","550"]},{"entry":[{},"Li:Na:K","30:18:52","120","550"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In some embodiments, pressurized hot water is used to preheat the piping in heater wellbores such that molten salts may be used. Preheating piping in heater wellbores (for example, to at least approximate the melting point of the molten salt to be used) may inhibit molten salts from freezing and occluding the piping when the molten salt is first circulated through the piping. Piping in the heater wellbore may be preheated using pressurized hot water (for example, water at about 120\u00b0 C. pressurized to about 15 psi). The piping may be heated until at least a majority of the piping reaches a temperature approximate to the circulating hot water temperature. In some embodiments, the hot water is flushed from the piping with air after the piping has been heated to the desired temperature. A preheated molten salt (for example, Li:Na:K:NO) may then be circulated through the piping in the heater wellbores to achieve the desired temperature.","In some embodiments, a salt (for example, Li:Na:K:NO) is dissolved in water to form a salt solution before circulating the salt through piping in heater wellbores. Dissolving the salt in water may reduce the freezing point (for example, from about 120\u00b0 C. to about 0\u00b0 C.) Such that the salt may be safely circulated through the piping with little fear of the salt freezing and obstructing the piping. The salt solution, in some embodiments, is preheated (for example, to about 90\u00b0 C.) before circulating the solution through the piping in heater wellbores. The salt solution may be heated at an elevated pressure (for example, greater than about 15 psi) to above the water's boiling point. As the salt solution is heated to about 120\u00b0 C., the water from the solution may evaporate. The evaporating water may be allowed to vent from the heat transfer fluid circulation system. Eventually, only the anhydrous molten salt remains to heat the formation.","In some embodiments, preheating of piping in heater wellbores is accomplished by a heat trace (for example, an electric heat trace). The heat trace may be accomplished by using a cable and\/or running current directly through the pipe. In some embodiments, a relatively thin conductive layer is used to provide the majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature and\/or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. Such a temperature limited heater may be used as the heating member in an insulated conductor heater. The heating member of the insulated conductor heater may be located inside a sheath with an insulation layer between the sheath and the heating member.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1713","num":"1716"},"figref":["FIG. 272","FIG. 272"],"b":["524","1950","1934","1934","1950","1934"]},"U-shaped wellbores may run down through overburden  and into hydrocarbon containing layer .

In an embodiment for producing hydrocarbons from a hydrocarbon containing formation (for example, a tar sands formation), produced hydrocarbons may include one or more portions with heavy hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons may be produced from the formation using more than one process. In certain embodiments, nuclear energy is used to assist in producing at least some of the hydrocarbons. At least some of the produced heavy hydrocarbons may be subjected to pyrolysis temperatures. Pyrolysis of the heavy hydrocarbons may be used to produce steam. Steam may be used for a number of purposes including, but not limited to, producing electricity, converting hydrocarbons, and\/or upgrading hydrocarbons.","In some embodiments, a heat transfer fluid is heated using a self-regulating nuclear reactor. The heat transfer fluid may be heated to temperatures that allow for steam production (for example, from about 550\u00b0 C. to about 600\u00b0 C.). In some embodiments, in situ heat treatment process gas and\/or fuel passes to a reformation unit. In some embodiments, in situ heat treatment process gas is mixed with fuel and then passed to the reformation unit. A portion of in situ heat treatment process gas may enter a gas separation unit. The gas separation unit may remove one or more components from the in situ heat treatment process gas to produce the fuel and one or more other streams (for example, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide). The fuel may include, but is not limited to, hydrogen, hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at most 5, or mixtures thereof.","The reformer unit may be a steam reformer. The reformer unit may combine steam with a fuel (for example, methane) to produce hydrogen. For example, the reformation unit may include water gas shift catalysts. The reformation unit may include one or more separation systems (for example, membranes and\/or a pressure swing adsorption system) capable of separating hydrogen from other components. Reformation of the fuel and\/or the in situ heat treatment process gas may produce a hydrogen stream and a carbon oxide stream. Reformation of the fuel and\/or the in situ heat treatment process gas may be performed using techniques known in the art for catalytic and\/or thermal reformation of hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen.

A portion or all of the hydrogen stream may be used for other purposes such as, but not limited to, an energy source and\/or a hydrogen source for in situ or ex situ hydrogenation of hydrocarbons.","Self-regulating nuclear reactors may be used to produce hydrogen at facilities located adjacent to hydrocarbon containing formations. The ability to produce hydrogen on site at hydrocarbon containing formations is highly advantageous due to the plurality of ways in which hydrogen is used for converting and upgrading hydrocarbons on site at hydrocarbon containing formations.","In some embodiments, the first heat transfer fluid is heated using thermal energy stored in the formation. Thermal energy in the formation may be the result of a number of different remediation methods.","Self-regulating nuclear reactors have been discussed for uses associated with in situ hydrocarbon remediation, and self-regulating nuclear reactors do have several advantages over many current constant output nuclear reactors. However, there are several new nuclear reactors whose designs have received regulatory approval for construction. Nuclear energy may be provided by a number of different types of available nuclear reactors and nuclear reactors currently under development (for example, generation IV reactors).","In some embodiments, nuclear reactors include very high temperature reactors (VHTR). VHTRs may use, for example, helium as a coolant to drive a gas turbine for treating hydrocarbon fluids in situ, powering an electrolysis unit, and\/or for other purposes. VHTRs may produce heat up to about 950\u00b0 C. or more. In some embodiments, nuclear reactors include a sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR). SFRs may be designed on a smaller scale (for example, 50 MWe) and therefore may be more cost effective to manufacture on site for treating hydrocarbon fluids in situ, powering electrolysis units, and\/or for other purposes. SFRs may be of a modular design and potentially portable. SFRs may produce temperatures ranging between about 500\u00b0 C. and about 600\u00b0 C., between about 525\u00b0 C. and about 575\u00b0 C., or between 540\u00b0 C. and about 560\u00b0 C.","In some embodiments, pebble bed reactors are employed to provide thermal energy.

MSRs may include fissile, fertile, and fission isotopes dissolved in a molten fluoride salt with a boiling point of about 1,400\u00b0 C. The molten fluoride salt may function as both the reactor fuel and the coolant. MSRs may produce temperatures ranging between about 400\u00b0 C. and about 900\u00b0 C., between about 500\u00b0 C. and about 850\u00b0 C., or between about 600\u00b0 C. and about 800\u00b0 C.","In some embodiments, two or more heat transfer fluids (for example, molten salts) are employed to transfer thermal energy to and\/or from a hydrocarbon containing formation.

The first heat transfer fluid may have a second temperature range in which the second heat transfer fluid is in a liquid form and stable. An upper end of the second temperature range may be hotter and above the first temperature range. A lower end of the second temperature range may overlap with the first temperatures range. The second heat transfer fluid may be circulated through the plurality of wellbores in the portion of the formation in order to heat the portion of the formation to a higher temperature than is possible with the first heat transfer fluid.","The advantages of using two or more different heat transfer fluids may include, for example, the ability to heat the portion of the formation to a much higher temperature than is normally possible while using other supplementary heating methods as little as possible to increase overall efficiency (for example, electric heaters). Using two or more different heat transfer fluids may be necessary if a heat transfer fluid with a large enough temperature range capable of heating the portion of the formation to the desired temperature is not available.","In some embodiments, after the portion of the hydrocarbon containing formation has been heated to a desired temperature range, the first heat transfer fluid may be recirculated through the portion of the formation. The first heat transfer fluid may not be heated before recirculation through the formation (other than heating the heat transfer fluid to the melting point if necessary in the case of molten salts). The first heat transfer fluid may be heated using the thermal energy already stored in the portion of the formation from prior attempts at hydrocarbon remediation. The first heat transfer fluid may then be transferred out of the formation such that the thermal energy recovered by the first heat transfer fluid may be reused for some other process in the portion of the formation, in a second portion of the formation, and\/or in an additional formation.","In some in situ heat treatment embodiments, compressors provide compressed gases to the treatment area. For example, compressors may be used to provide oxidizing fluid  and\/or fuel  to a plurality of oxidizer assemblies like oxidizer assembly  depicted in . Each oxidizer assembly  may include a number of oxidizers . Oxidizers  may burn a mixture of oxidizing fluid  and fuel  to produce heat that heats the treatment area in the formation. Also, compressors  may be used to supply gas phase heat transfer fluid to the formation as depicted in . In some embodiments, pumps provide liquid phase heat transfer fluid to the treatment area.","A significant cost of the in situ heat treatment process may be operating the compressors and\/or pumps over the life of the in situ heat treatment process if conventional electrical energy sources are used to power the compressors and\/or pumps of the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments, nuclear power may be used to generate electricity that operates the compressors and\/or pumps needed for the in situ heat treatment process. The nuclear power may be supplied by one or more nuclear reactors. The nuclear reactors may be light water reactors, pebble bed reactors, and\/or other types of nuclear reactors. The nuclear reactors may be located at or near to the in situ heat treatment process site. Locating the nuclear reactors at or near to the in situ heat treatment process site may reduce equipment costs and electrical transmission losses over long distances. The use of nuclear power may reduce or eliminate the amount of carbon dioxide generation associated with operating the compressors and\/or pumps over the life of the in situ heat treatment process.","Excess electricity generated by the nuclear reactors may be used for other in situ heat treatment process needs. For example, excess electricity may be used to cool fluid for forming a low temperature barrier (frozen barrier) around treatment areas, and\/or for providing electricity to treatment facilities located at or near the in situ heat treatment process site. In some embodiments, the electricity or excess electricity produced by the nuclear reactors may be used to resistively heat the conduits used to circulate heat transfer fluid through the treatment area.","In some embodiments, excess heat available from the nuclear reactors may be used for other in situ processes. For example, excess heat may be used to heat water or make steam that is used in solution mining processes. In some embodiments, excess heat from the nuclear reactors may be used to heat fluids used in the treatment facilities located near or at the in situ heat treatment site.","In some embodiments, geothermal energy may be used to heat or preheat a treatment area of an in situ heat treatment process or a treatment area to be solution mined. Geothermal energy may have little or no carbon dioxide emissions. In some embodiments, geothermally heated fluid may be produced from a layer or layers located below or near the treatment area. The geothermally heated fluid includes, but is not limited to, steam, water, and\/or brine. One or more of the layers may be geothermally pressurized geysers. Geothermally heated fluid may be pumped from one or more of the layers. The layer or layers may be at least 2 km, at least 4 km, at least 8 km or more below the surface. The geothermally heated fluid may be at a temperature of at least 100\u00b0 C., at least 200\u00b0 C., or at least 300\u00b0 C.","The geothermally heated fluid may be produced and circulated through piping in the treatment area to raise the temperature of the treatment area. In some embodiments, the geothermally heated fluid is introduced directly into the treatment area. In some embodiments, the geothermally heated fluid is circulated through the treatment area or piping in the treatment area without being produced to the surface and re-introduced into the treatment area. In some embodiments, the geothermally heated fluid may be produced from a location near the treatment area. The geothermally heated fluid may be transported to the treatment area. Once transported to the treatment area, the geothermally heated fluid is circulated through piping in the treatment area and\/or the geothermally heated fluid is introduced directly into the treatment area.","In some embodiments, geothermally heated fluid produced from a layer or layers is used to solution mine minerals from the formation. The geothermally heated fluid may be used to raise the temperature of the formation to a temperature below the dissociation temperature of the minerals, but to a temperature high enough to increase the amount of mineral going into solution in a first fluid introduced into the formation. The geothermally heated fluid may be introduced directly into the formation as all or a portion of the first fluid, and\/or the geothermally heated fluid may be circulated through piping in the formation.","In some embodiments, geothermally heated fluid produced from a layer or layers may be used to heat the treatment area before using electrical heaters, gas burners, or other types of heat sources to heat the treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures. The geothermally heated fluid may not be at a temperature sufficient to raise the temperature of the treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures. Using the geothermally heated fluid to heat the treatment area before using electrical heaters or other heat sources to heat the treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures may reduce energy costs for the in situ heat treatment process.","In some embodiments, hot dry rock technology may be used to produce steam or other hot heat transfer fluid from a deep portion of the formation. Injection wells may be drilled to a depth where the formation is hot. The injection wells may be at least 2 km, at least 4 km, or at least 8 km deep. Sections of the formation adjacent to the bottom portions of the injection wells may be hydraulically, or otherwise fractured, to provide large contact area with the formation and\/or to provide flow paths to heated fluid production wells.
