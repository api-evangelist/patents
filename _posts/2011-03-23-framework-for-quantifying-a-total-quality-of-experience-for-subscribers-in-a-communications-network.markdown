No. 13\/070,039, filed Mar. 23, 2011, entitled \u201cPROCESSING QUALITY OF SERVICE DATA TO PROVIDE A PREDICTION OF QUALITY OF EXPERIENCE,\u201d and U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/069,998, filed Mar. 23, 2011, entitled \u201cSTATISTICALLY DETERMINING AVERAGE NETWORK SPEED IN A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK,\u201d which are incorporated herein by reference.","This disclosure relates in general to hybrid fiber coaxial networks, and more particularly to providing a framework for quantifying a total quality of experience for subscribers in a communications network.","As service providers move forward with network optimization strategies, including congestion management, the need to ensure satisfactory customer quality of experience (QoE) will be critical.","High speed Internet customers no longer see the Internet as a platform for publishing and sharing static images. They are relying more and more on their service for entertainment, education and information, and their expectations of their broadband provider have increased as well. Therefore, the driving factors of rapid broadband deployment are the services that can be delivered on top of this technology. The services that are offered today go far beyond the best-effort services of a decade ago. The Internet technologies are being used to form an infrastructure that delivers data, audio and video traffic at the same time. QoE is essential for all these services. Multimedia services like IPTV are particularly sensitive to packet loss, delay and jitter, and often require a substantial amount of bandwidth, so a mechanism must be in place to detect QoE degradation and react appropriately to restore it.","Rapidly increasing video quality combined with rapidly increasing adoption, leads to traffic growth rates that put serious pressure on the network infrastructure. It is expected that IP traffic will double every two years. With broadband becoming ubiquitous, providing not only adequate but enhanced QoE will be the primary point of differentiation when it comes to customers' satisfaction and subscriber growth.","Existing research has identified key factors in customer experience that impact traditional best-effort broadband service QoE. Delay is one such factor. Delay refers to the initial system response time from providing URL until the end-user is aware that a download has started. The data download speed is frequently communicated to the end-user by means of a file transfer dialogue box that includes a numeric display of download status (% or number of bytes downloaded\/total bytes) or by a network rate meter. The consistency of download speed is another factor that affects the customer experience. If the download is at a steady rate, then the user has a good idea (either intuitively or through a meter) of when it will finish. If on the other hand the rate varies greatly, then the finish time is much less certain and the user cannot plan how to use the intervening period so effectively. The incremental display factor is the time before there is some new, intelligible content to view. It is often the case that the display starts to update before the download is complete. As soon as the user has some new information to consider, the fact that the download is still in progress is of less importance. Action availability is the time before the user can undertake the next step in the browsing process, e.g., a new link or action button becomes useable. Again this may be before the download is complete. Finally, the absolute time until the download is complete has an impact on the customer experience.","Data associated with parameters of the network, such as such as jitter, latency, packet loss, signal power, signal quality, etc., are an objective measurement of the technical health of the network. However, the customer experience, i.e., quality of experience (QoE), should reflect the actual experience of the customer, not the measure of what is technically occurring on the network.","Moreover, even if individual quality of service parameters are correlated with aspects of the quality of experience of a subscriber, quantifying how to score the overall experience of a subscriber is still elusive. For example, providing a certain bandwidth may be very important to an actual customer experience, but the customer's response needs to be included in any quantification of QoE. Having a 40 megabit per second downloading capability is faster than having a 20 megabit per second, but if the customer does not see much of a difference, then the difference is not that important to the customer. What matters is how the customer is impacted.","Accordingly, there is a need for providing a framework for quantifying a total quality of experience for subscribers in a communications network.","To overcome the limitations described above, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, embodiments for providing a framework for quantifying a total quality of experience for subscribers in a communications network are disclosed.","An embodiment includes method for providing a framework for quantifying a total quality of experience for subscribers in a communications network is disclosed. The method includes providing a weighted average score representing a quality of experience for at least one application, providing a set of scores associated with network parameters, calculating a weighted sum using the set of scores and the weighted average score and generating a total quality of experience score based on the weighted sum.","In another embodiment, a system for providing a framework for quantifying a total quality of experience for subscribers in a communications network is provided. The system includes a headend for providing video and data to a plurality of subscriber equipment via a hybrid fiber\/coax (HFC) network, a plurality of distribution hubs, the plurality of distribution hubs coupling network elements from subscriber equipment to the headend and a storage device, coupled to the headend, for storing states for a plurality of network parameters and scores associated with a level of satisfaction with the service being provided to the set of subscribers provided by the set of subscribers while the states for a plurality of network parameters are varied, wherein the headend further comprises a processor for providing a framework to quantify a total quality of experience for subscribers in a communications network, the processor provides a weighted average score representing a quality of experience for at least one application, provides a set of scores associated with network parameters, calculates a weighted sum using the set of scores and the weighted average score and generates a total quality of experience score based on the weighted sum.","In another embodiment a computer readable medium including executable instructions which, when executed by a processor, provides a framework for quantifying a total quality of experience for subscribers in a communications network is disclosed. The processor executes the steps of providing a weighted average score representing a quality of experience for at least one application, providing a set of scores associated with network parameters, calculating a weighted sum using the set of scores and the weighted average score and generating a total quality of experience score based on the weighted sum.","These and various other advantages and features of novelty are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed hereto and form a part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the disclosed embodiments, the advantages, and the objects obtained, reference should be made to the drawings which form a further part hereof, and to accompanying descriptive matter, in which there are illustrated and described specific examples of the disclosed embodiments.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to providing a framework for quantifying a total quality of experience for subscribers in a communications network. A weighted average score representing a quality of experience for at least one application is provided. A set of scores associated with network parameters is provided. A weighted sum using the set of scores and the weighted average score is calculated. A total quality of experience score based on the weighted sum is generated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","115","120","115","110","115","105","140"]},"According to embodiments of the present invention, the CATV system  is in the form of a distributed client-server computing system for providing video and data flow across the HFC network  between server-side services providers (e.g., cable television\/services providers) via a server-side head end  and a client-side customer via a client-side set-top box (STB)  functionally connected to a customer receiving device, such as the television set . As is understood by those skilled in the art, modem CATV systems  may provide a variety of services across the HFC network  including traditional digital and analog video programming, telephone services, high speed Internet access, video-on-demand, and information services.","On the client side of the CATV system , digital and analog video programming and digital and analog data are provided to the customer television set  via the set-top box (STB) . Interactive television services that allow a customer to input data to the CATV system  likewise are provided by the STB . As illustrated in , the STB  is a multipurpose computing device having a computer processor, memory and an input\/output mechanism. The input\/output mechanism receives input from server-side processes via the HFC network  and from customers via input devices such as the remote control device  and the keyboard . The remote control device  and the keyboard  may communicate with the STB  via a suitable communication transport such as the infrared connection . The STB  also includes a video processor for processing and providing digital and analog video signaling to the television set  via a cable communication transport . A multi-channel tuner is provided for processing video and data to and from the STB  and the server-side head end system , described below.","The STB  also includes an operating system  for directing the functions of the STB  in conjunction with a variety of client applications . For example, if a client application  requires a news flash from a third-party news source to be displayed on the television , the operating system  may cause the graphics functionality and video processor of the STB , for example, to output the news flash to the television  at the direction of the client application  responsible for displaying news items.","Because a variety of different operating systems  may be utilized by a variety of different brands and types of set-top boxes, a middleware layer  is provided to allow a given software application to be executed by a variety of different operating systems. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the middleware layer  may include a set of application programming interfaces (API) that are exposed to client applications  and operating systems  that allow the client applications to communicate with the operating systems through common data calls understood via the API set. As described below, a corresponding middleware layer is included on the server side of the CATV system  for facilitating communication between the server-side application server and the client-side STB . According to one embodiment of the present invention, the middleware layer  of the server-side application server and the middleware layer  of the client-side STB  format data passed between the client side and server side according to the Extensible Markup Language (XML).","The set-top box  passes digital and analog video and data signaling to the television  via a one-way communication transport . The STB  may receive video and data from the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  through a video\/data downlink  and data via a data downlink\/uplink .","The STB  may transmit data from the client side of the CATV system  to the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  via one data uplink. The data downlink\/uplink , illustrated in , between the HFC network  and the set-top box  comprise \u201cout of band\u201d data links. As is understand by those skilled in the art, the \u201cout of band\u201d frequency range generally lies between zero and 54 megahertz.","According to embodiments of the present invention, data flow between the client-side set-top box  and the server-side application server  is typically passed through the \u201cout of band\u201d data links. Alternatively, an \u201cin band\u201d data carousel may be positioned in an \u201cin band\u201d channel into which a data feed may be processed from the server-side application server  through the HFC network  to the client-side STB . Operation of data transport between components of the CATV system , described with reference to , is well known to those skilled in the art.","Referring still to , the head end  of the CATV system  is positioned on the server side of the CATV system and includes hardware and software systems responsible for originating and managing content for distributing through the HFC network . As described above, a number of services may be provided by the CATV system , including digital and analog video programming, interactive television services, telephone services, video-on-demand services, targeted advertising, and provision of information content.","The application server  is a general-purpose computing system operative to assemble and manage data sent to and received from the client-side set-top box  via the HFC network . As described above with reference to the set-top box , the application server  includes a middleware layer  for processing and preparing data from the head end of the CATV system  for receipt and use by the client-side set-top box . For example, the application server  via the middleware layer  may obtain data from third-party services  via the Internet  for transmitting to a customer through the HFC network  and the set-top box . For example, a weather report from a third-party weather service may be downloaded by the application server via the Internet . When the application server  receives the downloaded weather report, the middleware layer  may be utilized to format the weather report for receipt and use by the set-top box . Speed test server  may be used to determine the speed of a modem, which then can be used to calculate an average Network Speed.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, data obtained and managed by the middleware layer  of the application server  is formatted according to the Extensible Markup Language and is passed to the set-top box  through the HFC network  where the XML-formatted data may be utilized by a client application  in concert with the middleware layer , as described above. As should be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a variety of third-party services data, including news data, weather data, sports data and other information content may be obtained by the application server  via distributed computing environments such as the Internet  for provision to customers via the HFC network  and the set-top box .","According to embodiments of the present invention, the application server  obtains customer support services data, including billing data, information on customer work order status, answers to frequently asked questions, services provider contact information, and the like from data services  for provision to the customer via an interactive television session. As illustrated in , the services provider data services  include a number of services operated by the services provider of the CATV system  which may include data on a given customer.","A billing system  may include information such as a customer's name, street address, business identification number, Social Security number, credit history, and information regarding services and products subscribed to by the customer. According to embodiments of the present invention, the billing system  may also include billing data for services and products subscribed to by the customer for bill processing billing presentment and payment receipt.","A customer information database  may include general information about customers such as place of employment, business address, business telephone number and demographic information such as age, gender, educational level, and the like. The customer information database  may also include information on pending work orders for services or products ordered by the customer. The customer information database  may also include general customer information such as answers to frequently asked customer questions and contact information for various service provider offices\/departments. As should be understood, this information may be stored in a variety of disparate databases operated by the cable services provider.","An electronic mail system  may contain information such as electronic mail addresses, high-speed Internet access subscription information and electronic mail usage data. An authentication system  may include information such as secure user names and passwords utilized by customers for access to network services. As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the disparate data services systems , , ,  are illustrated as a collection of data services for purposes of example only. The example data services systems comprising the data services  may operate as separate data services systems, which communicate with a web services system (described below) along a number of different communication paths and according to a number of different communication protocols.","Referring still to , a web services system  is illustrated between the application server  and the data services . According to embodiments of the present invention, the web services system  serves as a collection point for data requested from each of the disparate data services systems comprising the data services . Storage device  may be used to store data for the headend  and act as a central network speed database. According to embodiments of the present invention, when the application server  requires customer services data from one or more of the data services , the application server  passes a data query to the web services system . The web services system formulates a data query to each of the available data services systems for obtaining any required data for a requesting customer as identified by a set-top box identification associated with the customer. The web services system  serves as an abstraction layer between the various data services systems and the application server . That is, the application server  is not required to communicate with the disparate data services systems, nor is the application server  required to understand the data structures or data types utilized by the disparate data services systems. The web services system  is operative to communicate with each of the disparate data services systems for obtaining necessary customer data. The customer data obtained by the web services system is assembled and is returned to the application server  for ultimate processing via the middleware layer , as described above.","The headend  may include a speed test server . Alternatively, speed test servers may be distributed throughout the HFC network . The speed test server , whether in the headend  or distributed throughout HFC network  poll a predetermined number of set-top boxes  a predetermined number of times, wherein the number of polls is selected to provide sufficient data for statistical modeling of the average network speed. Polling should also be configured to use random subscribers. The results of the polling may be sorted by tier or other parameters.","All data involved with performing quality of experience tests is controlled and processed by a processor . All data is stored in storage device . Correlation between measured network parameters and the quality of experience may be determined based on information gathered from subscribers. The processor  then can process the data in storage device  to quantifying a total quality of experience for subscribers in a communications network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","288","220","222","230","220","222","230","220","222","230","288","240","250","252","240","250","252","240","250","252","220","222","230","210","260","282"]},"In , the nodes, including speed test servers , ,  and access nodes , ,  communicate with modem\/set-top boxes -. Set-top boxes - connect to televisions  and are configured to process received signals into content that then may be displayed on the television screen or other display device. A modem - is used to provide bi-directional data communication to deliver broadband Internet access. Herein, the term modem will be used to refer to a device for providing conditional access to information, including a set-top box or modem -.","As mentioned, the quality of service can be degraded if there is too much traffic on the network. In such an instance, the speed slows down and the subscriber becomes aware of the issue. The speed test servers , ,  may thus perform an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ping test that sends a test packet  to a modem - to determine how quickly the packet arrives at the modem - along the network. To minimize the number of the ICMP ping test, which can clog the network with test traffic, a limited number of tests are performed and then, from those tests, the average network speed may be statistically determined by a processor . The result will not be the speed for each individual customer, but rather an average network speed. The average network speed is what a typical subscriber should expect to see.","For example, four tests are conducted during the day at four different times. The data is statistically analyzed to predict the speed on the network at times not represented by the times of the test. The statistical information regarding the average network speed may be shared with network managers and with subscribers. The statistical analysis is based on the mathematical relationship between the volume of traffic and an average speed. The dynamic of the volume of network traffic during the day can be obtained from historical data. An analysis of the trend in network traffic may be used to identify the peaks and low traffic times during the day.","Considering these factors, the requirement for speed test servers , ,  should reflect the need to poll a sample of specified size and the need to poll specified number of times during 24 hour period. The minimum feasible sample size can be determined by the equation:\n\n=(),\n\nwhere n is the sample size, Z is the z-score relating to selected confidence level, and e is the proportion of acceptable error.\n","A high confidence level, such as \u03b1=0.99999 (or 99.999%) should be chosen. For this confidence level, Z=4.2. The proportion of acceptable error should also be set relatively low. Suggested possible error values are e=0.05 (or 5%), e=0.03 (or 3%), or e=0.01 (or 1%). With all three error values, the calculated sample size is large enough to provide adequate sub-samples for smaller tiers and ensure proportional representation of all tiers. Decision regarding appropriate sample size should be based on desired accuracy of average speed measurement, as well as practical feasibility.","In determining testing frequency, the distribution of bandwidth consumption rates over an average 24 hour period is a relatively well-behaved sinusoid-shaped line with a single peak and a single trough. While it is always preferable to test as frequently as possible, based on the shape of the distribution, at least four data points will likely be necessary for construction of a relatively reliable inferential model for average network speed: average speed at maximum consumption level, average speed at minimum consumption level, and average speed at two consumption midpoints between maximum and minimum.","Embodiments for providing a framework for quantifying a total quality of experience for subscribers in a communications network may be implemented in a suitable computing environment. Embodiments may also be implemented in combination with other types of computer systems and program modules. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, and other types of structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. By way of example, computer readable media  can include computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media  includes volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information , such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.","Computer storage media  typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, etc. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. Embodiments may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in the headend  and\/or in speed test servers , , .","Embodiments implemented on computer-readable media  may refer to a mass storage device, such as a hard disk or CD-ROM drive. However, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed or utilized by a processing device, e.g., server or communications network provider infrastructure.","By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media  may include, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other solid state memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (\u201cDVD\u201d), or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by a processing device. As mentioned briefly above, a number of program modules and data files may be stored and arranged for controlling the operation of processing devices. Thus, processing devices, such as processor  provided by the headend  and\/or in speed test servers , , , may be configured to execute instructions that perform the operations of embodiments of the present invention.","It should also be appreciated that various embodiments of the present invention can be implemented (1) as a sequence of computer implemented acts or program modules running on a processing device and\/or (2) as interconnected machine logic circuits or circuit modules within the processing devices. The implementation is a matter of choice dependent on the performance requirements. Accordingly, logical operations including related algorithms can be referred to variously as operations, structural devices, acts or modules. It will be recognized by one skilled in the art that these operations, structural devices, acts and modules may be implemented in software, firmware, special purpose digital logic, and any combination thereof without deviating from the spirit and scope of the present invention as recited within the claims set forth herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","320","330","340","350","360"]},"Quantifying the Quality of Service (QoS) is objective because it is based on objective measures of network health. In contrast, quantifying the Quality of Experience (QoE) is more of a subjective measure of a customer's satisfaction. Traditionally QOS has been used interchangeably with QoE. There really has not been a distinction between QoS and QoE. However, the studies of actual human experience with the Internet note a clear distinction between QoS and QoE.","Service providers tout their competitive advantages in terms of what they that can technically provide. For example, one service provider may tout that they can achieve a certain network speed or that they can achieve a certain latency. Thus, the QOE aspect in this competitive marketing really does not exist. Everyone is really just talking about QOS.","However, providing a certain bandwidth may be very important to an actual customer experience, but the customer's response needs to be included in any quantification of QoE. Having a 40 megabit per second downloading capability is faster than having a 20 megabit per second, but if the customer does not see much of a difference, then the difference is not that important to the customer. What matters is how the customer is impacted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","490","440","440","450","460","480","420","440","435","440","445","455","450","460","465","470","475","490","485"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","520"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["600","610"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4"],"b":["700","710","720","710","730","740","710","720"]},"Accordingly, all of the factors are entered into the chart . As can be seen in , data from the speed test servers, as discussed earlier, are included. Thus, data from the speed test servers are used for two purposes. The first is for determining an average network speed that may be used to discuss service with subscribers. However, the average network speed is also a parameter that is included in the determination of the QoE. When the data entered into the chart  meets a certain threshold, the QoE is determined to meet expectations.","Regression analysis may be used to correlate QoE with QoS. As discussed earlier, QoS is a measure of technical health of the network and is thus based on measurements of network parameters, such as jitter, latency, packet loss, signal power, signal quality, etc. QoE should reflect the actual experience of the customer, not the measure of what technically is occurring on the network. Of course, QoS and QoE will be related to a degree because the technical issues with the network will impact the customer. However, QoS and QoE are not the same thing. Because the subscribers cannot be polled constantly, a prediction of the QoE is generated based on measured network parameters.","Correlation between measured network parameters and the quality of experience is based on information gathered from subscribers. A mean obtained score (MOS) is determined based on the subscriber input. Then latency, jitter, packet loss, etc. is used to correlate to the MOS based on subscriber input. In addition, signal power and signal quality are included as factors that are considered when predicting the QoE for subscribers based on regression analysis.","For example, when testing a subscriber's response to downloads, the download speeds are adjusted and the subscriber's evaluation of the experience is noted. Data is collected showing the various parameters of network tests that have been conducted. Then, for each set of parameters, a measure of customer's experience is noted. All of this data is then statistically analyzed to produce scores for QoE. Accordingly, composite scores are calculated, the weighted average score are calculated and then the total QOE is generated. A default score of zero indicates that the service matches the standard quality of experience. A negative score indicates the service is below the standard for quality of experience. A positive score indicates that the service exceeds the expectation of subscribers.","When a negative score is identified, the components for the score are analyzed to determine the source of the low score. Since each of the components will have a different weight, there may be a very small variation, but the variation may be associated with a very important component. For instance for voice conversations over Internet, latency is a serious issue. Packet loss is much less of a problem. Thus, if a conversation is scoring high on packet loss and maybe other metrics but it is scoring somewhat low on latency, the whole QoE is lowered because latency is weighted much more. Accordingly, network management procedures must be analyzed to correct for latency. Thus, QoE may not only be used to identify and correct a network problem, QoE may also be used to provide guidance when designing or expanding a network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"],"b":["800","810","820","830","840","850","860","870","880"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["900","910","920","930","940"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["1000","1010","1020","1030","1040"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["1100","1110","1120","1130","1140"]},"The foregoing description of the exemplary embodiment of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.
