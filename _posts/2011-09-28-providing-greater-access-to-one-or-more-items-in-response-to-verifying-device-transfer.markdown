In addition to the foregoing, other computer program product aspects are described in the claims, drawings, and text forming a part of the present disclosure.","The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.","Advances in computing technologies and related technologies (e.g., visual display technology, battery technology, etc.) in recent years have resulted in the development of computing devices that have increasingly smaller and smaller form factors while still maintaining exceptional processing capabilities. Examples of such computing devices include, for example, laptops, Netbooks, tablet computers (i.e., \u201cslate\u201d computers), e-readers, Smartphones, and so forth. Because of their compactness, such devices are becoming much easier to share among multiple users. That is, because of their small form factors, such devices allow users of such devices to easily pass or handoff their devices for others to use in order to access various items (e.g., documents, files, applications, and so forth). For example, suppose a primary user (e.g., an owner) of a tablet computer wants to show an image (e.g., a digital photograph) that is being displayed through his\/her tablet computer to a friend sitting across a table from the primary user. Typically, in order to show the image that is being displayed through the tablet computer to the friend, the primary user may simply pass or handover the tablet computer to the friend thereby allowing the friend to view the electronic document.","Unfortunately by doing so, the primary user's friend, in addition to having access to the image, may have access to many other things that the primary user may not want the friend to have access to. For example, upon being handed the tablet computer, the friend may be able to view any confidential documents, image or audio files, applications, websites, passwords, and so forth, that may be open or running at the time that the tablet computer was handed over to the friend. Even worse, the primary user's friend may be able to not just access open applications and content, but may be able to retrieve\/use\/modify any content (e.g., documents, image files, audio files, etc.) or applications that may be accessible to the primary user through the tablet computer.","In accordance with various embodiments, computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture are provided that can provide greater or lesser accessibility via a computing device (e.g., a tablet computer, a Smartphone, a laptop computer, or other types of portable computer device) to one or more items (e.g., electronic documents, files, image or audio files, applications, passwords, and so forth) depending upon whether the computing device, which may be associated with a first user (e.g., a user such as the primary user or owner of the computing device who can be identified by the computing device, such as by facial recognition system or voice recognition application, and who is recognized by the computing device as having superior access rights to the computing device and\/or to items stored in the computing device), has been transferred from the first user to a second user (e.g., a third party who has inferior rights to access the one or more items than the first user) or whether the computing device has been transferred from the second user to the first user.","For example, if the computing device is being transferred from the first user to the second user, access to one or more electronic items (herein simply \u201citems\u201d) through the computing device may be restricted. On the other hand, if the computing device is being returned from the second user to the first user, then greater access may be provided to the one or more items. At this time it should be noted that in cases where a computing device is being returned to the first user (e.g., a primary user of the computing device) from a second user (e.g., a third party having lower access rights to the computing device or to one or more items accessible through the computing device), a heighten level of proof that the computing device has been transferred back to the first user may be required since greater access is to be provided to the one or more items (which could include personal and\/or confidential items).","In various embodiments, the computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture may be designed to automatically determine whether a computing device that is associated with a first user (e.g., a user with superior access rights to the computing device and\/or to one or more items that are accessible through the computing device) has been transferred from the first user to a second user (e.g., a third party having inferior access rights than the first user to the computing device and\/or to the one or more items); and in response to determining that the computing device has indeed been transferred from the first user to the second user, automatically configure the computing device to restrict access to one or more items (e.g., documents, files, image or audio files, applications, passwords, and so forth) that may have been accessible to the first user when the first user was in possession of the computing device.","Additionally or alternatively, the computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture, in some embodiments, may be designed to, among other things, acquire one or more indicators that suggest that the computing device has been transferred to the first user from the second user, the first user having at least greater accessing rights than the second user to the one or more items via the computing device. In some cases, the one or more indicators that may be acquired may be acquired as part of an automatic monitoring operation executed by the computing device that monitors various aspects of the computing device as well as the surrounding environment in order to determine whether computing device has been transferred between users (e.g., from the first user to the second user or from the second user to the first user). As will be further described herein one or more aspects of the computing device\/environment may be monitored in order to at least infer that the computing device has been transferred between two users (e.g., the first user and the second user). These aspects that may be monitored include, for example, the direct movements of the computing device as detected by, for example, a movement sensor such as an accelerometer, visual cues such as a face or an eye as detected by an image capturing device such as a camera, and\/or audio cues such as a voice pattern as detected by an audio capturing device such as a microphone.","Unfortunately, in cases where the computing device is being transferred from the second user (e.g., a user with inferior accessing rights to the computing device and\/or to items stored in the computing device) to the first user (e.g., a user with superior accessing rights to the computing device and\/or items stored in the computing device), the initial data provided through such detection means (detected movements of the computing device, visual cues, and\/or audio cues) may be insufficient to satisfy the higher standard of proof that may be required in order to conclude that the computing device has indeed been transferred to the first user. That is, higher requirements of proof may be needed under these conditions since restrictions to access to one or more items through the computing device may be eased if the computing device is determined to be in the possession of the first user (e.g., a primary user of the computing device). For example, the monitoring of the movements of the computing device, by itself, may not be conclusive evidence that the computing device has been transferred back to the first user. Similarly, there are many situations where initially detected visual cues or audio cues may be insufficient to conclusively determine that the computing device has been transferred from the second user to the first user (e.g., if the first user's face or eye is not clearly visible to the camera of the computing device).","Thus, in order to correctly determine that the computing device indeed has been transferred to the first user, the computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture may also be designed to detect, in response to acquiring one or more indicators that suggest that the computing device has been transferred to the first user from the second user, input that verifies that the computing device has been transferred to the first user. In some embodiments, the detection of such input data may involve soliciting for such input data. As will be further described herein, the input data (or simply \u201cinput\u201d) that may be solicited may be one or more types of input data (e.g., biometric data, user entry, gestures, and so forth). The input that may be detected and\/or solicited may be the same or different type or types of data that were initially acquired during the monitoring phase described above. In cases where the same type of data is being solicited, the solicitation may merely be for better quality data (e.g., better visual or audio data). For example, if a facial recognition application is used to at least infer the presence of the first user in the vicinity of the computing device, and if the initial data that was collected to infer that the computing device has been transferred to the first user was based on an image that captured only a portion of the first user's face being in \u201cfront\u201d of the computing device, then the solicitation may be for the first user to provide a better view of his\/her face to the camera of the computing device) so that a more accurate verification can be made that the computing device has indeed been transferred to the first user (e.g., first user has possession of the computing device).","Upon detecting the input that verifies that the computing device has been transferred to the first user, the computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture may be designed to provide at least greater access via the computing device to the one or more items. In various embodiments, the computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture may be implemented at the computing device.","Referring now to  illustrating a computing device * in an exemplary environment  being transferred back-and-forth between two users. In particular,  shows a computing device * being transferred from a first user  to a second user , and from the second user  back to the first user . For purposes of the following description, the first user  will be a user, such as the primary user or owner of the computing device *, who the computing device * or the logic endowed with the computing device * can identify and who the computing device * (or its logic) recognizes as having superior access rights than others (e.g., the second user ) to the computing device * and\/or to one or more items (e.g., documents, image or audio files, applications, passwords, etc.) that may be stored\/available through the computing device *. In contrast, the second user  may be any third party who has inferior access rights than the first user  to the computing device * and\/or to the one or more items.","As will be further described herein, the illustrated computing device * may employ the computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture in accordance with various embodiments. In particular, the computing device * may be endowed with logic that is designed to determine that the computing device * is being or has been transferred (e.g., handed or passed-off) from a first user  to a second user , and in response to such a determination, automatically restrict access to one or more items (e.g., electronic documents, image or audio files, passwords, applications, and so forth) that may have been accessible to the first user  when the first user  had possession of the computing device *.","The endowed logic may alternatively or additionally be designed to, upon the computing device * being transferred from the second user  (e.g., a user recognized by the computing device * as having inferior access rights) to the first user  (e.g., a user recognized by the computing device * as having superior access rights), acquire one or more indicators that when processed infer or suggest that the computing device * has been transferred to the first user  from the second user ; solicit, in response to acquiring the one or more indicators, input that verifies that the computing device * has been transferred to the first user , and in response to receiving the input that verifies that the computing device * has been transferred to the first user  automatically provide at least greater access to the one or more items than the access that was allowed to the one or more items when the computing device * was in possession of the second user . Note that in some embodiments a computing device * may be in the possession of a user (e.g., the first user  or the second user ) when the respective user has some control over the computing device * such as by holding the computing device *, by being in physical contact with the computing device *, by being physically closer to the computing device * than anyone else, or by being in a specific location with respect to the specific orientation of the computing device * (e.g., being located centered on the front side (e.g., display side) of the computing device *.","In some embodiments, and for purposes of the following description, the first user  may be any user who has superior access rights than other users (e.g., second user ) to the computing device * and\/or to items (e.g., documents, images, applications, etc.) stored in the computing device *. Examples of a first user  include, for example, a primary user, such as the owner, of the computing device *. In contrast, a second user  for purposes of the following description may be any third party who has inferior access rights than the first user  to the computing device * and\/or to the items that may be accessed via the computing device *. As will be further described herein, note that illustrate two different implementations of the computing device * of  illustrated in as computing device \u2032 and in as computing device \u2033.","In particular, and as will be further described herein, illustrates a computing device \u2032 that is the \u201chardwired\u201d or \u201chard\u201d implementation of the computing device * of , , , , and in which certain logic modules including a transfer indicator acquiring module \u2032, a verification input soliciting module \u2032, a verification input receiving and transfer verifying module \u2032, and an access providing module \u2032 are implemented using purely hardware or circuitry components (e.g., application specific integrated circuit or ASIC). In contrast, illustrates a computing device \u2033 that is the \u201csoft\u201d implementation of the computing device * of , , , , and in which certain logic modules including a transfer indicator acquiring module \u2033, a verification input soliciting module \u2033, a verification input receiving and transfer verifying module \u2033, and an access providing module \u2033 are implemented using one or more processors (e.g., microprocessors, controllers, etc.) executing one or more programming instructions (e.g., software stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium).","Note that for purposes of the following, \u201c*\u201d represents a wildcard. Thus, references in the following to the \u201ccomputing device *\u201d may be in reference to the computing device \u2032 of or to the computing device \u2033 of unless indicated otherwise. Note that the two different implementations of the computing device * of  illustrated in (e.g., illustrated as computing device \u2032 in and as computing device \u2033 in ) are two extreme or opposite versions of the computing device * of , , , and in which certain logic modules (e.g., the transfer indicator acquiring module *, the verification input soliciting module *, the verification input receiving and transfer verifying module *, and the access providing module *) are implemented using purely \u201chardware solutions\u201d (e.g., implemented using circuitry such as ASIC) as illustrated in or using purely \u201csoftware solutions\u201d (e.g., implemented using software executed by hardware such as one or more processors) as illustrated in . However, those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the computing device * or at least the logic modules (e.g., the transfer indicator acquiring module *, the verification input soliciting module *, the verification input receiving and transfer verifying module *, and the access providing module *) may be implemented using essentially any combination of hardware and software solutions. Further details related to the two implementations of computing device * illustrated in will be provided in greater detail below.","Although the computing device * illustrated in  is depicted as being a tablet computer, in alternative embodiments, the novel computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture may be embodied in other types of computer systems having other form factors including other types of portable computer devices such as, for example, laptops, Netbooks, Smartphones, e-readers, and so forth. As illustrated in , the computing device * includes a display device  (e.g., a touchscreen) on the front side (e.g., display side) of the computing device *. Also as depicted in , the display device  (e.g., touch screen) displaying an exemplary electronic document  and a tool bar . As further illustrated, the computing device * may include a camera  (e.g., a webcam) disposed on the front side of the computing device *. In some embodiments, additional cameras may be included on the front side and\/or backside (see, for example, ) of the computing device *.","There are a number of ways to determine or infer whether a computing device * is or has been transferred from one user to another (e.g., from a first user  to a second user  or from the second user  to the first user ). In some cases, for instance, various sensor-provided data may be collected in order to make such determination or inference. Depending on the quality of such collected data, a determination or an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred between two users. For example, if the quality of the sensor-provided data is poor, then the collected sensor-provided data may only suggest (infer) that the computing device has been transferred between two users (e.g., from the second user  to the first user ). On the other hand, if the quality of the data is good, then a determination (e.g., a more definitive conclusion) may be made that the computing device * has been transferred between two users.","The sensor-provided data that may be collected to determine or to infer that the computing device * has been transferred to, for example, the first user  from the second user  may indicate certain aspects of the computing device * (e.g., movements exhibited by the computing device * as a result of, for example, a user holding and deliberately moving the computing device * during the transfer of the computing device *) and\/or various environmental aspects surrounding the computing device * (e.g., presence or absence certain visual and\/or audio cues such as faces or voice patterns). For instance, when the computing device * of  is passed from, for example, the second user  (e.g., a third party having limited or restricted access rights to the computing device * and\/or to items that may be available through the computing device *) to the first user  (e.g., a primary user or owner of the computing device * having at least greater access rights to the computing device * and\/or its stored content than the second user ), the second user  in passing off the computing device * may exhibit certain movements that is passed onto the computing device *. The occurrence of such movements, as exhibited by the computing device *, may at least infer that the computing device * is being transferred from, for example, the second user  to another user (e.g., the first user ). These movements exhibited by the computing device  when detected may only suggest that the transfer (e.g., change in possession) of the computing device * from the second user  to another user (e.g., the first user ) has occurred. That is, generally when only the movements of the computing device * are monitored (as opposed to monitoring a combination of direct movements, visual cues, and\/or audio cues), such monitoring of the movements by itself may not result in a conclusive determination that the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., from the second user  to the first user ). Instead, at best, such detected movements may only suggest that the computing device * has been transferred between two users.","In many cases where a computing device * is being transferred between two users (e.g., from the second user  to the first user ), the computing device * will often exhibit identifiable movements. Such identifiable movements may often be repeated whenever, for example, a computing device * is transferred between two users. Thus, in order to at least infer whether a computing device * is being transferred from the second user  to, for example, the first user , one may monitor the spatial movements of the computing device * in order to detect movements that matches with certain \u201csignature movements\u201d that have been identified as movements that occur when, for example, a computing device * is being transferred between two users (e.g., being transferred from the second user  to the first user ).","In order to determine whether particular spatial movements exhibited by the computing device * is as a result of the transfer of the computing device * between two users (e.g., transfer from the second user  to the first user  or from the first user  to the second user ), the computing device * may maintain in its memory  (see the computing device \u2032 and the computing device \u2033 of ) a movement library  (see ), which is a catalog or library of signature movements that have been identified as movements that may occur when a computing device * is being transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user ). Such a catalog or library may be used in order to determine whether the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, the second user  to the first user . That is, when movements of the computing device * that match with a signature movement stored in the movement library  have been detected, then the detection of such movements may at least infer (e.g., imply) that a transfer of the computing device * has occurred between two users (e.g., from the first user  to the second user , or from the second user  to the first user ). Various types of signature movements may be stored in the movement library  including, for example, signature tilt movements, signature spin rotation movements, signature vibration movements, signature 3-dimensional movements, and so forth that infer or indicate the transfer of the computing device *.","One way to monitor the movements of the computing device * is to directly detect such movements using one or more integrated \u201cmovement\u201d sensors that are designed to directly detect\/measure movements of, the computing device *. Examples of such movement sensors include, for example, inertia sensors, accelerometers (e.g. three-axis or 3D accelerometers), gyroscopes, and so forth. These sensors (herein \u201cmovement\u201d sensors \u2014see , which illustrates the one or more types of sensors  that may be included in the computing device  of ) when integrated with a computing device * may be used to directly detect the actual movements\/motions of the computing device * as the computing device * is being transferred from, for example, a first user  to a second user  or from the second user  to the first user .","Since not all movements of the computing device * that may be detected will be as a result of the computing device * being transferred between two users, in various embodiments and as will be further described herein, the computing device * may be endowed with particular logic for determining (e.g., identifying) which movements associated with the computing device * that have been detected at least suggests that the computing device * is or has been transferred from, for example, a second user  to a first user  (or vice versa) and which detected movements may merely be \u201cnoise movements\u201d (e.g., random or accidental movements caused by the user holding the computing device * randomly or accidentally moving the computing device *).","Various types of movements of the computing device * may be tracked in order to at least infer that the computing device * is being transferred between, for example, a first user  and a second user . Examples of the type of movements that may be tracked include, for example, tilt type movements, spin type rotation movements, spatial relocation type movements, vibration movements, overall three-dimensional movements (which may be a composite of various types of movements), and so forth of the computing device *. In order to at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user , the various movements exhibited by the computing device * may be, individually or in combination, tracked using one or more movement sensors  that may be included with the computing device *. For example, in various embodiments, one or more movement sensors  (e.g., inertia devices, accelerometers, etc.) that can directly detect movements, and\/or other types of sensors  (e.g., image capturing devices , audio capturing devices , etc.) that may be able to indirectly detect movements may be employed in order to track the movements of the computing device * as will be further described herein.","Referring now to illustrating various types of tilts and tilt movements of the computing device * that may be detected and monitored using one or more sensors  (e.g., one or more movement sensors ) in order to at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from a first user  to a second user  or from the second user  to the first user ). That is, shows the backside of the computing device * and some of the tilt-type movements that may be monitored by the computing device * in order to at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred between two users such as from the second user  to the first user . As previously described, and in accordance with various embodiments, the first user  may be a primary user or owner of the computing device * and the second user  may be any third party (e.g., a friend or co-worker) who has lower or inferior access rights than the first user  to the computing device * and\/or to one or more items that may be stored or available through the computing device *.","One type of tilt that may be detected\/monitored is tilt of the computing device * that may occur when the computing device * is at least partially rotated around a central horizontal axis . A second type of tilt that may be detected is tilt , which may occur when the computing device * is at least partially rotated around a bottom horizontal axis . Although not depicted, another type of tilt that may occur and that may be monitored is when the computing device * is at least partially rotated around an angular axis that is angular with respect to a horizontal axis (e.g., axis or ) and is parallel to the plane of the backside similar to axis and axis . Yet another type of tilt that may occur and that may also be monitored is when the computing device * is at least partially rotated around a vertical axis . Note that although the vertical axis is depicted as being centered along the backside of the computing device *, just like the horizontal axis , the vertical axis does not have to be centered on the backside and instead, may be offset from the center of the backside of the computing device * (e.g., may be closer to one end of the device rather than an opposite end of the device.","By detecting that the computing device * has been tilted in a particular manner from a first tilt orientation to a second tilt orientation, at least an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user . In particular, when the first user  is handing off or transferring the computing device * to the second user , the first user  may tilt the computing device * in a particular way that may be identifiable. Similarly, when the second user  is handing off or transferring the computing device * to the first user , the second user  may tilt the computing device * in a particular way that may be similarly identifiable. Thus, when the computing device * is being transferred from a first user  to a second user  or vice versa, the computing device * (or rather the logic endowed with the computing device *) may track the movements (i.e., tilt movements) of the computing device * as it moves from a first tilt orientation (e.g., the tilt of the computing device * at the beginning of the transfer or when the first user  or the second user  was in possession of the computing device *) to a second tilt orientation (e.g., the tilt of the computing device * at the end of the transfer or when the second user  or the first user , for example, has acquired possession of the computing device *).","In order to make at least an inference that a transfer was made from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user , the computing device * or at least the logic endowed in the computing device * may examine the particular movements of the computing device * (e.g., how the computing device * was reoriented from a first tilt orientation to a second tilt orientation including speed and cadence of the reorientation) as the computing device * moves from the first tilt orientation to a second tilt orientation. The computing device * may additionally or alternatively analyze the second tilt orientation (e.g., the tilt of the computing device * after it has finished being reoriented) at least with respect to the first tilt orientation in order to at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred. To further determine or at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user , the examination\/analysis of the detected tilt movements of the computing device * may involve comparing the detected tilt movements of the computing device * with catalogued or library signature tilt movements (which may be stored in the memory  of the computing device ) that are identified as being movements associated with transfer of the computing device * between two users.","That is, the computing device * may maintain in its memory  (see ) a movement library  that may include a catalogue or library of signature movements including signature tilt movements that have been previously identified as tilt movements that may occur when, for example, a computing device * is transferred between two users (e.g., first user  and second user ). Thus, when tilt movements that match with catalogued or library signature tilt movements have been detected, then a determination or inference may be made that a transfer of the computing device * between two users has occurred. Note that the above discussed tilt movements relates to the movement of the computing device * as it moves from a first tilt orientation to a second tilt orientation.","Thus, another aspect of tilt orientation changes that may be considered in order to at least infer that a transfer has taken place is to simply look at the end points of the tilt reorientation and their differences. In other words, to analyze the first tilt orientation (e.g., the tilt orientation of the computing device * before the computing device * being reoriented) and the second tilt orientation (e.g., the end tilt orientation of the computing device * after it has been reoriented) with respect to each other, and the differences between the first tilt orientation and the second tilt orientation. Thus, in some embodiments, the computing device * may also or additionally maintain a catalogue or library of changes of tilt orientation (e.g., tilt orientation changes) that have been previously identified as signature tilt changes that occur when, for example, a computing device * is transferred between two users. Such catalogue or library of tilt orientation changes may be stored as part of a movement library  stored in memory  (see ) of the computing device * of  (e.g., the computing device \u2032 of or the computing device \u2033 of ). Therefore, when tilt orientation changes that match with catalogued or library signature tilt orientation changes (e.g., as stored in the movement library  of the memory ) have been detected, then at least an inference may be made that a transfer of the computing device * between two users (e.g., transfer from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user ) has occurred.","Referring now to illustrating another type of movement of the computing device * that may be detected\/monitored in order to at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred between two users. In particular, shows a few types of spin rotation and spin rotation movements of the computing device * that may be detected\/monitored using one or more sensors  (e.g., one or more movement sensors ) in order to determine or infer that a transfer of the computing device * between two users has occurred. Note that this type of rotation (e.g., spin rotation) is different from the type of rotation associated with the previously described tilt movement where the \u201ctilt\u201d rotation involves the entire backside (or the front side ) of the computing device * rotating around some axis in a sweeping motion. In a spin rotation, the backside (or the front side ) of the computing device * substantially spins around an axis without the sweeping motion. Referring back to , which shows some of the various types of spin rotations that may be monitored by the computing device * in order to at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user ).","Examples of the type of spin rotations that may be monitored include a spin rotation of the computing device * that occurs when the computing device * is rotated around a center axis that is centered and vertical to the backside of the computing device *. Another type of spin rotation that may be monitored is a spin rotation of the computing device * that occurs when the computing device * is rotated around a center axis that may be centered but not vertical to the backside B of the computing device *. Instead, the center axis is angular to the backside of the computing device * such that when the computing device * is rotating around the center axis , the computing device * will have a constant tilt with respect to the center axis . Another type of rotation that may be monitored is spin rotation of the computing device * that may occur when the computing device * is rotated around an axis that may not be centered on the backside B of the computing device and that may not be vertical to the backside B of the computing device *.","By detecting that the computing device * has been spin rotated in a particular manner, at least an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user ). In particular, when the first user  is handing off or transferring the computing device * to the second user , the first user  may spin rotate the computing device * in a particular way. Thus, when the computing device * is being transferred from, for example, the second user  to the first user , the computing device * (or rather the logic endowed with the computing device *) may track the movements of the computing device * as it moves from a first spin orientation (e.g., the orientation of the computing device * at the beginning of the transfer or when the second user  was in possession of the computing device *) to a second spin orientation (e.g., the orientation of the computing device * at the end of the transfer or when the first user  has acquired possession of the computing device *).","Similar to the tilt or tilt movement detection\/analysis described earlier, in order to make at least an inference that a transfer was made between two users (e.g., either transferred from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user ), the computing device * or at least the logic endowed in the computing device * may scrutinize the particular movements of the computing device * as the computing device * spin rotates from a first orientation (e.g., the initial orientation of the computing device * at the beginning of the transfer of the computing device * between two users) to a second orientation (e.g., the end orientation of the computing device * at the end of the transfer). The computing device * may additionally or alternatively analyze the second orientation (e.g., the orientation of the computing device * after it has finished being spin rotated) at least with respect to the first orientation (e.g., the orientation of the computing device * before it was spin rotated) in order to at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred. To further determine or at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user ), the examination\/analysis of the detected spin rotation movements of the computing device * from the first orientation to the second orientation may involve comparing the detected spin rotation movements of the computing device * with catalogued or library signature spin rotation movements that are identified as being associated with transfer of the computing device *. That is, the computing device * may maintain in its memory  (see ) a movement library  that may include a catalogue or library of signature movements including signature spin rotation movements that may have been previously identified as spin rotation movements that may occur when, for example, a computing device * is transferred between two users. When the computing device * or at least the logic endowed with the computing device * detects the computing device * exhibiting movements that match with the signature spin rotation movements stored in the movement library  then at least an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user ).","Turning now to illustrating yet another type of movement of the computing device * that may be detected\/monitored in order to at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred between two users. In particular, shows the computing device * being relocated by moving from a first spatial location  to a second spatial location  when the computing device * is transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from the second user  to the first user ). In various embodiments, such movements from the first spatial location  to the second spatial location , which will be referred to herein as \u201cspatial relocation movements,\u201d may be detected using one or more sensors  (e.g., one or more movement sensors ). In order to make at least an inference that a transfer was made from, for example, the second user  to the first user , the computing device * or at least the logic endowed in the computing device * may examine\/analyze the particular spatial relocation movements  of the computing device  as it moves from the first spatial location  to the second spatial location , and to compare the pattern of spatial relocation movements  (e.g., path, speed, acceleration, and so forth).","In some cases, the computing device * (or rather the logic endowed with the computing device *) may additionally or alternatively analyze the second spatial location  with respect to the first spatial location  in order to determine or at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, the second user  to the first user . To further determine or infer that the computing device * has been transferred from the second user  to the first user  (or vice versa), the examination\/analysis of the detected spatial relocation movements of the computing device * may be compared with catalogued or library signature spatial relocation movements (or simply \u201csignature spatial movements\u201d) that have been identified as being associated with the transfer of the computing device  between two users. That is, the computing device * may maintain in its memory  (see ) a movement library  that may include a catalogue or library of signature movements including signature spatial relocation movements that may have been previously identified as spatial relocation movements that may occur when, for example, a computing device * is transferred between two users. When the computing device * or at least the logic endowed with the computing device * detects the computing device * exhibiting movements that match with signature spatial relocation movements stored in the movement library  at least an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user ).","In some embodiments, in order to at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from the second user  to the first user ), the computing device * may be endowed with logic that detects\/monitors vibrations that may have been exhibited by the computing device *. In some cases, such vibration may have been transferred to the computing device * from a user (e.g., the first user  or the second user ) who is holding the computing device * after the computing device * has been transferred to the user from another user. That is, each user who may come in contact with the computing device * may pass on to the computing device * unique vibration patterns (e.g., as a result of user's heartbeat). Thus, when the second user , for example is holding the computing device *, the computing device * may vibrate in a particular signature vibration pattern that is associated with the second user . In contrast, when the computing device * has been transferred to the first user  from the second user , and the first user  is holding the computing device *, the computing device * may vibrate in a vibration pattern (e.g., signature vibration pattern) that is associated with the first user .","Thus, one way to infer that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user , or from the second user  to the first user  is to detect\/monitor at least changes in vibrations of the computing device *. In some cases, this may involve the computing device * (or at least the logic endowed with the computing device *) initially detecting the particular vibration pattern of the computing device * when the computing device * is being possessed by, for example, the second user , and to detect when the computing device * no longer vibrates in such a particular vibration pattern. In order to determine whether the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, the second user  to the first user , the computing device * may be further designed to determine that the computing device * is vibrating in a way that matches with a signature vibration pattern of the first user  when previously it had detected that the computing device * was vibrating in a manner that did not match with the signature vibration pattern of the first user  (e.g., in a manner that matched with the signature vibration pattern of the second user ). By making such a determination, at least an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred from the second user  to the first user .","In some embodiments, the computing device * may include logic that is designed to determine whether the computing device * has moved away from one user, such as the second user , and has moved closer to another user, such as the first user , in order to determine whether the computing device * has been transferred from the second user  to the first user . That is, by making such a determination, an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred from the second user  to the first user . In some embodiments, in order to make such a determination, data from a combination of sensors  may be processed and analyzed. That is, in order to determine whether the computing device * has moved away from the second user  and closer to the first user , a combination of one or more movement sensors  (see ) for directly detecting movements of the computing device *, one or more image capturing devices  (e.g., webcam or digital camera), and\/or one or more audio capturing devices  (e.g., microphones) may be employed in order to determine whether the computing device * is moving away from the second user  and moving closer to the first user  (and thus, an inference that the computing device * has been transferred from the second user  to the first user ). For example, the computing device * in some cases may employ one or more movement sensors  to detect the actual movements of the computing device * and one or more image capturing devices  (along with facial recognition system\/application) to determine that a face associated with the second user  is moving away from the computing device * and a face associated with the first user  is moving closer to the computing device *. Based on the data provided by both the movement sensors  and the image capturing devices , at least an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred from the second user  to the first user .","In some embodiments, and as illustrated in , rather than only monitoring for a particular type of movement (e.g., tilt-type movements, spin rotation movements, spatial relocation movements, vibration movements, and so forth) the computing device * may be endowed with logic that is designed to detect\/monitor the overall three-dimensional movements of the computing device * and to determine whether the computing device * has moved in a particular three-dimensional way that at least suggests or infers that the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user ). In order to accomplish this, the computing device * may maintain in its memory  (see ) a movement library  that may include a catalogue or library of signature movements including signature three-dimensional movements that may have been previously identified as three-dimensional movements that may occur when, for example, a computing device * is transferred between two users. When the computing device * or at least the logic endowed with the computing device * detects the computing device * exhibiting movements that match with the signature three-dimensional movements stored in the movement library  then at least an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user ).","In many cases, it may be insufficient to rely only on the directly detected movements of the computing device * in order to determine whether the computing device * has been transferred between two users. For example, and as described earlier, in some instances, higher standards for determining whether a transfer has occurred (which may not be satisfied based purely only on the detected movements of the computing device *) may be needed in order to ensure that confidential information is not inadvertently accessed. Thus, and as described briefly above, in addition to or alternative to detecting the movements of the computing device * using, for example, movement sensors  (e.g., inertia sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and so forth), environmental aspects surrounding the computing device * may also or alternatively be detected\/monitored in order to determine or infer whether the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from a first user  to a second user  or from the second user  to the first user ). For instance, in some embodiments, the computing device * or the logic endowed with the computing device * may be designed to detect, using one or more image capturing devices , certain visual cues that when detected at least suggests the transfer of the computing device * between two users (e.g., transfer from the second user  to the first user .","For example, in some embodiments, the computing device * may be endowed with a facial recognition system (e.g., facial recognition software) that may be employed with one or more image capturing devices  (see ) in order to determine the presence or absence of a face associated with the first user  or the second user  within the proximate vicinity (e.g., within the immediate vicinity such as within three or four feet) of the computing device *. For example, if the face of the second user , which may have been initially detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *, is no longer detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *, and if the face associated with the first user  is instead detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *, then at least an inference may be made that a transfer of the computing device * from the second user  to the first user  may have occurred. The phrase \u201cproximate vicinity\u201d as used here is in reference to the immediate area surrounding the computing device * such as within a distance from the computing device * from which an object or a person is at least visually (or audibly) discernible or identifiable by the computing device * using, for example, a facial recognition system (or a voice verification system).","Another type of visual cues that the computing device * or at least the logic endowed with the computing device * may seek\/consider in order to determine or infer whether the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., transferred from a first user  to a second user  or from the second user  to the first user ) is the presence or absence of one or more eyes (e.g., irises or retinas) in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * that are determined to be associated with the first user  or the second user . In particular, if the eyes of the first user  is initially detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * but is subsequently determined not to be at least in the field of view of an image capturing device  of the computing device * and\/or if one or more eyes of another person (e.g., second user ) other than the first user  suddenly appears in the field of view of the image capturing device  (see camera  of ), then at least an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user . Similarly, if one or more eyes of a person (e.g., second user ) other than the first user  is initially detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * but is subsequently no longer detected at least in the field of view of the image capturing device  of the computing device * and\/or if one or more eyes of the first user  suddenly appears in the field of view of the image capturing device  of the computing device * then at least an inference may be made that computing device * has been transferred from the second user  to the first user .","In various embodiments, the computing device * or at least the logic that may be endowed with the computing device * may be designed to detect absence or presence of audio cues in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * in order to determine or at least infer as to whether the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., either transferred from a first user  to a second user  or transferred from the second user  to the first user ). For example, in some embodiments, the computing device * may be endowed with voice verification system that may be designed to detect, via one or more audio capturing devices  (e.g., one or more microphones), the sudden presence or increase in volume of a voice in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * having a voice pattern that matches with the signature voice pattern of the first user . By making such a determination and\/or by detecting the absence or diminishment of a voice associated with the second user  in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *, at least an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, the second user  to the first user .","In various embodiments, the computing device * or at least the logic endowed with the computing device * may be designed to at least infer that the transfer of the computing device * between two users (e.g., either transferred from the first user  to the second user  or transferred from the second user  to the first user ) has occurred based on one or more detected movements of the computing device *, one or more detected visual cues, and\/or one or more detected audio cues. That is, since in many situations, a single type of indicator or measurement (e.g., detected movements of the computing device * or detected visual cues in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *) may not reliably or conclusively indicate that the transfer of the computing device * between two users has occurred, in some embodiments, the computing device * may attempt to make such determination based on a combination of different types of indicators\/measurements (e.g., movements of the computing device *, visual cues, and\/or audio cues).","However, even in situations where multiple types of data (e.g., movement data, image data, audio data, and so forth) are collected and processed, such procedures may at best only provide an inference or suggestion that the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, the second user  to the first user , That is, and as briefly explained earlier, in cases where greater access to one or more items via the computing device * is to be granted, such as when the computing device * is being transferred to a first user (e.g., a primary user of the computing device *) from the second user (a third party with lower accessing rights than the primary user), a higher level of proof that the computing device * has indeed been transferred to the first user  may be required in order to ensure that confidential or personal information is not inadvertently released. For purposes of this description, the data (e.g., sensor-provided data) that is collected that suggests (e.g., infers) that the computing device * has been transferred between two users, such as from the second user  to the first user , will be referred to as \u201cindicators.\u201d","As briefly described earlier, in response to acquiring or receiving one or more indicators that suggest that the computing device * has been transferred to the first user  from the second user , the computing device * or at least the logic endowed in the computing device * may be designed to detect for input data that verifies that the computing device * has indeed been transferred to the first user . For example, in some cases, the first user  may be aware that whenever the first user  receives the computing device * back from another user (e.g. second user ) who has inferior accessing rights to the computing device * than the first user , he\/she is required to draw a unite figure, write a name, or sign a particular portion of a touch screen of the computing device * in order to alert the computing device * (or the endowed logic) that the first user  has regained possession of the computing device *. Thus, once the computing device * detects that the first user  has entered such input that verifies that the computing device * is back in the possession of the first user , the computer device * may accordingly reconfigure itself (in order to allow greater access to one or more items).","In some embodiments, the detection of the input data that verifies that the computing device * has been transferred to, for example, the first user  may involve soliciting for the input data. For example, in some instances, this may involve requesting the first user * (or whomever having possession of the computing device *) to provide the input data. If the input data is indeed solicited, then the solicitation may be made visually and\/or audibly through one or more display monitors  and\/or speakers  (see that illustrate two particular implementations of the computing device *). In some cases, the solicitation may be made by making a request for biometric input to be provided. Examples of biometric input that may be requested include, for example, a clear and unobstructed view of a face or an eye be provided to a camera  (see ) of the computing device * or clear unmuffled voice of a user (e.g., first user ) be spoken to a microphone  (see ) of the computing device *. Alternatively or additionally, the solicitation of the input may involve requesting that personal credentials (e.g., password) be entered via, for example, a keypad, a touchscreen, or a microphone, or requesting a \u201csecret\u201d gesture be executed on a touchscreen (e.g., display monitor  of ) or to show such gesture to a camera  (e.g., image capturing device  of ) of the computing device *.","In various embodiments, and as described earlier, in response to detecting the input verifying that the computing device * has been transferred to the first user , the computing device * or at least the logic that may be endowed with the computing device * may be designed to provide at least greater access via the computing device * to one or more items (e.g., electronic documents, image or audio files, applications, passwords, and so forth) that were at least not partially accessible when the computing device * was in the possession of the second user . In various embodiments, the one or more items that greater access may be provided to may be one or more electronic items that the second user  may have had limited or restricted access to or had completely no access to prior to the transfer of the computing device * when the second user  had possession of the computing device *.","Referring to illustrating a face  and an eye  of the first user  near the front side of the computing device * of , , , and . In some embodiments, in order to obtain input that verifies that the computing device * has been transferred to the first user , the first user  may be requested to bring his\/her face  or eye  close to the camera  of the computing device * so that the camera  can have a clear and close view of the face  or the eye . Alternatively or additionally, the first user  may be requested to speak into a microphone  of the computing device * so that the computing device * can verify for example that the first user  has possession of the computing device *. As further illustrated in , displaying on the display device  (e.g., display monitor  of ) is a message  that requests the first user  (or whoever else has the possession of the computing device *) to perform some sort of act in order to obtain input that verifies that the computing device * is in the possession of, for example, the first user .","In various embodiments, in response to receiving the input verifying that the computing device * has been transferred to the first user , the computing device * or the logic endowed with the computing device * may be designed to provide via the computing device * at least greater access to one or more items. The type of access to be provided in response to receiving the input verifying that the computing device * has been transferred to the first user  may depend on a number of factors including what type of items is the greater access or accesses being provided to. For example, if the one or more items are one or more software applications (herein \u201capplications\u201d), then the greater access (or accesses) to be provided may be access to one or more functionalities of the one or more applications  (see ). Alternatively, the greater access to be provided to the one or more applications  in some cases may mean access to the one or more applications  being completely unblocked and\/or unhidden. In contrast, if the one or more items are one or more electronic documents (e.g., productivity documents, image or audio files, etc.), then providing at least greater access to such items may relate to providing greater editorial access (e.g., allowing modifications, deletions, additions, and so forth to the items) to the one or more items.","In some cases, providing at least greater access to the one or more items may mean providing viewing access to the one or more items, while in other cases, it may mean providing audio access to the one or more items. In still other cases it may mean providing both viewing and audio access to the one or more items. In some cases, providing at least greater access to the one or more items may mean providing completely unrestricted access to the one or more items. In any event, a more detailed discussion related to the various types of access that may be provided to the one or more items will be provided below with respect to the operations and processes to be described herein.","Referring now to illustrating, as indicated earlier, two embodiments (illustrated in as computing device \u2032 and in as computing device \u2033) of the computing device * of , , , and .

The verification input detecting module \u2032 may be designed to detect, in response to the acquisition by the transfer indicator acquiring module \u2032 of the one or more indicators, input that verifies that the computing device * has been transferred to the first user . The access providing module \u2032 is a logic module that is designed to provide at least greater access via the computing device \u2032 to one or more items (e.g., electronic documents, audio or image files, software applications, passwords, and so forth) in response to the detection of the input that verifies that the computing device * has been transferred to the first user .
