title: System and method for remotely configuring testing laboratories
abstract: The invention provides a system for remotely configuring a plurality of devices to customize a lab network system for testing components and for training operators to use and maintain such systems. The system is configured to remotely access and control such a system via a computer network such as the Internet. Once connected, a user can run testing scenarios on the configured devices remotely from any location that has access to the Internet. In accordance with the invention, an organization's network equipment is integrated with specialized physical switching technologies, and controlled by unique management software. Access to the network equipment may be provided remotely, and granted via a scheduling service. Thus, multiple physical equipment labs can be integrated into one globally, visible resource, enabling one-stop scheduling of lab time without knowing the detailed inventory of a particular network equipment facility. Storage capability is provided for network topologies described using a standards-based topology description language. This topology archive is integrated with the equipment lab management software allowing lab efforts to be saved for later reuse. In addition to topology and configuration information, complete session logs can also be saved, allowing “offline” analysis of lab activities. Network topologies and device configurations may be uniquely specified using a provided authoring environment to facilitate customized lab configurations.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The invention generally relates to systems for testing equipment and, more particularly, to a system and method for remotely configuring and running lab network topologies and scenarios.","Service providers and corporations build engineering and support labs to validate new services, support customers, and extend their customer reach. To maintain and run these labs, institutions are investing heavily in network engineering professionals, buildings, and equipment. However, most current manual and device based lab methodologies are time consuming to construct and scale poorly for large projects. This, in turn, prevents reusability of lab test scenarios and severely reduces the ability to preserve \u201cbest practice\u201d qualities.","Moreover, components for use in computer networks are generally complicated to use and expensive to manufacture. Often, their production runs are small and require a large amount of development resources to produce. For at least these reasons it can be expensive to build additional components for testing purposes and for training people on operating the components. However, for companies and institutions that produce components for computer networks, there is a business need to verify the operability of these components for potential customers.","One solution that has been attempted is to set up various testing labs, for example, in different product sales regions, and install a number of components for testing and training purposes. As more components are developed, they are usually added to these individual systems to facilitate further testing and training. This requires manual interaction by an operator to both install the components and to test them. Complicating matters, installing the components can often be difficult, and these components must be properly integrated into a system to be tested. Further, most customer systems are quite diverse and usually require components to be tested either on their own systems or on similar systems with like components.","In addition, because each sales region is usually defined geographically, testing facilities can be numerous and are seldom standard in configuration or content. This also can make training on the use and maintenance of such systems difficult. For example, at present, people must be physically located at a testing\/training facility to operate particular systems there. Labs are designed with in-place and loaned equipment and configured as close to the customer or production configuration as possible. Operational testing is done, results are gathered and analyzed, and the test configuration is disassembled to prepare for the next test configuration. Tools are unavailable for capturing and reusing device configurations, topologies, and network traffic activities. Lab scenarios and configurations are not documented and reused, and lab equipment utilization falls to about 20%.","Additionally, conventional network lab facilities tend to be large, physical installations. They can be thousands of square feet in size and represent millions of dollars in both capital and annual operating expenses. Staffing these facilities can often require between 30 and 100 network engineers. In this lab environment, engineers may only be able to accomplish approximately 20\u201330 major laboratory configurations per year. A lab operating model developed around these parameters generates a per lab cost basis of about $8,000 to $10,000 per lab per engineer. For each engineering test, this amounts to more than $200,000 being expended annually. These costs are extremely high given a usage rate of only approximately 20%. With the forecasted growth of network systems expected to increase significantly, the potential for engineering costs to increase is high.","There exists a need for standardizing such facilities to facilitate the testing of components and systems, while providing a remote interface to allow users to access these facilities remotely to configure the facilities for testing and support, and for training people to use these systems in these facilities, thereby steadying the rising development and testing costs. It is to these ends that the present invention is directed.","The invention provides a system for remotely configuring a plurality of devices to customize a lab network system for testing components and for training operators to use and maintain such systems. The system is configured to remotely access and control such a system via a computer network such as the Internet. Once connected, a user can run testing scenarios on the configured devices remotely from any location that has access to the Internet.","In accordance with the invention, an organization's network equipment is integrated with specialized physical switching technologies, and controlled by unique management software. Access to the network equipment may be provided remotely, and granted via a scheduling service. Thus, multiple physical equipment labs can be integrated into one globally, visible resource, enabling one-stop scheduling of lab time without knowing the detailed inventory of a particular network equipment facility.","Storage capability is provided for network topologies described using a standards-based topology description language. This topology archive is integrated with the equipment lab management software allowing lab efforts to be saved for later reuse. In addition to topology and configuration information, complete session logs can also be saved, allowing \u201coffline\u201d analysis of lab activities. Network topologies and device configurations may be uniquely specified using a provided authoring environment to facilitate customized lab configurations.","In an aspect, the invention affords a system for configuring one or more devices to customize a lab network in one or more participating facilities for testing scenarios using those devices. A language subsystem is provided for creating a network topology description for a scenario. The language subsystem utilizes an XML-based language to describe the network topology description, such as network topology information, device and interface configuration information, and condition state information of the topology and devices. The language subsystem comprises a schema for formally defining the XML-based language to describe the network topology description and a parser for interpreting language expressions and determining whether those expressions are valid for creating a scenario description.","A scenario scheduling subsystem is provided for scheduling a facility to execute the scenario and for reserving one or more requested devices to be utilized in executing the scenario. The scenario scheduling subsystem comprises a global scheduler for maintaining scheduling information relating to all of the participating facilities in an associated global schedule database, and a global inventory database for maintaining information relating to all of the devices within the participating facilities. The global scheduler interfaces with a local scheduler located in respective ones of the participating facilities for maintaining scheduling information relating to that facility in an associated local schedule database, and a local inventory database for maintaining information relating to all of the devices within that facility. The scenario scheduling system may also include an authentication system for authenticating users accessing the scheduling system to ensure that only those users having valid access can request scheduling of scenarios using the scenario scheduling system.","A lab management subsystem is also provided for executing scenarios. Each participating facility may include its own lab management subsystem. The lab management subsystem comprises a local scheduler for maintaining scheduling information relating to an associated facility in an associated local schedule database, a scenario manager for interpreting and executing scheduled scenarios, and an inventory manager for interacting with the scenario manager to retrieve description information about the devices maintained in a local inventory database and for configuring the devices in accordance with the description information to enable the devices to be used in the scenario. The lab management subsystem also includes a device controller for managing the operation of the one or more devices utilized in executing the scenario, a proxy server for providing access to device consoles enabling authorized users to control the devices during the executing scenario, a switch controller for controlling switching systems used during the executing scenario, and an OS\/Image manager for maintaining an archive of system images in an associated image database and delivering the system images to devices under control of the scenario manager. A lab maintenance client may interface with the lab management subsystem enabling remote control of the lab management subsystem and remote monitoring of the participating facilities. A scenario archive subsystem may also be provided for archiving custom created scenarios for reuse in an associated archive database.","The invention also affords a method for configuring one or more devices to customize a lab network in one or more participating facilities for testing scenarios using those devices. The method comprises the steps of creating a network topology description for a scenario, scheduling a facility to execute the scenario and reserve one or more requested devices to be utilized in executing the scenario, and executing the scenario. The method also includes the step of archiving the executed scenario for reuse.","The creating step includes using a visual tool application to create the scenario by drawing a network topology, and automatically translating the network topology into a scenario that can be executed by a lab management subsystem. The scheduling step includes accessing a scenario scheduling subsystem to schedule a scenario request, and determining a facility and one or more devices to be used to fulfill the scenario request. The executing step includes retrieving description information about devices to be used in executing the scenario, configuring the devices in accordance with the description information to enable the devices to be used in the scenario, and managing the operation of the devices during the executing scenario.","The present invention provides an integrated set of tools and services that enable a user to securely and reliably access an arbitrary network topology on demand using a computer network, such as the Internet.  shows a diagram of a network architecture for accessing the remote lab system of the invention. The architecture  may include a lab management system  connected with one or more clients  across a wide area network (WAN) , such as the Internet, or more particularly, the World Wide Web. The lab management system  may comprise one or more subsystems (described below) that may be executed by a microprocessor  in the lab management system  in order to operate as the remote lab system of the invention. The Internet  permits the lab management system , when accessed by an individual client , to display a user interface (described below) on the client computer system  which permits the client  to interact with the lab management system .","The client computer system(s)  may include a display device , a chassis , and one or more user input devices, such as a mouse  and a keyboard . The chassis  may house a permanent storage system , such as a hard disk drive, optical disk drive, tape drive, or the like, which may store one or more software applications such as a web browser application . The client computer system may have a memory  resident therein and the software application from the disk  may be transferred to the memory  to be executed by a CPU  in the computer system . The browser application may be configured to connect the client  to the lab management system  over the WAN  and remotely configure and run custom lab topologies and scenarios in accordance with the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["12","12","12"]},"As shown in , the subsystems comprising the remote lab system  may include a language system and tool subsystem , a scenario scheduling subsystem , a scenario archive subsystem , and a lab management subsystem . These subsystems will be described in more detail below.","The language and tool subsystem  enables the creation and common expression of lab network topologies and configurations (scenarios) that are used by the system  to execute customized testing scenarios. Preferably, the invention utilizes an XML-based language to describe lab network topologies, device and interface configurations, and to post condition states of the topologies and devices. This language, referred to as the Network Description Language, or NDL, standardizes network topology descriptions that may be used by the system  to execute customized testing scenarios. However, those skilled in the art recognize that other languages may be used without departing from the invention. As will be described below, the language and tool subsystem  may include a visual software tool  for facilitating the creation of these network topology and device configuration descriptions. The software tool  is preferably integrated with the user's browser application , for example, as a Java applet, and allows the user to \u201cdraw\u201d a network topology, automatically translating the user's description into an actual configurable topology to be used in the physical laboratory.","Preferably, the software authoring tool  is built upon Visio, a visual drawing and diagramming tool available from Microsoft Corporation, for creating NDL descriptions of lab network topologies and device configurations. Alternatively, NDL descriptions may be created using a web-based generator, or other text editor without departing from the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["40","40","40","50","52","52","52","50"]},"In addition to the parser  and the schema , the subsystem  provides a set of extensions  to the Visio drawing application, preferably written in C++, which enables certain Visio shape objects to translate those objects to NDL descriptions on request. The subsystem  provides a set of these objects in a stencil . A development tool  is also provided to facilitate construction of NDL-aware shape objects. Since NDL is an XML based language, any text or XML editor  can be used to create NDL expressions.","Returning to , the scenario scheduling subsystem  is responsible for selecting an appropriate lab (from the numerous physical and geographically distinct labs) for executing an NDL-described scenario. The scenario scheduling subsystem  may include a globally accessible scheduling module , and may interface with local scheduling systems (described below) in each lab facility to enable selection of the most appropriate lab facility to execute a specified scenario. Thus, the scheduling subsystem  can substantially increase lab utilization by scheduling user access to remote physical labs and user access to remote devices and equipment when local labs are booked or unavailable.","The scheduling subsystem  enables authenticated, prioritized scheduling of individual or group access to network equipment in particular lab facilities. Preferably, the scheduling subsystem  is accessible to users via the Internet , for example, via a Java servlet that communicates via the HTTP protocol to the user's browser to serve a webpage, to enable users to remotely access the lab management system  and establish scheduling times for accessing network equipment and engage in testing scenarios. Advantageously, the scheduling subsystem  transparently schedules access to facilities regardless of the location of the physical lab or the location of the user.","In operation, a user accessing the Internet  via his\/her web browser application  may access an instance of a webpage designed to interact with the scheduling subsystem  of the lab management system , and request access to a particular combination of lab equipment. The scheduling subsystem  may, based on the user's request, determine the best lab facility for implementing the user's request, and assign the requested devices (with their requested configurations) to the user for use during a predetermined time. This allows global lab resources to be leveraged from any location, thus increasing lab utilization and reducing cost.","As described above, the scheduling subsystem  may be comprised of a global scheduler  and a local scheduler  (included in the lab management subsystem  described below).  is a diagram illustrating, in more detail, the scheduling subsystem  shown in . The global scheduler  may be associated with a global schedule database  and a global inventory database  for maintaining information about the various facilities and equipment within the network. The global schedule database  maintains a scheduled state of all resources (i.e., devices) in all facilities in the network. Preferably, the scheduled state of a local facility is cached (i.e., replicated) within that lab's local scheduler database  associated with the local scheduler  in that facility. This is done primarily to increase performance and to insure the system is resilient in the face of partial network failures. During an instance where the local schedule database  and the global database  are inconsistent, the information maintained in the global database  is preferably relied upon for scheduling.","The global scheduler  also maintains a global inventory database  that maintains information about lab resource inventory within the network. The inventory of each local lab is also preferably maintained within the local lab's own inventory database  associated with the local scheduler . In contrast with the scheduling databases , , the local inventory database  is dominant over the global inventory database . Thus, when inconsistencies exist between the local and global inventory databases , , the information maintained in the local database  is preferably relied upon for inventory information. Data maintained by the system  is preferably stored in relational databases that are accessed using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) protocol, however, other protocols and database architectures may be used without departing from the invention.","A user may interface with the global scheduler  via a web based interface implemented, for example, as a Java servlet that communicates via the HTTP protocol with a user's web browser application . Advantageously, the user interface presented to the user via the web browser application  may be look-and-feel neutral enabling integration with arbitrary web sites without requiring special design considerations.","The global scheduler  may also be integrated with a deployment specific authentication service , such as via public CORBA defined interfaces (described below). To integrate an existing authentication service  with the scheduler , a simple Java implementation of the CORBA interface may be provided that encapsulates the service specific behavior of the authentication service . Other interfaces may be utilized without departing from the invention and the above is merely exemplary. The authentication service  is primarily used to authenticate users to ensure that only those users that have proper access can schedule lab times and scenarios and otherwise interact with the system .","Preferably, programmatic interfaces to the system are built upon XML (Extensible Markup Language) over HTTP, CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture), or RMI (Remote Method Invocation) protocols, however, others may be used without departing from the invention. CORBA is an architecture that enables pieces of programs (objects) to communicate with one another regardless of the programming language used to write the objects or the operating system they execute on. RMI is a set of protocols developed by Sun Microsystems that enables Java objects to communicate remotely with other Java objects. Generally, most of the supported external APIs (application programming interfaces), such as that between the global scheduler  and the authentication service, as well as the interface between the web browser  and the global scheduler , are preferably implemented as XML\/HTTP interfaces (but could be implemented with other interfaces without departing from the invention). For example, CORBA APIs may be implemented where needed to support communication with existing external systems in specific deployments. RMI is preferably used for private external interfaces where efficiency takes precedence over extensibility, such as the interface between the global scheduler  and the local scheduler .","The archive and scheduling systems ,  are preferably deployed on Sun Microsystems hardware running the Solaris  or later operating system. The lab management subsystem  is preferably composed of a mix of Sun Microsystems hardware running Solaris  or later, PC systems running Linux, and proprietary hardware systems implementing various switching technologies.","Referring again to , the scenario archive subsystem  provides the ability to archive custom scenarios for later use. The system  not only provides the user with the ability to create new lab scenarios from previously created lab topologies and configurations, allowing engineers to extract scenarios from \u201cwhat-if\u201d and problem solving sessions rapidly, but enables the preservation of work and expertise that, in the past, would have been lost the moment a lab session was concluded.","The system  is designed to archive network designs, problems, solutions, training exercises, best-practice scenarios, and the like. The system  is also designed to extract the state of a network topology being executed in a physical lab, so that the work performed by users of a lab can be maintained and reused. When an access session is concluded, the user may be presented the opportunity to archive the complete session. This archive may include the initial NDL description of the scenario, the configuration of devices and interfaces at the end of the session, and the complete logs of all interactions with all devices during the session.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["44","44","31","44","90","44"]},"To locate specific scenarios a search engine application may be utilized by the scenario archive subsystem . Different searching methods may be capable, such as free-text searching, tag based searching, and topology indexed searching, among others. To control access to scenarios, the scenario archive subsystem  may be integrated with an externally provided authentication system , and may also be associated with external knowledge bases  to facilitate retrieval of additional scenarios.","Returning again to , the lab management subsystem  is designed to execute selected NDL-described scenarios on demand in a physical network equipment lab. Preferably, each participating physical lab environment includes its own lab management subsystem .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2","FIG. 6"],"b":["46","46","72","100","102","104","106","108","110","104","106","108","110"]},"As described above, the local scheduler  is a cache of the global scheduler  (). Entries in the local scheduler  preferably consist of those entries (i.e., device reservation) relevant to a particular lab. The lab management subsystem  attempts to keep the local scheduler  in synch with the global scheduler .","In operation, when a user accesses the remote lab management system , as described above, the user may initiate a scheduling request for particular devices and lab time and transmit that request to the scenario scheduling subsystem  (). The global scheduling system  () may pass the scheduling request to the local scheduler  which validates the device request against the inventory information maintained in the local inventory database  (maintained by the inventory manager ), and existing schedule information maintained in the local scheduling database , and fulfills (i.e., schedules) the request if possible. Preferably, the local scheduler  does not perform prioritization or access control over the request, since this is done by the global scheduling system . The local scheduler  and the global scheduling system  are preferably maintained in synchronization. However, in the event of a data inconsistency between these systems, the global scheduling system  is considered to contain the most accurate scheduling information.","The local scheduler  is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the local inventory database . When changes are made to this database , the changes are passed to the global scheduling system  for synchronizing the global inventory database .","The inventory manager  maintains the integrity of the inventory database . It interacts with the scenario manager  to keep track of the state (i.e., configuration, reservation, etc.) of each device maintained in the inventory database . It also interacts with the local scheduler  to insure that the scheduling system has an accurate snapshot of local lab inventory to facilitate accurate scheduling and reservation of devices in the facilities.","The scenario manager  interprets scheduled scenario requests and implements (i.e., executes) the requested scenario in cooperation with the group manager (not shown), inventory manager , device controller , proxy server , switch controller , and OS\/Image manager . In executing a scenario, the scenario manager  realizes a requested lab network topology (as described in the NDL description) by accessing the requested devices from the inventory manager  and configuring the devices as requested in order to carry out the scenario. When the scenario is complete, control of the devices is returned to the inventory manager  which may reinitialize the devices and make them available for use in another session.","The group manager (not shown) allows group labs to be utilized. It maintains a listing of group users, tracks system privileges for members of the groups, and provides client access to requested network topologies via a remote proxy so that group scenarios may be tested.","The inventory manager  maintains a listing of available and reserved devices. When a scenario is executed, the inventory manager  retrieves NDL descriptions of the devices from the inventory database , configures particular devices in accordance with the NDL descriptions, and initializes the requested devices using the device controller  to enable the devices to be used in the requested scenario.","The device controller  manages the operation of a device. The controller  may manage the resetting, configuring, and power control for each device used in a requested scenario. To enable the management of devices, the device controller  may interact with the scenario manager  using a common API interface.","The proxy server  provides authenticated, proxied, logged access to device consoles via one or more console servers , and to the HTTP port of web managed devices  enabling authorized users to control these devices during the scenario. The switch controller  functions as a software interface to the underlying switching devices used in the lab, including, for example, electronic matrix switches, optical matrix switches, A\/B switches, and the like. The OS\/Image manager  maintains an archive of system images (in an image database ) and delivers them via an image server  on demand to devices under the control of the scenario manager .","Device consoles are preferably managed via terminal servers (not shown) deployed on an internal control network. Data traffic flows from the console server(s)  to the appropriate terminal server, then on to the device console port. Device power is preferably controlled programmatically via a power controller  which interfaces with the device controller . Using the power controller  a user can force a power cycle of any device in the topology at any time during the lab session. The device controller  can also force a power cycle to devices as needed during device preparation.","Where possible, switching is preferably performed using device transparent matrix switch systems  utilizing a fully redundant solid state switching fabric. The invention supports serial switching at up to T3 (E3) rates or higher. Ethernet matrix switching is also supported at up to 100 megabits or more. Gigabit switching is available via non-matrix switching. Optical switching is accomplished with an optical switching matrix, supporting single mode and multi-mode fiber technologies. Single mode optical switching supports up to OC50 or higher, while multi-mode switching is fully bandwidth and technology independent. In certain cases when matrix switching is not available, the system provides programmable A\/B switch cascades. While this sort of switching is not entirely scalable, it does enable a much wider range of switching capability.","A lab maintenance client  may also be provided that offers the ability to control the lab management subsystem , including, for example, adding and removing devices to a lab network, adjusting priorities, and setting blackout periods for devices. It also provides a monitoring capability to remotely monitor facilities. The lab maintenance client  preferably interfaces with the lab management subsystem  via a public XML\/HTTP (or CORBA or other) interface, enabling additional applications to be written to extend the system as delivered, or to integrate the system with existing applications in the deployed environment.","As described above, users may interface with the system  using a standard web browser application . Remote access to network topologies may be provided, for example, via a Java RMI interface to a Java client (applet and\/or application versions) . This client  provides the user with complete control over the state of individual devices in the network topology. For example, the user can direct the system to temporarily disconnect an interface, or to power cycle a device, or load a fresh copy of an operating system image, or perform other operations, all in real-time from the client .","Advantageously, interactions between the user and the devices are logged for later retrieval. A preferred logging API utilizes a RMI interface that is implemented by the scenario archive subsystem .","The following examples illustrate the operability and utility of the invention. A user may design a network from his\/her desktop using the NDL authoring tool described above by, for example, dragging and dropping device icons from the stencil in the Visio-based (or other) authoring tool onto the drawing page. Once the device icon is on the page, the user may specify configuration parameters, device operating system or image, as well as other characteristics of the device, such as a label or description of the device's purpose in the topology. The user may connect interfaces between various devices, for example using a link creation tool, and then specify the type of link requested (i.e., Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, ATM, etc.). Once the user has completed drawing a network topology, the description of the network can be exported from the authoring system to the local file system as an NDL file.","In order to upload the network description (NDL) to the archive, the user may access the system via a browser, for example, logging in through the system's main webpage by typing in a user name and password. Once the system has authenticated the user, the user may then navigate through HTML (or similar) links to the archive webpage. From the archive webpage, the user may specify the NDL file on the hard disk to be uploaded into the system. The user may also list the existing NDL topologies that have been previously uploaded into the archive.","In order to schedule a reservation for a lab session, the user may navigate via the web browser application to a scheduling webpage, and enter the preferred time, date and duration of the lab session he\/she wishes to schedule. The user may also indicate the topology containing the equipment he\/she wishes to reserve. The scheduler returns a list of possible lab session reservations that meet the user's specified criteria and the user may select one of those choices, which the scheduler may confirm. While on the scheduling webpage, the user may also list all reservations he\/she has previously made, and may cancel any of these.","Prior to the start of the user's reserved lab session, the lab's local scheduler may feed the reservation to the scenario manager to be realized with the physical equipment in the lab. The lab management system may connect all of the links between the interfaces on each device as specified by the user in the NDL topology by, for example, controlling a matrix switch. In addition to connecting the links, the lab management system may apply the configurations to each device as specified by the user in the NDL. After the lab management system has connected the links and applied the configurations, the user may be permitted to access the equipment, for example, via a Java applet from the user's browser.","When accessing the lab session, the user may be presented with a graphical user interface that represents the topology as drawn in the authoring tool. The devices and links are distributed in approximately the same visual layout as originally authored. The user may access menus for each device or link by clicking the mouse with a sprite (i.e., cursor) over the item to be selected. From the device menu, the user may, for example, control the power to a device, turning it on or off. The user may also access the console of a device by selecting a menu item. The user will then experience console access with that device, preferably as a character-based, telnet-like window provided via the graphical user interface, or as a web-based interface depending on the capabilities of the individual device. The user may dynamically make and break links between device interfaces by manipulating the GUI representation of the links and devices. Accordingly, the user may conduct desired scenarios using the invention as described above.","Another example illustrating the utility of the invention involves testing. In order to evaluate a network's ability to withstand traffic storms, a service provider may author a topology containing, for example, several ATM switches and one or more traffic generators. This topology, described in NDL, could be uploaded into the archive and scheduled for testing in a lab either manually via the browser based user interface, or in an automated fashion, utilizing the system's public APIs. During the lab session, the topology may be altered to produce a variety of test permutations. For example, the location of a traffic generator in the topology can be changed by breaking existing links between the traffic generator and one or more ATM switches, and creating new links, thus establishing a different physical topology. Configurations on individual ATM switches may be adjusted to test quality of service and other features. During the test session, the logs of each device may be captured, extracted from the system, and analyzed by external tools to evaluate test results. The modified topology may be saved into the archive and re-used for future testing.","In an example illustrating knowledge capture and reuse capabilities of the invention, a subject matter expert may author a network topology for a specific market segment, incorporating industry best practices, or expertise in a particular vendor's product. This topology, described as NDL, may be uploaded into the archive and made available for use by subscribers to the system. Users wishing to design a new network may re-use a topolgy from the archive, adding devices or modifying configurations on existing devices as required by their particular requirements. Once the user has completed their modifications, the topology may be stored in the archive, scheduled in a lab, and exercised during a lab session.","In yet another example illustrating knowledge transfer and development collaboration, lab sessions may be accessed by multiple users. A subject matter expert may assist a user of the system during a running lab session by joining the session and observing the state of the devices in the topology. Each participant in a lab session may access the system from a different geographical location via their Internet browser. Using the console access for a particular device, all participants in a lab session may view the device configuration and activity simultaneously. Using the graphical user interface, all participants in a lab session may view the state of physical links between devices, and the state of power to each device simultaneously. A subject matter expert may examine the device, change configuration parameters, bring interfaces up or down, manipulate the power, or modify the links between devices. These changes are immediately observable by the other participants in the lab session. The modified topology can be saved into the archive for future use.","Another example illustrates interoperability testing capabilities of the invention. A topology may be authored with a specific vendor's products. Several variations of the topology may be created by substituting a different device, either from the same or different vendor. The performance and ability of the different devices to operate correctly with each other in a network can be evaluated by exercising each topology using the system, capturing and extracting the logs from the device consoles, and analyzing the results.","Further, the capabilities of a particular vendor's product, such as an ATM switch, may be demonstrated to a geographically distributed audience via the Internet. A topology which incorporates the device may be authored. The topology, described in NDL, may be uploaded to the archive, scheduled for use, and accessed during a lab session via an Internet browser.","While the foregoing has been described with reference to particular embodiments of the invention, such as a remote lab management, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes in these embodiments may be made without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention."],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
