Subsequent purchases to the original one that are captured in the database in the month of the original purchase plus the following, for example X months (e.g., 1, 5, 12, 24, etc.) are used to calculate the retention rate and\/or the average order. In some embodiments, the revenue from these subsequent purchases is netted out using a profit margin for each product to arrive at a net margin (or contribution). In some embodiments, since these subsequent purchases and associated revenue will be realized at a future point in time, the time value of money needs to be considered in valuing future revenue.","In some embodiments, the present value of future revenue may be calculated using a discount rate for the defined period of time. In some embodiments, the exemplary formula for present value equals future value divided by (1+d)n, where d=discount rate and n=number of years, assuming the discount rate is compounded annually. For example, assuming a discount rate of 3%, the 12 month contribution (future value) of $15,000 is divided by 1.03 to arrive at the present value of that contribution, or $14,563.","Continuing with the above example, in order to generate the $15,000 in future value from 200 acquired customers, the company had to invest in acquiring those customers at a cost (or negative contribution) of \u2212$18,000, or $90 per customer. The net present value is equal to the present value of the future revenue less the initial value of the investment. In this example, then, the net present value of the $18,000 investment is equal to $14,563 less $18,000, or \u2212$3,437, or $17.18 per original customer. Continuing further with this example, in the next six months, another $3,600 is generated by the same 200 customers. The present value of that future revenue is equal to $3,600\/1.031.5, or $3,444. In total, the present value of the 12 month revenue plus the 6 month revenue equals $18,007, the same as the initial investment. In other words, the net present value of the $18,000 original investment in one specific airing, after 1.5 years, is $7. The $7 is the payback on the investment and the payback period for that investment is said to be 18 months.","In some embodiments, the above analysis is done on each individual airing for a specific product and offer in each broadcast month that the product is being advertised. After 12 months of subsequent purchases by the original group of customers that were attributed to a specific airing, those results are rolled up or summarized at a network\/station level, providing the user a comparative view of the long term value of the networks\/stations used in the specific product's campaign. The marketer can use this view to supplement his\/her evaluation of media buying decisions to either confirm the recommended action or to override a recommended action. For example, if the media buyer recommends selling a specific airing or a group of airings on a network but the analytical tool shows that although this network produces an unacceptable initial contribution per order, its future value is superior to other networks, the user may choose to override that recommendation.","In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to perform airing level valuations based on by daypart, by day type (weekday vs. weekend), by creative, by offer, by product and any combination of these and other variables carried on the master record data table in a tagging database.","In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to, in addition to the mathematical calculations which ascribe a value to each network, apply demographic, psychographic and geographic data to the consumers that responded to the multiple offers run by multiple advertisers on a specific network\/station, to build a network customer and\/or a responder profile based on actual buyers and responders that responded to an airing on that network rather than on viewer surveys.","In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to determine value based on a negotiated rate for a specific DRTV airing and\/or a negotiated payout per order generated, usually by phone only. In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention account for a scenario when a third party may handle the media buying on the stations running the creative but usually only reports to the marketer the number of orders generated by that media in a day or week and the payment due for those orders based on the payout. That payment is essentially the media cost. In some embodiments, since most of the time a marketer does not receive specific airing level data for PI media, the aggregated cost, orders and revenue for a period of time form the basis for the valuation of that investment, in a similar fashion to rolling up airings that aired on the same network.","In some cases, the advertiser that uses direct mail to acquire new customers does so by typically renting targeted mailing lists of direct marketers, publishers and non-profit organizations for the purpose of mailing printed advertising material that is coded to indicate the source of the name being mailed to generate a response. In some embodiments, a response, in the form of a purchase or a lead that may convert to a customer purchase, is tracked to the original mailing list source either directly by the key code printed on the advertising material or by a match back algorithm.","In some embodiments, similar to the DRTV example above, the buying behavior of customers that are acquired through a specific mailing list is tracked over 12-24 months at which point the net present value of those subsequent purchases is combined with the net margin of the initial purchase and then divided by the original number of customers to provide a long term value to the investment in the mailing list.","In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to track the real-time value of airings based on at lest one ad in one of multiple consumer touch points that include, but are not limited to, print advertisements, direct mail, direct response television (DRTV), smartphones and the web, is designed to generate a response by means of such channels that include, but are not limited to, phone, website, postal mail, email, SMS and retail which is tracked to its trigger source thereby allowing for the calculation of a near term value to the investment in that source, at different levels of granularity, where customers originally generated at the most granular level of a source are tracked in terms of their subsequent transactions, revenue and\/or net margin generation for X number of months after the month of the original transaction at which point the present value of the subsequent margin dollars per original customer is added to the initial investment per original customer (called the net present value) to arrive at the near term value of any level of the source, from the highest summarized source level to the most granular (assuming statistically significant results at the most granular level) and, if the net present value is greater than zero, a discounted payback period is calculated for the investment.","In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to append demographic, psychographic and geographic variables to the master records of customers who responded to the advertisements of multiple advertisers, a responder and buyer profile is built for each media source used based on actual buyers that responded to a specific form of advertisement while controlling for variables that include, but are not limited to, changes in source content such as programming and man-made or natural catastrophic events that may affect consumers' consumption of media.","In some embodiments, the net margin may be equal to gross revenue of each subsequent purchase multiplied by a profit margin percent for the product purchased less all future contact costs including, but not limited to, email blasts, retargeting, direct mail, SMS texting. In some embodiments, the profit margin percent may be equal to the gross revenue less product cost, adjustments to gross revenue and all variable operational costs related to the transaction which produced the order divided by the gross revenue. In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to account for adjustments to gross revenue may include, but are not limited to, cancelled orders and\/or returned merchandise.","In some embodiments, variable operational costs may include, but are not limited to, fulfillment, customer service, freight out, credit card authorization fee, returns processing, telemarketing fees, royalty and\/or management fees.","In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to track the value of airing for a predetermined time period (e.g., x number of months, such as a minimum of 12 months but no maximum number of months). In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to discount the present value for the value of money of future net margin. In some embodiments, the initial investment may be equal to the net margin of the initial transaction.","In some embodiments, the discounted payback period may be the number of months it takes to reach the point where the future value of each subsequent month's (after initial transaction) gross profit is discounted until the cumulative monthly discounted gross profit exceeds or equals the initial gross profit.","In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to, in the DRTV touch point, calculate the long term value of an investment in a broadcast airing which represents marketing a specific product\/service through a specific offer by use of a specific creative commercial of specific length is calculated in terms of the following metrics: 1) the net present value of the current cash outlay plus the expected cash flow in the future per customer attributed to that airing; and 2) where the net present value is positive, the discounted payback period of the investment accounting for the time value of money whereby, in the case of the first metric, in the month following the original airing, the subsequent net margin (arising from subsequent purchases) from the customers attributed to that airing is accumulated for an extended period of time at which point it is discounted for the value of money to arrive at a present value of the gross profit which is combined with the initial net margin to yield the net present value of that airing which is then divided by the number of original customers attributed to that airing and, in the case of the second metric, the future value of each subsequent month's gross profit is discounted until the cumulative monthly discounted gross profit exceeds or equals the initial gross profit at which time the number of months taken to reach that point equals the discounted payback period.","In some embodiments, the broadcast airing level calculation may form the foundation for rollups that include, but not limited to, by network or station, daypart, day type, product, offer, creative, campaign and any combination of these. In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to receive media data for the broadcast airing that may refer to a unique identifier that combines three elements: network\/station, day and time.","In some embodiments, when any or all of the elements that define a broadcast airing are missing, those airings may be aggregated by a third party into one record per day or per week as in a Per Inquiry (PI) program in which case that PI record is treated as a Network and the analysis in claim  is performed on the investment in the PI program. In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to account for adjustments to gross revenue which may include, but are not limited to, cancelled orders and returned merchandise.","In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to account for variable operational costs which may include, but are not limited to, fulfillment, customer service, freight out, credit card authorization fee, returns processing, telemarketing fees, royalty and management fees.","In some embodiments, a subsequent net margin at particular time pint may be equal to gross revenue of each subsequent purchase multiplied by a profit margin percent for the product purchased less all remarketing costs including, but not limited to, email blasts, retargeting, direct mail. In some embodiments, the profit margin percent may be equal to the gross revenue less product cost, adjustments to gross revenue and\/or all variable operational costs related to the transaction which produced the order divided by the gross revenue.","In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to the subsequent purchases may sometimes not include purchases of another \u201cmain offer\u201d product featured in the same marketer's other creative in the case of a DRTV marketer that is selling multiple products through different creatives in the same time frame.","In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to account, in the Direct Mail touch point, a current real-time value of an investment in a targeted rented mailing list or space in a direct marketer's outgoing package used to deliver printed advertising material to prospective customers based on, but not limited by, the following metrics: 1) the net present value of the current cash outlay plus the expected cash flow in the future per customer attributed to that mailing list; and 2) where the net present value is positive, the discounted payback period of the investment accounting for the time value of money whereby, in the case of the first metric, the subsequent net margin (arising from subsequent purchases after the initial one) from the customers attributed to that mailing list is accumulated for an extended period of time at which point it is discounted for the value of money to arrive at a present value of the net margin which is combined with the initial net margin to yield the net present value of that mailing list which is then divided by the number of original customers attributed to that mailing list and, in the case of the second metric, the future value of each subsequent month's net margin is discounted until the cumulative monthly discounted net margin exceeds or equals the initial net margin at which time the number of months taken to reach that point equals the discounted payback period.","In some embodiments, printed advertising material may include, but is not limited to, catalogs of various dimensions and page count, postcards, tri-folds, bi-folds, direct mail coupons and package inserts which all but the last one are delivered to a consumer or business via postal mail while package inserts travel in merchandise package shipped by direct marketers.","In some embodiments, the discount rate or value of money may be defined as the cost of capital to the marketer or the required return rate of an investment for the marketer.","In some embodiments, the initial gross profit or acquisition cost may be defined as gross revenue less product cost, adjustments to gross revenue and all variable operational costs related to the transaction which produced the customer\/order.","In some embodiments, adjustments to gross revenue may include, but are not limited to, cancelled orders and returned merchandise.","In some embodiments, the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to continuously calculate the real-time net margin as being equal to gross revenue of each subsequent purchase multiplied by a profit margin percent for the product purchased less all remarketing costs including, but not limited to, email blasts, retargeting, direct mail.","In addition, by appending demographic, psychographic and geographic variables to the consumers that responded to the advertisements of multiple advertisers, a responder and buyer profile is built for each media source used based on actual buyers that responded to a specific form of advertisement while controlling for variables that include, but are not limited to, changes in source content such as programming and manmade or natural catastrophic events that may affect consumers' consumption of media.","In some embodiments, the present invention is directed to database driven computer systems providing real-time updatable graphical user interfaces to track real-time value of airings.

File\u201424 Hrs). In some embodiments, the exemplary media database contains MAR ID (media agency record identifier for a creative), Media ID, and Agency Data.","An Exemplary Call Center Database","In some embodiments, the inventive systems of the present invention combine and validated data for call center order records from a plurality of call centers, for example, via ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)-type processes on, for example, a periodical basis (e.g., Daily Transactional File\u201424 Hrs). In some embodiments, the call center data is processed in real time to update the master record-related databases (e.g., gross revenue database, net margin database).","An exemplary Web Database (Piwik, Ga., Omniture, etc)","In some embodiments, the inventive systems of the present invention combine and validated data for web order records from a plurality of web tracking sources, for example, via ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)-type processes on, for example, a periodical basis (e.g., Daily Transactional File\u201424 Hrs). In some embodiments, the web data is processed in real time through an attribution process that matches web records to active creatives' offers based on a field \u201cItem1SKU (Kit Code)\u201d to associate to provide Offer and Product values. For example, in some embodiments, Piwik Order Numbers match the Order Numbers found in Fulfillment Data Feed(s). In some embodiments, the web data is separated between advertised programs and parts\/accessories orders.","Fulfillment Data Feed","In some embodiments, fulfillment data feeds are matched to call center data, web data, media data, based on a plurality of fields such as Order ID, Offer ID, Name & Address, and Order Amount. In some embodiments, the fulfillment data is received with a time delay such as 3-5 business days behind the call center and\/or web data. In some embodiments, to match the Call Center Database Record to the Fulfillment Data Feed, the inventive systems of the present invention utilize the match logic that can be based on a plurality of the following fields:","Order Date","Zip (e.g., 5 Digits, 9 digits, 11 digits)","Last Name (e.g., first 5 letters)","Order Amount","Street Name (e.g., first 5 vharacters).","In some embodiments, once Call Center Data and fulfillment data are matched, the inventive systems of the instant invention automatically assign tags and create mater records in the tagging database.","In some embodiments, the inventive systems of the instant invention generate exception reports for errors and\/r unmatched records, which can be shown as revenue leakage.","Exemplary Tagging Process",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0499","num":"0510"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"For example, in some embodiments, the Tagging process generates an unique code for every transaction and use case based, at least in part, on Order ID and Order Dates.","In some embodiments, each Tag is associated with a \u201cdetail\u201d record and a \u201cMaster\u201d record.  shows an exemplary multi-part Tag utilized by the inventive systems of the present invention. For example, if an Order Number creates multiple transactions (i.e., original order transaction and subsequent transactions), the first Tag assigned to the first transaction is the Master. In some embodiments, the tagging module can create a second line record\/item (due to return, cancel, or multipay scenarios).","An Exemplary Gross Total Database","In some embodiments, the tagging module of the inventive computer systems of the present invention creates an real-time updatable Gross Total Line record for each Individual Tag Master record, which totals all line items for that Order to feed, in real-time, a Margin Module that calculates the net margin. In some embodiments, the Tagged Master records are then rolled up by Offer and Creative fields where all Individual creatives and offers are summarized and can feed exemplary real-time updatable look-up graphical items on a user graphical interface shown in , which are utilized to generate real-time values of airing(s) reports shown in  (e.g., total Orders, Gross $'s, Subtraction of Return $'s, Cancel $'s, etc.). In some embodiments, items with an asterisk in  accept more than one selection. In some embodiments, when there are more than one airing on a station\/day\/time within the selected broadcast weeks, the revenue and cost figures are summed across those airings and a net margin per airing is calculated at the end.  provides an exemplary real-time report when 1 Network, 1 Offer, 2x+ Airings.  provides an exemplary real-time report when 2x+ Networks, 1 Offer.  provides an exemplary real-time report when 1 Network, 2x+ Offers.  provides an exemplary real-time report when All Networks, 2x+ Offers.","Tables 1-6 illustrate various exemplary tagging scenarios that are utilized by the inventive systems of the present invention to tag matched records in accordance with some embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0505","num":"0516"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Case 1 -
