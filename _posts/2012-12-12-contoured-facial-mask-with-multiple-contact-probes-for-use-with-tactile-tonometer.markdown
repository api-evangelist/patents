The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for measuring the intraocular pressure, i.e. the fluid pressure within an eye. More particularly, the invention relates to improved systems and methods for measuring intraocular or fluid pressure within an eye.","As is well known in the art of ophthalmology, measuring the intraocular pressure (IOP) of the eye is an important indicator of the health of the eye. Elevated IOP has been associated with progressive damage of the optic nerve known as glaucoma, which, if left untreated, may lead to permanent loss of sight.","Various apparatus and techniques have thus been developed to measure IOP. Among the techniques are applanation tonometery, dynamic contour tonometry, transpalpebral diatom tonometry, non-contact tonometry, electronic indentation tonometry, rebound tonometry and digital palpation tonometry.","Applanation tonometry measures approximate intraocular pressure either by the force required to flatten a constant area of the cornea (e.g. Goldmann tonometry) or by the area flattened by a constant force.","In applanation tonometry, a special calibrated disinfected probe attached to a slit lamp biomicroscope is used to flatten the central cornea a fixed amount. Because the probe makes contact with the cornea, a topical anesthetic, such as oxybuprocaine, tetracaine, alcaine, proxymetacaine or proparacaine, is introduced onto the surface of the eye in the form of one or a few eye drops. A yellow fluorescein dye is often also used in conjunction with a cobalt blue filter to aid the examiner in determining the IOP.","Goldmann tonometry is considered to be the gold standard in tonometry, as it is the most widely accepted method of determining \u201capproximate\u201d intraocular pressure. However, as is well known in the art, Goldmann tonometry is an inherently imprecise measurement.","Dynamic contour tonometry (DCT) is a measuring technique that employs the) 5 principle of contour matching instead of applanation to eliminate the systematic errors inherent in previous tonometers. These factors include the influence of corneal thickness, rigidity, curvature and elastic properties. DCT is not influenced by mechanical changes, such as those seen in refractive surgery that would otherwise cause error in applanation tonometers.","An exemplar apparatus that employs DCT to measure IOP is the PASCAL Dynamic Contour Tonometer (Ziemer Ophthalmics). The PASCAL uses a miniature pressure sensor embedded within a tonometer tip that is contour-matched to the shape of the cornea. When the sensor is subjected to a change in pressure, the electrical resistance is altered and the PASCAL's computer calculates a change in pressure in accordance with the change in resistance.","The tonometer tip rests on the cornea with a constant appositional force of one gram. This is an important difference from all forms of applanation tonometry wherein the probe force is variable.","In transpalpebral diaton tonometry, a diaton tonometer is employed to measure intraocular pressure through the eyelid. It is typically regarded as a simple and safe method of ophthalmotonometry. Transpalpebral tonometry requires no contact with the cornea, therefore sterilization of the device and topical anesthetic drops are not required.","Non-contact tonometry or air-puff tonometry uses a rapid air pulse to applanate the cornea. Corneal applanation is detected via an electro-optical system. Intraocular pressure is estimated by detecting the force of the air jet at the instance of applanation.","Modern-day non-contact tonometers have been shown to correlate very well with Goldmann tonometry measurements and have thus generally been considered a fast and simple way to screen for high IOP. Further, since non-contact tonometry is accomplished without the instrument contacting the cornea the potential for disease transmission is reduced.","Electronic indentation tonometry employs a Tono-Pen, i.e. a portable electronic, digital pen-like instrument that determines IOP by making contact with the cornea. Electronic indentation tonometry is especially useful for very young children, patients unable to reach a slit lamp due to disability, patients who are uncooperative during applanation tonometry, or patients with cornea disease in whom contact tonometry cannot be accurately performed.","In palpation tonometry, also known as digital palpation tonometry, measuring intraocular pressure is performed by gently pressing the fingertips of both index fingers onto the upper part of the bulbus through the eyelid. This technique requires medical experience and results in an estimation of the level of intraocular pressure based on the skills of the ophthalmologist.","A major drawback associated with each of the noted techniques is that each technique requires professional assistance to measure IOP.","A further drawback associated with each of the noted techniques is the need for topical anesthesia and complex instrumentation to measure IOP, which makes multiple daily measurements impractical.","It would thus be desirable to provide improved systems and methods for measuring IOP that overcome the disadvantages and drawbacks associated with conventional systems and methods for measuring IOP.","As has been demonstrated by the inventor earlier in publications [1], [2], and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,959,570 B2 [3], using a multitude of force sensors, it is possible to infer the intraocular pressure of the eye by measuring the forces obtained from such sensors during gradual indentation of the eye with these probes.","It has further been shown in [2], that when the force probes are applied with differ indentation rates, the measured force is different, whereby for the same amount of indentation, higher forces are obtained under higher indentation rates.","It has further been demonstrated, that when the force probes applied to the eye are tilted or displaced laterally, the relative magnitude of the forces obtained from different probes changes and therefore interferes with the correct interpretation of the data and extraction of IOP [1-2].","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide systems and methods for measuring IOP using an apparatus that can conforms to the anatomy of the face and therefore can be performed by the patient without professional assistance and eliminate the errors associated with variable position of the indentation.","It is another object of the present invention to provide systems and methods for applying a repeatable force under controlled rate of increase.","It is another object of the present invention to provide systems and methods for interpretation of force data obtained from multiple probes that account for sensor misalignment.","In accordance with the above objects and those that will be mentioned and will become apparent below, the system for measuring IOP of an eye, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, generally comprises a device for aligning a tonometry system for eye pressure measurement of a patient, comprising a mask having a contour shape of the patient's face, said mask comprising at least one eye ball opening, said eye ball opening accommodating a plurality of contact probes moveable to contact a surface of the patient's eye ball. In one embodiment the mask has four contact probes per eye ball opening, preferably comprising three outer probes and one central probe. In such embodiment the three outer probes preferably are equally radially spaced from one another.

Flexing of the strips  is detected by the strain in strain gauges .","As previously reported by us in [1-2], the eye can be modeled as a vessel with visco-elastic walls filled by incompressible fluid. When the volume of the fluid is increased, the vessel walls stretch and exert compressive forces onto the fluid known as intraocular pressure. Conversely, the vessel walls are under tension T inducing the required stretch. When indented by the tactile probes, the shape of the vessel walls change, so that equilibrium is established between the tension in the deformed vessel walls and the force probes indenting it.","According to the present invention, the force analysis of during tactile tonometery is approximated via an abstract one-dimensional string model, where the tension in the string is proportional to the IOP, while its shape is modified by the action of the external force probes.

As illustrated in , when cap  is compressed by a distance H, the resulting spring force is F=KH. This force compresses the visco-elastic spacer , which is can be a donut-shaped open-cell polyurethane foam. Open cell-polyurethane foams can be described by a three-parameter Maxwell viscoelastic bodies [4]. A wide variety of visco-elastic foams, also known as shape-memory foams, are available on the market including Sorbothane, polynorbornene, Noene, Astro-sorb, and Neoprene.","By selecting a visco-elastic member with viscoelastic material constants K[units N\/m], K[units N\/m], and C [units N-s\/m], it can be shown that the mechanical model depicted in  will result in exponential time-response of the tonometer  () according to the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00008","num":"00008"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["K","S"]},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"H"},"msub":{"mi":"K","mn":"2"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":"K","mn":"1"},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"K","mn":"1"},{"mi":"K","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"exp","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mo":"-","msub":{"mi":"K","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":"K","mn":"2"}},{"msub":[{"mi":"CK","mn":"1"},{"mi":"K","mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u2062"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"t"}}}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"8"}}}]}}}}},"A sketch of the displacement y(t) is shown in .

Therefore, tactile tonometers will need a calibration against an independent measurement of the IOP. Since in practice the eye pressure of a human subject cannot be adjusted at will, it is advantageous to be able to calibrate the unit from a single known value of the IOP. The following example illustrates how data from several force probes can be used to determine the calibration coefficients of each from a single measurement.","As described in this invention, when forces from two probes are plotted against each other, the resulting curve exhibits a sharp change of slope at a point determined by Eq. (7).  shows Fverses Fand illustrates the location of this point labeled by Ffor pressure levels p=10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 mmHg.","When two force probe pairs are used (a total of 3 probes) with known but different distance ratios Z\/dand Z\/d, it is possible to obtain two calibration curves. For example, instead of carrying out an experiment at pressure 2p, one might use Z\/d=2Z\/d. According to Eqs. (3) and (7) the resulting force curve will be equivalent to one obtained from probe pare with ration Z\/dbut at pressure 2p. Therefore, using multiple probe pairs, one can obtain calibration curves similar as if the experiment was carried out at different pressures.","In order to obtain an absolute pressure reading, at least one pressure should be known. From it, the unknown subject-specific coefficient 2k can be obtained according to",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00011","num":"00011"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"k"},{"mfrac":[{"msubsup":{"mi":["F","c"],"mrow":{"mi":"E","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}},"mi":"p"},{"msub":[{"mi":"d","mn":"1"},{"mi":"Z","mn":"1"}]}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"10"}}}]}}}}},"Based on Eq. (10) evaluated at single pressure p, the subject-specific calibration factor 2k can be determined for subsequent use. Therefore this method allows calibration of the tactile tonometer using a single experiment that collects data from several force pairs. The true intraocular pressure for this experiment can be obtained from Goldmann applanation tonometer.","It is apparent that this application requires at least 3 force probes. An example of such arrangement is shown in  probes A-B offset from E at a given distance, and probes C-D offset from E at another distance.","Fabricating of contoured masks conforming to the facial anatomy of a subject can be accomplished by first scanning the face using commercial laser or optical 3D scanner.","A mask with embedded probes can then be printed using stereo-lithography (3D printing as illustrated in . Alternatively, a mask may be custom fitted to an individual using a plurality of built-in inflatable air bags shown in phantom at  in .","A pneumatically driven tactile mask is shown in .","As will readily be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art, the present invention provides numerous advantages over hand-held tactile tonometers and methods for measuring IOP. Among the advantages are the following:","The contoured facial mask and its components improves the repeatability of the measurements and reduces alignment errors.","The contoured facial mask and its components aids the user in self-administering IOP measurement.","The contoured facial mask and its components provides repeatable indentation and repeatable control of the rate of application of the indentation.","The contoured facial mask and its components eliminate the need for motorized more expensive indentation mechanisms.","The provision of IOP measuring systems and methods that utilize a miniaturized and integrated multi-force sensor based on integrated strain gauges.","The invention also demonstrates that the calibration of the tactile tonometer can be carried out using a single know pressure followed by the application of the tactile tonometer.","Without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention, one of ordinary skill can make various changes and modifications to the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions. By way of example, the force sensors or contact probes may be formed of ferromagnetic materials which will allow them to snap onto magnets embedded into the mask, thus making a quick-release version and permitting use of probes with different lengths which may be rotatable so that they interchange places.
