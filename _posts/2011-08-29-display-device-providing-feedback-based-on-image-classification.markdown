No. 13\/088,486, entitled: \u201cImage display device providing feedback messages,\u201d by Liao et al.; and to commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/220,032, entitled: \u201cDisplay device providing individualized feedback,\u201d by Liao et al., each of which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention pertains to the field of digital image display devices, and more particularly to digital image display devices that provide feedback for images provided over a network from a variety of sources.","A digital media frame (also called a digital photo frame, a digital picture frame or a digital image display device) is a device that electronically stores and displays digital images. As used herein, the term digital image includes both digital still images and digital video images. The digital images are typically captured using digital cameras (still or video), but may also be obtained using other types of digital image sources such as scanners. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,754,271 to Edwards, entitled \u201cLiquid Crystal Photograph,\u201d describes a device resembling a pocket calculator which stores still pictures in a digital memory cartridge, and displays the pictures on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. The device includes an auto-sequencing mode which automatically changes the displayed image after a user-selectable time period, such as 5 seconds, or 5 minutes.","Digital media frames can include a modem to receive digital images over a communications network from computers or other devices, as described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7,155,679 to Bandaru, et al., entitled \u201cDigital Media Frame,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference. Such a digital media frame is commonly known as a \u201cconnected frame\u201d. This patent further teaches that the connected digital media frame can include an information mode which displays news headlines, stock trading news, weather reports, and advertising received over the communications network.","Some digital media frames can receive digital images over a network from a \u201cshare group\u201d which includes a plurality of members, as described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,509,910 to Agarwal, et al., entitled \u201cMethod and system for interfacing with a digital media frame network,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference. This patent teaches that images provided by various sharing members can be downloaded from a network service and automatically displayed on digital media frames which communicate with the network service.","FrameChannel is an Internet service that can be used with a digital media frame having a modem which enables an Internet connection, such as a WiFi modem, that enables communication with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) via a wireless home router. A FrameChannel customer can use a home computer to access the FrameChannel website (www.framechannel.com) in order to customize the content that will be provided to their digital media frame. The customer can select from many different channels of custom content including news, traffic, weather, sports, and financial data. The customer can also use FrameChannel to receive photos from social networking or digital image sharing websites such as Facebook and Flickr, and to receive photos via E-mail and camera phone messages.","Users of digital images may assign metadata to particular images based on emotional or aesthetic judgments of the user, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,629,104 to Parulski et. al., entitled \u201cMethod for adding personalized metadata to a collection of digital images.\u201d This patent describes a software application for adding metadata to a collection of images by configuring and storing a database of pre-assigned metadata labels, displaying images and a menu for selecting the pre-assigned metadata labels, and storing user-selected metadata labels in association with the digital images. The aesthetic categories can include \u201cFavorite\u201d images, \u201cHumorous\u201d images, \u201cArtistic\u201d images, \u201cEmotional\u201d images, \u201cCute\u201d images, and \u201cImportant moment\u201d images. This metadata can be used to help organize the collection of images, and facilitate retrieval of particular images of interest (e.g., \u201cfunny\u201d images) at a later date.","The web service Facebook provides a way for individuals to share images either publicly or with friends. When viewing an image, a Facebook user is presented with a user interface allowing the association of a free form textual comment with a given image. The collection of user comments on a given image is available and visible as feedback to the owner of the image as well as other viewers. A Facebook user can select the \u201clike\u201d button, which includes a \u201cthumb up\u201d symbol, to indicate that they like particular images.","Digital media frames can receive images from a variety of individuals. In many cases, the person viewing the received images on the digital media frame would like to provide immediate feedback to the persons who provided the images. Thus, there remains a need for a user of a digital media frame to easily provide immediate feedback to the persons who shared images, and to later utilize this feedback to assist in organizing their image collection.","The present invention represents a digital image display device for displaying a collection of digital media assets, comprising:\n\n","This invention has the advantage that the user of the digital image display device can easily send feedback messages that are customized according to an asset classification to individuals who have provided digital media assets to the display device.","It has the additional advantage that the feedback messages can be selected from a set of classified feedback message choices.","It has the further advantage that the feedback classification associated with the selected feedback message can be stored and used as a selection criteria for selecting a subset of the digital media assets.","It is to be understood that the attached drawings are for purposes of illustrating the concepts of the invention and may not be to scale.","In the following description, some embodiments of the present invention will be described in terms that would ordinarily be implemented as a software program. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the equivalent of such software can also be constructed in hardware. Because image manipulation algorithms and systems are well known, the present description will be directed in particular to algorithms and systems forming part of, or cooperating more directly with, the system and method in accordance with the present invention. Other aspects of such algorithms and systems, and hardware or software for producing and otherwise processing the image signals involved therewith, not specifically shown or described herein, can be selected from such systems, algorithms, components and elements known in the art. Given the system as described according to the invention in the following materials, software not specifically shown, suggested or described herein that is useful for implementation of the invention is conventional and within the ordinary skill in such arts.","Still further, as used herein, a computer program for performing the method of the present invention can be stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium, which can include, for example; magnetic storage media such as a magnetic disk (e.g., a hard drive or a floppy disk) or magnetic tape; optical storage media such as an optical disc, optical tape, or machine readable bar code; solid state electronic storage devices such as random access memory (RAM), or read only memory (ROM); or any other physical device or medium employed to store a computer program having instructions for controlling one or more computers to practice the method according to the present invention.","The invention is inclusive of combinations of the embodiments described herein.

Elements not specifically shown or described herein are selected from those known in the art. Certain aspects of the embodiments to be described are provided in software. Given the system as shown and described according to the invention in the following materials, software not specifically shown, described or suggested herein that is useful for implementation of the invention is conventional and within the ordinary skill in such arts.","The following description of digital media frames will be familiar to one skilled in the art. It will be obvious that there are many variations of this embodiment that are possible and are selected to reduce the cost, add features or improve the performance of the digital media frame. The present invention is illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the accompanying figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["10","10","10","10","10","10","10","52","54","52"]},"The digital image display device  allows a user to display digital media assets with minimal user intervention. The digital media assets to be displayed typically include digital still images captured with a digital camera. The digital media assets to be displayed can also include video clips, graphic images, text, and animations. The digital media assets can also include audio information, such as music, speech, and sound effects.","Referring to , a central processor  in the digital image display device  provides the overall control of the digital image display device . The central processor  is coupled to a user input interfaces block , which enables a user of the digital image display device  to select operating modes and images to be displayed. The central processor  is also coupled to a media interface block , and a network interface block , which are used to provide digital media assets to the digital image display device . The central processor  is also coupled to a non-volatile storage block  via an interface, which provides a processor-accessible program memory that stores executable instructions that are used to control the operation of the central processor . Non-volatile storage block  can also serve as a processor-accessible image memory for storing a collection of digital media assets.","The central processor  is also coupled to a buffer memory block , which temporarily stores digital media assets for display on display screen . The central processor  is also coupled to a display compensation block , which processes the digital images and provides the compensated digital images to the display screen . The central processor  is also coupled to an audio codec block , which processes digital audio information and converts the digital audio information to one or more analog signals, which are provided to one or more speakers .","The user input interfaces block  can be provided using various conventional user input devices and circuits. For example, the user input interfaces block  can include a group of user buttons , such as those provided on the upper back of the digital image display device  in . These user buttons  can include, for example, a forward function button, a reverse function button, and a pause function button. The forward function button allows the user to initiate the display of the next image in a playlist, the reverse function button allows the user to initiate the display of the previous image in a playlist, and the pause function button allows the user to initiate the continued display of the current image, until a different function button is pressed by the user. The user buttons  can also include a \u201cmenu\u201d button, a \u201cselect\u201d button\u201d and a number of cursor movement buttons, such as \u201cup,\u201d \u201cdown,\u201d \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright,\u201d or some subset thereof. These can be used to select various operating modes.","In some embodiments, the user input interfaces block  includes a touch screen interface provided on the front surface of the display screen . In some embodiments, the touch screen interface can be implemented using IR emitters and detectors in front of, and parallel to, the display screen . A \u201ctouch\u201d is detected by determining which IR beams have been blocked by the viewer's finger. In some embodiments, this can be implemented using a relatively small number of emitters and detectors. For example, using 5 emitters spaced vertically and 8 detectors spaced horizontally, enables the detection of 5\u00d78 positions on the display screen. This is enough to allow touch buttons icons to be displayed on the display screen  and discern which button icon was touched by the viewer.","In some embodiments, the user input interfaces block  includes a touch sensitive input surface that can be positioned adjacent to the display screen . For example, the KODAK EASYSHARE P730 Digital Frame includes two \u201cQuick Touch Border\u201d capacitive touch strips, including a horizontally oriented touch strip adjacent the bottom of the display screen  and a vertically oriented touch strip adjacent the right side of the display screen . Menu items are displayed on the display screen  adjacent to these touch strips, and the viewer touches the strip at the appropriate location in order to select menu items. One advantage of the Quick Touch Border is that it keeps fingerprints off of the display screen .","In some embodiments, the user input interface can also include a pointing device such as a computer mouse, a joy stick, a track ball, or a track pad. In some embodiments, the user input interface can also include a remote control input device. The remote control can include user inputs which replicate some or all of the functions provided by the user buttons . In some embodiments, the user input interface can also include a voice recognition interface (including a microphone and speech recognition processor) or a gesture recognition interface that includes a sensing device (such as a camera) which recognizes user hand gestures or other user movements.","Non-volatile storage block  represents non-volatile storage memory, which may include, for example, flash EPROM memory. Non-volatile storage block  provides a processor-accessible program memory for storing executable instructions, such as firmware programs, for controlling the operation of the central processor .","In some embodiments, the firmware programs stored in non-volatile memory block  can be updated or replaced by new firmware provided using the media interface block  or the network interface block . In some embodiments, other types of non-volatile memory, such as Read Only Memory (ROM), magnetic disk storage or optical disc storage, can be used. In some embodiments, the central processor  includes an additional program memory (not shown), and the firmware programs stored in the non-volatile storage block  are copied into the program memory before being executed by the central processor .","The non-volatile storage block  can also be used to provide a processor-accessible image memory for storing a collection of digital media assets such as still images, video clips, sounds music, graphics, text, and other types of content which can be used to create the images displayed on the display screen  and the sounds output from speaker(s) . These sounds can include sounds captured by the digital still or video camera when the digital images were captured. These sounds can also include sounds (such as audio annotations) captured when the images were previously viewed, either by the user or another individual. These sounds can also include songs or music soundtracks that have been associated with the digital images. In some embodiments, at least some of the stored digital media assets are associated with particular events either automatically as a result of the image capture date, or as a result of manual selection by the user. The sounds can also include audio content associated with the particular events.","The non-volatile storage block  also stores auxiliary information (e.g. metadata) associated with the digital media assets. This metadata can include the date and time the image was captured by a digital capture device (e.g., a digital still camera or a digital video camera), or the date and time the image was received by the digital image display device . The metadata can also include data which identifies the individual or service that provided the digital media assets that was transferred to the digital image display device  using the system to be described later in reference to .","The metadata stored in non-volatile storage block  can also include feedback related metadata associated with the digital media assets, such as feedback classifications corresponding to user selected feedback messages. The metadata stored in non-volatile storage block  can also include playlists, such as playlists which are created using the feedback classification metadata associated with the digital media assets as selection criteria. These features will be described in more detail later in reference to .","Buffer memory block  is a relatively small memory (compared to non-volatile storage block ) which provides fast memory access for displaying images. The buffer memory block  can use, for example, one or more dynamic random access memory (\u201cDRAM\u201d) or static random access memory (\u201cSRAM\u201d) integrated circuits.","The media interface block  receives digital media files from various local external devices, such as removable media devices. For example, the media interface block  can include memory card and USB interface connectors  (), to enable the digital image display device  to display media files stored on various removable Flash memory cards, such as a Secure Digital (SD) card, a micro SD card, a Compact Flash (CF) card, a MultiMedia Card (MMC), an xD card or a Memory Stick, as well as USB memory \u201csticks\u201d or \u201cjump drives\u201d. The digital media assets stored on these memory devices can be provided by digital computers, digital still cameras, digital video cameras, camera phones, PDAs, print and film scanners, and other types of digital imaging devices. The central processor  controls the media interface block  in order to transfer media files from the local external devices. The transferred files can be stored in the non-volatile storage block , or can be stored directly in the buffer memory block  for immediate display on the display screen . Thus, the media interface block , in combination with the removable memory card or memory \u201cstick\u201d, provides a processor-accessible image memory for storing a collection of digital media assets, such as digital images.","The network interface block  can be used to enable other devices, such as computers or mobile imaging devices, to transfer digital media files to the digital image display device . The network interface block  can be provided using a wired interface, such as an Ethernet cable interface or a wired telephone modem. The network interface block  can also be provided using a wireless interface, such as a WiFi (e.g. IEEE 802.11 WiFi standard) modem, a cellular modem, or a Bluetooth modem.","In some embodiments, the network interface block  provides a direct connection to the Internet, and is configured to read HTML (\u201cHyperText Markup Language\u201d) and to use TCP\/IP (\u201cTransmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol\u201d). In other embodiments, the network interface block  provides a connection to a local area network, which can then provide an Internet connection using a wired or wireless router or other type of network interface device, which either interfaces directly to the Internet, or to an Internet Service Provider (ISP).","The display compensation block  is used to adjust the image data for the characteristics of the display screen . This can include tone scale adjustments, color adjustments, sharpness adjustments or any other type of appropriate adjustment. It should be noted that in some embodiments, the display compensation block  can be implemented by the central processor . In other embodiments, the display compensation block  and central processor  can be integrated into the same integrated circuit (\u201cIC\u201d).","The display screen  displays images using a soft-copy display device, such as a color active matrix LCD (\u201cLiquid Crystal Display\u201d). Other types of soft-copy display devices may be used, such as an OLED (\u201cOrganic Light Emitting Diode\u201d) display, a CRT (\u201cCathode Ray Tube\u201d), or various silicon-based displays.","A power supply  converts the AC power supplied via a wall plug to the proper DC voltages needed to provide power to all of the components of the digital image display device . In some embodiments, the power supply can include a re-chargeable battery, so that the digital image display device  can be portable, thus allowing it to be used for a period of time without a power cable, and outdoors. In some embodiments, the digital image display device  can include a solar panel which is used to charge the rechargeable battery.","In some embodiments, the digital image display device  includes a motion sensor (not shown). The motion sensor can provide a signal to the central processor , which controls the power supply  in order to supply power to the display screen  only when motion is detected. This reduces the power wasted when displaying images if there are no viewers in the vicinity of the digital image display device .","The central processor  runs two primary processes in order to display images and communicate with other system components, as will be described later in reference to  and . A real-time clock  in the central processor  provides a date\/time value. In some embodiments, the real-time clock  is manually configured by the user while in other embodiments, the real-time clock is configured using information accessed on an external device such as a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server using the network interface block .","It will be understood that the functions of the central processor  can be provided using a single programmable processor or by using multiple programmable processors, including one or more digital signal processor (DSP) devices. Alternatively, the central processor  can be provided by custom circuitry (e.g., by one or more custom integrated circuits (ICs) designed specifically for use in digital media frames), or by a combination of programmable processor(s) and custom circuits. It will be understood that connections between the central processor  and some of the blocks shown in  can be made using a common data bus. For example, in some embodiments the connection between the central processor , the non-volatile storage block , the buffer memory block , the media interface block , and the network interface block  can be made using a common data bus.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["10","10","10","102","104","106","10","110","110","120","120","122","124","110","130","140","120","150","150"]},"Each content providing system  can include an external content media server  which communicates with an external content host  in order to supply external digital image and metadata content . The external digital image and metadata content  can be stored on hard drives or other digital storage devices or media that can be accessed by the external content host .","In some embodiments, the content and configuration server  only provides a list of digital media assets together with appropriate information about each digital media asset. The digital image display device  can subsequently access digital media files directly from the content providing systems .","It will be understood that the various blocks shown in  can be implemented using different hardware configurations. For example, the routing server , action logging server  and authentication server  can execute on the same physical hardware, or on different hardware. Furthermore, each server, such as routing server , may execute on multiple pieces of hardware in order to execute operations in parallel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["20","200","20","22","32","34","40","44","10","10","10"]},"In read next digital media asset step , the central processor  reads the list and determines the next digital media asset to display from the list. The central processor  then reads the digital media asset from the non-volatile storage block  or the storage media connected to media interface block . In some embodiments, the central processor  can read the digital media asset from a remote storage site via the network interface block .","In decompress data step , the central processor  decompresses the image data associated with the digital media asset and stores the decompressed image data in the buffer memory block . If the digital media asset is a video file, such as an MPEG 2 or MPEG 4 video file, the central processor  performs real-time decompression of the compressed video file.","In resize image for display step , the central processor  scales the image for display, by resizing the image as necessary in order to match the image size (i.e., the display screen resolution) required by display screen . In some embodiments, the image size stored in buffer memory block  is slightly larger than the screen resolution, in order to allow for some panning\/zooming effects as the image is displayed.","In compensate image data for display step , the display compensation block  applies compensation to the image data before it is provided to the display screen . The compensation typically includes adjusting the image to account for the characteristics of the display screen  (e.g., an LCD panel). In some embodiments, the compensation may also adapt to the content of the specific image, for example, to provide image-specific enhancements.","In display image step , the central processor  displays the current image on the display screen . The central processor  can also display visual messages or user interface controls on the display screen , to indicate to the user of the digital image display device  various operating modes and options that can be selected by the user. In some embodiments, the central processor  provides these messages and controls using an on-screen graphics buffer, which can be stored in a portion of buffer memory block . The graphics information provided from this on-screen graphics buffer can be blended with the currently displayed image when the user activates one of the user interface elements of the user input interfaces block , such as a touch screen interface. In some embodiments, the text and icons are transparently overlaid on top of the currently displayed image.","In respond to user interface inputs step , if the user makes a selection using one of the user input elements, the central processor  takes one or more actions in response to the user selection. This can include, for example, changing the display time for images, deleting an image from the collection of digital media assets, selecting a feedback message for the displayed image, or selecting a playlist of digital media assets to be displayed.","In wait to display next digital media asset step , the central processor waits until the real-time clock  has advanced by a specified time interval between images, and then execution returns to the read next digital media asset step . The specified time interval can be a factory default time interval (e.g., 10 seconds per image) or can be a time interval selected by the user using appropriate user interface elements. The central processor  also controls the type of transition between images. The transition is a mechanism of \u201cretiring\u201d the current image while \u201cphasing in\u201d the next image. For example, one type of image transition moves the current and next images in one direction (e.g. left to right, or top to bottom) such that the current image moves out while the next image moves in. In another example, the image transition fades out the current image while fading in the next image on top of the current image. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many different types of transitions can also be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["20","34","34","10","102","104","106","110"]},"At startup, an identify server(s) step  is performed, during which the digital image display device  interfaces via network interface block  over the Internet to the routing server  at a known server location, in order to identify itself and determine how to proceed. The routing server  returns information to the digital image display device  that indicates which server(s) the digital image display device  should communicate with for all subsequent functions. The only address that is not allowed to change is the path to this routing server .","In obtain security code token step , the digital image display device  uses a secure communication method (e.g. https:\/\/) to query the authentication server  for a security code to communicate with the rest of the system. This query involves transmission of private information that is known by both the digital image display device  and the authentication server . The authentication server  generates a temporary security token and returns the token to the digital image display device . The token is made available to other parts of the server (and other servers) to allow authentication of the particular digital image display device  for future operations.","When the time window for the authentication token expires, any operations from the digital image display device  to one of the servers (other than the authentication server ) will be rejected. In this situation, the digital image display device  then communicates with the authentication server  in order to acquire a new authentication token, before continuing with other operations. The use of a temporary token for most of the communications between the digital image display device  and each of the servers has the advantage of minimizing exposure to the private information shared between the digital image display device  and the authentication server  and the advantage of minimizing the computation required for subsequent communications by reducing the need for secure communications with a temporary token.","In obtain and store new content step , the digital image display device  communicates with the content and configuration server  in order to retrieve any new content that may be available. The digital image and metadata content provided by the content and configuration server  is organized into groups of pictures that are grouped by some combination of the source of the content (e.g., E-mail, Facebook or Kodak Gallery), a unique identifier of the sender of that content (e.g., the E-mail address of the sender who provided the content), and the date and time that the particular content was shared (or the instance of sharing). In some embodiments, a direct network upload sharing method can be used to provide content directly to the digital image display device . The direct upload sharing method can make use of various interfaces such as the well-known FTP or REST interfaces.","The digital image and metadata content provided by the content and configuration server  may also be organized by other information related to each particular content such as the location where the particular content was captured, keywords associated with the particular content, names or identity of people captured in the particular content, or things captured in the particular content. The digital image and metadata content provided by the content and configuration server  may also be organized using the feedback classifications corresponding to selected feedback messages, as will be described later in reference to .","The digital image and metadata content is obtained through a separate interface to content and configuration server , and is stored using an appropriate non-volatile storage (not shown) available to the content and configuration server . The content and configuration server  sends a description of the new content to be stored on the digital image display device . The central processor  in the digital image display device  then individually retrieves each of the digital media assets defined by the content and configuration server  and stores each digital media asset in the non-volatile storage block  in the digital image display device . The digital image display device  also transfers metadata related to each digital media asset, such as the sharing method (e.g., E-mail, Facebook or Kodak Gallery), an identifier for the individual providing the digital media asset, an identifier of the sharing instance, and any descriptive text available related to the digital media asset. In some embodiments, the digital media assets are only downloaded from the content and configuration server  at the time when they are to be displayed on the digital image display device , and are not stored locally in the non-volatile storage block  in the digital image display device . In some embodiments, the digital media assets are stored in non-volatile storage block  using a cache mechanism and the digital media assets are retrieved from the non-volatile storage block  if the digital media asset is stored in the non-volatile storage block  and has not been updated on the content and configuration server , and further, if the digital media asset is not stored in the non-volatile storage block  the central processor  retrieves the digital media asset from the content and configuration server  and stores the asset into the cache mechanism stored on the non-volatile storage block . The details of the data cache mechanism will be familiar to one knowledgeable in the arts.","The user can add content to the digital image display device  by using a web browser upload sharing method via the web pages user interface block  to upload digital images and other digital media assets to the web page server . The web page server  then stores these digital media assets and appropriate metadata.","In obtain configuration information step , the digital image display device  communicates with the content and configuration server  in order to retrieve configuration information. The configuration information includes settings such as the type of slideshow transition, the time interval for displaying each slideshow image, and the time of day to automatically turn the digital image display device  on and off.","In some embodiments, factory default configuration information is stored on the content and configuration server  automatically when a digital image display device  is registered.

Likewise the feedback icons A-D used for family members and more conservative than the feedback icons A-D used for friends.","It will be understood that in some embodiments, not all feedback messages (feedback icons or feedback text) provided in the feedback message set will be different for the different message sets. For example, both the friend feedback message set  and the family feedback message set  use the same feedback text D and D for the memorable feedback classification D.","In some embodiments, a user interface can be supplied to allow the user to assign the feedback messages (e.g., the feedback icons and the feedback text) that are associated with the feedback classifications for a particular feedback message set. A set of different feedback icon choices and feedback message choices can be provided that the user can choose from using the user interface. Alternately, the user can be enabled to type in their own custom feedback message or load their own custom feedback icons. In some embodiments, the user interface can be supplied to allow the user to define their own feedback message sets and to define the individuals or asset classifications that should be associated with those sets. For example, a user may desire to define several different variations of \u201cfriend\u201d feedback message sets, one for \u201ccollege friends\u201d and one for \u201cneighborhood friends\u201d to reflect the fact that these groups may use different slang terminologies. In some embodiments, sets of classified feedback message choices can also be defined for sets of individuals sharing a common interest such as a hobby, a job or a club. In some embodiments, feedback messages may only be defined for a subset of the available feedback message choices for a particular feedback message set. For example, it might not make sense to define a \u201cfunny\u201d feedback message for a \u201csunset\u201d asset classification.","Similarly,  depicts two sets of classified feedback message sets for two different asset classifications that can be used in accordance with the method of . A birthday party feedback message set  is provided for use with digital media assets having a \u201cbirthday party\u201d asset classification, and a nature scene feedback message set  is provided for use with digital media assets having a \u201cnature scene\u201d asset classification. The example classified feedback message sets use the same feedback classifications A-D that were used for the feedback message sets of . The classified feedback message sets define feedback icons A-D and A-D and feedback text A-D and A-D for each of the feedback classification A-D. The feedback messages are customized to be relevant to the asset classification.","It will be understood that the methods for providing classified feedback can be provided using systems other that the one depicted in . For example, a personal computer connected to the Internet can be used to obtain digital media assets and metadata from a variety of individuals that are provided, for example, by E-mail server  or content providing systems  such as Facebook. The personal computer can display a digital media asset and provide a particular set of classified feedback choices from a plurality of different sets of classified feedback message choices. The personal computer can then receive input from the user, via any user interface included as part of the personal computer, so that the user can select a particular one of the set of classified feedback message choices. The personal computer can then use its network connection to provide an indication of the selected feedback message to the individual who provided the digital media asset, or to an account associated with the individual who provided the digital media asset.","In the foregoing detailed description, the method and apparatus of the present invention have been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the present invention. The present specification and figures are accordingly to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive.","A computer program product can include one or more storage medium, for example; magnetic storage media such as magnetic disk (such as a floppy disk) or magnetic tape; optical storage media such as optical disk, optical tape, or machine readable bar code; solid-state electronic storage devices such as random access memory (RAM), or read-only memory (ROM); or any other physical device or media employed to store a computer program having instructions for controlling one or more computers to practice the method according to the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0001","num":"0144"},"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0002","num":"0145"},"b":"20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0003","num":"0146"},"b":"21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0004","num":"0147"},"b":"22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0005","num":"0148"},"b":"24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0006","num":"0149"},"b":"30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0007","num":"0150"},"b":"31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0008","num":"0151"},"b":"32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0009","num":"0152"},"b":"33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0010","num":"0153"},"b":"34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0011","num":"0154"},"b":"40"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0012","num":"0155"},"b":"42"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0013","num":"0156"},"b":"44"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0014","num":"0157"},"b":"46"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0015","num":"0158"},"b":"50"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0016","num":"0159"},"b":"52"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0017","num":"0160"},"b":"54"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0018","num":"0161"},"b":"80"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0019","num":"0162"},"b":"82"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0020","num":"0163"},"b":"84"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0021","num":"0164"},"b":"86"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0022","num":"0165"},"b":"92"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0023","num":"0166"},"b":"92"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0024","num":"0167"},"b":"92"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0025","num":"0168"},"b":"92"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0026","num":"0169"},"b":"92"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0027","num":"0170"},"b":"92"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0028","num":"0171"},"b":"94"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0029","num":"0172"},"b":"94"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0030","num":"0173"},"b":"94"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0031","num":"0174"},"b":"96"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0032","num":"0175"},"b":"96"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0033","num":"0176"},"b":"96"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0034","num":"0177"},"b":"102"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0035","num":"0178"},"b":"104"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0036","num":"0179"},"b":"106"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0037","num":"0180"},"b":"110"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0038","num":"0181"},"b":"120"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0039","num":"0182"},"b":"122"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0040","num":"0183"},"b":"124"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0041","num":"0184"},"b":"130"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0042","num":"0185"},"b":"140"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0043","num":"0186"},"b":"150"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0044","num":"0187"},"b":"152"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0045","num":"0188"},"b":"154"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0046","num":"0189"},"b":"156"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0047","num":"0190"},"b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0048","num":"0191"},"b":"205"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0049","num":"0192"},"b":"210"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0050","num":"0193"},"b":"215"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0051","num":"0194"},"b":"220"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0052","num":"0195"},"b":"225"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0053","num":"0196"},"b":"230"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0054","num":"0197"},"b":"235"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0055","num":"0198"},"b":"250"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0056","num":"0199"},"b":"255"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0057","num":"0200"},"b":"260"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0058","num":"0201"},"b":"265"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0059","num":"0202"},"b":"300"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0060","num":"0203"},"b":"305"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0061","num":"0204"},"b":"315"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0062","num":"0205"},"b":"320"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0063","num":"0206"},"b":"325"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0064","num":"0207"},"b":"330"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0065","num":"0208"},"b":"335"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0066","num":"0209"},"b":"400"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0067","num":"0210"},"b":"410"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0068","num":"0211"},"b":"410"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0069","num":"0212"},"b":"410"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0070","num":"0213"},"b":"410"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0071","num":"0214"},"b":"420"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0072","num":"0215"},"b":"420"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0073","num":"0216"},"b":"420"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0074","num":"0217"},"b":"420"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0075","num":"0218"},"b":"430"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0076","num":"0219"},"b":"430"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0077","num":"0220"},"b":"430"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0078","num":"0221"},"b":"430"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0079","num":"0222"},"b":"450"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0080","num":"0223"},"b":"460"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0081","num":"0224"},"b":"460"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0082","num":"0225"},"b":"4
