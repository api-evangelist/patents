title: Methods and systems for operating a remote computer application from a thin client
abstract: Methods and systems are provided for overcoming negative tradeoffs associated with providing remote access to a computer application, such as lack of control over functions of the computer application. Such tradeoffs are overcome by controlling the functions of the computer application provided to a thin client. The functions are controlled by an executable that displays a modified image of a session of the computer application. Specifically, the executable hides particular elements of the session and the limited image is then the image that is provided to a client, as opposed to the client accessing the full functionality of the computer application via remote computing.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/400,155, filed Jul. 23, 2010. The contents of that application are hereby incorporated by reference.","The invention relates to remote access of a computer application from a thin client. Specifically, the invention relates to using remote access functionality to develop new applications without having to recreate the components and functions of robust remote applications and to using such functionality to modify and control existing remote applications provided to end users.","The advent of client-server based networking combined with the need for organizations to cut costs in IT support has encouraged adoption of remote desktop software. Remote desktop software facilitates a remote server or a cluster of servers to store and execute a computer application that users can access via a thin client that is connected to the remote server or the cluster through a computer network. Such a practice facilitates end users to access a fully functional computer application remotely and it also facilitates administration of the computer application from the server or the cluster as opposed to administration from each client computer. Another benefit includes clients having various operating systems that are able to interface the computer application without concern for compatibility issues. Compatibility with various operating systems is not a concern because the user of the thin client interacts with a copy of an image of a session of the computer application as opposed to interacting directly with the computer application.","From its name, it may be assumed that remote desktop software only facilitates remote interaction with a desktop session hosted on a remote computer; however, it has become popular to configure remote desktop software to facilitate interaction with a single computer application. For example, a user through a client computer could interact with a copy of an image of a MICROSOFT WORD\u2122 or a MICROSOFT EXCEL\u2122 session that is hosted on a remote computer.","As mentioned above, remote desktop software allows for interacting with the full functionality of a remote computer application, but it does not additionally allow for developing a new application using specific components and functions of the remote computer application nor does it allow modifying and controlling the use of the remote computer application in a granular manner. To address these limitations, systems and methods are described herein that allow end users to use specific components and functions of a remote computer application to develop their own applications, where the remote application acts as a virtual library at the developers' disposal. Additionally, the methods and systems described herein allow for overcoming a well know tradeoff associated with remote desktop computing, which is having less control over functionality provided by a remote application session and the content entered into files interacting with the remote application.","The invention facilitates using remote applications and their components and functions as application programming interfaces and libraries for developing new applications. The methods and systems of the invention particularly lend themselves to the development of applications compatible with thin clients. By providing such functionality, developers can take advantage of the components and functions provided by a wide array of computer applications, such as MICROSOFT WORD\u2122 and MICROSOFT EXCEL\u2122, when developing their own applications. Additionally, the methods and systems overcome the above-mentioned tradeoffs of remote desktop computing which is a lack of control over the functionality of a function-rich computer application and the files interacting with such an application.","The methods and systems of the invention provide the aforementioned functionality by employing a combination of interacting technologies that facilitate interacting with the function-rich application, making the function-rich application provided to an end-user via a client computer behave more like a lightweight client side application. This allows for the end user to interact with the remote application independently or as a part of a greater application where a number of the components or functions of the greater application are derived from the remote application.","Such functionality is provided by controlling selected aspects of the computer application provided to a thin client. The aspects are controlled by an executable that displays a modified image of the session of the computer application. Specifically, the executable hides particular elements of the session. This limited image is then the image that is provided to an end-user as opposed to the end-user accessing the full functionality of the computer application via remote computing.","In an embodiment of the invention, remote desktop software, a web application server that hosts a web application, and the executable (e.g. a.out, COFF, COM, ELF, Mach-O, MZ, NE, OMF, PE (exe), PEF, etc.) facilitate the limited application session provided to the end-user. The web application provides a user interface to the thin client, where the user interface includes two user interface components. The first user interface component outputs a copy of the image of the computer application session, where the computer application session may be a session of a word processor, a database management system, a presentation program, a spreadsheet program, an email and personal information management system, or the like, or any combination thereof. The second user interface component outputs a tool (e.g. toolbar, menu, items of a toolbar or menu, etc.) for interacting with the first user interface component. The executable facilitates restricting or hiding particular elements of the image of the application session so that the particular elements do not appear in the copy of the image. By hiding the elements, the thin client does not have access to all the functions of a function-rich application through the copy of the image. However, a number of the hidden functions are found in the second user interface component. From the second user interface, functions that interact with the computer application can be controlled to a greater extent than if accessed directly through the copy of the image. As a result, developers can take advantage of the components and functions provided by a wide array of computer applications, such as MICROSOFT WORD\u2122 and MICROSOFT EXCEL\u2122, when developing their own applications and the tradeoffs associated with providing remote access to a computer application session is lessened.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 and 3","FIGS. 2 and 3"],"b":["201","202","203","220","204","204","205","206","207","208","218","218","209","207","201","210","211","222","225","210","221","216","206","211","222","222","206","222","201","207","222"],"i":["a ","b"]},"Preferably, the client user interface  of the thin client  is provided through a web browser  that displays a web page . In such a case, it is preferred that the first user interface component  is an embedded element, such as an element embedded in an inline frame (e.g. iframe) . Whether the thin client  is provided through a web browser or not, the second user interface  provides additional user interaction capabilities with the session of the computer application , the file , or any combination thereof. The possible tool or tools  of the second user interface  include functions that are rendered and controlled by the web application , the executable , or a combination thereof.","When the processor  performs the computer-executable instructions stored in the memory , the aforementioned elements of the computer system are able to communicate with each other through at least five communication pathways. The remote desktop software and facilitates such pathways. It is preferred that the communications between the elements occur via virtual channels.","The communication pathways are enabled by at least five connections , , , , and . The connection may include, for example, remote control software in I-frames that talk to a Citrix or terminal server application with an application that talks to the API of MICROSOFT WORD\u2122 and MICROSOFT EXCEL\u2122 to control it and pass the keys back again. In the illustrated embodiment, the first connection  provides a bidirectional communication pathway for the executable  and the computer application . Preferably, a binary-interface standard for software components (e.g. Common Object Model otherwise known as COM) facilitates the communication between the executable  and the computer application . COM or any standard similar to COM possibly facilitates any of the other interactions between components of the system as well. The second connection  provides a communication pathway for the executable  and the web application  to communicate bidirectionally. It is preferred for a set of communication and application protocols and services that provide support for a packet-switched network, such as web services, enterprise services, etc., facilitate the communication between the executable , the computer application , the web application , and other systems and servers including enterprise application servers, web application servers, digital asset management systems, database management systems, and the like. The third connection  provides a communication pathway for the computer application  and a file , such as a document, where the file  includes a user interface  and the file  is in a format compatible with the computer application . Using the pathway of the third connection , the operating system  provides control and management for the computer application  to read data from and write data to the file . The fourth connection  provides a communication pathway for the first user interface component  and the executable , where the fourth connection  is facilitated by remote desktop software and . Besides facilitating the fourth connection , the remote desktop software and possibly facilitates any connection between elements of the methods and systems. The fifth connection  provides a communication pathway for the second user interface component  and the web application  via the executable , where the fifth connection  is facilitated by Internet Protocol technologies. Additionally, the operating system  further facilitates bidirectional communications within the fourth and fifth connections  and  and possibly other connections of the system.","In an embodiment of the invention, a cross-platform and language-independent standard for representing and interacting with objects in a document (e.g. Document Object Model otherwise known as \u201cDOM\u201d) facilitates communication between the first user interface component  and the file  via the executable . DOM also facilitates interactions between the computer application , computer applications of external computer systems, and documents compatible with such applications. Additionally, DOM facilitates the indirect communications between the second user interface component  and the file  where the file  is a document, spreadsheet, or other type of file compatible with DOM.","In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, upon performance of an operating system, a computer application, a web application, and an executable, a process as shown in  ensues. The process as illustrated in  facilitates limiting user interactions with the computer application to interactions solely through a first user interface component and a second user interface component, which controls functionality of a computer application provided to end-users and content entered into files interacting with the computer application. The process begins with a processor executing the operating system, the computer program, the web application, the remote desktop software, and the executable at . As a result, the web application generates a client user interface having the two user interface components at . The five above-mentioned connections that facilitate communication amongst the components of the system are enabled at steps , , , , and . Alternatively, the connections are enabled independently prior or post the aforementioned execution of the components. With the above-mentioned elements interacting through the five connections, a user is only allowed to use the computer application to the extent permitted by the first and second user interface components, instead of directly interfacing with the computer application remotely.","In an embodiment of the invention, the computer systems depicted by  are enabled by the computer system depicted in . The computer system illustrated in  includes at least one computer  with the facility to run the computer programs of the computer systems depicted in , including the operating system  and the computer application programs . The computer  also includes a processor  in communication with a computer readable storage medium, where the computer readable storage medium is any medium that that stores information for retrieval later by the processor . Computer readable storage medium includes, for example, memory  and data storage units . The memory  is possibly a fast-access memory and is used to run program instructions executable by the processor . The memory  is possibly random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), and\/or flash memory. The data storage units  are possibly physical devices and are used to store any data and instructions which may be accessed by the processor , such as program data  and instructions for computer applications  and operating system . The data storage units  and their associated computer readable storage media provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for the computer . The data storage units  are possibly an optical medium, a magnetic medium such as a floppy disk, a compact disc (CD), a digital video disk (DVD), and\/or a solid-state medium such as RAM, ROM, and flash memory.","The operating system  provides management and allocation of processes and components of the computer system and computer applications , where a computer application is defined as any computer program that assists a user to perform a task or multiple related tasks. The computer applications  preferably include an executable, a web server that hosts a web application, remote desktop software, a word processor, a database management system, a presentation program, a spreadsheet program, an email and personal information management system, and\/or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, the computer applications possibly include a version of MICROSOFT WORD\u2122, MICROSOFT EXCEL\u2122, or MICROSOFT POWERPOINT\u2122. The executable is a file that causes a computer system to perform tasks as opposed to a file that solely carries data. For the purposes of this disclosure, the executable is a program that specifically provides for control over other computer applications. The web application is hosted on a web application server, which is communicated over a computer network and accessed through a web browser. As mentioned above, remote desktop software typically facilitates graphical computer applications to run remotely on a server, while being displayed locally on a client computer. The remote desktop software also facilitates remote use of computer applications that are not necessarily graphical, where the remote use may not necessarily be implemented by a computer (i.e. the thin client is not necessarily a computer). For example, the thin client is possibly a tactile input\/output module (e.g. a module based on Braille), a speaker, a microphone, a joystick, the like, or any combination thereof.","The computer  operates in a networked environment using logical connections to other computers and communication devices via a network . The computer , other computers, and communication devices are possibly a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device, or other common network nodes. When used in a LAN or WLAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to other computers and communication devices via the LAN or WLAN through a network interface . Preferably, the network interface  includes a network interface controller (e.g. NIC, wireless network interface controller or card otherwise known as WNIC, etc.). The computer  further includes a radio  or another type of communications device for wirelessly transmitting and receiving data from other electronic devices.","To interact and communicate with the computer  remotely or locally, the computer  includes input\/output devices . The input devices  provide input to the processor , the memory , the radio , the storage units , the network interface , and other electrical components of the computer . The output devices  provide output of the electrical components of the computer  to other electrical components of the computer , other electrical components of other electrical devices, or a user of the computer  or other electrical devices. Output of information to users is provided in a visual manner, an auditory manner, a tactile manner, any other perceivable manner, or any combination thereof. For example, a display device and speakers typically provide audio and video output to a user. A bus  and other circuitry assist in connecting the input\/output devices  and other electrical components of the computer  to each other.","The electrical components of the computer system and other electronic devices, including the bus  and other circuitry, are made up of computer hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. The communications amongst such electrical components occur in the form of signals including electronic signals, electromagnetic signals, optical signals, or any combination thereof. The signals are transported through channels, where the channels may be wired, wireless, virtual (virtual channels), the like, or any combination thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["530","531","532","533","534","534","535","543","534","534","531","532","536","536"],"i":["a ","b","a ","b "]},"The toolbar  is rendered by a web application typically hosted by a web server.
