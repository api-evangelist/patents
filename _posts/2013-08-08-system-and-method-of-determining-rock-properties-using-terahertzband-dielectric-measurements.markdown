{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Measurements of the dielectric constants of materials at different frequencies are used in many different measurement schemes. For example, capacitance measurements at low frequencies are used to distinguish between oil and water. In the oil and gas sectors, for example, dielectric scanners may measure these constants at frequencies up to 1-2 GHz to determine water volume and rock properties. In addition, Fourier transform infrared (\u201cFTIR\u201d) measurements in the infrared region may be used to determine mineralogy of core samples.","Other measurements demanding sample preparation, such as those utilizing helium pycnometry are unable to provide accurate results in the case of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs that possess low permeability. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based measurements of pore volume may be used, but are often limited by the small pores in unconventional samples that cause fast relaxation times in the NMR signal that are difficult to accurately measure. Commercial measurements today are generally based on utilizing crushed samples but these techniques both add uncertainty due to the crushing process and also are destructive measurements may demand extensive sample preparation.","Other techniques for identifying the mineralogy of core samples include diffuse reflective infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). However, due to similarity of FTIR spectrum of smectite and illite samples, DRIFTS is unable to accurately distinguish between these notable constituents of shale beds. Similar issues in accurately determining the concentrations of illite and smectite have been observed in measurements taken with X-ray diffraction (XRD).","Illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a method for determining rock properties using terahertz band dielectric measurements. The method includes obtaining an unknown sample and obtaining an electromagnetic spectrum of the unknown sample using terahertz spectroscopy. An unknown sample complex permittivity is computed from the electromagnetic spectrum of the unknown sample. The method further includes estimating the constituents and constituent fractions and computing an estimated effective complex permittivity based upon a model and the constituent fractions. The method further includes comparing the computed unknown sample complex permittivity with the estimated effective complex permittivity in order to determine the physical properties the unknown sample.","Also, various embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a system for determining rock properties using terahertz band dielectric measurements. The system includes a THz spectrometer that may obtain a THz spectrum of an unknown sample. The system also includes an analysis module that receives an electromagnetic spectrum of the unknown sample. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the electromagnetic spectrum includes a terahertz spectrum and the analysis module may compute an unknown sample complex permittivity from the electromagnetic spectrum of the unknown sample. The analysis module may further estimate constituents and constituent fractions of the unknown sample. The analysis module may further compute an estimated effective complex permittivity based upon a model and the constituent fractions and compare the computed unknown sample complex permittivity with the estimated effective complex permittivity in order to determine the physical properties the unknown sample.","Illustrative embodiments are directed to a system of determining rock properties using terahertz band dielectric measurements that includes a non-transitory computer readable medium. The computer readable medium includes computer readable program code embodied therein, that, when executed on a processor, causes the processor to receive an electromagnetic spectrum of an unknown sample and compute an unknown sample complex permittivity from the electromagnetic spectrum of the unknown sample, estimate constituents and constituent fractions of the unknown sample, compute an estimated effective complex permittivity based upon a model and the constituent fractions, and compare the computed unknown sample complex permittivity with the estimated effective complex permittivity in order to determine the physical properties the unknown sample.","Other aspects of the disclosure will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims.","Dielectric constant measurements can provide information such as specific resonances of constituent minerals and molecules, and thus such measurements are ideal for identifying detailed sample composition. Furthermore, trends in the collective behavior of the measured dielectric constant as a function of frequency may reveal information that can distinguish between distinct classes of materials such as oil versus water or sandstone versus clays.","In general, in accordance with one or more embodiments, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for the determination of rock properties using terahertz-band dielectric measurements. Different materials, e.g., rocks, minerals, fluids, etc., have substantially different dielectric properties in the terahertz (THz) frequency range (approximately 0.08 THz-10 THz). These differing responses depend, in part, on the composition and structure of the material. Thus, by measuring the dielectric constant of an unknown rock sample as a function of THz frequency, and then inverting an effective medium theory, or dielectric mixing law, the volume fractions of the constituents of an unknown sample may be determined. For example, in the case of an unknown sample, e.g., a core sample, obtained from a location that includes an unconventional oil and gas reservoir, the relative fraction of various clays may be of great importance. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the present disclosure is directed to a system and method that can determine the fraction of illite and smectite in an unconventional sample using terahertz-band dielectric measurements. In addition, in accordance with one or more embodiments, the present disclosure is directed to a system and method for determining the volume fraction of crude oil, natural gas, water, and\/or rock matrix in an unknown sample using terahertz-band dielectric measurements. In addition, the systems and methods described herein may be used to determine the porosity and water saturation in a low permeability, unconventional core sample. In various embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein allow for the investigation of unknown rock samples in situ, meaning that, in one or more embodiments, the measurements do not involve replacing the component fluids in the sample with different components and, thus the disclosed systems and methods may be used to determine the properties of an untreated or unmodified rock sample, i.e., as it occurs in the field, including but not limited to, the identification of unmodified low permeability rock that is often present in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["103","105","103","105","107","109","115","111","105","105","105"],"i":["a","b "]},"In accordance with one or more embodiments, the THz spectrometer system  is configured to obtain a terahertz time domain spectrum (\u201cTHz-TDS spectrum\u201d) of a rock sample obtained from the field, e.g., by way of a downhole coring tool or from cuttings retrieved during drilling. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the analysis module  is configured to receive a THz-TDS spectrum and to determine one or more properties of the rock sample based on the THz-TDS spectrum. More precisely, the analysis module  includes a dielectric permittivity estimation engine  that determines the complex permittivity of the sample based on the THz-TDS spectrum. Once the complex permittivity of the sample is determined by the dielectric permittivity estimation engine , a sample modeling engine  constructs a model complex permittivity based on the measured complex permittivity. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the model complex permittivity may be based on one or more external input parameters related to known physical properties of the sample that are input by a user.","The model complex permittivity may be formed from combining one or more rock constituents by way of an effective medium theory and\/or a dielectric mixing law. More precisely, the model may be formed by combining two or more rock types and\/or fluid types (including both oil and gas) having previously known or measured complex permitivities that are stored in the data repository , which itself may include a dielectric constant database and a rock matrix database . In one or more embodiments, the data repository  is any type of storage unit and\/or device (e.g., a file system, database, collection of tables, or any other storage mechanism) for storing data. Further, the data repository  may include multiple different storage units and\/or devices. The multiple different storage units and\/or devices may, or may not, be of the same type or located at the same physical site. Furthermore, in accordance with one or more embodiments, the data repository  includes functionality to store one or more previously measured frequency dependent complex permitivities for various materials such as fluids, minerals, and rock matrix types. For example, as shown in , the data repository  may include a dielectric constant database and a rock matrix database that store the previously measured frequency dependent complex permitivities. In addition to being accessed from the data repository , the identity and\/or physical properties of one or more of the constituents in the model may be input directly by a user if already known e.g., through the use of previous measurements. The use of previously known constituents may serve to increase the speed and accuracy of the computational procedure used to determine the model complex permittivity based on the measured complex permittivity.","Once an initial model is constructed using data from the data repository  and\/or user input, an error estimation engine  computes the error between the model complex permittivity and the measured complex permittivity. In accordance with one or more embodiments, if the computed error is above a predetermined threshold, the volume fractions of the constituents that make up the model are adjusted and an updated model is computed by the sample modeling engine . The error determination engine  then recomputes the error between the updated model and the measured complex permittivity. This iterative process of 1) update model and 2) compute error, proceeds until the computed error drops below the predetermined threshold at which time, the error determination engine  outputs the model parameters, including the constituent identities and volume fractions of the model. In accordance with other embodiments, the iterative process may proceed until the model constituent values, e.g., the volume fractions, converge to stable values. Thus, the volume fractions that lead to an accurate estimate of the volume fractions and constituents that make up the sample are determined numerically by way of the analysis module .","While  shows a configuration of components, other configurations may be used without departing from the scope of the embodiments disclosed herein. For example, various components may be combined to create a single component. As another example, the functionality performed by a single component may be performed by two or more components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["103","201","201","202","203","205","203","205","203","207","211","208","205","209","205","213"]},"In accordance with one or more embodiments, the emitter  includes two gold strip-lines (not shown), separated by 10 \u03bcm to 1 mm, that are patterned on a gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate. The femtosecond pulses from the oscillator  are tightly focused in the center of the strip-lines while a bias voltage is applied across the strip-lines. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the bias voltage is used to accelerate photo-induced free carriers to generate a resulting current that generates a THz pulse and may be approximately of 50 V-1 kV. The detector  is configured to receive the THz pulse after it has passed through the sample . In this example, another parabolic mirror  is used to direct the pulse onto the detector . The detector  operates on inverse principles and includes a dipole antenna of length 5 to 100 \u03bcm. In one such embodiment, instead of biasing the antenna externally, the THz pulse's electric field generates a current that is measured and is proportional to the electric field at the specific temporal delay. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the detector is patterned on a custom grown substrate of erbium arsenide (ErAs) nanoisland superlattices embedded in gallium arsenide (GaAs). Furthermore, in accordance with one or more embodiments, the design of the superlattices may be optimized to have a minimum carrier lifetime. After passing through the sample , the femtosecond pulses are tightly focused in the gap of the dipole antenna of detector . In accordance with one or more embodiments, a lock-in amplifier (not shown) measures the current generated in the dipole antenna gap of the detector  due to the incoming THz pulse. Furthermore, in one or more embodiments, several high resistivity silicon hyper-hemispheres (not shown) are pressed to the back of the substrates of emitter  and detector  in order to efficiently couple the THz radiation into and out from the emitter and detector antennas, respectively.

Furthermore, one or more embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to the THz-TDS systems used as examples herein. For example, the THz spectra may be obtained using any type of THz spectrometer including, e.g., continuous wave (CW) microwave-based systems, or the like. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the THz-TDS spectra are used to estimate the complex index of refraction of the sample \u00f1(\u03c9)=n(\u03c9)\u2212i\u03ba(\u03c9), where n(\u03c9) is the frequency dependent (real) refractive index of the unknown sample, \u03ba(\u03c9) is the frequency dependent extinction coefficient of the unknown sample, and \u03c9=2\u03c0f, where f is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation interacting with the material. Furthermore, the frequency dependent extinction coefficient \u03ba(\u03c9) can be written in terms of a frequency dependent absorption coefficient: \u03b1(\u03c9)=2\u03c9\u03ba(\u03c9)\/c.  shows the magnitude  and phase  of the transfer function of the unknown sample obtained by dividing the Fourier transform of the sample scan by the Fourier transform of the reference scan. As is described in more detail below, the real part of the transfer function is related to \u03ba(\u03c9) of the sample, while the imaginary part of the transfer function is related to n(\u03c9) of the sample.  shows the index of refraction , i.e., n(\u03c9) and absorption coefficient , i.e., \u03b1(\u03c9) as computed from the transfer function as described in more detail below.","Furthermore, in accordance with one or more embodiments, \u00f1(\u03c9) (as plotted in ) may be determined numerically from a measured THz-TDS spectrum by constructing a numerical model of the measured THz-TDS spectrum based upon an estimated complex index of refraction and then optimizing the estimated complex index of refraction by minimizing the error between the estimated and measured complex indices of refraction. In other words, the optimal estimated complex index of refraction is found to be the estimated complex index of refraction that produces a model THz-TDS spectrum that most closely matches the measured spectrum. Any known method may be used to determine the estimated complex index of refraction from the measured sample and one example of such a procedure is described in detail below. Once the estimated complex index of refraction is obtained, the complex permittivity may be determined using known relationships between the real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity \u2208\u2032 and \u2208\u2033, respectively, and the index of refraction n and absorption coefficient \u03b1:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"=","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"msqrt":{"mrow":{"msup":[{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mi":["\u025b","\u2032"]}},"mn":"2"},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mi":["\u025b","\u2033"]}},"mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"+","msup":{"mi":["\u025b","\u2032"]}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["\u03c0","f"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mi":"c"},"mo":"\u2062","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"msqrt":{"mrow":{"msup":[{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mi":["\u025b","\u2032"]}},"mn":"2"},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mi":["\u025b","\u2033"]}},"mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"-","msup":{"mi":["\u025b","\u2032"]}}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}]}}},"br":{}},"Once the complex permittivity is determined, the volume fractions of the sample constituents may be determined using an effective medium theory and\/or dielectric mixing law, as described in more detail below. More specifically, a dielectric mixing law may be used to combine a set of reference measurements thereby forming a model frequency dependent complex permittivity that is then compared to the complex permittivity determined from the THz spectrum measurements. For example, the reference measurements may be stored in memory, e.g., in a database such as dielectric constant database and\/or rock matrix database or may be both stored in a single database. Examples of reference measurements are shown in . The final estimate for the volume fractions of the combination of reference materials is the combination of reference measurements that yields the lowest error match to the measured complex permittivity. The type of the constituents within the sample is an example of a physical property of the sample. Also, the final estimate of the constituent volume fractions is another example of a physical property of the sample. Furthermore, from the final estimates of the volume fractions, other physical properties of the sample may be determined, e.g., the porosity and water saturation may be determined. As used herein, porosity \u03c6 is defined as \u03c6=V\/Vwhere Vis the void volume in the sample and Vis the total volume of the sample. Porosity is thus given by an estimate of the volume fraction of the rock matrix, f. Water saturation, S, is defined as S=V\/Vwhere Vis the volume of water in the sample. Water saturation is thus given by S=f\/(1\u2212f) where fis an estimate of the volume fraction of water in the sample.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, the complex index of refraction of the unknown sample may be determined from the THz-TDS spectrum as described below.

(3) may be written in the frequency domain as\n\n(\u03c9)=(\u03c9)\u00b7(\u03c9)\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nThus, in a manner that corresponds to the response function h(t), the transfer function H(\u03c9) depends on the material parameters of the sample.
