title: Handling of data transfer in a LAN-free environment
abstract: There is disclosed a method, system and computer readable medium for transferring data in a LAN-free environment, in particular for a tape backup or restore operation. Data of a client partition of a first server is sent to a partition of a LAN-free server through the Local Area Network (LAN). The data sent is then converted from TCP/IP protocol to Fiber Channel protocol. The converted data is sent to a Storage Area Network (SAN) through a Fiber Channel card and finally to a tape library. An advantage is thus to mutualize and virtualize resources, in particular Fiber Channel cards. Storage Area Network tape drives are shared using such host bus adapter cards. Certain embodiments avoid the reconfiguration of Storage Area Network tape drives when the client partition moves to a new hardware.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/969,329 is a non-provisional application that claims priority benefits under Title 35, United States Code, Section 119(a)-(d) from European (EP) Patent Application entitled \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR HANDLING DATA TRANSFER IN A LAN-FREE ENVIRONMENT\u201d by Alain Lentini and Jarl Theuwissen, having Patent Application No. EP09306262.8, filed on Dec. 18, 2009, which EP Patent Application is also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","1. Field","The disclosure relates to data processing, and more particularly to the handling of data transfer in a LAN-free environment.","2. Background","Backup and restore operations pose various issues. In particular, backup on storage tape drives pose specific issues. For example, a same number of backup cards and of partitions may be required. Some existing approaches to solve these issues use particular communications systems between servers of the architecture, other approaches mutualize resources, and still other approaches leverage virtualization mechanisms.","US Patent application 20080091896 entitled \u201cStorage system and data management method\u201d for example discloses a storage system and a data management method which can reduce the load on a virtualization apparatus by executing backup processing or restoration processing within one apparatus in which an externally connected storage apparatus and a tape library apparatus are installed. The storage system includes a virtualization apparatus and an external storage apparatus, wherein the virtualization apparatus comprises an actual volume for storing data sent from a host apparatus, formed in a storage area provided by a physical disk. The virtualization apparatus further comprises a virtual volume paired with the actual volume, for storing replicated data for the data. The external storage apparatus comprises a logical volume that functions as an actual storage area for the virtual volume and a tape associated with the logical volume, for storing the replicated data, wherein the external storage apparatus has a copy unit for copying the replicated data stored in the logical volume to the tape. Whereas this approach leverages a virtualization mechanism, it still presents drawbacks.","During backup and restore operations, the use of the Local Area Network (LAN) may also be highly solicited, leading to a negative impact on the network traffic for existing and active users. For this reason, \u201cLAN-free\u201d backups are increasingly operated. A LAN-free backup is a backup of the data of a server to a shared central storage device without sending the data over the local area network (LAN).","There is a need for a system and method of efficiently managing backup or restore operations and in particular efficient handling of data transfer in a LAN-free environment.","In order to address these and other problems, embodiments for handling LAN-free data transfer are provided.","Certain embodiments relate to the usage of tape drives by virtual environments, and more particularly to the efficient connection of a tape drive from a storage area network to a logical partition by using a Virtual LAN provided by a virtual environment.","Certain embodiments provide for the sharing Storage Area Network tape drives using host bus adapter cards with several logical partitions.","Certain embodiments avoid the reconfiguration of Storage Area Network tape drives in the Operating System when the logical partition moves to a new hardware.","An advantage of certain embodiments relate to the sharing of Fibre Channel (FC) technology in the context of LAN-free backup.","An additional advantage of certain embodiments is thus to share resources between several servers.","Yet another advantage is to virtualize a Fibre Channel card between several servers.","Further advantages of certain embodiments will become clear to the skilled person upon examination of the drawings and detailed description. It is intended that any additional advantages be incorporated therein.","To facilitate description, any numeral identifying an element in one figure will represent the same element in any other figure.","The following text presents embodiments in the context of LAN-free backup or restore but it is to be understood that it is not limited to this specific backup or restore context. In particular, the figures and the description discuss a preferred embodiment with the use of IBM pSeries\u00ae servers. Further embodiments of the invention are not restricted to these proprietary environments or products, which are provided for exemplary purposes only. IBM pSeries\u00ae is a registered trademark of IBM Corporation","A LAN-free backup is a backup of data from a server to a shared and central storage device. The goal of a LAN-free backup is to reduce the load on LAN and reduce the time required to complete the backup.","Therefore, such a LAN-free backup process often uses a Storage Area Network (SAN). This type of backup offers an alternative way to backup data: this is no more a simple data copy to network-attached storage (NAS) over LAN. There may exist a central backup server arbitrating access to devices (for all the other SAN servers), which does not however handle data stream itself. Without such a backup server, the storage facility (usually a virtual tape library, or VTL) is adapted to handle multiple data accesses without intermediate components.","Fibre Channel (FC), is a gigabit-speed network technology primarily used for storage networking. FC ensures the connection between a computing device and the associated storage device. Fibre Channel is standardized: the ANSI working group X3T11 defines the Fibre Channel specifications. It has become the standard connection type for Storage Area Networks (SAN) in enterprise storage. Fibre Channel signaling can run on both twisted pair copper wire and fibre-optic cables. The Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) is a transport protocol which predominantly transports SCSI commands over Fibre Channel networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","101","102","103","120","120","121","122","140","160","130","131","140","141","160","180","181","184","187","189","190","192"]},"In a typical design of a virtualized architecture, the physical server (IBM pSeries\u00ae for example) hosts several partitions  with operating systems used for production applications. These operating systems share the same physical resources owned by a specific partition. In  this specific partition is named VIO server . In this architecture, the shared resources are used for LAN and SAN data communication. Virtualized structures to the interface between client partitions and the physical interfaces hosted by the VIO partition  are required.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["131","187","100","130"]},"Certain embodiments of the invention provide a similar virtualization, but specifically for SAN tape sharing between client partitions . The virtualization consists in sharing fibre channel hardware cards  connected to the SAN which is connected to the tape library. The advantage is thus to use few fibre channel hardware cards and share them instead of installing one or more fibre channel hardware cards on each client partition.","In , the LAN-free server partition can be any of the client partition of the IBM pSeries\u00ae server.","In operation, in a first step data is transferred from the client partition  to the LAN-free server partition  that owns the fibre channel cards and shares them with all client partitions. In certain embodiments, this step is operated using a virtual Ethernet LAN  provided by the IBM pSeries\u00ae server  for example. A virtual LAN, commonly known as a vLAN, has the same attributes as a physical LAN, but defines a logical grouping of networking devices. Network reconfiguration can be operated through software (instead of physically relocating devices). Alternatively to a vLAN, it may be a physical LAN but according to an embodiment, there is a sharing of hardware material instead of assignments of such material to particular tasks.","A second step is the conversion of data coming from virtual LAN  to send it to the SAN fibre channel cards  to go then to the tape library . This conversion is done by a tool currently named \u201cAPI LAN-SAN\u201d . In IBM environments, this API is named \u201cLAN-free storage agent\u201d. The API LAN-SAN enables the conversion from TCP (in the TCP\/IP stack) into the FC protocol acting as a \u201cgateway\u201d. When data are received by the tape library , they are written on a set of tapes managed by the tape library. This mechanism can be initiated by a backup of the data owned by one of the client partitions  or by a restore of the data of one of client partitions . In case of a data backup, pieces of data come from the client partition  toward the tape library , and in case of a data restore, pieces of data come from the tape library  toward one of the client partitions .","A backup or a restore of the client data is initiated and managed by one of the backup server . To manage this backup or restore operation, the backup server communicates with the client partition. It uses therefore a physical LAN network . As the LAN hardware cards are virtualized on the IBM pSeries\u00ae server models , they are hosted by the VIO partition which shares them between available client partitions  via a virtual LAN  provided by the IBM pSeries\u00ae server . A virtual structure, the virtual Ethernet server adapter  is used to generate the interface between physical and virtual LAN. During backup or restore operations, the backup server exchanges backup protocol information with the client partition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","220","230","240","250","261","262","263","270","271"]},"In case of live partition mobility (LPM), any client partition  can move online from its IBM pSeries\u00ae  to the other IBM pSeries\u00ae  dynamically.
