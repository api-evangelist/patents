The furnace is used to provide oxygen to closed spaces. The oxygen candle furnace may be used in different applications such as in submarines, airplanes, spacecrafts, and survival chambers in mines.","As shown in , the oxygen candle furnace  includes a hollow metallic drum or container . Although  shows the drum  being cylindrical, the drum may be any desired shape, so long as it accommodates all its internal elements. The drum  defines a furnace area therewith.  also shows a lid  that covers and seals the drum . The lid  may be removably attached to the drum . Therefore, latching mechanisms around the circumference of the upper edge of the drum  and around the circumference of the lid  allow for securing the lid  to the drum . These latching mechanisms also allow for the removal of the lid  from the drum . The removal of the lid  allows for access to components on at the bottom surface of the lid, and also for easy access to components within the drum . In another embodiment, the lid  may be hinged to the drum .","The oxygen candle furnace  also includes an ignition assembly , which as shown is attached to the lid  and extends through an opening in the lid . The opening in the lid , through which the ignition assembly  extends, may be located at a substantially central part of the lid.  also shows an oxygen candle  within the drum. It should be noted that the candle  is only schematically illustrated. Oxygen candles  may typically be a chlorate candle or the like. The candles  may be about 11\u215c in to 11\u215d in high and have a diameter of about 6\u215b in. Within the drum , oxygen candles  may be vertically stacked on top of each other. As shown by the dotted line and as will be outlined below, the candle  is vertically aligned with the ignition assembly .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["300","300","301","300","320","330","340","350","301","360","350","365","360","320"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"],"b":["301","301","303","305","370","303","305","370","350","370","350","350","350","350","303","350","370","370","370","305","350","305","350","301","350","305","303"],"sub":["U ","L","L ","U","U ","L ","U ","L ","L ","L "]},"It should be noted that according to another embodiment of the invention, the diameters Dand Dmay be the same. According to this embodiment the borehole  is constant along the length of housing . The difference in diameters allows the nail  to have a substantially exact fit in the upper and lower portions of the borehole . This substantially exact fit prevents lateral movement in the X direction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["303","372","372","370","380","372","375","372","380","375","372","375","380","375","380","380","375","380","372"]},"As shown, the ball plunger assembly  includes a round-nose plunger  that is biased in direction X towards the borehole .  also shows a biasing member , such as a spring, pushing the round-nose plunger towards the borehole .  shows the round-nose plunger  disposed within the borehole .

However because of the spring biasing, the round-nose plunger  maintains contact and pushes against the nail , thereby preventing the nail from moving in the Y direction, without user intervention.","The lower portion  of the housing includes a threaded outer surface , which as outlined below, and illustrated in , is used to secure the housing to the lid . It should be noted that the elements of the housing member  may be any desired material that provides the strength and the heat resistance suitable for use in the oxygen candle furnace.

During operation, the oxygen candle material sprays, and the baffle  is included to receive the hot material, significantly reducing the temperature of the lid, preventing injury and degradation of the lid. The fastening arrangement also includes the nut  which is fastened around the threaded outer surface  of the lower portion . The second washer  is sandwiched between the nut  and the baffle .

A user may use the nail holder  to move the igniter nail  down in the Y direction into contact with the oxygen candle , wherein chemicals on the head end  of the nail react to ignite the candle . As outlined with respect to , and as shown in , the igniter nail  is vertically aligned with the candle , so the downward Y-direction movement automatically brings the nail head into contact with the candle. Additionally, as outlined above, because of the respective diameters Dand d of the upper borehole  and the nail , there is also no lateral movement of the nail  in the X direction.","After the candle is lit, the user may move the nail  upwards in the Y direction until the head end  abuts against the nut , covering the borehole , thereby sealing the furnace . Thus, the combination of the narrow borehole  having diameters (D, D) outlined above, and the proximity of the nail head  with respect to the borehole , and also the adhesion of reaction products to the nail head, all contribute to sealing the furnace, preventing almost all the smoke from escaping the furnace. Furthermore, even if the plunger fails during oxygen generation, the small borehole diameters (D, D) substantially prevent the escape of combustion products. Again, when the user releases the nail holder, the round-nose plunger  pushes against the nail , thereby preventing the nail from moving in the Y direction.","What has been described and illustrated herein are preferred embodiments of the invention along with some variations.
