title: Fast method to search for linear frequency-modulated signals
abstract: A computer implemented method for determining frequency and slope of a linear frequency modulated signal. Windowed signal data is collected and used for formulating a search surface function which can be calculated recursively. The function is divided into parts. Part values are calculated at an underspecified number of points corresponding to the number of parts. The search surface function part values are interpolated at values between frequency values. An interpolation geometry is chosen and then the function part values are interpolated at values between frequency values and slopes. Function parts are added together giving a restored search surface function. The frequency and slope values can be searched to find the values that maximize the search surface function. Other embodiments result in faster execution.

No. 5,249,150, which is said to disclose a circuit and method for iteratively estimating Fourier coefficients of one or more Fourier components of a measuring signal that utilizes a filter to determine the Fourier coefficients for sampling time k\u22121. The coefficients are utilized to obtain an estimate of the measuring signal at sampling time k. A subtractor circuit subtracts an actual sample of the measuring signal at sampling time k from the estimate of the measuring signal at sampling time k to obtain a difference signal. The difference signal is inputted back into the filter to determine an estimate of the Fourier coefficients at sampling time k.","Known in the prior art is Fukuda et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,960,373, which is said to disclose a frequency analyzing method for analyzing frequency components of an original signal. The method has: a spectrum detecting step of detecting, from the original signal, energy levels of components of a predetermined number of orthogonal function waves which have waveforms each having same start position and end position in a predetermined time window and in which the number of occurrences of periods in the predetermined time window or frequencies are different from each other; and an orthogonal function wave changing step of changing at least one of the start position and the end position within the predetermined time window after completion of the spectrum detecting step, wherein the spectrum detecting step and the orthogonal function wave changing step are alternately repeated. According to Fukuda, it is possible to provide frequency analyzing method and apparatus which can contribute to estimate each correct fundamental frequency from a complex distorted wave signal such as a musical signal or the like by a relatively simple construction and to provide complex sound separating method and apparatus using the frequency analyzing method or apparatus.","Also known in the prior art is Scheppach, U.S. Pat. No. 6,484,112, which is said to disclose a method for estimating the frequency of a time signal by means of a discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) and interpolation between support points of the DFT spectrum. According to the method, the Hamming window is used in a known manner for filtering and the interpolation is carried out according to the mathematically calculated solution. The method makes use of the fact that a function of the third degree which can serve as a correction distance has a clear solution within the definition range of the amount ratio between a secondary maximum and a primary maximum of the DFT spectrum. The correction distance is calculated according to this solution on the basis of the ratio of the secondary maximum and the primary maximum.","Also known in the prior art is Nelson, U.S. Pat. No. 6,577,968, which is said to disclose a method of estimating the frequency of a signal by first receiving a signal, forming a row vector, segmenting the row vector; converting the row vector to a first matrix, multiplying the first matrix by a weight, and performing a Fourier transform on the result of the last step. These same steps are repeated on a delayed version of the signal. The next steps are calculating a complex conjugate for each result of the last step, forming a cross-spectrum matrix, selecting a magnitude in the cross-spectrum matrix that is above a threshold; and setting an angular frequency of the signal to either the phase of the selected magnitude, the phase of the mean of the complex numbers in the row in which appears the selected magnitude, or the selected magnitude. The frequency of the signal is then set to the estimated angular frequency divided by the product of 2\u03c0 and the signal delay period. Additional rows are processed if need be.","Also known in the prior art is Hillerstrom, U.S. Pat. No. 6,598,005, which is said to disclose a method for measuring a frequency f=\u03c9\/2\u03c0 of a sinusoidal signal V(t)=A sin(\u03c9t+\u03b1) with an essentially constant amplitude A. Measured values are registered in the form of the instantaneous level of the signal V(t), V(t\u2212h) and V(t\u22122 h) at three points of time separated by a predetermined measuring period h, which corresponds to a measurement frequency f=1\/h. Then the measured values are applied to a calculating device, which recursively estimates the quantity y(t) given by: y(t)=y(t\u2212h)+\u03b7e(t)s(V(t\u2212h)), where e(t)=[V(t)+V(T\u22122 h)]\/2\u2212y(t\u2212h) and \u03b7s(V(t\u2212h))V(t\u2212h)\u22670. The choice of \u03b7 and s(.) controls the convergence speed of y(t)\u2192cos(\u03c9h) and the noise sensitivity of the measurement system. Finally the frequency is calculated or looked up in a table based on the expression f(t)=(f\/2\u03c0)arc cos y(t).","Also known in the prior art is Michel, U.S. Pat. No. 7,076,380, which is said to disclose a method for analyzing the frequency in real-time of a non-stationary signal and corresponding analysis circuit. According to the invention, the signal is sampled, digitized, and broken up into sub-bands. In each sub-band, the signal is modeled by an auto-regressive filter the transfer function of which is of the form 1\/A(z). By an adaptive method that is recursive in time and in order, all the polynomials A(z) that have a degree between 1 and a maximum value are calculated. The order of the model is estimated and the polynomial that has this order is retained. The roots of this polynomial are calculated and the components are monitored. The frequency and the amplitude of the sinusoidal components of the signal are thus obtained. Applications include aeronautics, electromagnetic, mechanics, seismic prospecting, zoology, and others.","Also known in the prior art is Shim et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,103,491, which is said to disclose a method of estimating parameters of time series data using a Fourier transform. The parameter estimation method can directly estimate modes and parameters, indicating the characteristics of a dynamic system, on the basis of the Fourier transform of the time series data. The method is advantageous in that it can estimate parameters of the system through a single Fourier transform without repeatedly calculating a Fourier transform, thus shortening the time required to estimate the parameters.","Also known in the prior art is Rao, U.S. Pat. No. 7,124,042, which is said to disclose a system and method for estimating parameters of multiple tones in an input signal. The method includes receiving samples of the input signal, generating a frequency transform (FT) of the samples, identifying multiple amplitude peaks in the FT corresponding to the tones, and determining parameter estimates characterizing each of the multiple tones based on the peaks. For each tone, the effects of the other tones are removed from the FT of the peak of the tone using the parameter estimates of the other tones to generate modified FT data for the tone. Single tone estimation is applied to the modified FT data to generating refined parameter estimates of the tone, which is used to update the parameter estimates of the tone. After refining the estimates for each tone, the entire process may be repeated one or more times using successive refined estimates to generate final estimates for the parameters.","A literature search revealed a number of algorithms related to this problem that include the following. There are algorithms that attain fast performance by searching only over 1-dimensional space of \u03b3 (see J. Cao, N. Zhang, and L. Song, \u201cA fast algorithm for the chirp rate estimation,\u201d in 4(2008), pp. 45-48, January 2008; P. M. Djuric and S. M.

Wang, \u201cFast estimation method and performance analysis of frequency modulation rate via rat,\u201d in 2008 (), (Zhangjiajie, China), pp. 144-147, June 2008). These algorithms confuse signals with different starting frequency and similar slope and typically require a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to work properly.","There are algorithms that integrate in the time-frequency transform (TF) plane (see S. Barbarossa, \u201cAnalysis of multicomponent lfm signals by a combined wigner-hough transform,\u201d , vol. 43, pp. 1511-1515, June 1995; S. Krishnan and R.

Wood and D. Barry, \u201cRadon transformation of time-frequency distributions for analysis of multicomponent signals,\u201d , vol. 42, pp. 3166-3177, November 1994). The computation of the TF distribution adds significant processing load.
