The present method of such repair is cutting around the damage and removing the resulting plug from the panel. Then one prepares a matching plug of undamaged material, e.g., of honeycomb core and inserting same into the aperture vacated by the damaged plug. This means that one has to estimate the thickness of such core, insert same and sand it flush with the panel surfaces.","Such prior art method is laborious and abrades the plug and panel surface(s) until the repair is flush.","Accordingly, there is need and market for a method of panel repair that overcomes the above prior art shortcomings.","There has now been discovered a method of panel repair that is less laborious and minimizes or reduces scratching and\/or abrasion to the panel surface(s) in obtaining a flush insert panel repair.","Broadly, the present invention provides a method for repairing a hole or indent in a surface comprising\n\n","The invention also provides a tool for flush cutting a projection from a surface comprising a saw having a saw blade mounted across a frame, the blade being mounted at an angle to the plane of such frame so as to cut in a direction parallel to the surface and at an angle to such frame.","Definitions:","By \u201cflush cut\u201d as used herein, is meant cutting a plug or insert, nearly level with the surrounding surface of a panel, so it can be readily sanded down to full flushness with such surface.","By \u201caperture\u201d as used herein, is meant an indent, a recess or a through hole in a surface, panel or other structure.","Referring now in detail to the drawings, panel  has a damaged portion  which has been cut out of such panel, leaving a recess or aperture  for which a replacement plug  has been cut of a size to fill the aperture  and yet project above the surface (or skin)  of the panel , which plug  is inserted into the aperture  as shown in .","Again the plug  is of a greater thickness or height than the aperture  and thus projects above the surface  of the panel , as clearly shown in FIG. .","At this point the bow saw of the invention  has blade  with cutting edge  mounted across the frame , at an angle with the plane thereof, so as to cut the plug  in a direction about parallel with and proximate to the surface  of the panel , all as shown in FIG. .","The resulting flush cut of such plug , in the panel , is shown in .","Referring further to , it should be noted that when an aluminum panel is dented or damaged, only the upper skin may be in need of repair, with the bottom skin of the panel  being relatively undamaged. In such case, it is desirable to employ a tool such as a router, with a pre-set depth of penetration, to rout (preferable through a template aperture) out the damaged portion of the panel without damaging such bottom skin as indicated in FIG. . The so drilled-out recess or aperture  is then measured, e.g., by placing a tape thereacross and then cutting around the circumference or periphery of the aperture , to obtain a disc as template which can be adhered atop a reserve aluminum panel (of greater thickness than the one being repaired). Then a plug is cut from such reserve panel by scribing a cutting tool around the edges of such template disc and through such panel, which plug is then coated with adhesive on bottom and sides thereof and inserted into the aperture  and pressed or tapped down into contact or near contract with the bottom skin and dried under heat and vacuum (to collapse bubbles in the adhesive) and flush cut, as indicated in  hereof. Then a patch or disc of fiberglass or metal, e.g., Al, can be adhered in place over the plug to seal same as desired.","Again the resulting repair is shown in  where plug  is inserted and flush cut in the panel  with minimal or no damage to the lower skin , as shown in FIG. .","Now, if the hole is through the panel and both skins, the core and skins are routed out and the skin below is patched with an overlapping adhesive-coated disc. Then a plug is cut, coated with adhesive, inserted through the aperture in the upper skin and the repair processed as before.","The tool:","That the bow saw  has its blade  mounted at an angle with the plane of its frame , so as to cut parallel with and proximate to the surface  of the panel  and thus flush cut the plug , is shown in , to augment the view thereof shown in FIG. .","The bow saw  has its frame  mounted to pedestal  and has handle  which terminates in pedestal , also mounted to the frame which pedestals rest on smooth pads , as shown in .","Views of the frame  (of such saw) are shown in , , and .","Views of the cutting blade  are shown in , , , and .","The bottom surface of the blade  is secured at its ends  and , in a recess slightly above downwardly projecting polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon\u00ae) pads , as shown or indicated in , , , and  so as to elevate such blade slightly above the surface  of panel  by a distance \u2018d\u2019, per  hereof. The so mounted blade permits the bow saw  of the invention to glide across the surface  of the panel , while sawing through the plug , with minimal or no scratching or abrading of such surface, as indicated in the above drawings.","As indicated in , the blade  of the invention preferably has a single cutting edge  but can have a second cutting edge, where a double-edged blade is desired per the invention.","Also pads  of pedestals  and  of the cutting tool  are advantageously beveled or curved in one or more directions, to slide over surfaces rougher than aluminum skin such as sheetrock, wood and the like, to flush cut projections therefrom.","Thus the cutting tool of the present invention has at least 3 main innovations. The first is situating the saw blade parallel to the skin's surface, allowing a flush cut of the honeycomb material. This allows a flush cut for aircraft repairs, with little or no scratching of the panel skin, making for a high quality repair. The second innovation is that the bottom of the two pedestals of the tool have a smooth coating or glide pads thereunder, e.g., of phenolic or other smooth material to permit such tool to glide on the panel surface while minimizing or precluding scratching thereof. The third innovation is the recessing of the saw blade between the glide pads to elevate the blade slightly above the surface of the panel to minimize scratching or abrasion thereof while cutting the plug off proximate such skin, e.g., as indicated in  hereof.","Per the invention, the cutting blade is raised above the surface of the panel skin a distance \u2018d\u2019 per  hereof, e.g., 0.5-2 mils for near flush cutting of the plug from the panel or other surface. Any remaining projection of such plug can be readily sanded down in close proximity or fully flush with such skin or other surface.","The saw of the invention desirably employs a hacksaw or other blade and is highly suitable for cutting through metal or plastic, e.g., cutting through aluminum and phenolic honeycomb material, to flush cut a projection from a surface, with little or no scratching of such surface. Accordingly the tool of the invention, e.g., a modified bow saw, can be employed in any application where a flush cut of a projection from a surface is required, with little or no damage to such surface.","As indicated above, a preferred application of the method of the invention is to repair damage to aircraft or other panels by inserting a plug into the damaged panel and flush cutting same therein. Aluminum or phenolic honeycomb plugs are highly suitable in repairing damage to such panels. However various other plugs of, e.g., wood, metal or plastic can be employed, as desired, per the invention.","Also such plugs can be bonded in a panel aperture by adhesives such as resin or epoxy adhesives or various other available adhesives.","Various saw blades can be used in the cutting tool of the present invention of various metals such as blades of steel or alloys thereof, including stainless steel having saw teeth of various sizes, e.g., 18, 24 or 32 teeth per inch. Preferably, hacksaw blades are employed per the invention.","The foot pads of the cutting tool of the invention project slightly below the cutting blade and have a smooth surface (e.g., with rounded edges, per ) of various materials, e.g., wood, metal or plastic such as phenolics, polyolefins including polyethylene or various other plastics e.g., Teflon\u00ae.","As indicated in , the blade  on the cutting tool of the invention, is secured to the frame  thereof and recessed between smooth foot or glide pads  thereof by fasteners, e.g., screws  and , as shown or indicated in  hereof.","The cutting tool of the invention can have various frames, rounded, angular or a combination thereof (which include feet or pedestals) and preferably with a handle mounted thereto.","Accordingly, the flush cutting tool of the present invention provides a high quality panel or surface repair while significantly reducing man-hours per repair, providing structurally sound repairs, reducing rework errors and avoiding damage to skin or surface of the structure. Further, the tool of the present invention has application whenever a flush cut needs to be made on any surface, whether on panel, sheetrock, wood, ceramic, or other type surface that needs to be flush cut, e.g., in the construction industry."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will become more apparent from the following detailed specification, and drawings in which;",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 6 and 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 6 and"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
