title: Creation and presentation of selective digital content feeds
abstract: Methods and systems for creating and presentation of selective digital content feeds are disclosed. A user can design a selective feed comprised of video feed items, for example. An aggregation system searches two or more Internet services specified by the user to gather feed items. Those feed items are filtered according to a media type, such as video, such that each feed item is a video or has a link to a video. The feed items are gathered for presentment with a user interface that allows playback of the video feed items organized in some way, such as ascending order. For one embodiment, Internet video content is gathered from various sources to provide a consistent interface to the video content without the need to navigate all over the web to manually locate each video item.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to Australian Patent Application Serial No. 2011202182, filed May 11, 2011, which is a national phase of PCT\/US2011\/034653, filed Apr. 29, 2011 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","This application relates in general to creation of, and presentation of, selective digital content feeds and, but not by way of limitation, to creation of, and presentation of, selective digital content feeds comprising primarily or exclusively video and video-related content.","There are many services available to users through the use of the Internet, including websites, other Internet sites, publishing services, media services, data services, information services, electronic commerce services, electronic transaction services, payment services, software and content download services, communications services, other remotely accessed sites and services, and other digital sites, centers, destinations, or systems; whether shared or dedicated, public or private, institutional or personal, fixed or mobile, wired or wireless; and whether accessed through a browser, mini-browser, embedded browser, application, other software program, or other interface. Examples of popular Internet services in widespread use today include, but are not limited to: content websites that may include primarily video or audio content, primarily text and graphics (including photographs) content, or a mixture of several content and media types, including websites such as CNN.com\u2122, Politico.com\u2122, HuffingtonPost.com\u2122, NYTimes.com\u2122, and others; video publishing websites, such as YouTube\u2122, DailyMotion\u2122, Metacafe\u2122, and others; entertainment content services, such as Netflix\u2122, Pandora\u2122, Hulu\u2122, Zynga\u2122; social networking sites, such as Facebook\u2122, Twitter\u2122, and MySpace\u2122; and many others.","Digital content provided by Internet services can include any of, all of, or any combination of proprietary content, exclusively or non-exclusively licensed content, syndicated content, member-provided content, user-provided content, system-generated content, messages or emails from one or more users to one or more other users, social content, comments, ratings, embedded links to other digital content, tags, maps, locations, time and date content, user identifiers, source identifiers, and other related or unrelated content. The hyperlinked structure of the World Wide Web and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the advanced capabilities of modern web browsers, the ability (built into an increasing range of modern user devices) to execute programs, the flexibility inherent in application software developed and delivered to user devices, the rise of common platforms that support both broadly deployed and more narrowly focused functionality across many discrete Internet services, and the ability to stream data and content from, to, and among users and Internet services in realtime or near realtime, individually and collectively have increasingly allowed Internet services to create content and data feeds that are simple, complex, or compound, and include as many, or as few, diverse components as is desired.","A user may use more than one Internet service, sequentially, concurrently, or simultaneously; may use different Internet services with different degrees of interest, intensity, frequency, sophistication, depth of knowledge of the service, and\/or skill; and may vary her selection and mix of services from time to time, or over time, according to tasks and interests, because of the Internet service choices of others, according to her choice of device at the moment or over time, or for other reasons.","Users increasingly use devices other than, or in addition to, browser-equipped personal computers to access Internet services, including SMS-capable and other mobile phones, web-equipped mobile phones, smartphones, Internet-ready television sets, digital set-top boxes, DVD and Blu-Ray players, digital video recorders, videogame consoles, tablets such as the iPad\u2122, and other devices. These devices exhibit a wide array of form factors, memory, storage, displays, output interfaces, user input interfaces and devices, and other peripherals and components. Users may have preferences and habits that influence or determine the choice of device for a given purpose, for a given time and place, or for a given mode of use, because of, or regardless of, such device aspects.","There are numerous standards available for use in browsers, browser-equipped personal computers, and the numerous other devices used by users to access Internet services. These standards are sometimes deployed in mass production products before being finally determined, at different times for different products, in heterogeneous technical implementations, and with varying degrees of completeness; they often evolve over time, at times discontinuously; and they fluctuate in popularity. As a result, devices are not always technically uniform, and not all such standards are supported by all device and component providers. For example, some browsers support HTML5 and some browsers do not; different HTML5-ready browsers support different media standards (e.g., when rendering content identified with the <video> tag some support H.264, whereas others support WebM\u2122 or another video codec); some devices support Adobe\u2122 Flash\u2122, while some devices do not (e.g., Apple\u2122 iPhone\u2122 and iPad\u2122 do not); or, one set-top box may support MPEG2 video but not H.264 video, whereas another may support both and a third may support just H.264. In addition, there are diverse content security schemes deployed across devices, including proprietary encryption schemes, consortia-based encryption schemes, and other encryption schemes; and there are diverse rights management and user authentication schemes, including consortia-based schemes, such as UltraViolet\u2122, and vendor-proprietary schemes, such as Disney\u2122 Keychest\u2122 and Apple\u2122 iTunes\u2122.","As the variety and capability of devices available to users have increased and as user behavior has evolved in response to new devices and capabilities, content company strategies have also evolved. Aspects of evolving content company strategies include: blocking some or all devices from accessing some or all content; modifying or customizing technical versions of content available on some or all devices; modifying or customizing editorial versions of content available on some or all devices; modifying or customizing advertising, sponsorships, or other promotional aspects presented in conjunction with content accessed via some or all devices; making content available on different devices with different access prices, terms, user rights and privileges, and other conditions; and many other strategy variations. Content company strategies and aspects of strategies commonly vary from device to device, from content company to content company on a given device, and from one geography to another. For example, in the United States, ABC\u2122\/Disney\u2122 makes most ABC\u2122 network television shows available on broadcast television with commercials, online with commercials, and online for download via Apple\u2122 iTunes\u2122 without commercials but at a charge per episode, but blocks the availability of these shows on GoogleTV\u2122; while at the same time, it makes most Disney\u2122 network television shows available on broadcast television without commercials, online with commercials, and online for download via iTunes\u2122 without commercials but at a charge per episode, and blocks the availability of these shows on GoogleTV\u2122.","Most Internet services operate legitimately. Legitimate Internet services may properly obtain rights to content through licensing, syndication, fair use, government permission, or other legitimate methods, or may produce content of their own, or may pursue a combination of these and other methods. Some Internet services, however, are less concerned about obtaining proper rights to content, and may rely on their users to have obtained rights, may rely on actual or alleged legal safe harbor provisions, or may pay little or no attention to rights questions. The problem of intellectual property piracy has increased as user Internet use has increased.","In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides methods and systems for creating and presentation of selective digital content feeds. A user can design a selective feed comprised of video feed items, for example. An aggregation system searches two or more Internet services specified by the user to gather feed items. Those feed items are filtered according to a media type, such as video, such that each feed item is a video or has a link to a video. The feed items are gathered for presentment with a user interface that allows playback of the video feed items organized in some way, such as ascending order. For one embodiment, Internet video content is gathered from various sources to provide a consistent interface to the video content without the need to navigate all over the web to manually locate each video item.","In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a content processing system for providing personalized video content feeds to users from the Internet. The content processing system includes a first and second feed services, an aggregation system and a selective video feed. The first service feed is acquired from a first Internet service, which is accessible from the Internet, wherein the first service feed includes a plurality of first feed items that each link to content objects available from the Internet. The second service feed is acquired from a second Internet service, which is accessible from the Internet, wherein the second service feed includes a plurality of second feed items that each link to content objects available from the Internet. The aggregation system receives the first and second service feeds and respectively reduces them to a first subset of the plurality of first feed items and a second subset of the plurality of second feed items, wherein the first subset and the second subset are limited to video feed items. The selective video feed includes the first subset of the plurality of first feed items and the second subset of the plurality of second feed items.","In yet another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for processing personalized video content feeds to users from the Internet. A first service feed is acquired, including a plurality of first feed items that each link to content objects available from the Internet, from a first Internet service. A second service feed is acquired, including a plurality of second feed items that each link to content objects available from the Internet, from a second Internet service. The first service feed is filtered to a first subset of the plurality of first feed items. The second service feed is filtered to a second subset of the plurality of second feed items. The first subset and the second subset are combined into a video selective feed. The video selective feed is delivered to a user.","In yet another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for providing personalized video feeds to a user gathered from the Internet. Selection of a first content feed is sent, including a plurality of first feed items that each link to content objects available from the Internet, from a first Internet service. Selection of a second content feed is sent, including a plurality of second feed items that each link to content objects available from the Internet, from a second Internet service. A criteria receiving from the user specifying filtering of one of: the first service feed to a first subset of the plurality of first feed items, and\/or the second service feed to a second subset of the plurality of second feed items. The criteria is sent. A combination of the first subset and the second subset is received as a selective feed of video content. The selective feed is rendered for the user as a series of videos.","In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for providing personalized content feeds to users from the Internet. A first service feed is acquired, including a plurality of first feed items that each link to content objects available from the Internet, from a first Internet service. A second service feed is acquired, including a plurality of second feed items that each link to content objects available from the Internet, from a second Internet service. The first service feed is filtered to a first subset of the plurality of first feed items. The second service feed is filtered to a second subset of the plurality of second feed items. The first subset and the second subset are combined into a selective feed. The selective feed is delivered to a user.","In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a video processing system for providing personalized content feeds to users from the Internet. The video processing system comprising one or more hardware servers configured to: acquire a first service feed, including a plurality of first feed items that each link to content objects available from the Internet, from a first Internet service, acquire a second service feed, including a plurality of second feed items that each link to content objects available from the Internet, from a second Internet service, filter the first service feed to a first subset of the plurality of first feed items, filter the second service feed to a second subset of the plurality of second feed items, combine the first subset and the second subset into a selective feed, and deliver the selective feed to a user.","Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating various embodiments, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to necessarily limit the scope of the disclosure.","In the appended figures, similar components and\/or features may have the same reference label. Further, various components of the same type may be distinguished by following the reference label by a dash and a second label that distinguishes among the similar components. If only the first reference label is used in the specification, the description is applicable to any one of the similar components having the same first reference label irrespective of the second reference label.","The ensuing description provides preferred exemplary embodiment(s) only, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the disclosure. Rather, the ensuing description of the preferred exemplary embodiment(s) will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing a preferred exemplary embodiment. It is understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope as set forth in the appended claims.","Referring first to , a primary embodiment is shown that includes an Internet system  that aggregates two or more Internet service feeds .  shows a block diagram of the Internet system  without showing the Internet or other network that couples the various blocks together.  shows a functional diagram of various feeds and filters that operate to convert service feeds  into selective feeds . Only a single selective feed  and a single user  is shown, but it is to be understood that there are many different selective feeds  for many different users  supported by the Internet system . An aggregation service  selectively and optionally narrows the aggregate of the service feeds  into one or more selective feeds , and presents the selective feed(s)  to a user  viewing with a rendering system\/device\/agent  at a user location . In this disclosure, the singular and plural terms \u201cselective feed\u201d and \u201cselective feeds\u201d are used interchangeably for convenience, clarity and readability, to mean one or more selective feeds , and should be interpreted accordingly. In the primary embodiment, a selective feed  is created from the aggregate of service feeds  by including only items from the aggregate of service feeds  which are, contain, refer to, or otherwise indicate, video content. This creates a condensed and video-specific selective feed  from the aggregate of service feeds . The Internet services  are generally operated by third parties (e.g., websites, Facebook\u2122, YouTube\u2122, Twitter\u2122).","In other embodiments, a selective feed  is created by selecting (meaning to include and\/or exclude) items which are, contain, refer to, or otherwise indicate one or more media types other than video or in addition to video; is created from a single Internet service feed  by selecting items which are, contain, refer to, or otherwise indicate video content; is created from a single Internet service feed  by selecting items which are, contain, refer to, or otherwise indicate one or more media types other than video or in addition to video; is created from a single Internet service feed  or from an aggregate of more than one Internet service feed  by selectively narrowing the single service feed  or aggregate of service feeds (i.e., an aggregate feed ) by selecting items which are, contain, refer to, or otherwise indicate video content and based on one or more other criteria, including user, Internet service, user within Internet service, source, user within source, user ratings or rankings, user comments, keywords, tags, user tags, topic, category, language, other content indicators, length, format and\/or codec, fidelity (such as standard definition, 720p, 1080p), time and\/or date, device , or location; is created from a single Internet service feed  or from an aggregate feed  by selectively narrowing the single feed  or aggregate feed  by selecting items which are, contain, refer to, or otherwise indicate one or more media types other than video or in addition to video, and based on one or more other criteria, including user, Internet service, user within Internet service, source, user within source, user ratings or rankings, user comments, keywords, tags, user tags, topic, category, language, other content indicators, length, format and\/or codec, fidelity (such as standard definition, 720p, 1080p), time and\/or date, device , or location respectively, optionally through use of a first-stage filter  or a second-stage filter  or both; or is created from a single Internet service feed  or from an aggregate feed  by selectively narrowing the single service feed  or aggregate feed  by selecting items based on other similar or dissimilar criteria respectively, optionally through use of a first-stage filter  or a second-stage filter  or both.","In the primary embodiment, the user configures which Internet service feeds  will be aggregated as the basis for her selective feed(s)  and supplies whatever credentials are required in order to enable the aggregation system  to collect the configured service feeds . The selective feed  is produced from one or more service feeds  with optional first-stage filtering  that are collected into an aggregate feed  that may have an optional second-stage filter . Some feeds may be specific to her, for example her Twitter\u2122 service feed  (which, although it may comprise the Twitter\u2122 messages [\u201ctweets\u201d] of many Twitter\u2122 users, will contain only those of the feeds that she follows) or her email service feed  (inbound email messages); in many such cases, the ability of the aggregation system  to access these service feeds  will depend on the user  supplying her credentials, typically her username and password, for the aggregation system  to use. In the primary embodiment, a user  can provide access credentials for other Internet services , either permanently (allowing the aggregation system  to store the credentials) or temporarily (the aggregation system  uses the credentials for the current session but does not store them, or stores them temporarily), and can revoke access, in effect disconnecting a given service feed  from the aggregation system . Other service feeds  may be freely available service feeds , such as published service feeds , for example a YouTube\u2122 channel or the RSS feed of a website; service feeds  such as these often will not require any credentials. In the primary embodiment, these service feeds  can be configured or de-configured, even though there may be no access credentials required to access, or to revoke, these service feeds . Other service feeds  may be created by, or made available to, the aggregation system  by querying one or more websites or other publicly available or privately available Internet content sources or services .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["204","116","108","206","116","204","224","204","116","204","224","204","206","204","224","216","220"]},"In the primary embodiment, a user  creates a username and password, or uses other credentials she has created (such as her Facebook\u2122 username and password, via Facebook\u2122 Connect) or that are available to her (such as her employer-assigned username, password, or other credentials, or such as system-created credentials, including credentials that precisely, loosely, approximately, or otherwise identify her or associate her with one or more services or resources), to access and control her selective feed  (configure and reconfigure the service feeds  that will be aggregated to create her selective feed , connect and configure rendering systems , and perform other control and configuration functions). In other embodiments, a user  can use other access credentials or methods, or is required to use no access credentials or methods, to access or to control some or all aspects of her selective feed  through the aggregation system .","As described previously in the primary embodiment, some Internet service feeds  (which will be included in the aggregation of feeds as the basis for a user's selective feed), such as Twitter\u2122 service feeds  or service feeds  from email accounts, may consist, in part or entirely, of items that can be identified to particular users or other sub-entities within the overall service feed ; for example, a Twitter\u2122 service feed  comprises messages that can normally be identified with one or more particular Twitter\u2122 users, Twitter\u2122 accounts, or Twitter\u2122 lists. In addition, feed items from an Internet service feed  (which will be included in the aggregation of service feeds  as the basis for a user's selective feed ), may have other optional or mandatory attributes; for example, messages in an email feed may have a priority flag, a spam flag, or one or more other attributes. In an optional aspect of the preferred embodiment, a user can further configure a specific Internet service feed  (which will be aggregated as the basis for a user's selective feed ) to include or exclude feed items from aggregation into the basis for the user's selective feed , based on the user, account, list, entity, or other attribute or characteristic of items in the Internet service feed .","In the primary embodiment, the aggregation system  is implemented as an Internet service and supports two or more users. Accordingly, in the primary embodiment the aggregation system  collects Internet service feeds  as configured for each one of the multiple users  of the aggregation system , and selectively narrows the aggregated feeds  and\/or video sharing feeds  into one or more selective feeds  for each user. In other embodiments, the system  is implemented as an Internet aggregation service  that supports only one user ; is implemented as software deployed on one or more user devices or rendering systems  and supporting one or more users  of those devices ; is implemented as software deployed in an Internet network supporting one or more users ; or is implemented as a feature of another Internet service.","With reference to , another embodiment of a diagram showing creation of a selective feed . In this embodiment, the selective feed  is a function of a video-sharing feed  formulated by another user and an aggregate feed  designed by the user. A second-stage filter takes the combination and may select in, or filter out, certain parts of the feed based upon a criteria specified by the user. The selective feed  could include any number of video-sharing feeds for optionally combining with an aggregate feed . The user could avoid specifying an aggregate feed  in other examples solely relying upon one or more vide-sharing feeds  to create her selective feed .","In the primary embodiment, some service feeds  configured for aggregation may overlap (e.g., if a popular celebrity is followed on Twitter\u2122 by more than one user of the system); in this case, the service feed  configured for aggregation is only obtained once, and can be simultaneously, synchronously, asynchronously, or discontinuously used (or re-used) as the basis for the other users  who also have configured that feed for aggregation. In this fashion, the aggregation system  of the primary embodiment is efficient in its use of resources and avoids duplicate or repetitive processing. Reuse may even be used where credentials are used by one user for a service feed  that will be used for another user.","In other embodiments, some or all of any overlapping service feeds  configured for aggregation are obtained separately for some or all users that have configured that service feed for inclusion in their aggregation feeds . Where credentials are required, service feeds  could be kept separate and retrieved in duplicate from the Internet service . Separation could be done in some embodiments regardless of whether credentials are required.","In the primary embodiment, optionally some service feeds  that a user  configures for aggregation can be provided by the Internet service  individually for that user , so that some or all users  who have configured that service feed  for inclusion in their aggregate feed  receive personalized, partially personalized, unique, partially unique, or potentially unique selective feeds  that are specific to them or that are created expressly for them. In the primary embodiment, the user  is identified via a user ID associated with the aggregated feed  that she provides to the aggregation system , and that the aggregation system  passes to the Internet service  of the service feed  to be aggregated, enabling that Internet service  to configure and return, or otherwise send, a service feed  customized for that specific user . In this optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the user  also provides a password, so that the user  can be authenticated to the Internet service . In another embodiment, a password is not required.","In other embodiments, the user  is identified by any of, all of, or any combination of: a user ID, with or without a password; association with a specific device , device identifier, MAC address, or other attribute or data element associated with a device ; association with a network address, network identifier, telephone number, or other attribute or data element associated with a network; association with content, a set of content, a pattern of content viewed, a content access characteristic, a set of content access characteristics, or a pattern of content access characteristics; association with a stored identifier, such as an Internet browser cookie, a Flash\u2122 local shared object, or a similar file; association with a derived identifier, such as a device fingerprint comprising one or more aspects of the user's device and\/or device software; association with biometric information; association with a usage pattern or characteristics; or association through another method of identifying a user or a user's association with a feed provider.","In the primary embodiment, while most service feeds  configured for aggregation are content feeds, additional feeds can optionally be configured for aggregation that provide data, sound, music, or other information, rather than video content, to the aggregation system . This data or other information can be used by the aggregation system  in the optional creation of algorithmically created, filtered, or alternatively sequenced feeds; for example, a data feed of a user's fantasy sports league rosters could be configured for aggregation, and the aggregation system  could then use the information it receives about the user's fantasy sports roster as a basis for identifying items for, filtering items contained within in, or alternatively sequencing the items in, the user's selective feed ; in this optional embodiment, if and as the provided data or other information changed, the content of, filtering of, or sequencing of the items contained in the selective feed  would change accordingly.","Referring next to , a block diagram of an embodiment of an aggregation system  is shown. There are various stores of information that may be in a database, file system and\/or memory data structure, specifically, Internet feed items , aggregate feed items , selective feed items , service credentials , and feed filters . The information in the various stores can be combined into a single store or divided between a number of stores at a number of locations. The aggregation system  includes application software running on one or more hardware servers in one or more locations.","The aggregation engine  manages processing of information within the aggregation system. Service interfaces  periodically check the various Internet services  for new Internet feed items . Service credentials  are stored when and if the service credentials  are provided by users  and used by the service interfaces  where required by the Internet services . Internet feed items  are processed and stored. In some cases, Internet feed items  can be pushed to the aggregation engine  without the need to query for Internet feed items  by the Internet services .","In another embodiment, one or more Internet services  send, transmit, or otherwise provide Internet feed items  to the aggregation system , accessing an Application Programming Interface (API) or other interface mechanism to provide feed items, associated content, metadata, extracts or highlights, and any other information related to the service feed  or to individual Internet feed items  in the service feed .","There can be first-stage filters  and second-stage filters  stored as feed filters . The feed processor  performs standard filtering to find appropriate feed items, but can also apply the first-stage  and second-stage filters  as specified by the users . The Internet feed items  are organized by their source Internet service , category, sub-category, subject, topic or topics, tag or tags, genre, content rating, reviewer rating, popularity, and\/or other factors. The aggregate feed items  are an aggregation from multiple service feeds  specified by a user after any feed filter  is applied by the feed processor . The selective feed items  are further filtered by the feed processor  using any second-stage filters .","Filters, including first-stage filters  and second-stage filters , or other filters, can be absolute or can be indicative of proportion or relative weight or degree, or can combine both. Thus, a filter applied to the aggregate or video sharing feeds ,  of one user could completely block, or always include, inclusion in the selective feed  or a subset of the selective feed  those feed items ,  matching the specified criteria, whereas the filter applied to the feed ,  of a second user could operate to reduce the number of such feed items , , but not completely block such feed items , , or operate to increase the proportion of such feed items , , but not always include such feed items , , in the selective feed  or a subset of the selective feed  of that second user, and whereas the filter applied to the feed ,  of a third user could operate to change the position or sequence of feed items ,  matching the specified criteria in the selective feed  or a subset of the selective feed  of that third user. For example, in a user interface, such filters could be visually presented to a user as a \u201cslider\u201d bar, where the far left position means \u201calways include,\u201d the far right position means \u201calways exclude,\u201d and positions between the far left and far right mean graduated degrees of inclusion, importance, or priority.","Once a service interface  has found an Internet feed item , it is processed to determine included video or content link, feed service source, description of the video or content, any reviews or rankings, user comments, related article(s) etc. In the various stages of processing, all the information that comprises the Internet feed item  need not be replicated. The aggregate feed  can be a list of identifiers that specify which Internet feed items  to include. Similarly, the selective feed can be a list of the Internet feed items  that have not been filtered out and are specified for inclusion for one or more users .","The user  interacts with a user interface to configure the aggregation system . An account is created through the user interface where service feeds  are specified, filtering, credentials, etc. Additionally, the user  can authenticate herself with the aggregation system , for example, with a user name and password or with other credentials. Content pages are supplied through the user interface  to display the selective feed items . The selective feed items  can be organized by oldest items, newest items, most highly reviewed, popularity, unviewed items, or any other criteria or combination of criteria.","Referring next to , a diagram - of an embodiment illustrating the logical flow of feeds is shown. In this embodiment, there are x service feeds , y aggregate feeds  and z selective feeds. The arrows show how service feeds  are typically logically combined into aggregate feeds  and optionally logically combined into selective feeds . For example, a first service feed - is the sole contributor to a first aggregate feed -. The first, third and fifth aggregate feeds -, -, - are identified by the user  to be combined into the first selective feed -. In another example, the third and fifth service feeds -, - combine into the fourth aggregate feed - before being the sole contributor to the fifth selective feed -.","With reference to , a diagram - of an embodiment illustrating the flow of feeds is shown. This embodiment adds user-defined filtering through first-stage filters  and second-stage filters . These filters are in addition to standard filters that screen for feed items that are of a particular type, for example, video feed items are screened to exclude items that have no video. In one example, the fifth service feed - is provided to fourth and fifth aggregate feeds -, -. A first stage filter  on prior to the fifth aggregate feed may select for, or screen out, any Internet feed items  relating to a particular subject or with a particular characteristic, for example, HD video or with a keyword or tag of \u201cCharlie Sheen\u201d. In another example, the second aggregate feed - is provided to both the first and second selective feeds -, - with only the second selective feed - filtering the input aggregate feed items .","Referring next to , a process  for gathering feed items is shown for the primary embodiment. The depicted portion of the process begins in block  where the service interfaces  gather Internet feed items . Any needed service credentials  are used to get access to the service feeds . In block , the service feeds  chosen by the various users are gathered by the service interfaces . Each service feed  could be checked periodically for new Internet feed items . Processing is performed on the Internet feed items  in block .","Various users  have subscribed to the various service feeds . In block , the processed Internet feed items  are routed to the subscribed aggregate feeds . Any first-stage filter  specified by the user is performed on the Internet feed items  before they become part of the aggregate feed  in block . The aggregate feed items  are routed to selective feeds  that have subscribed in block . Any second-stage filter  is applied on the selective feed items  in block . The user  periodically will access the aggregation system  to view the selective feed  through the user interface .","With reference to , a process  that fixes the service feed  is shown. The aggregation system  determines whether an aggregate feed item  from an aggregate feed  is itself, or references or includes within it, video content, and if the aggregate feed item  is or does, processes the aggregate feed item , by any of, some of, or all of the following blocks, depending on the requirements presented by the aggregate feed item  from the service feed , and executed in any order as determined by the requirements presented by the aggregate feed item . The depicted portion of the process  begins in block  where the aggregation engine  identifies and categorizes the Internet feed item  and extracts available characteristics of the Internet feed item , e.g. any available identifying, classifying, temporal, or system-related characteristics of the Internet feed item .","In block , the aggregation engine  determines whether the Internet feed item  has been previously processed, and if it has, how recently and in what context. Next, it is determined whether an Internet feed item  is itself a video resource. The aggregation engine  determines whether an Internet feed item  that is not a video resource is a web page, RSS feed, XML file, or other data type that potentially contains within it URLs that are video resources or that iteratively require further processing in block . Embedded executable code contained within the resource is executed in block , such as Javascript\u2122 contained with a web page, to obtain content that is normally activated within that resource by a browser or other software client's execution of such embedded executable code, and further processes the content thereby obtained. In block , it is determined whether a video resource URL or other resource URL is content, or is a URL for an advertisement (either video or non-video); and if it is a URL for an advertisement, ignores it.","A URL in an Internet feed item  can be redirected and\/or rewritten when activated. In block , it is determined whether a URL is a shortened URL, and if it is, issues an HTTP (or other appropriately formatted request) for that URL to obtain the actual base reference URL for further processing. It is determined whether the base reference URL has previously been processed in block , and if it has, determines whether a modification, creation, or expiration date parameter is associated with the base reference URL, and if one is available, determines whether it indicates that the resource identified by the base reference URL has been changed, or has not been changed, since the base reference URL was previously processed. Where the base reference URL was not previously processed, the aggregation engine  parses the surrounding resource to obtain metadata, such as dates, times, proper names, and other metadata, that is potentially relevant to, associated with, or descriptive of, the video resource in block . The aggregation engine  optionally parses the surrounding resource to obtain user comments, \u201clikes,\u201d ratings, and other user feedback or other content. The aggregation engine  optionally associates data obtained from the surrounding resource with the base reference URL or base video object, in order to aggregate data obtained from multiple surrounding resources in which a particular base reference URL or base video object appears.","Where a base reference URL is available for the URL, such as may be the case for syndicated content, the aggregation engine identifies whether a base reference video object is available for a video resource identified by a URL. In block , a syndicated video resource that has not been previously stored, is stored. Optionally, one or more short highlights of the video object are extracted and stored; in the current implementation of the primary embodiment, a single 15 second highlighted is extracted and stored. Optionally, the video resource, the extracted highlight(s), or both (all) are transcoded or otherwise processed into one or more other formats, codecs, bitrates, containers, or forms. The aggregation engine stores and associates the data and objects obtained via this process , keyed at least by the item processed and by the video resource as a service feed item in block .","In the primary embodiment, the aggregation system  optionally eliminates duplicate video items (i.e., items that appear in more than one of the service feeds  aggregated for one or more users ), while preserving the selective feed item's  presence in any of the selective feeds , or any of the filtered or narrowed views of any of the selective feeds . In the primary embodiment, the user  can also add a resource or item to the aggregation system , so that the video will be included in the user's aggregate feeds  and processed to derive the user's selective feed , by providing the resource's URL, embed code, or other identifier to the aggregation system ; that item is processed as if it were an item obtained from a service feed .","In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment, some Internet services  are blocked by the aggregation system , so that a user  cannot configure such Internet service  for aggregation, cannot add an Internet item  associated with that Internet service  to the aggregation system , or otherwise designate content from that Internet service  for incorporation into the aggregation system ; this optional aspect of the primary embodiment can be configured to prevent the aggregation system  from accessing and\/or incorporating content associated with, or obtained from, Internet services  that have been identified as being Internet services  that consist partially, predominately, or entirely of content that is undesirable, prohibited, illegal, pirated, unlicensed, copied, or otherwise objectionable. In another embodiment of this optional aspect, some Internet services  are blocked by the aggregation system  for some users , based on criteria associated with users  or rendering devices , or other criteria. In another embodiment of this optional aspect, some or all Internet services  are configured for content review and each feed item  (including related or associated content) is inspected for a digital watermark, digital fingerprint, audio content match, or other content match to determine whether the specific feed item  and its related or associated content is permitted or blocked.","Referring next to , B and C, an embodiment of an user interface  to the aggregation system  is shown. In the primary embodiment, the user interface  for a full screen (as opposed to mini) browser-based user  who is recognized by the aggregation system  comprises a content navigation pane  with navigational and other controls across the top of the screen, a presentation of the user's selective feed running in a feed pane  beneath the content navigation pane  and down the left side of the screen, an active item pane  for video playback underneath the overall controls on the right side of the user interface , an information display showing information (i.e., title , source  and description ) about the video underneath the video window , and a comment entry field  and sharing controls , ,  beneath the information display.","In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment, a visual user interface for a full screen browser-based user is a video playback window  embedded in a web page published by a party other than the primary embodiment aggregation system . The embedded user interface could also include a feed pane  and\/or a content navigation pane . Other embodiments could include a feed pane  that is overlaid or replaced by a video playback window  when one selective feed item  is chosen.","In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment, one or more data elements or types related to each selective feed item  is presented from some or all of the Internet services  associated with the service feeds  in which the selective feed item  was found, for example, ratings, comments, \u201clikes,\u201d shares or other such information about a selective feed item . In yet another optional aspect of the primary embodiment, one or more data elements or types related to each selective feed item  is consolidated from some or all of the Internet services  associated with the service feeds  in which the selective feed item  was found, for example, \u201clikes\u201d or shares of a feed item  are aggregated from multiple Internet services , or ratings of a feed item  are averaged or otherwise mathematically consolidated from multiple Internet services .","In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the visual interface  and controls are adapted to the display characteristics and data input\/output capabilities of an Internet-connected television, with the video playing in the full screen, or nearly the full screen, of the television display with translucent information related to the video displayed over the video as the video playback window  starts and then fading-out after several seconds to provide unimpeded visual access to the video; controls, such as \u201cskip to the next video\u201d or \u201cbring up the selective feed,\u201d are executed via pressing keys on the television remote. In some cases, a playback manipulation control  would overlay the video playback window  translucently when temporal manipulation of playback is performed and fade away after manipulation.","In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the visual user interface  and controls are adapted to the display characteristics and data input\/output capabilities of an Internet-connected smartphone or tablet, with the video playback window  playing in the full (albeit, in at least some cases, physically small) screen, or nearly the full screen, of the smartphone or tablet, with information , ,  related to the video displayed over the video as the video starts and then fading out after several seconds to provide unimpeded visual access to the video; controls, such as \u201cskip to the next video\u201d or \u201cbring up the selective feed,\u201d are executed via gestures made by touching the screen, or by pressing keys on a soft keyboard invoked to appear on the screen, or by pressing physical keys on the smartphone or tablet.","In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the visual user interface  is split between two display screens, implemented as either two display screens embedded in a single device or as two separate devices. A first display screen could be a television with the video playback window  being supplied by internal circuitry or a set top box. A second display screen would be used to provide the feedback pane , content navigation pane , content information , , , playback manipulation control , comment entry field , sharing controls , , , and\/or embedded link control . The second display screen could be an intelligent remote control, a smart phone, a PDA, a personal computer, a tablet computer, etc. Communication could be directly from the second display screen to the first display screen or through an intermediary such as a set top box or through the aggregation system .","In another embodiment, the visual interface comprises multiple columns of selective feed items , all of which may be sorted according to the same criteria, or some or all of which may be sorted according to separate criteria, implemented as multiple feed panes  or as multiple columns of information in a single feed pane . In this embodiment, one or more feed panes  would compress, dissolve or fade, shift to another position, or otherwise visually give way to the active item pane  when a selective feed item  is selected for playback.","In the primary embodiment, the selective feed  is presented to the user  in reverse chronological timeline sequence, that is, with the most recent item first (e.g., at the top of a list of items) as shown in . In other embodiments, the selective feed  is presented to the user  in chronological timeline sequence; in modified reverse chronological timeline sequence where selective feed items  are grouped together, the selective feed items  within groups  are presented in chronological timeline sequence and the groups  are presented in reverse chronological timeline sequence; in modified chronological timeline sequence where selective feed items  are grouped together, the selective feed items  within groups  are presented in reverse chronological timeline sequence and the groups  are presented in chronological timeline sequence; or in a sequence determined without regard to time order. Optionally, the selective feed  may also be presented in one or more filtered or alternative sequences, for example any of, all of, or any combination of:\n\n","In the primary embodiment, the videos are played sequentially in the order in which they are presented to the user  in the selective feed , and if the selective feed  is presented in a filtered or narrowed ordered, then in that filtered or narrowed sequence. Thus, in the primary embodiment and on a full screen browser-based device interface (e.g., a PC), the user can see the selective feed  on the left in a feed pane , which feed item  is currently playing, which feed item(s)  recently played, and which items are coming up for playback with the feed items  arranged in the feed pane  as a vertically-rotating carousel. In the primary embodiment, each item in the running selective feed  presented on the left hand side feed pane  of the user interface screen  contains descriptive information about the item, such as the title , description , source , number of likes and shares, optionally other rating information, and optionally other information; this enables the user to see such information about feed items  not currently playing in the video playback window of the active item pane . The user  can manually select feed items  within the selective feed  as presented, typically by pointing and clicking on a feed item , at which point the feed item  begins playing in the video playback window of the active item pane , which allows the user  to directly access any feed item  on demand and begin playback as the feed items  are rotated through a list of the selective feed  arranged in a vertical carousel within the feed pane . The user  can also select the next sequential video in the list of the selective feed  by clicking on a button or slider control that advances playback to the next feed item , which stops playback of the current feed item  and begins playback of the next feed item  in sequence. At the conclusion of any feed item's  playback, when playback of that feed item  reaches the end, the next feed item  in sequence automatically begins playback in one embodiment. Other embodiments could use a Play control to begin playback of the next feed item  after the current feed item  is done playing.","In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment, automatic sequential playback continues indefinitely, until the end of the selective feed  is reached; in this manner, a very long continuous period of video content playback\u2014hours, days, weeks, months, limited only by the length of the history of the user's selective feed \u2014can in principle be offered to the user , with as much or as little action, and resulting control, as the user desires. In another aspect of the primary embodiment, automatic sequential playback is paused or stopped by the aggregation system  after a predetermined point or range, based on a number of videos played, a total time amount of video played, a time interval that has elapsed since the last user-initiated action, the age of an item in the user's selective feed, or other criteria; automatic sequential playback may then be resumed upon user initiation or if the user responds to a prompt or system request or dialogue.","In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the user  can perform one or more of the following actions for some or all of the feed items  in her selective feed :\n\n","In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the sequence of feed items  upcoming in the user's selective feed  shown in the feed pane  is dynamically influenced, changed, or rearranged based on the user's actions as the aggregation system  progresses through the selective feed  as originally sequenced for the user  in the vertical carousel. For example, as previously described, in the primary embodiment the sequence of the feed items  in the selective feed  is reverse chronological timeline sequence (which in this optional aspect may be considered the original sequence of feed items ); as the aggregation system  proceeds through the playback process and the user  watches, skips, likes, saves, or shares items in the selective feed , in this optional aspect of the primary embodiment the aggregation system  dynamically adjusts the sequence of upcoming feed items  in the user's selective feed  to reflect these actions so that the user  sees more items that share various characteristics with the feed items  she has liked or shared or saved for later viewing, or fewer items that share various characteristics with the feed items  she has skipped or deleted, or otherwise re-sequences the upcoming feed items  in the selective feed  based on her actions. This process can be iteratively repeated based on the user's actions as the aggregation system  progresses through the adjusted selective feed , further adjusting the sequence of feed items  then upcoming; similarly, based on the user's actions this process can be cancelled or reversed and the user's upcoming selective feed items  reverted to the original sequence.","In this optional aspect of the primary embodiment, this adjusted sequence can be presented continuously with, or as part of, or as the next part of, the user's selective feed , or can be presented as a separately labeled and separately selectable sequence of the user's selective feed . Adjustments to the user's upcoming sequence can be provided in real-time or near real-time, as the user  advances through, or as automatic playback advances through, the user's selective feed ; can be effected between sessions; can be effected after a specified amount or type of amount of one or more types of user action has occurred; can be effected after two or more user actions have occurred in sequence, consecutively, within a specified time period, within a specified number of user actions, in a particular order or in no particular order, or otherwise have occurred; or can be effected after a specified level of confidence in the applicability of the adjustment(s) is reached.","In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the user  has the option of selecting regular viewing mode, which plays each video in the selective feed  in full as presented (that is, plays the first video, then plays the next video, then plays the next video) or can select a quick-play viewing mode activated by a quick-play control , which plays one or more excerpts of each video, rather than the full videos, in sequence. In this optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the excerpts may be of a specific length, may be of selectable length, may be of a length selected by the aggregation system , or may be of a length separately selected for each feed item  by the aggregation system  for each. In this optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the user  has the option of clicking on a play-in-full icon, which then initiates play of the full feed item  from the beginning; upon completion, the aggregation system  will stay in regular viewing mode for the next feed item  in the user's selective feed , or in another optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the aggregation system  will return to quick-play viewing mode for the next feed item . When the user  selects quick-play viewing mode or alters the settings (length of excerpt, etc) of quick-play viewing mode, the presentation of the user's selective feed  is filtered to include only those feed items  for which the necessary excerpt(s) is(are) available, thus presenting the user  a selective feed  that functions properly in this mode.","In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment, content publishers and\/or Internet services  may be offered the option of prohibiting quick-play viewing mode or of specifying one or more excerpts to be presented in quick-play viewing mode. If a content publisher  has elected to prohibit quick-play viewing mode, when the user  selects this viewing mode the presentation of the user's selective feed  is additionally filtered to include only those feed items  for which the content publisher  has not prohibited quick-play viewing mode, thus presenting the user  a selective feed  that functions properly in this mode. If a content publisher  has elected to specify one or more excerpts to be presented in quick-play viewing mode, when the user  selects this mode the presentation of the user's selective feed  is additionally filtered to include only those feed items  for which the specified excerpt matches the quick-play viewing mode settings, or alternatively, the user's settings are overridden and the content publisher's  selected excerpt is presented even though it does not meet the user's quick-play viewing mode settings.","In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment, content publishers  may be offered the option of prohibiting quick-play viewing mode on specific devices  or specifying the excerpt to be used on a particular device  in quick play viewing mode. If a content publisher  has elected to prohibit quick-play viewing mode on specific devices , when the user  selects quick-play viewing, the presentation of the user's selective feed  is additionally filtered to include only those feed items  for which the content publisher  has not prohibited quick-play viewing mode on the device  the user  is using for playback, thus presenting the user  a selective feed  that functions properly in this mode. If a content publisher  has elected to specify one or more excerpts to be presented in quick-play viewing mode on a particular device , when the user  selects this mode the presentation of the user's selective feed  is additionally filtered to include only those feed items  for which the content provider's  specified excerpt for the device  being used by the user  matches the quick-play viewing mode settings, or alternatively, the user's settings are overridden and the content publisher's  selected excerpt for the device  being used by the user  is presented even though it does not meet the user's quick-play viewing mode settings.","In the primary embodiment, the selective feed  presented to the user  may optionally be modified (expanded or narrowed) based on the capabilities of the device  in use by the user  to effectively render the video content that comprises, is contained in, is referred to by, or is otherwise indicated by, the feed items  in the selective feed . In the primary embodiment, the ability to effectively render the video content is determined in absolute terms, that is, either the device  can render it or the device  cannot; in another embodiment, the ability to effectively render the video content is determined in qualitative terms, such as based on how well the device  can render the video content, based on the relative quality of the video playback in the context of the device's overall capabilities, or based on the relative quality of the video playback in the context of the particular user's or a typical user's normal usage of the device .","In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the selective feed  presented to the user  may optionally be modified (expanded or narrowed) based on the individual selective feed items  and the device  in use by the user , based on policies, attributes, or characteristics associated with the selective feed items , including the preferences or settings specified by any of, all of, or any combination of the producer of, publisher of, distributor of, contributor to, or other party affiliated with one or more items or the content contained in, or referenced by, one or more feed items , or by one or more Internet services  that contributed one or more items, or the content contained in, or referenced by, one or more feed items , to the selective feed . In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the selective feed  presented to the user  may optionally be modified (expanded or narrowed) based on the individual selective feed items  and the device  in use by the user , based on policies, attributes, or characteristics associated with the device , including the preferences or settings specified by the manufacturer of, distributor of, or other party affiliated with the device . In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the selective feed presented to the user may optionally be modified (expanded or narrowed) based on the individual selective feed items and the network or network segment to which the device  in use by the user  is attached, based on policies, attributes, or characteristics associated with the network or network segment, including the preferences or settings specified by the network or network segment operator, including a network operator, an enterprise or other organization, or an operator of a home or other premises network.","In the primary embodiment, the user  can view a subset of the selective feed  and\/or playback of the video content that comprises, is contained in, is referred to by, or is otherwise indicated by, the feed items  in the selective feed  based on (including or excluding) all of, any of, or any combination of: the Internet service(s)  from which one or more feed items  were obtained; the user(s)  or other entity(ies) associated with the Internet service(s)  from which one or more feed items  were obtained; the source(s) where one or more feed items  were referenced; the source(s) where one or more feed items  were published; the source(s) where one or more feed items  were first published; one or more lists or categories of Internet services ; one or more lists or categories of users of one or more Internet services ; one or more lists or categories of sources where feed items  are referenced, published, or first published; one or more topics to which one or more feed items  refer; one or more categories of topics or within which one or more topics are included; one or more time ranges, timeframes, sequences, or dates; one or more ratings, either globally or within one or more Internet services ; activity related to one or more feed items ; or other criteria associated with one or more feed items .","In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the user  can attach one or more devices , such as connected consumer electronics equipment, video game consoles, smartphones, and other devices, to his or her user account with the aggregation system . In the primary embodiment, the user  navigates to a code available on the device  she desires to connect to her account, then enters that code into her account through the user interface . In an alternative method for connecting a device  to her account, the user  navigates to a sign-in screen on the device  she wishes to connect and enters her username and password, thereby signing into the aggregation service  from the desired device . Under either method, the aggregation system  of the primary embodiment then identifies the device type and other technical and configuration characteristics, identifies the device  as connected to the user's account, and provides the appropriately configured selective feed, properly formatted content items, other user interface parameters and elements, operational parameters, controls and commands, and other content and data to the device , and accepts data, input, and other appropriately formatted (and, if desired, authenticated) entries from the device . In one embodiment, a device  can only be attached to a single user account with the aggregation system ; in another embodiment, a device  can be attached to multiple user accounts.","In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the aggregation system  determines one or more home regions, locations, or characteristics of a user , or of a device , or the combination of a user  and device , with any appropriate level or range of geographic or cultural precision, such as a global region (e.g., North America, Western Europe), continent, country, state, county, city, postal code, DMA, census tract, language, zone, or other cultural environs. The home regions, locations, or characteristics can then be used to filter, prioritize, select, or make substitutions for, some or all feed items, or versions of feed items, or versions of content associated with feed items, such as video content, presented in or with the selective feed  for a user , for example to select a version of a selective feed item  that is presented in a language specific to, or appropriate for, a region, location, or characteristic, or that contains a content version tailored to, or appropriate for, a region, country, or location, or substitute one such version of a selective feed item  for another, or as another example to filter out a selective feed item  that is not appropriate for, or is prohibited for legal or regulatory reasons in, a country or location. In another embodiment of this optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the user  can specify her home region, location, or characteristics. In yet another embodiment, the aggregation system  determines one or more home regions, locations, or characteristics of a user , the user  can also specify her home region, location, or characteristics, and the aggregation system  can determine when, under what conditions, and\/or for which feed items  to use the home region, location, or characteristics specified by the user  and when, under what conditions, and\/or for which feed items  to use the home regions, locations, or characteristics determined by the aggregation system . In one embodiment, the Internet service  can specify a home region, location, or characteristics on a per service feed  or per Internet feed item , which is communicated to the aggregation system  and can be used by the aggregation system  independently, or in conjunction with, the home region, location, or characteristics determined by the aggregation system , or the home region, location, or characteristics specified by the user , or both.","In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment, the user interface  of the aggregation system  presents the user  with a list of, or array, comprising one or more of the devices  connected to the aggregation system , optionally including the manufacturer, model, device type, carrier, and\/or other relevant descriptive data; allows the user  to provide customized names or identifiers to each device  (such as \u201cJohn's smartphone\u201d or \u201cLiving Room TV\u201d); enables the user  to manage each device , including to cancel the connection of that device  to the user's account; enables the user  to manage which of his or her organized feeds, subsets of feeds, lists of items, or other category or subset of feed items  is available on each device , and under what label; enables the user to identify or save feed items  for a specific device or devices , for example, while browsing the web via a web browser or while reviewing her selective feed  from a connected smartphone, identify or save a video for viewing on the device \u201cLiving Room TV\u201d or on the group of devices \u201cTVs at Home\u201d; enables the user  to manage the lengths of items, content of items, category of items, or other item attributes that will determine or influence which content or feed items  are available on that device ; allows the user  to control one connected device  from another, such as controlling a connected Blu-Ray player from a connected smartphone; control how one or more selective feeds , subset(s) of the selective feed(s) , or group of content or items is\/are filtered and\/or presented on the device or another device ; and enables the user  to save, rollback changes to, or recover prior versions of, such configurations, information, settings, or controls associated with one or more devices .","Specific details are given in the above description to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments.
