{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCED RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08\/550,455, filed Oct. 30, 1995, which is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 08\/512,365, filed Aug. 8, 1995, now abandoned.","The present invention generally relates to vehicle purchase systems, and more particularly, to an exchange system accessible via a communications network which facilitates the purchase of new vehicles.","When purchasing a product, a purchaser must first determine which product, including brand name, model, color and other features, best meets his needs. Once the purchaser has an established interest in purchasing a particular product, the purchaser typically visits, in person or by telephone, a few stores that sell the product to determine the best price. Once the best price is determined, all things being equal, the purchaser usually buys from the store selling this particular product at the best price.","Although visiting a dealer generally is a necessary element of the car purchasing process, many potential purchasers do not enjoy meeting with a sales person and having to negotiate a purchase. For example, a potential purchaser may want to first ascertain the various options and prices before discussing a purchase with a sales person.","In addition, visiting a dealer requires the purchaser to set aside at least a few hours of time. Even after visiting a dealer, however, the potential purchaser may not be totally comfortable in making a purchasing decision. For example, the purchaser may want to visit a number of other dealers to determine a competitive price for the particular car of interest. The purchaser, therefore, may visit a number of dealers that are within a reasonable distance from the purchaser's residence. Visiting many dealers usually requires a significant amount of time. It is not unusual for a potential purchaser to spend weeks visiting various dealers in an attempt to understand and locate the best deal.","Further, once a purchaser identifies a particular car, the purchaser then typically attempts to negotiate the best price from the dealer. These negotiations, for many purchasers, are the most difficult steps in the car purchasing process. Further, when coupled with options, factory invoice, advertised specials and volume buyer discounts, these negotiations may become complex and confusing.","In an attempt to assist car purchasers in the purchase of a new car, many types of services have been created. For example, magazines provide potential purchasers with detailed information regarding particular cars. Some services provide a wide variety of information accessible through a computer network such as Internet.","Known magazines and systems, however, generally do not fully facilitate negotiating the car price. For example, although the purchaser may be better informed, in general, about a particular car as a result of reviewing a particular magazine source, the purchaser may not be provided with the price or the detailed information with respect to cars readily available within a specific geographic region. In addition, in known magazines and \u201con-line\u201d services, all pricing information is limited to \u201clist\u201d price and \u201cinvoice\u201d price, and possibly a suggested discount percentage. Further, such systems do not provide a mechanism to allow a potential purchaser to \u201clock in\u201d a final purchase price. Also, such magazines and systems do not eliminate the negotiation process and in some instances in which unrealistic expectations are created, may even make the negotiations more difficult.","Accordingly, it would be desirable and advantageous to provide a car exchange system which enables a potential car purchaser to easily and quickly review all options, factory discounts and other information regarding specific car configurations of interest in combination with final pricing information for cars in a particular geographic region. It also would be desirable and advantageous to eliminate the car purchase negotiation process by providing an exchange system which enables a potential car purchaser to ascertain the best price for a particular car and to \u201clock in\u201d to a specific dealer offer via the system without having to make prior direct contact with a particular dealer.","An object of the present invention is to simplify and reduce the time required, for both the buyer and seller, in completing a vehicle sales transaction.","Another object of the present invention is to enable potential purchasers to quickly and easily ascertain dealer offers for the sale of cars in a particular geographic region of interest.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a car exchange system which enables a potential car purchaser to easily and quickly review all options, factory discounts and other information regarding specific car configurations of interest in combination with final pricing information for cars in a particular geographic region.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an exchange system which enables a potential car purchaser to ascertain the best price for a particular car and to \u201clock in\u201d to a specific dealer offer via the system without having to make prior direct contact with a particular dealer.","These and other objects and advantages are achieved by a car exchange system which includes, in one embodiment, a file server having a plurality of databases storing specific information related to cars offered for sale by dealers. The exchange system further includes a processor coupled to the databases and programmed to perform certain tasks in response to price inquiries, special requests, offers to sell, offers to buy and acceptance of such offers.","Specifically, the exchange system is coupled to a communications link, such as the telephone lines or the Internet. A potential car purchaser may access, from a remote site, the exchange system via the network, and submit requests to such system. In response to some requests, the system processor retrieves stored data from the respective databases, and causes such data to be transmitted to the remote site for display. The exchange system also executes certain functions in response to commands and data transmitted from dealer sites and institution sites, e.g., banks or other lenders. The system enables a potential purchaser to, for example, browse the offers in a particular geographic region for the particular car and options of interest and to lock-in to a particular offer to sell.","The system described above enables a potential car purchaser to easily and quickly review all final pricing information for a variety of cars and configurations in a particular geographic region. In addition, such system eliminates, if desired by the buyer, the negotiation process by enabling a potential car purchaser to \u201clock in\u201d a specific dealer offer via the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","22","24","22"]},"One embodiment of an exchange system  is illustrated in  as being coupled to network  via a multi-line communications control and router . System  includes, for example, a file server having a processor and memory storage. Such file servers are commercially available, such as the IBM RS-600 or HP-9000. Databases A\u2013B and  are illustrated as forming a part of system . Databases A\u2013B and  would, for example, be part of the memory storage of the file server.","Administration database A is utilized for storing data related to tasks executed by system . Configurations database B stores data related to specific car configurations which may be accessed, via network , from remote sites. Database  includes a price inquiries database A, an offer to buy and special request database B, an accepted offers database C and an offers to sell (\u201cprices\u201d) database D. A plurality of personal computers such as personal computers A and B are coupled to system  via a local area network (LAN) to enable access to system  without requiring access to network .","Buyer sites  and dealer sites  are shown as being coupled to branch B of network . Particularly, potential buyers, through personal computers and modems A and B, may access exchange system  via network . Similarly, dealers, through personal computers and modems A and B, may access exchange system  via network . Of course, the functions performed by system  for such buyers and dealers are different, as explained hereinafter in more detail.","Institution sites  are shown as being coupled to branch A of network . Such institutions may include lending institutions such as banks. Institutions may access exchange system  through modem , coupled to a file server  having a car buying service accounts database , and via personal computers A and B. Account information for car purchases made by buyers at buyer sites  via system  may be stored in database .","It should be understood, of course, that the architecture illustrated in  may vary depending upon the network utilized. Also, many additional buyer sites , dealer sites  and institution sites  may be coupled to system . Further, a geographic area such as a country, e.g., the United States of America, could be divided into regions with separate systems  serving such regions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["38","40","46","26","38","40","46","26","26","26","26","26","26","26"]},"With respect to buyer sites , at such sites, a potential buyer may, via personal computer and modem A\u2013B, enter commands to cause system  to execute routines to enable such buyer to review pricing, make offers, special requests and accept a dealer offer. At dealer sites , dealers may, via personal computer and modem A\u2013B, enter commands to cause system  to execute routines to enable such dealer to, by a mass upload to system  or by exception, maintain offers by base model and options in databases of system . In addition, dealers may respond to specific buyer acceptances and special requests communicated to dealer sites  from buyer sites  via system . The manner in which certain functions are executed by system  is described hereinafter in more detail.","At institution sites , institutions may provide pricing service for customers, such as providing, via system , information regarding loans. Such institutions may also maintain, in file server , information regarding individual accounts and offers.","Car configuration services  may provide data to system  related to particular car makes and models. In this manner, system  may compliment existing services which provide, on-line, car configuration information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["30","34","26","26","26"]},"Referring specifically to , in configurations database B, information regarding new cars is stored. Such information includes, for each designated car, make, model, style and options information. Such information typically provides a detailed description of each particular car. Note that although information regarding a particular car may be stored in configurations database B, a particular dealer may not have made a specific offer for that specific configuration. Therefore, data stored in configurations database B may not necessarily match information stored in offers to sell database D.","With respect to offers to sell database D, information such as an identification of the dealer making an offer, the dealer region, and pricing information by make\/model, style and options is stored. Such information identifies, by dealers having specific geographic selling locations, offers to sell certain cars.","In price inquiries database A, information related to potential buyer inquiries is stored. Such information includes an identification of each buyer, by identification number, who makes an inquiry to offers to sell database D, the buyer's geographic region, and the car make\/model, style and options which were the subject of the buyer inquiry.","Buyer offers and special request database B is utilized by system  for storing information related to offers made by buyers and special requests made by potential buyers, via system , to a dealer. For example, a buyer may request an updated price offer based on a unique selection of options. For each such buyer offer and special request, buyer and dealer identifications, geographic region, and make\/model, style and options information is stored in database B.","System  stores, in accepted offers database C and for each offer accepted via system , an identification of the buyer and dealer and an offer number, which is assigned to the accepted offer by system . Such information may be used, for example, for billing purposes.","With respect to administration database E, information related to dealer accounts, buyer accounts, and geographic locations for buyers and dealers is stored. Also, institution accounts, transactions logs, system billing, and accounts receivable information is stored in such database E.","As pointed out above, the specific architecture and structure of databases B and A\u2013E may, of course, vary and is not limited to the specific structure illustrated in . In addition, although databases B and A\u2013E are shown as being separate, such databases could be consolidated or distributed in many other configurations. Further, information in addition to the specific data described above could be stored in, and form a part of, such databases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","26","100","100"]},"Referring now particularly to , upon initialization  of system , functions performed by system  include maintaining dealer, buyer and institution accounts , maintaining new car configuration masters , and maintaining price offers by dealers by make, model, style and options . Such maintenance functions are described hereinafter in more detail and generally require maintaining current information in the various databases of system .","Exchange system  also validates price offers . For example, once a dealer at a dealer site  communicates a specific offer to sell a car, system , prior to loading such offer in database D, displays the information which is the subject of the offer to the dealer. If the information is correct, the dealer enters a command on computer A, for example, and system  then loads the validated information into database D.","System  also is configured to determine, upon receiving a buyer command, a low market price  for a selected specific configuration within a designated geographic region. Particularly, a potential buyer at a buyer site  may want to place a specific \u201coffer to buy\u201d or identify a specific desired car configuration and a particular geographic region in which such buyer would be willing to travel within to obtain a car. Such information is then loaded into computer A, for example, through a graphical user interface. Such information is then transmitted to system . Using such inputted information, offers to sell database D is scanned to identify matches for the selected car configuration offered for sale in the selected geographic region. The selling prices are then compared for such matches, and the lowest selling price is then caused to be displayed by system  at computer A. Exchange system  also enables, upon receipt of a buyer command, a buyer to review dealer price offers  for a variety of cars.","If a buyer desires to make an offer or a special request of a dealer, such requests may be made to a dealer  through system . Exchange system  also enables a buyer to review and update pricing inquiries , and if a buyer accepts a dealer offer via system , system  generates a buyer acceptance notification .","With respect to offers to buy and special requests , exchange system  communicates such offers and requests to the buyer designated dealer and enables such dealer to respond to the offer or request via system . If a dealer response to a special request is acceptable, the buyer may accept the dealer's offer and system  will generate acceptance notification . Exchange  also generates, for the dealer, a notification of offer acceptance . Of course, if a dealer accepts an offer to buy , exchange  generates a notification of the dealer acceptance.","Administration tasks performed by system  generate data to be stored in administration database  (). More specifically, and as shown in , system  monitors account activity and data , manages deposits and credits , maintains account billings and collections  and performs periodic backup and file storage operations . Data related to such activities is loaded in administration database A and may later be utilized, for example, to generate buyer and dealer billing for access and use of system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["150","152","26","152","38","42","22","154","156","22","26","26","158","160","30","26","162","42","164","26","166","42","166"]},"The menu displayed to a buyer, for example, is a graphical user interface which enables the buyer to select from various options such as shopping , offers , and account . Once the buyer has selected an option, system  responds to such selection. For example, if the buyer selects \u201cshopping\u201d , since this service is not executed by system , system  prompts the buyer to logoff system . On the other hand, if the buyer selects \u201coffers\u201d , then system  executes the sequence of process steps associated with reviewing dealer price offers .

System  then assigns the dealer an identification number and an SMSA region . System  also sets all account balances for the dealer to zero  and adds the dealer account  to administration database A. Once such an account is established, the dealer may update the dealer account master information  stored in administration database A.","If the dealer is not a new dealer , then system  will prompt the dealer and request entry of new or updated data . A dealer may update information in any and all fields for information stored by system  with respect to such dealer . Once such data has been entered, then system  updates the account master for the dealer  stored in administration database A. Once all such information has been entered and stored by system , all the updated account information is caused, by system , to be displayed at personal computer A, for example, to enable the dealer to review such information and to ensure its correctness .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["250","26","252","30","250","26","26"]},"Referring to process  in more detail, system  first reads\/uploads the latest source file configurations from configurations database B.
