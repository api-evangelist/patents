title: Scoped code fly-out editor for domain languages
abstract: A method for generating a model diagram includes registering a scoped domain editor extender with a domain model element, retrieving a domain model and sending the domain model to the registered scoped domain editor extender, generating a modeling language model and mapping the modeling language model to the domain model, retrieving a domain model element from the domain model, generating a modeling language model element and associating the modeling language model element with the domain model, generating a graphical diagram including a shape corresponding to the modeling language model element, generating a user input item and associate the user input item with the modeling language model element, and displaying the shape and the user input item to a user.

The diagram represents a domain language for example, Java, and typically includes code blocks that represent programming elements such as loops and if\/else statements; however the code blocks do not include details of the code represented by the blocks. It is useful for a user to have the ability to easily review specific code details represented by the blocks when analyzing a diagram.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method for generating a model diagram includes registering a scoped domain editor extender with a domain model element, retrieving a domain model and sending the domain model to the registered scoped domain editor extender, generating a modeling language model and mapping the modeling language model to the domain model, retrieving a domain model element from the domain model, generating a modeling language model element and associating the modeling language model element with the domain model, generating a graphical diagram including a shape corresponding to the modeling language model element, generating a user input item and associate the user input item with the modeling language model element, and displaying the shape and the user input item to a user.","According to another one embodiment of the present invention a method for generating a fly-out editor window includes receiving an input from a user selecting an input item, identifying and retrieving a modeling language model element associated with the selected input item, retrieving a domain model element associated with the modeling language model element from a domain model, determining whether a scoped editor is registered for the domain model element, sending the domain model and the domain model element to an extender responsive to determining that the scoped editor is registered for the domain model element, generating a scoped code editor and displaying text associated with the domain model element in a fly-out editor window to a user.","According to yet another one embodiment of the present invention, a system for generating a diagram including a processor operative to register a scoped domain editor extender with a domain model element, retrieve a domain model and sending the domain model to the registered scoped domain editor extender, generate a modeling language model and mapping the modeling language model to the domain model, retrieve a domain model element from the domain model, generate a modeling language model element and associating the modeling language model element with the domain model, generate a graphical diagram including a shape corresponding to the modeling language model element, generate a user input item and associate the user input item with the modeling language model element, and send the shape and the user input item to a display.","Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention. For a better understanding of the invention with the advantages and the features, refer to the description and to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["108","102","202","204","206","223","212","202","204","206","210","214","212","202","204","206","212","214","214","216","218","218","104","222","202","204","206","208","216","220","104"]},"The illustrated exemplary embodiments include the use of the UML as modeling language, however the use of UML in the exemplary embodiments is merely illustrative.

The user may select one or more elements (including elements with dissimilar source code domain types) in the presented diagram, which generates a fly-out editor corresponding to the selected element. The fly-out editor only displays source code associated with the selected element (scoped code) allowing the user to quickly and easily analyze and edit the source code for the element in the context of the entire domain model. If the user edits the scoped code, the edited code is returned to the associated domain model where the code is synchronized. The user may also save the edited code in an updated domain model.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention.
