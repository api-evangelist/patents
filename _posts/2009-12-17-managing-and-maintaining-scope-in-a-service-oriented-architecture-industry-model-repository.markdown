{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to meta models, and more specifically to managing and maintaining scope in a service oriented architecture industry model repository.","Enterprises are adopting a model-driven development (MDD) approach to architecting and designing both the business architecture and the supporting IT system and applications. In order to promote the best practices and interoperability between industry participants both product vendors and industry associations are aggressively developing and making available analysis and design frameworks or industry models to support the model-driven development approach. The frameworks are targeted towards vertical industries and tend to be very complex.","For successful adoption of the complex industry models, scoping capability for both strategic and tactical purposes is important. In enterprise wide projects, it is important to provide users project-level model views that match their roles and needs. For example, a project manager may want to clearly view the specific scope of requirement that belong to his\/her project while developers may want to view the specific elements of design-level models, such as services or data structures from which they will work, without being burdened with having to sift through the entire model to find those elements.","Typically industry associations are not concerned with specific tooling or usage methods and therefore do not provide any scoping aids. Any scoping that is provided is limited and based on explicit inputs and relationships and does not leverage any level of semantic technologies.","A method of managing and maintaining scope in a of service oriented architecture industry model repository is provided comprising defining boundaries and definitions of scope and scope propagation of topics, associations, and occurrences within the SOA IMR; managing boundaries and definitions of scope and scope propagation within the SOA IMR; and maintaining boundaries and definitions of scope and scope propagation within the SOA IMR.","The method may further comprise creating a new meta model topic, association, or occurrence and topic, association, or occurrence name for the requirement model; creating a scope topic, association, or occurrence to identify that the new meta model topic, association, or occurrence is in the scope of the meta model; adding the scope topic, association, or occurrence to the topic, association, or occurrence name of the new meta model topic; creating resource description framework triples of the new meta model topic, association, or occurrence; and creating scope dependent uniform resource identifiers from the topic, association, or occurrence name for uniquely identifying the resource description framework triples created.","The scoping may be, but is not limited to inheritance scoping, industry vertical scoping, business scoping, and project scoping.","With reference now to the figures, and in particular, with reference to , exemplary diagrams of data processing environments are provided in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. It should be appreciated that  are only exemplary and are not intended to assert or imply any limitation with regard to the environments in which different embodiments may be implemented. Many modifications to the depicted environments may be made.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","2","1","2"]},"In the depicted example, server  and server  connect to network  along with storage unit . In addition, clients , , and  connect to network . Clients , , and  may be, for example, personal computers or network computers. In the depicted example, server  provides information, such as boot files, operating system images, and applications to clients , , and . Clients , , and  are clients to server  in this example. Network data processing system  may include additional servers, clients, and other devices not shown.","Program code located in network data processing system  may be stored on a computer recordable storage medium and downloaded to a data processing system or other device for use. For example, program code may be stored on a computer recordable storage medium on server  and downloaded to client  over network  for use on client .","In the depicted example, network data processing system  is the Internet with network  representing a worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) suite of protocols to communicate with one another. At the heart of the Internet is a backbone of high-speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers, consisting of thousands of commercial, governmental, educational and other computer systems that route data and messages. Of course, network data processing system  also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks, such as, for example, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), or a wide area network (WAN).  is intended as an example, and not as an architectural limitation, for the different illustrative embodiments.","With reference now to , a block diagram of a data processing system is shown in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Data processing system  is an example of a computer, such as server  or client  in , in which computer usable program code or instructions implementing the processes may be located for the illustrative embodiments. In this illustrative example, data processing system  includes communications fabric , which provides communications between processor unit , memory , persistent storage , communications unit , input\/output (I\/O) unit , and display .","Processor unit  serves to execute instructions for software that may be loaded into memory . Processor unit  may be a set of one or more processors, or may be a multi-processor core, depending on the particular implementation. Further, processor unit  may be implemented using one or more heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example, processor unit  may be a symmetric multi-processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.","Memory  and persistent storage  are examples of storage devices . A storage device is any piece of hardware that is capable of storing information, such as, for example, without limitation, data, program code in functional form, and\/or other suitable information either on a temporary basis and\/or a permanent basis. Memory , in these examples, may be, for example, a random access memory or any other suitable volatile or non-volatile storage device. Persistent storage  may take various forms depending on the particular implementation. For example, persistent storage  may contain one or more components or devices. For example, persistent storage  may be a hard drive, a flash memory, a rewritable optical disk, a rewritable magnetic tape, or some combination of the above. The media used by persistent storage  also may be removable. For example, a removable hard drive may be used for persistent storage .","Communications unit , in these examples, provides for communications with other data processing systems or devices. In these examples, communications unit  is a network interface card. Communications unit  may provide communications through the use of either or both physical and wireless communication links.","Input\/output unit  allows for input and output of data with other devices that may be connected to data processing system . For example, input\/output unit  may provide a connection for user input through a keyboard, a mouse, and\/or some other suitable input device. Further, input\/output unit  may send output to a printer. Display  provides a mechanism to display information to a user.","Instructions for the operating system, applications, and\/or programs may be located in storage devices , which are in communication with processor unit  through communications fabric . In these illustrative examples the instructions are in a functional form on persistent storage . These instructions may be loaded into memory  for running by processor unit . The processes of the different embodiments may be performed by processor unit  using computer implemented instructions, which may be located in a memory, such as memory .","These instructions are referred to as program code, computer usable program code, or computer readable program code, that may be read and run by a processor in processor unit . The program code in the different embodiments may be embodied on different physical or tangible computer readable media, such as memory  or persistent storage .","Program code  is located in a functional form on computer readable media  that is selectively removable and may be loaded onto or transferred to data processing system  for running by processor unit . Program code  and computer readable media  form computer program product  in these examples. In one example, computer readable media  may be in a tangible form, such as, for example, an optical or magnetic disc that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of persistent storage  for transfer onto a storage device, such as a hard drive that is part of persistent storage . In a tangible form, computer readable media  also may take the form of a persistent storage, such as a hard drive, a thumb drive, or a flash memory that is connected to data processing system . The tangible form of computer readable media  is also referred to as computer recordable storage media. In some instances, computer readable media  may not be removable.","Alternatively, program code  may be transferred to data processing system  from computer readable media  through a communications link to communications unit  and\/or through a connection to input\/output unit . The communications link and\/or the connection may be physical or wireless in the illustrative examples. The computer readable media also may take the form of non-tangible media, such as communication links or wireless transmissions containing the program code.","In some illustrative embodiments, program code  may be downloaded over a network to persistent storage  from another device or data processing system for use within data processing system . For instance, program code stored in a computer readable storage medium in a server data processing system may be downloaded over a network from the server to data processing system . The data processing system providing program code  may be a server computer, a client computer, or some other device capable of storing and transmitting program code .","The different components illustrated for data processing system  are not meant to provide architectural limitations to the manner in which different embodiments may be implemented. The different illustrative embodiments may be implemented in a data processing system including components in addition to, or in place of, those illustrated for data processing system . Other components shown in  can be varied from the illustrative examples shown. The different embodiments may be implemented using any hardware device or system capable of executing program code. As one example, the data processing system may include organic components integrated with inorganic components and\/or may be comprised entirely of organic components excluding a human being. For example, a storage device may be comprised of an organic semiconductor.","As another example, a storage device in data processing system  is any hardware apparatus that may store data. Memory , persistent storage  and computer readable media  are examples of storage devices in a tangible form.","In another example, a bus system may be used to implement communications fabric  and may be comprised of one or more buses, such as a system bus or an input\/output bus. Of course, the bus system may be implemented using any suitable type of architecture that provides for a transfer of data between different components or devices attached to the bus system. Additionally, a communications unit may include one or more devices used to transmit and receive data, such as a modem or a network adapter. Further, a memory may be, for example, memory  or a cache such as found in an interface and memory controller hub that may be present in communications fabric .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","1","102","102","104","105","102","105"]},"The IMR architecture system  includes federated physical model assets  that are stored in different types of repositories depending on the model driven framework tools and products that are being deployed by the system. The federated physical assets may include framework, industry models, business models, UML design applications, data models, business services, service components, and technical services. The federated physical assets are not limited to the assets shown in .","Applications and services  are provided to IMR users  through the network  using interfaces . The interfaces used by the IMR users  includes reports generation and tools supporting multi-formats and visualization tools supporting complex views. The applications and services  may include registration and profile management; creating and customizing repository meta model, importing customized and disparate model\/data into the depository, examining\/decomposing complex diagrams and structures, structure, link, and trace change disparate model\/assets; advanced search and query, navigate\/browse data assets; select and download model\/assets, customize\/add models\/assets submit for repository upload; and impact analysis.

These applications are hereby incorporated by reference. The interfaces  are further described in greater detail in an application entitled, \u201cSERVICE ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE INDUSTRY MODEL REPOSITORY META-MODEL WITH A STANDARD BASED INDEX\u201d filed concurrently with the present application and hereby incorporated by reference.","The IMR users  may include but are not limited to repository administrator, model manager, system architect, and business analyst.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["102","102","202","202","206","208","210","210","204","212","214","216"]},"The internal meta model service  of the SOA IMR component  is the SOA IMR meta-model service using ISO Standard topic map meta models . Topic maps map both web and real-world information resources, by reifying real-world resources as \u201csubjects\u201d, and creating \u201ctopic\u201d constructs to capture their characteristics and relationships with other topics and subjects. By using the topic maps meta models , , and  as the repository internal meta model, a common meta model service interface  allows users to programmatically access, manage, and maintain these meta models.","The SOA IMR meta model service  maps or implements the ISO topic map meta models  to a web ontology language (OWL) representation of the topic map. The industry model repository (IMR) provides the context for the implementation of the ISO topic map meta models  to the OWL representation of the topic maps. The OWL representation of the topic map is stored in a resource description framework (RDF) semantic web repository . Scoping of the industry vertical or the topic map meta model  of the OWL representation of the topic map may occur.","In one embodiment of the present invention extends the service definition for the SOA IMR meta model service component with new fields and services for defining and managing multi-definitions of scope and scope propagation within the model constructs managed by the meta-model scoping service. The meta-model scoping service described below in detail, supports the industry model usage needs and is capable of defining scope and boundaries in the repository topic map meta model  and scope propagation through the captured relationships between multiple types of models.","In one embodiment of the present invention manages and maintains scope across boundaries in the industry model repository and can differentiate between different meta-models and artifacts. The scoping may be industry vertical scoping, inheritance scoping, business scoping and project scoping.","Industry vertical scoping identifies scope of Insurance versus Telco within topics (e.g. requirements, model assets), occurrences (e.g. web page or a URL to a RAS asset repository), and associations. In other words, distinguishing the differences in scope between the vertical industries.","Inheritance scoping identifies and scopes topics, occurrences and associations based on artifact inheritance relationships. For example, in Telco topics, identifying security identifier (SID) original artifacts versus a security identifier derived customized artifact.","Business scoping identifies and scopes topics, occurrences and associations based on business function areas, for example marketing versus procurement business scope.","Project scoping identifies and scopes topics, occurrences and associations based on project parameters or requirements.","The scoping may be queried directly from an artifact's explicit or implicit mapping. Explicit mappings occur when associations are created and stored in the industry model repository (IMR) Implicit mapping occur when the associations are derived based on inferences.","The scoping is not limited to the scoping listed above and may include other types of scoping as applicable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"300"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"],"b":["420","422","424","428","430","432","426","424","432","428","430"]},"New scope dependent topics may be created on the client side using a programming language such as Java\u2122, a programming language from Sun MicroSystems Inc. For example, a new meta\u2014model topic may be created for the requirements models. The user then creates a scope topic to identify that this topic is in the scope of the meta-model. Then the scope is added to the topic name. A similar approach may be used to create scope dependent associations and occurrences of topics as well.","The topic is created with the appropriate scope by persisting the new topic as a RDF triple. With the scope information defined for the requirement model and the RDF triples, scope dependent uniform resource identifier's (URI's) for uniquely identifying the triples are created. The scope information defined for the requirement model, the RDF triples, and the topic map constructs can also provide namespace data. If a topic cannot be created with a meaningful scope dependent URI, multiple scopes may be necessary and each scope would be added onto the based URI. A similar approach may be used to create scope dependent URI's for associations and occurrences of topics as well.","By using the ISO Standard of topic maps as the meta-meta model, the capability of automated index building is present. All of the topics are represented by index elements and these index elements can be limited by scope. The associations show which other topics a specific topic is related to and the occurrences show where physical assets relating to these topics may be found.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention.
