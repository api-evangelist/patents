{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/039,585, filed Mar. 3, 2011, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,106,084, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/363,168, filed Jan. 30, 2009, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,947,723, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/025,462, filed Feb. 1, 2008, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","This invention was made with government support under Grant Award No. 5P20MD000215-070002, awarded by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The invention is related to compounds, compositions, and methods that involve anti-proliferative and anti-neoplastic activity in cancer cells.","It is estimated that 10.1 million Americans have a medical history that involves cancer, and it is expected that another 1.4 million new cases will develop in the next year. Cancer is the second leading cause of death among Americans, with prostate cancer being the leading form found in men. Unfortunately, the statistics surrounding the disease are complicated by disparities relating to race and sex and by declining relative survival rates. For general information, see: American Cancer Society, 2008, Atlanta: American Cancer Society, 2008.","Prostate cancer, which is being increasingly diagnosed in younger-aged men, often metastasizes to other places in the body and therefore is difficult to regulate. Studies have shown that the cellular survival pathways present in the cancerous tissues of the prostate, and where it spreads in the body, are resistant to the normal apoptosis processes that constitute a principal type of programmed cell death (PCD) in a complex organism. Thus, cancerous cells are able to avoid apoptosis and replicate in an unregulated manner, causing malignant tumors to form. Some causes for the rapid cell growth in the prostates of men are due to age and the presence of mutated genes that encode proteins for cell division. See: Kleinsmith, L. J., , Pearson Benjamin Cummings (2006). Further, studies of the genetic make up of African American males diagnosed with prostate cancer have associated an over-expression of the gene Bcl-2 that prevents apoptosis with the cancer. Moreover, Bcl-2 has also been linked to other fatal cancers like breast cancer and leukemia in children.","Celecoxib, an FDA-approved drug, is known to induce apoptosis by inhibiting the PDK1\/Akt interaction in a process independent of its cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity. Its PDK1 activity has been directly linked to its ability to inhibit cell growth in prostate cancer cells. Exploiting the activity of celecoxib, Zhu et al. developed a library of molecules which included the efficacious compound known as OSU-03013. This celecoxib derivative diminished cell proliferation by inhibiting PDK1 in PC-3 cells in micromolar concentrations thirty-fold lower than that of celecoxib. The versatility of OSU-03013 in treating a number of tumors, and its ability in overcoming the chemotherapeutic resistance of some drugs have been noted.","While the activity of these compounds has been attributed to their binding to the catalytic domain of PDK1 and the subsequent inhibition of Akt activation, the mechanism of action has not been fully identified. Further, the ability of celecoxib to inhibit cell proliferation has been attributed to mechanisms associated with the reduction of inflammations and the inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme. See: Cui, W. et al., -(2008), 19(9), 891-897; Szabo, I. et al., . (Paris), 2001, 95, 379-383; Yoshinaka, R. et al., (2006), 26(6B), 4245-4254; and Mukherjee, P. et al., (2008), Volume Date 2009, 182(1), 216-224. In comparison to other, more potent COX-2 inhibitors, celecoxib displayed a superior potency in inducing apoptosis in comparison to other COX-2 inhibitors. See: Kazanov, D. et al., 2004, 10, 267-271; and Srinath, P. et al., 2003, 23, 3923-3928. The compound's ability to induce apoptosis by various routes adds to its appeal as a chemotherapeutic agent and a lead molecule. Analogs of celecoxib could potentially be active against malignant growth and be useful as a Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID) with enhanced oral activity and superior safety to that of celecoxib. Such a molecule would vastly improve the treatments for cancer and inflammation based diseases.","Thus, new compounds are needed that might function in a fashion similar to celecoxib and possibly help identify the structural and electronic features of a molecule that give rise to such activity. In addition, new compounds are needed that might exhibit anti-proliferative or anti-neoplastic activity, regardless of the specific mechanism by which such activity might arise. Therapeutically effective agents, particularly those that are effective in humans and other mammals, are needed to treat such diseases, to increase the survivability of the patient, inhibit the rapidly-proliferating cell growth associated with the neoplasm, and\/or effect a regression of the neoplasm.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a series of compounds that exhibit anti-proliferative activity, including activity against human prostate cancer cells. Therefore, methods for treating and\/or preventing a neoplasia are provided herein. The compounds disclosed herein include substituted benzimidazole, purines, imidazopyridine, and imidazopyrizine species, which are shown to inhibit cell proliferation in PC-3 cells. This invention also provides methods of making the inventive compounds, and methods of treating and\/or preventing cancer using the inventive compounds.","As used herein, the term \u201ctreatment\u201d is non-limiting and includes the partial or total inhibition of the neoplasia growth, spreading, or metastasis, or partial or total destruction of the neoplasia cells. The term \u201cprevention,\u201d as used herein, is also non-limiting, and includes either preventing the onset of clinically evident neoplasia altogether, or preventing the onset of a preclinically evident stage of neoplasia in individuals at risk. The prevention of initiation for malignant cells or arresting or reversing the progression of premalignant cells to malignant cells are also intended to be encompassed by this definition. Therefore, prevention includes the prophylactic treatment of those at risk of developing the neoplasia. Also as used herein, the phrase \u201ctherapeutically-effective,\u201d as in describing a therapeutically-effective amount of a drug or dosage form, is intended to qualify an amount of an agent that will achieve the goal of improvement in disease severity or the frequency of incidence. Typically, the phrase therapeutically-effective involves the minimization or, if possible, the avoidance of adverse side effects associated with many therapies. The term \u201cneoplasia\u201d is intended to be non-limiting, and includes any abnormal new growth, or tumor, which may be benign or malignant. Thus, neoplasia includes, but is not limited to, neoplasia that produce prostaglandins or express a cyclooxygenase, including benign and cancerous tumors, growths, and polyps.","In one aspect, this invention provides a compound having the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"19.47mm","wi":"60.03mm","file":"US08329728-20121211-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"wherein"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"21.34mm","wi":"16.59mm","file":"US08329728-20121211-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"\u2003is selected from:"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"68.92mm","wi":"73.15mm","file":"US08329728-20121211-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":"wherein G is selected from"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0018"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"91.61mm","wi":"73.15mm","file":"US08329728-20121211-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":"\u2003wherein Z is selected from CH, NH, O, or S;"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0020"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"11.51mm","wi":"32.85mm","file":"US08329728-20121211-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":"\u2003wherein Q is selected from CH, NH, O, or S;"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0022"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"25.65mm","wi":"21.17mm","file":"US08329728-20121211-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":"\u2003wherein n is 0, 1, 2, or 3;

PDK1 is over-expressed in a number of tumor cells and the inhibition of PDK1 kinase has been linked to the induction of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and decreased proliferation in the PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line. Therefore, due to its role in cancer and the regulation of cell cycle, PDK1 is an excellent target for development of chemotherapeutic agents for prostate cancer. While not intending to be bound by theory, one aspect of this invention includes the evaluation of the three-dimensional steric and electronic features of the potential binding interactions of proposed or test molecules, for example, when docked in the ATP binding pocket of PDK1. Again, while not bound by theory, useful pharmacophores that are disclosed herein may have some of the following properties: large hydrophobic substituents, which in various aspects may include aromatic or cycloaliphatic substituents; at least one hydrogen bonding substituent; a heteroaromatic central ring; and small hydrophobic substituents In one aspect, for example, in characterizing the structure-activity of celecoxib analogs or derivatives, it was found that useful compounds contained aromatic hydrophobic groups. Again, while not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that a so-called \u201cfuzzy\u201d pharmacophore, which roughly describes very delocalized potential pi-pi (\u03c0-\u03c0) interactions involving the protein and an aromatic group, may be useful. For example, such an interaction in which a phenanthrene group of a celecoxib analog is docked in the aromatic rich ATP binding pocket of PDK1 appears to afford stable conformations.","In a further aspect, useful pharmacophores of this invention that have the ability to inhibit PDK1 kinase activity and proliferation in PC-3 cells can have particular relationships between their electronic and size and\/or shape features their. In this aspect, for example, useful pharmacophores can have size to lipophilicity ratios, calculated by the ratio of molar volume (in cm\/mol) to lipophilicity (as cLogP) ratios in the range from about 50 to about 90.

The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition wherein, for example, saline, dextrose or water may be used as a suitable carrier.","For intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal administration, a compound of this invention may be combined with a sterile aqueous solution that can be isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Such formulations may be prepared, for example, by dissolving or suspending a solid active ingredient, which can be a neutral compound or a salt, in water containing physiologically compatible substances such as sodium chloride, glycine, and the like. Such a solution or suspension could have a buffered pH compatible with physiological conditions to produce an aqueous solution or suspension that could be rendered sterile. The formulations may be present in unit or multi-dose containers such as sealed ampoules or vials.","If the neoplasia is localized in the G.I. tract, the compound may be formulated with acid-stable, base-labile coatings known to one of skill in the art which begin to dissolve in the high pH small intestine.

For example, aerosol delivery compositions could be prepared by formulating the compounds with known aerosol excipients, such as saline, and administered the formulation using commercially available nebulizers. Formulation in a fatty acid source may be used to enhance biocompatibility. For example, aerosol delivery is a typical method of delivery for epithelial neoplasias of the lung for prevention application.","For rectal administration, the active ingredient may be formulated into suppositories using bases which are solid at room temperature and melt or dissolve at body temperature. For example, commonly used bases include cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oil, polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights, and fatty esters of polyethylene stearate.","The dosage form and amount can be readily established by reference to known neoplasia treatments or prophylactic regiments. For example, the amount of therapeutically active compound that is administered and the dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and\/or compositions of this invention depends on a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex and medical condition of the subject, the severity of the disease, the route and frequency of administration, and the particular compound employed. The amount and dosage regimen of therapeutically active compound also can depend on the location of the neoplasia, as well as the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual treated, and thus may vary widely. Such dosage generally will be lower if the compounds are administered locally rather than systemically, and for prevention rather than for treatment. Such treatments may be administered as often as necessary and for the period of time judged necessary by the treating physician.","One of skill in the art will appreciate that the dosage regime or therapeutically effective amount of the inhibitor to be administrated may need to be optimized for each individual. The pharmaceutical compositions may contain active ingredient in the range of, for example, from about 0.1 to about 2000 mg, or in the range from about 0.5 to about 500 mg, or from about 1 to about 200 mg, though these amounts are not considered limiting. A daily dose from about 0.01 to about 100 mg\/kg body weight is typical, which also can be from about 0.1 to about 50 mg\/kg body weight, or from about 1 to about 30 mg\/kg, which may be appropriate.

A fuzzy pharmacophore was generated of OSU\/Celecoxib analogs using the Pymol and the Liquid software plug-ins. See: DeLano, W. L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (2002) DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, Calif., USA (www.pymol.org); Tanrikulu, Y.; Proschak, E.; Schneider G. LIQUID: Fuzzy Pharmacophore Models Based on Trivariate Gaussian Distributions, 2006, in preparation. The analysis of the inventive molecules was carried out by structural alignment, which was accomplished using the flexible alignment tool of MOE with default settings and the MMFF94. The molecules were docked in the crystal structure of PDK-1 in complex with ATP (PDB code 1H1W) using the GOLD software. See: a) Nissink, J.; Murray, C.; Hartshorn, M.; Verdonk, M.; Cole, J.; Taylor, R. A new test set for validating predictions of protein-ligand interaction. 2002, 49, 457-471; and b) GOLD-Protein-Ligand Docking www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk\/products\/life_sciences\/gold\/. The fuzzy pharmacophore was then generated for the docked structures with the highest GOLD score.","Overlays. The inventive molecules were further analyzed using overlays. Thus, the B3LYP hybrid functional with a double-zeta valence-polarization DFT basis set was used to perform DFT geometry optimizations on a 32-processor Xeon cluster using the NWChem computational chemistry program for parallel computers. See: 5.0 (2006), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Wash. 99352-0999, USA; www.emsl.pnl.gov\/docs\/nwchem-\/nwchem.html. The benzimidazole and OSU structures were superimposed using the \u2018superpose\u2019 function in Tinker and seen to substantially coincide. Jay Ponder. Tinker Molecular Modeling Package, version 4.2. dasher.wustl.edu\/tinker\/.","Docking The docking was accomplished using the crystal structure of PDK-1 complexed with ATP (PDB code 1H1W) subjected to the deletion of heteroatoms (phosphoserine, glycerol and sulfate ions), and the addition of polar hydrogens. Missing atoms were added to Gln73, Arg75, Arg238, Glu303, Lys304, Glu348, Lys357, and the missing residues Glu233, Ser234, Lys235 and Gln236 were added using DS Visualizer v1.6 and the Extensible Computational Chemistry Environment.

The Gasteiger partial atomic charges and the gas-phase minimum energy structure were computed with MOE using the MM94x force field and default parameters. See: (); www.chemcomp.com\/. MOE was used to designate the rotable bonds in the ligand and predict its bound conformations in the binding cavity. The docked protein-ligand structures with the most favorable hydrogen bonding to Ser160\/Ala162, Glu209, Asp223 were then placed in a cubic solvent box and energy minimized in the same manner as the ATP-bound structure.","Calculation of Binding Energies. Binding affinities were calculated using the MM94x force field implemented in MOE by taking the difference between the energy of the bound system and the isolated protein and ligand using the optimized protein-ligand complexes described above. In all cases, the binding energies indicate favorable ligand binding.","Calculation of Lipophilicity and Molar Volume. The lipophilicities and molar volumes reported in Table 1 were calculated for the energy minimized structure contained in the database using the QuaSAR module in the MOE software.","Compounds 206-208 of Table 1 were analyzed for their ability to inhibit cell proliferation in human prostate cancer cells, the results of which are illustrated in . Compound 206 was slightly more effective at diminishing proliferation in PC-3 cells than its pyrazole counterpart celecoxib (201). Comparative test compounds 203-205 demonstrate an inhibition similar to that of the OSU compounds. See: Ripple M. O. et al., 1997, 89, 40-48. Modest levels of kinase inhibition was observed for IKK\u03b2 and CK2. However, there was a significance reduction in activity for CDK1\/cyclinB, GSK3\u03b2, and p70S6K in the presence of the benzimidazole compounds as illustrated in Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0269","num":"0325"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"441pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Kinase Inhibition of Various Benzimidazole Compounds"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"406pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"% Activity"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u2002 \u2002 \u2002 \u2002 \u2002 \u2002 \u2002 \u2002 \u2002 \u2002 \u2002 \u2002 \u2002 Kinase",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00162","num":"00162"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00162","he":"39.71mm","wi":"33.53mm","file":"US08329728-20121211-C00162.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00163","num":"00163"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00163","he":"39.79mm","wi":"33.78mm","file":"US08329728-20121211-C00163.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00164","num":"00164"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00164","he":"39.88mm","wi":"34.12mm","file":"US08329728-20121211-C00164.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00165","num":"00165"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00165","he":"40.30mm","wi":"33.44mm","file":"US08329728-20121211-C00165.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["CDK1\/","36","16","\u20027","11"]},{"entry":["cyclinB(h)",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["CK2(h)","22","99","92","99"]},{"entry":["GSK3\u03b2(h)","\u20025","\u20027","72","13"]},{"entry":["IKK\u03b2(h)","25","72","86","71"]},{"entry":["p70S6K(h)","12","18","33","17"]},{"entry":["PDK1(h)","30","Not tested","Not tested","Not tested"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Cell Culture and Drug Treatment. PC-3 human prostate cancer cells were seeded in duplicate 96 well tissue culture plates at 500 cells\/well in 80-\u03bcL Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and nonessential amino acids and 1% equimolar mixture of streptomycin-penicillin. The flasks were incubated in a humidified 95% air\/5% COatmosphere. The cells were grown for at least 24 hours to ensure that they were in the early log phase of growth. Cells were then treated with 20-\u03bcL drug solutions (stock 10 mM drug solution in DMSO was diluted in DMEM containing 5% FBS such that final DMSO concentration is less than 1%) of appropriate final concentration by serial dilution. Untreated control cells received 20-\u03bcL DMEM containing 5% FBS. Six wells of each plate received the same drug concentration. Thus, each data point and error bars are an average and standard deviation of readings from 12 wells treated with identical drug concentration.","DNA Assay. After appropriate time of incubation, DNA assay was performed. For DNA assay, each culture plate was washed with 25% PBS and incubated in deionized double distilled water for at least one hour at room temperature. Plates were frozen at \u221270\u00b0 C. and thawed\/equilibrated to room temperature. Hoechst 33258 DNA binding dye was then added to each well in 200-\u03bcL of high salt TNE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl [pH 7.4]) at a final concentration of 6,7-\u03bcg\/mL. After further incubation at room temperature for 2 hours under protection from light, culture plates were scanned on the CytoFluor 2350\u2122 scanner using the 360\/460 nm filter excitation and emission set. Readings from all plates were normalized to the fluorescence of control untreated cells and all data were expressed as the percent control.","Kinase Assays. Kinase assays were conducted by Millipore's KinaseProfiler Service to determine the amount of ATP phosphorylation that occurs in the presence of a benzimidazole molecule. Kinases assayed included IKK\u03b2, CK2, CDK1\/cyclinB, GSK3\u03b2, and p70S6K. The desired kinase was treated with the benzimidazole compound The reaction were initiated by the addition of the MgATP mix. After incubation for 40 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by the addition of 3% phosphoric acid solution. 10 \u03bcL of the reaction was then spotted onto a P30 filtermat and washed three times for 5 minutes in 75 mM phosphoric acid and once in methanol prior to drying and scintillation counting. The kinase activity was measured radiometrically to determine the amount of ATP phosphorylation produced.
