title: Method and apparatus for dynamically controlling release of private information over a network from a wireless device
abstract: A proxy gateway is coupled to one or more wireless hand-held devices over a wireless network and to one or more origin servers over a wired network. The proxy gateway proxies requests and responses between the wireless devices and the origin servers. The proxy gateway determines when private information associated with a wireless device is needed or requested by another network entity, such as an origin server. In response to such determination, the proxy gateway communicates with the wireless device to enable the wireless device to present a user interface which allows a user of the wireless device to dynamically control release of the private information.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of Provisional U.S. patent application No. 60\/264,210, filed on Jan. 25, 2001, entitled, \u201cPrivacy Negotiation Model\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention pertains to techniques for controlling the release of private information over a network. More particularly, the present invention relates to controlling the release of private information over a network from a wireless, hand-held device.","Present technology allows users of hand-held, wireless devices to access to applications on the Internet. Some of those applications need to access information about wireless devices which may be considered private. Two types of information which may be considered private are information on whether a wireless device is currently turned on (\u201cpresence\u201d information) and information about the geographic location of a wireless device (\u201clocation\u201d information). For example, a network application might need to know the location of a wireless device in order to provide the device with real-time traffic or weather updates relevant to the user's location. Other examples of private information are serial numbers and telephone numbers of wireless devices.","Wireless devices commonly access the Internet through a gateway which links the wireless network to the Internet. The gateway or a separate server system may act as a proxy server, which proxies requests from the wireless devices to applications on the Internet. In some cases, when private information is needed by a network application in order to process a request from a wireless device, the proxy server adds the private information to the request before sending the request to the network application.","The proxy server is typically operated by the wireless carrier. However, the wireless carrier generally cannot release private information to network applications without prior authorization from the subscriber. Today, the subscriber's authorization to release private information is normally acquired in a paper agreement or click-through agreement. These types of privacy agreement can be cumbersome to manage and normally must be in place before a subscriber attempts to access applications which require private data. Further, there is no way for the subscriber to give permission to release private data on a per request basis. In addition, the carrier generally must inform the subscriber about every modification to the agreement manually, and the user must agree to this before the modifications can take effect.","The present invention includes a method and apparatus for dynamically controlling the release of information on a network. The method includes determining that protected information associated with a hand-held wireless communication device is needed or requested by a remote network entity, and in response, enabling a user of the hand-held wireless communication device to dynamically control release of the protected information.","Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.","A method and apparatus for controlling the release of private information over a network from a wireless, hand-held device are described. Note that in this description, references to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d mean that the feature being referred to is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Further, separate references to \u201cone embodiment\u201d in this description do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment; however, neither are such embodiments mutually exclusive, unless so stated and except as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, the present invention can include any variety of combinations and\/or integrations of the embodiments described herein.","The techniques described herein relate to controlling the release of information often considered by users to be \u201cprivate\u201d, such as location or presence information, subscriber numbers, etc. Note, however, that the described techniques can be applied to controlling the release of essentially any type of information. That is, the described technique can be used to dynamically negotiate essentially any parameter with a user. Hence, information which is controlled using the techniques described herein is referred to generally in this specification as \u201cprotected\u201d information, which may be (but does not have to be) private information.","The present invention allows a user's authorization to release private information to be obtained dynamically, e.g., in response to a request. This allows authorization to be given (or denied) on a per request basis and reduces the need for cumbersome paper or click through privacy agreements. In addition, the technique can be implemented over a standard network communication protocol, such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).","As described in greater detail below, in one embodiment a processing system is coupled to one or more wireless hand-held communication devices (hereinafter \u201cwireless devices\u201d) over a wireless network and to one or more origin servers over a wired network. The processing system may be a proxy gateway, which proxies requests and responses between the wireless devices and the origin servers. The processing system determines when protected (e.g., private) information associated with a wireless device, such as location or presence information, is needed or requested by another network entity, such as an origin server. Upon making such a determination, the proxy gateway initiates an exchange of information with the wireless device to dynamically determine whether release of the protected information is authorized by the user of the wireless device. In one embodiment, the wireless device presents a user interface which allows the user to dynamically authorize or prohibit release of the protected information. The user may grant or deny permission to release the information for only the current interaction or for all future interactions with the network entity. The protected information is then only released to the extent authorized by the user. In one embodiment, this dynamic determination of user permission to release protected information is accomplished over standard HTTP. In other embodiments, other standards may be used.","In this description, various acts are described as being performed by a proxy gateway in connection with establishing a privacy agreement with a user (in addition to standard proxy or gateway functions). Note, however, that a proxy gateway is only one example of a platform in which the described acts can be carried out. The acts related to establishing a privacy agreement do not have to be performed by a device that acts as a proxy or as a gateway. They may instead be performed in a processing system that is separate from any proxy or gateway, which may be a processing system dedicated to performing such acts, or a processing system which performs the described acts in addition to having other purposes. Nonetheless, typically, those acts will be performed by a processing system controlled by a wireless carrier (i.e., the operator of the wireless network ), although that also is not necessarily so.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","1","2","1","2","3","4","3","4","1","5","1","5","3","4","5"]},"At least some of the origin servers  may be conventional web servers on the World Wide Web. Accordingly, origin servers  provide content to the wireless devices  in response to standard (e.g., WAP or HTTP) requests from the wireless devices . In some cases, origin servers  may (or alternatively) \u201cpush\u201d content to the mobile devices , i.e., send content to the mobile devices  without the content having been requested by the mobile devices . Content provided to the wireless devices  by the origin servers  may include, for example, hypermedia documents, email, short messages, real-time updates of traffic, stock quotes or weather, and the like.","In one embodiment, the wireless devices  do not support the same protocols or languages used by the origin servers . For example, the wireless devices  might support only wireless markup language (WML) and wireless access protocol (WAP), while the origin servers  use only hypertext markup language (HTML) or extensible mark-up language (XML) and HTTP. In that case, the gateway feature of proxy gateway  converts\/translates between the languages and protocols used by processing systems  and the languages and protocols used by the mobile devices  to allow these entities to communicate with each other. In other embodiments, some or all of the wireless devices  might directly support the protocol (or language) used by the origin servers , such as HTTP. In such embodiments, at least some of the translation\/conversion operations would not be needed for those devices.","To facilitate explanation, it is henceforth assumed in this description that the wireless devices  and the origin servers  all support HTTP. It will be recognized, however, that the techniques described herein can be easily adapted to network environments in which that is not the case.","Proxy gateway  also operates as a proxy for transmitting various requests and responses on behalf of the mobile devices  and the processing devices , as described further below. Note that while proxy gateway  is shown as a single network entity, the proxy and gateway functions can be distributed between two or more physical platforms. Furthermore, both functions do not necessarily have to be used in a given network environment, as noted above.","Origin servers  may require private information relating the wireless devices , such as information of the types mentioned above. The information may be needed by the origin servers  in order to process requests from the wireless devices  or in order to push information to the wireless devices . Accordingly, another responsibility of the proxy gateway  is to determine when private information associated with one of the wireless devices  is needed or requested by another network entity, such as an origin server . In response to making such a determination, the proxy gateway  transmits information to the subject wireless device , to cause a browser in the wireless device  (sometimes called a \u201cminibrowser\u201d or \u201cmicrobrowser\u201d) to generate a predetermined graphical user interface (GUI) mode. The predetermined GUI mode allows the user to dynamically provide or deny permission to release the private information. By \u201cdynamically\u201d, what is meant is that the user is prompted to provide or deny permission in response to a contemporaneous determination (by proxy gateway , for example) that private information associated with the user is needed or requested.","The predetermined GUI mode is henceforth referred to as the \u201cprivacy negotiation GUI\u201d to facilitate description. Note, however, that the process is not necessarily a \u201cnegotiation\u201d in a strict sense. The information transmitted by the proxy server  to the wireless device  may be, for example, mark-up language code (e.g., a WML deck) for use by the wireless device to generate the privacy negotiation GUI. Alternatively, the mark-up language code for generating the privacy negotiation GUI may be stored permanently or semi-permanently in the wireless device, in which case the information transmitted by the proxy server  may be a simple signal to cause the wireless device to generate the privacy negotiation GUI.","Private information relating to a wireless device  may be normally stored within the wireless device . In that case, when authorized by the user, the wireless device  releases the private information to the proxy gateway , to allow the proxy gateway  to release the information to other network entities, as authorized. Alternatively, the private information may already be stored within the proxy gateway  when a need or request for such information is detected. In that case, the proxy gateway  merely needs to release the information when it receives authorization to do so.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","100","100","102","103","102","208","216","220","103","230","216","220","221","221","221","221","102"]},"The hypermedia information  shown in  is one example of the privacy negotiation GUI, generated by a browser in the telephone . As shown, it includes a list of selectable items (\u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, \u201cAlways\u201d, \u201cNever\u201d) from which the user of the device can select to dynamically specify privacy parameters permissions. The GUI may enable the user to provide or deny permission to release the private information for only the current request (by choosing \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d) or for all requests associated with the target application (by choosing \u201cAlways\u201d or \u201cNever\u201d). Each of the selectable items may represent a hyperlink which has a corresponding Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). These URI's may correspond to network addresses within the proxy gateway .","Hypermedia information  may be, for example, a WML file (\u201cdeck\u201d) including one or more WML cards. In certain modes of operation, activating function key  while a displayed item is selected (e.g., highlighted) causes the telephone  to retrieve and display a WML card associated with a URI of that item. In addition, by using the alphanumerical keys , the user may enter a URI manually to access hypermedia content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":"1"},"The illustrated processing system includes one or more processors , i.e. a central processing unit (CPU), read-only memory (ROM) , and random access memory (RAM) , each connected to a bus system . Also coupled to the bus system  are a mass storage device , one or more input\/output (I\/O) devices  through , and one or more data communication devices  through . Note that a server would not necessarily require any I\/O devices in addition to a data communication device.","The processor(s)  may be, or may include, one or more programmable general-purpose or special-purpose microprocessors or digital signal processors (DSPs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), or a combination of such devices. The bus system  includes one or more buses, which may be connected to each other through various bridges, controllers and\/or adapters, such as are well-known in the art. For example, the bus system may include a \u201csystem bus\u201d, which may be connected through one or more adapters to one or more expansion buses, such as a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus, HyperTransport or industry standard architecture (ISA) bus, small computer system interface (SCSI) bus, universal serial bus (USB), or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard  bus (sometimes referred to as \u201cFirewire\u201d).","Mass storage device  may be, or may include, any one or more devices suitable for storing large volumes of data in a non-volatile manner, such as a magnetic disk or tape, magneto-optical (MO) storage device, or any of various types of Digital Versatile Disk (DVD) or Compact Disk (CD) based storage, or a combination of such devices. The I\/O devices  through  may include, for example, any one or more of: a keyboard or keypad, a pointing device (e.g., a mouse, trackball, or touchpad), a display device, and an audio speaker.","The data communication devices  and  may be any devices suitable for enabling the processing system to communicate data with a remote processing system over a data communication link, such as a wireless transceiver (e.g., if implemented in a wireless device), a conventional telephone modem, a wireless modem, an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) adapter, a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) modem, a cable modem, a satellite transceiver, an Ethernet adapter, or the like. At least one of communication links  and  may be a wireless link, such as to provide the connection between wireless devices  and wireless network  in FIG. .","Note that while  shows two communication devices  and , more than one data communication device would not necessarily be required. The proxy gateway  does require at least two communication interfaces (i.e., one to connect to the wireless network  and one to connect to the wired network ), although these interfaces potentially can be implemented in a single physical device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIGS. 4 and 5"],"b":["4","4"]},"In this first embodiment, the proxy gateway  lacks the \u201cintelligence\u201d to determine, solely from a client's request, that private information is needed to process the request. Initially, at process block , proxy gateway  receives a standard HTTP GET\/Post request  from one of the wireless devices  (the \u201cclient\u201d), and proxies the request to the targeted origin server  at block . At block  the proxy gateway  receives a response  at to the request from the origin server .","If the origin server  requires additional information to process the request, such as presence or location information from the client , the origin server  responds with a standard \u201c\u201d error message as defined in HTTP version 1.1. Accordingly, if the proxy gateway  identifies the origin server's response  as an HTTP \u201c\u201d error message at block , then at block  the proxy gateway  sends to the client  a WML deck  to cause the client  to generate the privacy negotiation GUI.","If the private information is already stored within the proxy gateway  or the user denies permission to release information, the proxy gateway  may receive only the user's choice at block . Conversely, if the private information is not currently available to the proxy gateway , then the private information may be provided to the proxy gateway  by the wireless device  at block , assuming the user gives permission to do so. The user's choice may be in the form of a URI, as noted above. The client  may provide the private information to the proxy gateway  in any suitable manner, such as in a markup language document or in an extended header of a markup language document.","If the response  from the origin server  was an error message other then a \u201c\u201d error message (block ), then the response  is processed in an appropriate manner at block , which is not germane to the present invention. If the response  is not an error message at block , then the proxy gateway  simply proxies the origin server's response  to the client  at block .","If the proxy gateway  determines at block  that the user authorized release of the private information, based on the client's response  to the WML deck, and if all of the required information is available at block , then the proxy gateway  sends the private information  to the origin server  at block . As an alternative, at block  the proxy gateway  may send the origin server  a new request, which includes the private information and all of the information in the original request  from the client . At block , the proxy gateway  receives a response from the origin server , and it proxies the response to the client  at block .","If the proxy gateway  determines at block  that permission to release of the private information was denied by the user, then the proxy gateway  sends a redirect to the client  at block , to reset the browser context and to cause the browser to retry its original request. The new request is received by the proxy gateway  at block  and proxied to the origin server at block . The origin server will presumably respond to this new request with another HTTP  response, which is received by the proxy gateway  at block  and proxied to the client  at block . If permission to release the information was given, but not all necessary information was received (block ), the process loops back to block .","Of course, many variations upon this process are possible without departing from its basic principle. For example, certain operations might be added or deleted from the above-described process, or the sequence of operations altered, while still employing the same basic principle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 7","FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIGS. 6A"],"b":["4","6","7","4","4"]},"Thus, at process block , proxy gateway  receives a standard HTTP GET\/POST request  from one of the wireless devices  (the \u201cclient\u201d). It may be assumed that the original request  specifies a URI representing the proxy gateway . At block  the proxy gateway  determines whether additional (private) information is needed for the origin server  to process the request. If no additional information is needed, the proxy gateway  simply proxies the request to the origin server  at block . If additional information is required, then at block  the proxy gateway  saves the original request with headers. It then sends a WML deck  to the client  at block  for generating the privacy negotiation GUI. At block  the proxy gateway  receives the user's choice and\/or the private information  from the client .","If the proxy gateway  determines at block , based on the client's response , that the user authorized release of the private information, and if all of the required information is available at block , then at block  the proxy gateway  sends an HTTP redirect  (or the equivalent) to the client , to reset the browser context and to cause the browser to retry its original request.","If permission to release the information was given, but not all necessary information was received (block ), the process loops back to block . If the proxy gateway  determines at block  that permission to release the private information was denied by the user, then the proxy gateway  sends a redirect to the client  at block  to reset the browser context and to cause the browser to retry its original request. The new request is received by the proxy gateway  at block  and is simply proxied to the origin server at block . The origin server may respond to this new request with an HTTP  response, although that is not necessarily so. The response by the origin server is received by the proxy gateway  and is proxied to the client  at block .","When the proxy gateway  receives at block  a request  directed to the redirected URI, it creates a new request including the private information and the information from the previously saved request at block . The proxy gateway  then sends a new request  to the origin server  at block . The proxy gateway  then proxies the origin server's response  to the client  at block .","As already noted, numerous variations on the above-described techniques are possible without departing from the basic principle. For example, a network entity may request private information associated with a client  independently of any request from the client . In that case, the request may be in the form of a service invocation document sent by the requesting entity to the proxy gateway , which specifies the requested private information. As another example, the proxy gateway  may have knowledge that a given network entity requires certain additional information on a periodic basis, at specified times, or in response to specify events. Consequently, the determination by the proxy gateway  that private information is needed does not have to be in response to a request from any network entity. As yet another example, in appropriate cases the private information may be released (when authorized) to a network entity other than the entity which requested it. And again, the above-described processes do not have to be implemented in a device which operates as a proxy or as a gateway.","Thus, a method and apparatus for controlling the release of private information over a network from a wireless, hand-held device have been described. Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the claims. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which like references indicate similar elements and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 6A and 6B"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
