title: Increased capacity communication links with spectrum sharing
abstract: Various embodiments are directed to systems and methods for processing signals comprising a first component and a second component. A bandwidth of the first component may be centered at a center frequency. A bandwidth of the second component may be offset from the center frequency by an offset frequency such that at least a portion of the bandwidth of the second component overlaps a skirt of the first component. In various embodiments, a transmitter may split a single signal to generate the first and second components, shift the frequency of the second component, recombine and transmit the two components.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. FA8802-09-C-0001 awarded by the Department of the United States Air Force. The government has certain rights in the invention.","There is great demand for high capacity communication links in a variety of industrial and government settings including, for example, in mobile telephony, satellite communications, broadband data communications, etc. Existing methods for increasing the capacity (e.g., the data rate) of a communications link suffer from high costs, high power requirements, and the limited availability of bandwidth. For example, it is known to increase communications link capacity using higher-order modulation techniques such as, for example, 16 QAM. Successfully implementing higher-order modulation techniques, however, requires a relatively high bit energy to noise spectral density ratio (E\/N) and linear power amplifiers. High values for E\/Nrequire increased transmission power. Operating a power amplifier in a linear manner, however, often requires an increased power back-off. Accordingly, the use of higher-order modulation techniques is often unsatisfactory. This is especially the case in communications links with severe power constraints, such as, for example, high capacity satellite links. It is also known, for example, in the commercial television industry, that increased communications link capacity can be obtained using power division multiple accessing (PDMA). According to PDMA, two or more signals may occupy the same spectrum bandwidth. At least one of the signals, however, must have a relatively higher power level, typically 10 dB or more depending on the number of signals. Again, power constraints often render these methods undesirable.","Various embodiments are directed to systems and methods for increasing the capacity of a communications link by intentionally overlapping the spectrums of a main wideband signal and one or more narrowband signals. The narrowband signal or signals may have center frequencies offset from the center frequency of the wideband signal such that the signal spectrums overlap. According to various embodiments, the narrowband signal or signals may be spectrally positioned completely or partially within a skirt region of the wideband signal's spectrum. Accordingly, significant portions of the resulting interference effects between the signals may be removed by filtering. Additional interference may be removed from the wideband signal by detecting the narrowband signal or signals, estimating the interference caused to the wideband signal from the narrowband signal or signals, and compensating for the narrowband signal interference. In various embodiments, a similar process may be implemented to remove additional interference from the narrowband signals due to the wideband signal. According to various embodiments, the wideband signal and the narrowband signal or signals may be transmitted from the same transmitter\/location, or from different transmitters\/locations.","Various embodiments are directed to systems and methods for increasing the capacity of a communications link by intentionally overlapping the spectrums of a main wideband signal and one or more narrowband signals.  illustrates one embodiment of a chart  showing frequency domain representations (e.g., spectrums or spectrum distributions) of a wideband signal WB and two narrowband signals NB and NB having overlapping frequency spectrums. The frequency domain representations of the WB, NB and NB signals are indicated as Gs(), Gs(\u2212\u0394f) and Gs(+\u0394f), respectively.","Prior to transmission, each of the signals WB, NB, NB may be filtered with band-limiting square-root raised cosine (SRC) filters, thus causing the signals WB, NB, NB to have skirts as shown. A skirt may be defined as a frequency band where a signal's power spectral density drops off from a predetermined portion of the peak power spectral density to zero (e.g., \u2212\u221e dB). For example, where the signal skirt begins at 6 dB from peak spectral power density, it may take up \u03b1 % of the 6 dB bandwidth of the signal, where \u03b1 is the roll-off factor of the SRC filter.","As illustrated in , the spectrums of the narrowband signals NB, NB are frequency shifted by \u0394fand \u0394f, respectively, from the center frequency (f) of the wideband signal. The frequency offsets \u0394fand \u0394fmay be selected such that the spectrums of the narrowband signals NB, NB overlap the spectrum of the wideband signal, as shown. According to various embodiments, and sometimes depending on the data rate of the signals NB, NB, the spectrums of the signals NB, NB may be limited to within the skirt of the wideband signal WB, or may extend beyond the skirt of the wideband signal WB, as shown in .","According to various embodiments, the signals WB, NB, NB may originate from separate transmitters that may be at separate physical locations. The transmitters may generate the signal spread shown in  by utilizing different carrier frequencies. For example, a transmitter for the narrowband signal NB may utilize a carrier frequency that is offset from the carrier frequency of the wideband signal transmitter by \u0394f. A transmitter for the narrowband signal NB may utilize a carrier frequency that is offset from the carrier frequency of the wideband signal transmitter by \u0394f.","In various embodiments, the signals WB, NB and NB may originate from a single source.  illustrates one embodiment of a block diagram showing a transmitter  for deriving and transmitting the signals WB, NB, NB. An input binary data stream may be provided to a data splitter . The data splitter  may split the input stream into the signals WB, NB and NB, as shown. The wideband signal WB may be modulated by a complex baseband modulator , resulting in a filtered complex signal:\n\n()+()\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nIn (1) and in the other equations herein, the letter \u2018j\u2019 may represent \u221a{square root over (\u22121)} unless otherwise noted. The narrowband signals NB, NB may, likewise, be modulated by complex baseband modulators  and , respectively, generating additional filtered complex signals given by (2) and (3) below:\n\n()+()\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n()+()\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nThe modulators , , , as well as other modulators and demodulators herein, are described in terms of Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK). It will be appreciated that any suitable modulators or modulation methods may be used including, for example, other types of phase-shift keying, amplitude-shift keying methods, frequency-shift keying methods, etc.\n","The filtered complex signals given by (1) (2) and (3) above may be scaled at nodes ,  and  by scaling factors A, Aand A, respectively. The scaling factors A, Aand Amay be selected to appropriately apportion the amplifier power among the three signals WB, NB, NB. The output of the scaling nodes , ,  may be a set of complex baseband signals, g(t), g(t), and g(t) corresponding to the wideband signal WB and the narrowband signals NB, NB, respectively. The complex baseband signals g(t) and g(t), corresponding to the narrowband signals NB, NB, may be input to subcarrier modulators , , respectively. Subcarrier modulator  may translate the frequency spectrum of the complex baseband signal g(t) by \u0394f, resulting in:\n\n()exp [2\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nLikewise, subcarrier modulator  may translate the frequency spectrum of the complex baseband signal g(t) by \u2212\u0394f, resulting in:\n\n()exp [\u22122\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nThe complex baseband signal, g(t), as well as those given by (4) and (5) above, may be combined at signal combiner  to generate a composite complex baseband signal g(t).\n","The composite baseband signal g(t) may be input to a complex baseband to intermediate frequency (IF) converter , which may up-convert signal g(t) to the intermediate frequency. For example, a complex to real converter  may separate the composite baseband signal g(t) into real and imaginary components. The real component may be modulated, at node , by the intermediate frequency signal, generated by an intermediate frequency oscillator . The imaginary component may be modulated by the intermediate frequency shifted by \u03c0\/2. The real and imaginary signals may be summed at summing junction . The resulting intermediate frequency (IF) signal may be filtered at intermediate frequency bandpass filter  and multiplied by a signal fat node . The signal fmay be selected according to Equation (6) such that the node  up-coverts the intermediate frequency signal to radio frequency (RF).\n\n\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nAfter RF bandpass filtering at , the resulting signal may be amplified at  and transmitted by antenna . Although  shows an OQPSK upconverter, it will be appreciated that an upconverter according to any suitable modulation technique may be used.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["204","204","204","206","208","302","306"],"sub":"1f"},"A second output may be delayed by a delay  equal to T\/2, wherein Tis the symbol time for the WB signal.

It is noted from the description above and from the simulation of the second test case that the performance difference between the wideband and narrowband signals arise as the wideband receiver demodulates the narrowband signal and uses the result for the narrowband signal to improve its own performance. In the second test case, however, the narrow band receiver ignored the presence of the wideband signal. This is reasonable when the two signals arise from different physical locations and are destined to different physical locations, as was assumed in the second test case. When the two signals are obtained by splitting a single wideband symbol stream, however, the same receiver will recover both signals. This may also be the case when two or more physical locations transmit to the same receiver. As described above, in this case, the wideband signal detected channel symbols may be fed back to improve the narrowband signal performance. In such embodiments, it is expected that the performance of the narrowband signal will be similar to that of the wideband signal (e.g., there will be negligible degradation due to spectrum overlap). The relative increase in the peak PSD of the narrowband signal \u0394results in an overall increase in the transmit power or equivalently the (E\/N) requirement compared to the case of no such increase or equivalently for the case of no spectrum overlap. Denoting by \u0394(E\/N), such an increase may be given by (46):\n\n\u0394()=10 log {1+[(\u22121)]}\u2003\u2003(46)\n","For the second test case, with \u0394=1 dB, \u0394(E\/N)=0.18 dB which is relatively small. When the wideband and narrowband signals arise from different physical locations, it is very likely that the narrowband receiver may have a relatively high receiver noise spectral density Ncompared to that of the wideband receiver and thus will inherently require a higher relative (E\/N), thus implying no increase in (E\/N) due to spectral overlap.","In order to increase the Pperformance of the narrowband signal for the case when the narrowband signal is received by an independent receiver, the relative peak PSD of the narrowband signal \u0394may be increased beyond 1 dB.  shows a chart  of the performance results for a third test case similar to the second test case, but with \u0394=2 dB. In , a first curve  shows the performance of the wideband signal while a second curve  shows the ideal performance.  shows a chart  having a first curve  corresponding to the actual performance of the narrowband signal and a curve  corresponding to the ideal performance.","The third test case illustrated in  results in a power sharing loss Pof 1.2 dB as computed from (37). The resulting increase in the (E\/N) requirement as computed from (44) is given by \u0394(E\/N)=0.4 dB. As may be inferred from , there is no penalty in terms of the required (E\/N)as expected from the third test case where \u0394=1 dB. Also, the channel Pcan be satisfied for systems with most error correction coding schemes. In fact a Pof 10may be achieved even with a smaller value of \u0394than 2 dB. Thus an increase of 20-24% in symbol rate may be achieved at the cost of a relatively small increase of 0.3 dB in the (E\/N) requirement. When the two symbol streams are generated by the same terminal, there is no meaningful performance degradation even with such an increase in the capacity (e.g., the capacity is increased at little cost in terms of (E\/N)).","According to various embodiments, the performance of the narrowband can be further increased by increasing the value of \u0394above 2 dB considered in third test case of . For example,  show charts of the performance results for a fourth test case where \u0394=3 dB.  shows a chart  comprising a first curve  illustrating the probability of bit error for the wideband signal, P, versus the (E\/N)for the fourth test case along with a plot  of the ideal case.  shows a chart  comprising a first curve  showing the fourth test case result for the narrowband signal P, as well as a curve  showing the ideal narrowband case. As may be inferred from , a probability of bit error Pof 10may be achieved with a (E\/N)of 2.6 dB. The corresponding Pfor a (E\/N)of 2.6 dB is equal to 0.025 from , which is very close to the ideal case when only the wideband signal is present. Thus with an appropriate selection of \u0394and (E\/N)the Prequirements for both the wideband and the narrowband terminals may be satisfied. Selection of \u0394=3 dB results in an overall (E\/N) penalty of \u0394(E\/N)=0.66 dB.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIGS. 20 and 21","FIG. 20","FIG. 21","FIGS. 20 and 21","FIGS. 18 and 19"],"sub":["e ","0"],"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00019","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.46mm","file":"US08767845-20140701-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},"b":["2000","2002","2004","2100","2102","2104"]},"It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions of the present invention have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the present invention, while eliminating other elements, for purposes of clarity.
