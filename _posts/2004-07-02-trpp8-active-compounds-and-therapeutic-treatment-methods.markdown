D. McKemy, et al., \u201cIdentification of a Cold Receptor Reveals a General Role for TRP Channels in Thermosensation,\u201d 7, 2002; 416(6876):52-8. For a recent review of \u201cThe TRP Ion Channel Family,\u201d see D. E. Clapham, et al., 2001, 2, 387-396 <www.nature.com\/reviews\/neuro>.

The predicted protein has significant homology with the transient receptor potential (Trp) family of Ca channel proteins. Northern blot analysis indicates Trp-p8 expression within normal human tissues is mostly restricted to prostate epithelial cells. In situ hybridization analysis shows that Trp-p8 mRNA expression was at moderate levels in normal prostate tissue and appears to be elevated in prostate cancer. Trp-p8 mRNA was also expressed in a number of non-prostatic primary tumors of breast, colon, lung, and skin origin, whereas transcripts encoding Trp-p8 were hardly detected or not detected in the corresponding normal human tissues (Tsavaler, et al Cancer Research (2001), 61(9):3760-3769).","Immunotherapy of prostate carcinoma (PCa) largely depends on the identification of suitable target antigens that are present in a high percentage of prostate tumors. The putative calcium channel protein, Trp-p8, is associated with loss of Trp-p8 mRNA expression and a significantly shorter time to PSA relapse-free survival. The identification of Trp-p8 is associated with prostate cancer outcome, and suggests an integral role for this receptor in prostate carcinogensis. Immunogenic peptides derived from the prostate-specific protein transient receptor potential-p8 (Trp-p8) that is recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes from PCa patients have been reported (Kiessling, et al (2003) Prostate 56(4):270-279; Henshall, et al Cancer Research (2003), 63(14):4196-4203; Fuessel, et al International Journal of Oncology (2003), 23(1):221-228; U.S. Pat. No.2003-108,963 A1). Identification of therapeutic agents effective in the treatment of neoplastic, hyperplastic, and like diseases or conditions continues to be the subject of significant research efforts. Recent work indicates that certain therapeutic agents in combination with certain antibody preparations can be effective in treating angiogenic related disorders, and like diseases or conditions, see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,582,959.","There is currently a need for therapeutic agents and methods that are useful to treat diseases and conditions that are associated with regulation of the Trp-p8 receptor. There is also a need for therapeutic agents and treatment methods, which are specific and selective toward cancerous cells and have low cytotoxicity toward healthy cells. There is also a need for therapeutic agents in combination with additional chemotherapeutic agents, including, for example, antibody preparations, and combination therapeutic treatment methods thereof, that are useful to treat diseases and conditions that are associated with regulation of the Trp-p8 receptor.","It has now been discovered certain compounds, including some known to produce a physiological cool sensation (\u201ccool-genic\u201d), such as the above mentioned tetrahydropyrimidine-2-ones, phosphine oxides, menthane carboxamide compounds, alkyl substituted alkyl amide compounds, and alpha-keto enamines, exhibit useful biological activity, such as anti-tumor activity.","Accordingly, the present disclosure provides, in exemplary embodiments, compounds which activate the Trp-p8 receptor.

An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. Described in terms of its structure, an antibody is a Y-shaped protein consisting of four amino acid chains, two heavy and two light. In a simplified model sufficient for this appeal, each antibody has primarily two regions: a variable region and a constant region. The variable region, located on the ends of the arms of the Y, binds to and interacts with the target antigen. This variable region includes a complementary determining region (CDR) that recognizes and binds to a specific binding site on a particular antigen. The constant region, located on the tail of the Y, is recognized by and interacts with the immune system (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) 5., Garland Publishing, New York). A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also called epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al (1975) 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The \u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al (1991) 352:624-628 and Marks et al (1991) 222:581-597, for example.","The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al (1984) 81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include \u201cprimatized\u201d antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g., Old World Monkey, Ape etc) and human constant region sequences.","A \u201cchemotherapeutic agent\u201d is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer.

Treatment of cancer, by the method of the disclosure, also includes contacting the cells with a compound of the disclosure to activate Trp-p8 receptors in cancerous cells, such as tumors, to cause elevated flux levels of multi-valent ions into the cells to cause cell stasis or cell death. Cancer can include diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control. Cancer cells can also invade nearby tissue and can spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body. The major categories of cancers are carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias, and lymphomas. Within these major categories are numerous subgroups that generally describe the organ in which the cancer originates, such as adenocarcinoma of the stomach or oat cell carcinoma of the lung.","\u201cTumor\u201d refers to, for example, an abnormal benign or malignant mass of tissue that may not be inflammatory, arises from cells of pre-existent tissue, and may possesses no physiological function. Benign tumors, include for example, cysts, warts, moles, and polyps, and generally do not spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors are typically composed of cells that grow rapidly, have other abnormal properties that distinguish them from normal cells, and often invade other normal tissues.","\u201cVascular endothelial cell growth factor,\u201d or \u201cVEGF,\u201d refers to a mammalian growth factor as defined, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,671.

As used herein, \u201cmammals\u201d means any class of higher vertebrates that nourish their young with milk secreted by mammary glands, including, for example, humans, horses, cows, pigs, sheep, dogs, rabbits, and monkeys.","\u201cApoptotic cell death,\u201d \u201cprogrammed cell death,\u201d \u201capoptosis\u201d and like terms refer to any cell death that may result from the complex cascade of cellular events that occur at specific stages of cellular differentiation and in response to specific stimuli. Apoptotic cell death can be characterized by condensation of the cytoplasm and nucleus of dying cells. Apoptosis is an active process requiring new protein synthesis. Typically, the process requires ATP, involves new RNA and protein synthesis, and culminates in the activation of endogenous endonucleases that degrade the DNA of the cell, thereby destroying the genetic template required for cellular homeostasis. Apoptosis is observed in controlled deletion of cells during metamorphosis, differentiation, and general cell turnover, and appears normally to be regulated by receptor-coupled events. For these reasons, apoptosis has been called \u201cprogrammed cell death\u201d or \u201ccell suicide.\u201d While every cell likely has a genetic program to commit suicide, it is usually suppressed. Under normal circumstances, only those cells no longer required by the organism activate this self-destruction program.","\u201cTherapeutically effective amount\u201d means, in embodiments, a dose of a compound of the disclosure, or a dose of a combination of a compound of the disclosure and another chemotherapeutic agent, with or without an excipient, that inhibits, reduces or eliminates tumor growth, in vivo, in vitro, or both, by for example, activating Trp-p8, stimulating apoptosis, or both. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques.","In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the compounds of the disclosure are used in combination therapy, for example, with other antibody therapeutic agents. In an embodiment, compounds of the present disclosure are used in combination with known cancer treating antibodies.

More particularly the present disclosure provides compounds that specifically bind to the subgroup of long TRP (or TRPM) channels, and most particularly to compounds that specifically bind to the TRP channel called \u201cTrp-p8\u201d (or TRP-M8). The Trp-p8 receptors are typically present at elevated levels in cancers, such as prostate cancer. The compounds of the disclosure are endowed with Trp-p8 receptor activating activity. Activation of the Trp-p8 receptor causes increased calcium ion flow into cancerous cells and ultimately cell death. Compounds of the present disclosure are useful for, but not limited to, the treatment of cell proliferation diseases or disorders, and stimulating apoptosis. It is also well known in the art and as illustrated herein how to determine Trp-p8 receptor activity, for example, using the standard tests described herein, or using other similar tests.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that compounds of the disclosure having a chiral center may exist in and be isolated in optically active and racemic forms. Some compounds may exhibit polymorphism. It is to be understood that the present disclosure encompasses any racemic, optically-active, polymorphic, tautomeric, or stereoisomeric form, or mixture thereof, of a compound of the disclosure, which possesses the useful properties described herein, it being well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms (for example, by resolution of the racemic form by recrystallization techniques, by synthesis from optically-active starting materials, by chiral synthesis, or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase). In particular, it is understood that compounds of the disclosure, such as of formulas (I-XIII), can contain chiral centers, for example, in the Rsubstituents of formula (I), the Rsubstituents of formula (V), and in the Rto Rsubstituents of formula (XIII).

Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids, which form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, and \u03b1-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.","Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example, by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metals, for example, sodium, potassium or lithium, or alkaline earth metal salts, for example, calcium, of carboxylic acids can also be made.","Compounds of the present disclosure can conveniently be administered in a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound in combination with a suitable excipient, the composition being useful in treating tumors. Pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound appropriate for anti-tumor use are prepared by methods and contain excipients well known in the art. A generally recognized compendium of such methods and ingredients is Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin (Mark Publ. Co., 15ed., 1975). The compounds and compositions of the present disclosure can be administered parenterally, for example, by intravenous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection, orally, or rectally, depending on, for example, the disposition or dissemination of the tumor cells.","In embodiments, the antibodies included within the scope of the disclosure include hybrid and recombinant antibodies (e.g., \u201chumanized\u201d and \u201chuman\u201d antibodies) regardless of species of origin or immunoglobulin class or subclass designation, as well as antibody fragments (for example, Fab, F(ab\u2032), and F). See U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Mage and Lamoyi, in 79-97, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987).","Thus, the modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from such a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies of the disclosure may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler & Milstein, 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. Other known methods of antibody production are described, for example, in Goding, 59-103, Academic Press (1986); Kozbor, 133:3001 (1984). Brodeur, et al., 51-63, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1987).","Various methods have been employed to produce monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Hybridoma technology, which refers to a cloned cell line that produces a single type of antibody, uses the cells of various species, including mice (murine), hamsters, rats, and humans. Another method to prepare MAbs uses genetic engineering including recombinant DNA techniques. Monoclonal antibodies made from these techniques include, among others, chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies. A chimeric antibody combines DNA encoding regions from more than one type of species. For example, a chimeric antibody may derive the variable region from a mouse and the constant region from a human. A humanized antibody comes predominantly from a human, even though it contains nonhuman portions. Like a chimeric antibody, a humanized antibody may contain a completely human constant region. But unlike a chimeric antibody, the variable region may be partially derived from a human. The nonhuman, synthetic portions of a humanized antibody often come from CDRs in murine antibodies. In any event, these regions are crucial to allow the antibody to recognize and bind to a specific antigen.","As noted, murine antibodies play an important role in these technologies. While useful for diagnostics and short-term therapies, murine antibodies cannot be administered to people long-term without increasing the risk of a deleterious immunogenic response. This response, called Human Anti-Mouse Antibody (HAMA), occurs when a human immune system recognizes the murine antibody as foreign and attacks it. A HAMA response can cause toxic shock or even death.","Chimeric and humanized antibodies reduce the likelihood of a HAMA response by minimizing the nonhuman portions of administered antibodies. Furthermore, chimeric and humanized antibodies have the additional benefit of activating secondary human immune responses, such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity.","\u201cAntibody fragments\u201d comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably comprising the antigen-binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and multi-specific antibodies formed from antibody fragment(s).","An \u201cintact\u201d antibody is one which comprises an antigen-binding variable region as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof.","The intact antibody may have one or more \u201ceffector functions\u201d which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptor; BCR), etc.","Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different \u201cclasses.\u201d There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into \u201csubclasses\u201d (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3, and \u03bc, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.","When used in vivo for combination therapy, antibodies can be administered to the patient in therapeutically effective amounts (i.e. amounts that eliminate or reduce the patient's tumor burden). The combination of a compound of the disclosure and antibodies can be administered at the same time or sequentially. They will normally be administered parenterally, when possible, at the target cell site, or intravenously. The dose and dosage regimen will depend upon, for example, the nature of the cancer (primary or metastatic), its population, the site to which the antibodies are to be directed, the characteristics of the particular immunotoxin (when used), for example, its therapeutic index, the patient, and the patient's history. The amount of antibody administered will typically be in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg\/kg of patient weight. The amount of a compound of the disclosure administered in combination with an antibody can typically be, for example, in the range of about 5 to 1,000 mg, or about 0.1 to 300 mg\/kg of patient body weight, and can depend on many of the abovementioned factors and considerations.","The present disclosure also contemplates using combinations of a compound of the disclosure with an anti-TRP-P8 antibody in diagnostic applications. For diagnostic applications, the antibodies of the disclosure typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety can be any one capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety may be a radioisotope, such as H, C, P, S, or I, a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or luciferin; or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase or horseradish peroxidase.","Any method known in the art for separately conjugating the antibody to the detectable moiety may be employed, including those methods described by Hunter, et al., 144:945 (1962); David, et al., 13:1014 (1974); Pain, et al., 40:219 (1981); and Nygren, 30:407 (1982).","For therapeutic applications, antibodies may be administered to a mammal, preferably a human, in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form, including those that may be administered to a human intravenously as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, subcutaneous, intra-articular, or inhalation routes. An antibody is also suitably administered by intra-tumoral, peritumoral, intra-lesional, or peri-lesional routes, to exert local as well as systemic therapeutic effects.","Such dosage forms encompass known pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or vehicles that are inherently nontoxic and non-therapeutic. An antibody will typically be formulated in such vehicles at a concentration of about 0.1 mg\/ml to 100 mg\/ml.","For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of a combination of a compound of the disclosure will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the compound is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the compound, and the discretion of the attending physician. The compound is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments.","Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 0.015 to 15 mg\/kg of the compound is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is repeated until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be useful.","For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound of the disclosure may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations typically contain at least about 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.","The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac, or sugar, and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.","The compounds or compositions of the disclosure can also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.","Pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient, which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes or implantable seeds or pellets. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form should be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.","Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.","Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water-alcohol\/glycol blends, in which the present compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. Useful dosages of the compounds of the disclosure can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949.","The compound is conveniently administered in unit dosage form; for example, containing 5 to 1,000 mg, conveniently 10 to 750 mg, most conveniently, 50 to 500 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator.","For internal administration, the compositions can be administered orally or parenterally at dose levels, calculated as the free base, of about 0.1 to 300 mg\/kg, preferably 1.0 to 30 mg\/kg of mammal body weight, and can be used in man in a unit dosage form, administered one to four times daily in the amount of 1 to 1,000 mg per unit dose.","For parenteral administration or for administration as drops, as for eye treatments, the compounds are presented in aqueous solution in a concentration of from about 0.1 to about 10%, more preferably about 0.1 to about 7%. The solution may contain other ingredients, such as emulsifiers, antioxidants or buffers.","Generally, the concentration of the compound(s) of formula (I-XIII) in a liquid composition, such as an IV (intravenous), will be from about 0.1 to about 25, preferably from about 0.5 to about 10, weight percent. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1 to about 5 weight percent, preferably about 0.5 to about 2.5 weight percent.","The exact regimen for administration of the compounds and compositions disclosed herein will necessarily be dependent upon the needs of the individual subject being treated, the type of treatment and, of course, the judgment of the attending practitioner.","The binding activity and binding selectivity of the compounds of the present disclosure are excellent predictors of the anti-tumor activity of compounds of the disclosure. The binding activity and binding selectivity can be determined using pharmacological models well known to the art, or using the assays described below. Exemplary results of biological testing are summarized in Table 1 below.","Evaluation of Biological Activity","General methods and materials disclosed in R. Skyryma, et al., 2000, 527.1, 71-83, for assessing and measuring calcium ion flux or cell uptake, and induction of apoptosis were adapted for use in the present disclosure and as illustrated herein. Other test methods and procedures such as described below, including cell line culturing, transfection, and in vivo and in vitro tumor growth inhibition, are readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art upon comprehending the disclosure.","Assays for Activity","For cancer, a variety of well-known animal models can be used to further understand the role of the genes in the development and pathogenesis of tumors, and to test the efficacy of candidate therapeutic agents, including combinations of compounds of the disclosure and anti-angiogenic antibodies. The in vivo nature of such models makes them particularly predictive of responses in human patients. Animal models of tumors and cancers (e.g., breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, etc.) include both non-recombinant and recombinant (transgenic) animals. Non-recombinant animal models include, for example, rodent, e.g., murine models. Such models can be generated by introducing tumor cells into syngeneic mice using standard techniques, e.g., subcutaneous injection, tail vein injection, spleen implantation, intraperitoneal implantation, implantation under the renal capsule, or orthopin implantation, e.g., colon cancer cells implanted in colonic tissue. See for example, PCT publication No. WO 97\/33551, published Sep. 18, 1997.","Probably the most often used animal species in oncological studies are immunodeficient mice and, in particular, nude mice. The observation that the nude mouse with thymic hypo\/aplasia could successfully act as a host for human tumor xenografts has lead to its widespread use for this purpose. The autosomal recessive nu gene has been introduced into a very large number of distinct congenic strains of nude mouse, including, for example, ASW, A\/He, AKR, BALB\/c, B10.LP, C17, C3H, C57BL, C57, CBA, DBA, DDD, I\/st, NC, NFR, NFS, NFS\/N, NZB, NZC, NZW, P, RIII, and SJL. In addition, a wide variety of other animals with inherited immunological defects other than the nude mouse have been bred and used as recipients of tumor xenografts. For further details see for example, , E. Boven and B. Winograd, eds. (CRC Press, Inc., 1991).","The cells introduced into such animals can be derived from known tumor\/cancer cell lines, such as any of the above-listed tumor cell lines, and, for example, the B104-1-1 cell line (stable NIH-3T3 cell line transfected with the neu protooncogene); ras-transfected NIH-3T3 cells; Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37); or a moderately well-differentiated grade II human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, HT-29 (ATCC HTB-38); or from tumors and cancers. Samples of tumor or cancer cells can be obtained from patients undergoing surgery, using standard conditions involving freezing and storing in liquid nitrogen. Karmali et al., 48: 689-696 (1983). Tumor cells can be introduced into animals such as nude mice by a variety of procedures. The subcutaneous (s.c.) space in mice is very suitable for tumor implantation. Tumors can be transplanted s.c. as solid blocks, as needle biopsies by use of a trochar, or as cell suspensions. For solid-block or trochar implantation, tumor tissue fragments of suitable size are introduced into the s.c. space. Cell suspensions are freshly prepared from primary tumors or stable tumor cell lines, and injected subcutaneously. Tumor cells can also be injected as subdermal implants. In this location, the inoculum is deposited between the lower part of the dermal connective tissue and the s.c. tissue.","Animal models of breast cancer can be generated, for example, by implanting rat neuroblastoma cells (from which the neu oncogene was initially isolated), or neu-transformed NIH-3T3 cells into nude mice, essentially as described by Drebin, et al., 83: 9129-9133 (1986).","Similarly, animal models of colon cancer can be generated by passaging colon cancer cells in animals, e.g., nude mice, leading to the appearance of tumors in these animals. An orthotopic transplant model of human colon cancer in nude mice has been described, for example, by Wang, et al., 54: 4726-4728 (1994) and Too, et al., 55: 681-684 (1995). This model is based on the so-called \u201cMETAMOUSE\u201d\u2122 sold by AntiCancer, Inc. (San Diego, Calif.).","Tumors that arise in animals can be removed and cultured in vitro. Cells from the in vitro cultures can then be passaged to animals. Such tumors can serve as targets for further testing or drug screening. Alternatively, the tumors resulting from the passage can be isolated and RNA from pre-passage cells and cells isolated after one or more rounds of passage analyzed for differential expression of genes of interest. Such passaging techniques can be performed with any known tumor or cancer cell lines. The following examples serve to more fully describe the manner of using the above-described disclosure, as well as to set forth the best modes contemplated for carrying out various aspects of the disclosure. It is understood that these examples in no way serve to limit the true scope of this disclosure, but rather are presented for illustrative purposes.","Preparation of Compound IIa4-1 from (\u2212)Menthyl chloride. 1.39 grams of Mg metal (57 mmol) was placed in a 100 mL flask and 4 mL of dry THF was added to cover the Mg metal. A crystal of iodine was added to the metal-THF mixture and stirred for several minutes followed by the addition of about \u2153 portion of 10 grams (57 mmol) of (\u2212)menthyl chloride (Aldrich). The mixture was heated to induce Grignard formation and the remaining menthyl chloride (\u2154portion) was added in 50 mL dry THF and stirred until the reaction was complete. The Grignard solution was then canulated under nitrogen into a vessel containing excess dry ice. This dry ice quenched mixture was swirled and poured into 300 mL ice containing 2 mL concentrated HCl. Diethyl ether was added and the mixture separated. The separated organic layers were combined and washed with water then extracted with an aqueous NaOH solution. The aqueous solution (and oil) was acidified with HCl until a solid formed, diethyl ether was added, and the acid was extracted into the organic phase, washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated to give 4.18 grams (40%) as white needles.","The acid (0.57 grams, 3.1 mmol) was dissolved in 1.5 mL dimethylacetamide (DMA). The PyBOP (2.1 grams, 4.0 mmol), p-anisidine (0.58 grams, 4.7 mmol, Aldrich) and DiPEA (2.7 mL, 15.5 mmol) were added. Another 0.25 grams p-anisidine was added after 2 hours and again after 5 hours. The reaction was diluted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) after 7 hours, washed twice with 1 N HCl, twice with aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and then with brine. The separated organic layers were combined and dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to a brown solid. This solid was put through a plug of silica gel with 30% EtOAc\/hexanes to remove the color. The product began to crystallize upon concentration, so the crystallization was allowed to occur, the solvent was removed by pipette, and the white needles were washed with cold EtOAc and dried under vacuum to give 0.365 grams (1.26 mmol, 40% yield) of a first crop. Recrystallization of the mother liquor yielded an additional 0.346 grams (1.2 mmol, 39% yield) as white needles.","LCMS showed the product to have a molecular weight of 289, corresponding to the desired molecular weight, and the NMR spectra showed it to have the desired structure.","Demonstration of Ion Channel Activity in Response to Selected Cool-Genic Compounds\u2014Calcium Ion Uptake Evaluation. Calcium ion uptake experiments were conducted as follows. Calcium uptake was measured for cells expressing Trp-p8 tumor antigen and for cells not expressing Trp-p8 tumor antigen after each cell line was contacted with cool-genic compounds of the present disclosure. The results showed that cells expressing Trp-p8 tumor antigen had progressively increased calcium uptake as the concentration of cool-genic compound was increased incrementally over about five concentration decades from about 0.0001 to about 10 microM. Compound (IIa4-1) had unexpectedly particularly high calcium uptake at all cool-genic compound concentrations. Cells not expressing tumor antigen had essentially no observable calcium uptake over all of the cool-genic compound concentrations. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a non-coolgenic compound, was used as a control compound in both expressing and non-expressing cell lines and which DMSO exposed cells showed no appreciable calcium uptake at any concentration. Cell lines included non-expressing lines: 293, PC3, and PC3\/neo; and tumor antigen expressing lines: 293, PC3, and PC3\/neo.","Human Cell Killing in vitro by Compounds that Activate Trp-p8. Referring to the Figures, in  the effectiveness of selected cool-genic compounds in human cell killing was evaluated. The order and potency of cool-genic compounds were compared in two related human cell lines, one was 293 cells expressing Trp-p8 and a second was matched 293 cells lacking (not expressing) Trp-p8 used as a control. There were about 50,000 cells per well at plating. The cool-genic compounds were added at plating. The cells were treated by exposing the cells to the individual compounds at varying concentrations over about 0.1 to about 1,000 microM for 72 hours. The x-axis shows concentration increments and the y-axis shows the number (in arbitrary units) of viable cells remaining at the end of 72 hours.  show the response of cells expressing Trp-p8 and treated with the indicated numbered or named coolgenic compounds.  show the response of cells without (not expressing) Trp-p8 and also treated with the indicated coolgenic compounds. The results in  show that the cells with Trp-p8 had a range of kill responses or potencies with respect to the coolgenic compounds. Compound IIa4-1 had the best kill (IC<1 microM) for cells expressing Trp-p8. The comparative results in  show that the cells without Trp-p8 had a lower or essentially no kill response to the same coolgenic compounds, particularly at the lower concentrations of the coolgenic compounds, e.g., below 100 microMolar.","Procedure for inhibition of tumor growth in vivo by compounds that activate Trp-p8. Methods for preparing transfected cancerous cells, such as those expressing Trp-p8, is readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, see for example J. M. Schallhorn, et al., 15, 1996;24(4):596-601. Referring to the , there is illustrated the growth of PC3 clone cells transfected to express tumor antigen, (PC3\/Trp-p8.c8 and .c9), and PC3 clone cells not expressing tumor antigen (PC3-Neo) in athymic nude mice (5 million cells\/mouse). The non-Trp-p8 expressing tumor forming human prostate cancer cell line, PC3-Neo 200 (-\u25cf-), shows expected exponential tumor cell growth rates. In contrast, the Trp-p8 expressing (i.e. \u201cover-expressing\u201d) tumor forming human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3\/Trp-p8: .c8 (clone 8) 220 (-\u25aa-); and .c9 (clone 9) 230 (-\u25b4-), show substantially slower growth and static growth rates, respectively.","Athymic mice (8 per group) are inoculated in the flank with about 5\u00d710of PC3 clone cells stablely expressing Trp-p8 (cl.8) or a vector control cell line (PC3-Neo). Tumors are established to a size of approximately 200 mg each at which time coolgenic compounds are administered once or twice per day I.V. or P.O. at doses ranging from about 1-30 mg\/kg body weight. Tumor volumes are measured by caliper every third day and average volumes are calculated.","Contacting, in vivo, the Trp-p8 expressing cancerous cells, such as those illustrated above, with certain coolgenic compounds of moderate to high potency of the present disclosure, and as illustrated herein, is expected to result in high cell kill for Trp-p8 expressing cancerous cells and no cell kill or low cell kill for healthy or non-Trp-p8 expressing cells. This expectation is consistent with the abovementioned in vitro human cell killing results presented in EXAMPLE 3.","Table 1 summarizes exemplary ion channel activity and Cell Kill response to selected cool-genic compounds, mentioned above or illustrated below, and provides a comparative or relative activity ranking for those compounds.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0223","num":"0227"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Ion Channel Activity"},{"entry":"and Cell Killing in Response to Selected CoolGenic Compounds."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Activity","Compound","Peak","293\/Trp-p8","PC3\/Trp-p8"]},{"entry":["Ranking","ID#","(FLIPR)","Cell Killing","Cell Killing"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","IIa4-1","31,000","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":["2","IV-1","31,000","Yes"]},{"entry":["3","XIII-1","29,000","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":["4","IV-2","29,000"]},{"entry":["5","IIb-2","25,100","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":["6","IIb-3","25,100","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":["7","IIb-4","25,100","Yes"]},{"entry":["8","IIb-1","25,000"]},{"entry":["9","XIII-2","25,000"]},{"entry":["10","IIb-5","23,300"]},{"entry":["11","IV-3","22,000"]},{"entry":["12","Icilin","20,000"]},{"entry":["13","V-4","17,500"]},{"entry":["14","V-2","17,000"]},{"entry":["15","V-1","\u20029,600"]},{"entry":["16","III-1","\u20025,000"]},{"entry":["17","DMSO","\u20021,400"]},{"entry":[{},"control"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"left","id":"FOO-00001"},"sup":"1"}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["V-1",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00037","num":"00037"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00037","he":"25.57mm","wi":"22.44mm","file":"US07893072-20110222-C00037.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{},"CHO"]},{"entry":[{},"Mol.
