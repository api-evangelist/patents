Dynamic polymerization and depolymerization of tubulin heterodimers is a necessary and tightly controlled process during mitosis. Perturbing microtubule dynamics with small molecules blocks the cell cycle in the metaphase\/anaphase transition and leads to apoptosis. Therefore, molecules that target tubulin may be used to halt the uncontrolled cell division that characterizes cancer cells. This therapeutic strategy was validated by the success of antimitotic drugs such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, vincristine, and vinblastine, but the clinical utility of these drugs is limited by neurotoxicity and p-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance. Synthetic taxanes, vinca alkaloid analogs, and novel chemotypes that modulate microtubule dynamics have been synthesized in an attempt to overcome these limitations, but few have produced useful results during clinical trials.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration embodiments that may be practiced.

Described herein are the synthesis and structure-activity relationships of several 1,2,3-triazole derivatives of the 2-phenyl-oxazole-4-carboxamide fragment which exhibit potent anti-cancer activity. Also described are mode of action studies based on in silico and in vitro work, which demonstrate that these triazoles represent a new antimitotic chemotype.","In embodiments, the exemplary compounds described above may be synthesized according to the following general procedures. The strategy for exploring the chemical space around the 2-phenyl-oxazole-4-carboxamide fragment was based on \u201cclick chemistry.\u201d More specifically, the Cu(l)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction was chosen. The CuAAC reaction produces 1,2,3-triazoles by linking terminal alkynes to organic azides, so one of these two functional groups was installed onto the 2-phenyl-oxazole-4-carboxamide. Given the presence of an amide bond in the fragment, a terminal alkyne was installed to form the desired amide bond by condensation of propargyl amine with 2-phenyl-oxazole-4-carboxylic acid.","Triazole derivatives of the 2-phenyl-oxazole-4-carboxamide fragment were synthesized using the CuAAC reaction according to the protocols shown in Scheme 1. \u03b2-hydroxy amides 5a-c were synthesized through EDC-mediated coupling of benzoic acid derivatives 4a-c to the benzyl ester of serine. One-pot dehydrative cyclization and oxidation of the \u03b2-hydroxy amides with diethylaminosulfurtrifluoride (DAST) and DBU\/BrCClyielded oxazoles 6a-c. Catalytic hydrogenation of the benzyl esters provided carboxylic acids 7a-c. Carbodiimide coupling of 7a-c with propargyl amine produced terminal alkynes 8a-c. In a separate synthetic pathway, a series of benzyl azides, 11a-d, was synthesized by treating the corresponding benzyl bromides 10a-d with sodium azide in DMSO (Scheme 2). As necessary, the benzyl bromides were synthesized from alcohols. In the convergent synthetic step, mixing terminal alkynes 8a-c with benzyl azides 11a-d in the presence of a catalytic amount of Cu(l) efficiently and regioselectively produced 1,4-substituted triazoles 9a-l. Aqueous CuAAC conditions (HO\/t-BuOH, 2:1) were utilized instead of organic reaction conditions because the aqueous conditions facilitated precipitation of the products with high purity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"70.36mm","wi":"155.79mm","file":"US08268874-20120918-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"64.01mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US08268874-20120918-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Structure-activity relationship studies later demonstrated that the 2-aryl-4-carboxamide oxazole could be replaced by a relatively simple aryl carboxamide.

it is believed that the anti-cancer activity of various disclosed compounds disclosed herein is due to antimitotic activity. As shown in , confocal microscopy of cells treated with the 1,2,3-triazoles showed fragmented mitotic spindles, which is characteristic of antimicrotubule compounds. In agreement with these results,  shows that compound 9c (ND-6732) results in cell cycle arrest at the G2M phase of mitosis.  shows the results of a tubulin polymerization assay, which demonstrates potent inhibition of tubulin polymerization by the 1,2,3-triazoles ().","In another embodiment, a method for treating cancer in a subject is provided. The method includes selecting a subject having or at risk for developing a cancer that responds to antimitotic therapy, and administering to the subject a therapeutically effective dose of at least one compound disclosed herein.","Although the anti-cancer compounds disclosed herein can be used to treat a wide variety of cancers in animal and human subjects, the compounds are particularly effective at treating CNS cancers such as neuroblastomas, renal cell cancers, melanomas, leukemias, colon cancers, breast cancers, ovarian cancers, prostate cancers, and non-small cell lung cancers.","As used herein, the term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d includes a quantity of a specified compound (such as one of the oxazole- or triazole-containing anti-cancer agents disclosed herein, for instance compound 9c (ND-6732)) required to achieve a desired effect in a subject being treated. For instance, this may be the amount necessary to treat a cancer, such as a CNS cancer, melanoma, renal cell cancer, leukemia, colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer in a subject, or a dose sufficient to prevent advancement, or to cause regression of a disease (such as the tumor), or which is capable of relieving symptoms caused by a disease, such as pain, inflammation, neurological symptoms, or fatigue.","Various dosage ranges and administration schedules may be adopted for therapeutic treatment of cancers in animal and human subjects with the anti-cancer agents disclosed herein. In an embodiment, such a therapeutically effective amount of active component may be in the range of about 0.1 to about 100 mg\/kg, or more preferably about 3.0 to about 50 mg\/kg, of body weight\/day. Such dosages may vary depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity, type, stage, grade, or location of the cancer being treated, and the particular compound being used.","In some embodiments, the anti-cancer agent may be administered in conjunction with one or more other anti-cancer agents, such as alkylating agents, such as nitrogen mustards (for example, chlorambucil, chlormethine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and melphalan), nitrosoureas (for example, carmustine, fotemustine, lomustine, and streptozocin), platinum compounds (for example, carboplatin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and bbr3464), busulfan, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, procarbazine, temozolomide, thiotepa, and uramustine; antimetabolites, such as folic acid (for example, methotrexate, pemetrexed, and raltitrexed), purine (for example, cladribine, clofarabine, fludarabine, mercaptopurine, and tioguanine), pyrimidine (for example, capecitabine), cytarabine, fluorouracil, and gemcitabine; plant alkaloids, such as podophyllum (for example, etoposide, and teniposide), taxane (for example, docetaxel and paclitaxel), vinca (for example, vinblastine, vincristine, vindesine, and vinorelbine); cytotoxic\/antitumor antibiotics, such as anthracycline family members (for example, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone, and valrubicin), bleomycin, hydroxyurea, and mitomycin; topoisomerase inhibitors, such as topotecan and irinotecan; monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab, gemtuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab; photosensitizers, such as aminolevulinic acid, methyl aminolevulinate, porfimer sodium, and verteporfin; cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-27; and other agents, such as alitretinoin, altretamine, amsacrine, anagrelide, arsenic trioxide, asparaginase, bexarotene, bortezomib, celecoxib, denileukin diftitox, erlotinib, estramustine, gefitinib, hydroxycarbamide, imatinib, pentostatin, masoprocol, mitotane, pegaspargase, and tretinoin.","In some embodiments, the anti-cancer agent (for instance, compound 9c (ND-6732)) may be administered systemically, whereas in other embodiments the anti-cancer agent may be administered locally. An effective dose of a disclosed anti-cancer agent may be administered systemically in a variety of ways. For instance, systemic administration may be by injection, for instance intravenous, intra-arterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intra-peritoneal injection. Systemic administration also may include transdermal or inhalational administration. By way of example, one method of administration to the lungs of an individual may be by inhalation through the use of a nebulizer or inhaler. For example, the anti-cancer agent may be formulated in an aerosol or particulate and drawn into the lungs using a standard nebulizer well known to those skilled in the art. Transdermal administration may be accomplished, for example, by application of a topical cream or ointment or by using a transdermal patch.","An effective amount of an anti-cancer agent may be administered in a single dose, or in multiple doses, for example daily, or every four, eight, or twelve hours, during a course of treatment. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-cancer agent may be administered as a single pulse dose, as a bolus dose, or as pulse doses administered over time. In specific, non-limiting examples, pulse doses of an anti-cancer agent may be administered during the course of a day, during the course of a week, or during the course of a month. In some embodiments, the anti-cancer agent may be administered to the subject on a schedule that includes several daily doses of the anti-cancer agent, followed by a withdrawal period, for example to reduce toxicity. For instance, in certain embodiments, the anti-cancer agent may be administered daily for two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more days in a row, followed by a period in which the drug may not be administered for one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more days. This cycle may be repeated until the desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example tumor regression or remission. In certain examples, the cycle may be repeated from about two to about ten times, or even more.","In some embodiments, the anti-cancer agent may be administered locally. In certain embodiments, this may be accomplished by local injection into the body part that is affected by the cancer, for example by injecting or infusing the anti-cancer agent directly into the tumor. In other embodiments, local administration may be accomplished by implanting a sustained-release device such as a pump or a micropump, or sustained-release implant, such as a bead or gel that contains the anti-cancer agent and slowly releases the drug into the desired area over time.","Although certain embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that a wide variety of alternate and\/or equivalent embodiments or implementations calculated to achieve the same purposes may be substituted for the embodiments shown and described without departing from the scope. Those with skill in the art will readily appreciate that embodiments may be implemented in a very wide variety of ways.
