No. 11\/586,197 filed Oct. 25, 2006 and published as US Patent Application Publication US 2007\/0105972 on May 10, 2007 (hereinafter Doyle II), the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","This invention was made with Government support under grant P41EB002503 awarded by the National Institutes of Health and grant CTS-0239012 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Spherical colloidal particles are ubiquitous in drug delivery, in vivo and in vitro diagnostics, as well as additives in almost every industry (food, cosmetics, paints, etc). The ability of these particles to accurately interact with biological organisms, cells and molecules in a complex mixture or in vivo is crucial in both basic research and clinical settings. The vast majority of particles used in suspension arrays are optically encoded latex microspheres with diameters between 0.3 and 10 microns (1 micron=10meters) that can be interrogated and decoded with laser-based flow cytometry (measurement of cell sized particles). Optical encoding is accomplished by swelling the spheres with fluorescent organic dyes with different emission spectra. While recent advances in the field of colloid synthesis have produced anisotropic (non-spherical) particles, the ability to independently control size\/shape, chemistry, and flexibility has not been demonstrated. Current methods for altering flexibility of colloids rely upon using different materials to synthesize the particles. For instance, wax can be used to create softer colloidal particles; but wax lacks the flexible chemistry necessary for a variety of applications. There is not a single colloidal system known to the authors that brings together independent control of size\/shape, chemistry, and flexibility.","Applicants have recognized a need to independently control size\/shape, chemistry, and flexibility of colloids for biological interactions. Techniques are provided to produce and use non-spherical colloidal particles with independently tuned size, shape, flexibility, and chemical properties.","In one set of embodiments, a pre-polymer mixture, for forming hydrogel particles, includes a percentage of PEGDA selected to impart a predetermined stiffness to the particles. The mixture also includes a percentage of acrylic acid selected independently to impart a capacity to bind to a target affinity molecule. The mixture also includes a percentage of photo-initiator to polymerize PEGDA upon exposure to a light source to impart an independently selected target size or shape or both to the particles.","In another set of embodiments, a particle of a particular shape includes PEGDA, an active substance and PEG. A total amount of PEG, PEGDA and active substance is between about 30 percent by volume and about 95 percent per volume of the particle.","In another set of embodiments, a method includes providing a pre-polymer mixture and exposing the pre-polymer mixture to the light source shaped by a mask having a particular shape to produce particles that exhibit the particular shape. The pre-polymer mixture includes a first fraction and a remaining fraction. The first fraction comprises PEGDA in an amount selected to impart a predetermined stiffness to a particle produced by the method, PEG, and an active substance. The remaining fraction comprises a photo-initiator to polymerize PEGDA upon exposure to a light source.","In another set of embodiments, composition comprises a particle of a particular shape. The particle comprises PEGDA, an active substance and PEG. A total amount of PEG, PEGDA and active substance is from about 30 to about 95 percent by volume of the particle.","In another set of embodiments, a ring shaped hydrogel particle has a diameter and flexibility of a red blood cell.","In another set of embodiments, a method includes providing a pre-polymer mixture, exposing the pre-polymer mixture to a light source shaped by a mask to produce particles that exhibit a ring shape having a size of a red blood cell, and administering the particles into a bloodstream of an animal. The pre-polymer mixture includes a first fraction and a remaining fraction. The first fraction comprises PEGDA in an amount selected to impart a predetermined stiffness comparable to stiffness of red blood cells to a particle produced by the method, PEG, and an active substance. The remaining fraction comprises a photo-initiator to polymerize PEGDA upon exposure to a light source.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","A method and apparatus are described for producing and using tunable hydrogel particles. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that some embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the illustrated embodiments.","Some embodiments are described below in the context of producing and using microparticles having at least one dimension no greater than 500 micrometers (\u03bcm, also called microns, 1 \u03bcm=10meters) for drug delivery in a bloodstream. However, the invention is not limited to this context. In other embodiments, the apparatus, particles, or method, or some combination, are used to detect or quantify or deliver substances to targets or add properties to articles of manufacture such as paints, cosmetics, food and medicine. As used herein targets may include biological entities such as proteins, nucleic acids, cytokines, lipids, organelles, whole cells, enzymes, antibodies, pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and toxins including those that could be used as bioterror threats, or any range of chemicals from polymers to small molecules. As used in the figures \u201csubject\u201d includes an animal subject, preferably a human, a biological sample, an article of manufacture (contacted with the particles).","In various embodiments, detection and quantification are based on fluorescence, chemiluminescence, magnetic properties, radioactivity, radio frequency, electrical resistance, opacity, or colorimetry, among other means. For optical approaches, single or multiple wavelengths may be used. In addition, multiple detectors or excitation sources may be used.","Drugs refer to any substance introduced for delivery to the target or that binds to a target, including any therapeutic agent such as chemotherapy agents, radioactive elements, and mechanical objects. Active substances include drugs, detection labels including fluorophores, acrylic acid (AA) and other acrylate chemistries such as acrylate monomers used to form acrylate polymers including acrylic acid, butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, and TMPTA methacrylate.","Some specific applications include drug discovery, drug delivery, biomarker discovery, target segregation or filtering, expression profiling, combinatorial chemistry, clinical diagnostics, or monitoring environmental samples for microorganisms or chemical agents, or introducing properties to articles of manufacture such as paints, cosmetics, foods and medicines.","As used herein a microparticle is a particle with at least one dimension in a range from about 0.1 micrometers (\u03bcm, also called microns, 1 \u03bcm=10meters) to about 500 microns. The dimensions of a particle size are characterized by a length greater than a width greater than a thickness.","Colloids are ubiquitous in industrial processes and products, pharmaceuticals, and the medical field. Until now, the colloids used in these fields have been spherical and their mechanical properties have been completely tied to the materials used to synthesize them. For instance, polystyrene colloids are the gold standard for biomedical research where the colloids can be functionalized with bio-molecules and used to assay for specific cells in a cellular sample. Polystyrene however, is a material with only a single stiffness (it is not possible to create \u201chard\u201d or \u201csoft\u201d polystyrene colloids) and the commercially available colloids are only spherical, limiting their utility in a number of ways. Spheres by definition are the lowest surface area object for a given volume and rigid spheres only contact planar surfaces (or other spheres) at a single contact point. This is the poorest possible design for binding to cells (one of the major uses of polystyrene spheres) since the binding relies on high surface area contact.","The size and shape of microparticles strongly influences their uptake by macrophage cells. A particularly interesting length scale for polymeric particles is the cellular length scale. However, an important feature of cells and other cell-sized biological entities is their flexibility. Among the more interesting, and well studied cell types is the red blood cell (RBC), especially the human red blood cell. RBCs possess the ability to deform and squeeze through small contractions (capillaries) during circulation through the vascular system. One application is to create synthetic particles with similar attributes to RBCs for diagnosis or treatment of conditions in an organism, such as in the human body. Currently, a method does not exist for creating RBC shaped particles with tunable flexibility. Furthermore, the utility of such particles is in part due to the chemical properties of the particle that permit it to interact or not interact with cells and entities encountered in the bloodstream. Currently, a method does not exist for creating RBC sized particles with independently tunable flexibility and chemical properties. In other applications, particles with independently tunable size, shape, flexibility and chemical properties also are desirable.","With the embodiments described below, disk shaped colloids can be manufactured with a much higher surface area than spheres. Furthermore, the disks can be made very mechanically flexible so that they can bend when they come into contact with a potential binding surface, thus increasing the surface area for contact. A preferred shape is and flexibility is that of the red blood cell. Particles of other shapes and tunable flexibility can also be manufactured. Additionally, the chemistry for functionalizing the disks can be made identical to that of the polystyrene spheres or for many other applications.","A hydrogel (also called aquagel) is a network of polymer chains that are water-insoluble. A polymer is a large molecule (macromolecule) composed of repeating structural units (called monomers) typically connected by covalent chemical bonds. Hydrogels are highly absorbent (they can contain over 99% water) and possess a degree of flexibility due to their significant water content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","115","115","130"]},"The system  includes a microfluidic device  having a selected hollow cross-sectional geometry with at least one dimension less than 500 \u03bcm. The example microfluidic device  exhibits a rectangular cross section but a wide range of other cross section geometries can be employed in other embodiments. In one example embodiment, the microfluidic device channel width is characterized by an inner channel width of, e.g., between about 100 nanometers (m, 1 nm=10meters) and about 1 millimeter (m, 1 mm=10meters), with channel walls having a thickness of, e.g., between about 100 \u03bcm and 10 mm, and with a channel length of, e.g., between about 1 mm and 100 mm. The microfluidic device is configured to accept a stream of a pre-polymer mixture  that is directed to the hollow cross section, or channel, of the microfluidic device for passage through the device. The microfluidic device is formed of any suitable material. In the example arrangement of  the microfluidic device is constructed of, e.g., polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or other suitable material.","The pre-polymer mixture  can include a range of constituents, as explained in detail below. In an illustrated embodiment, at least one of the constituents is provided as a liquid-phase monomer that can be polymerized by a selected polymerization process, e.g., photo-polymerization, thermal polymerization, or other process. In the example system of  the pre-polymer mixture includes a photo-polymerizable monomer and a photosensitive initiator species (called a photo-initialization ingredient). One example of a suitable photo-polymerizable monomer is poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA), having a molecular weight in a range between about 50 and about 10000 (called PEGDA herein), with 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propan-1-one employed as the photosensitive initiator species. The monomer stream can also include other selected monomers such as PEG, as well as particles, molecules, porogens, and other species. The monomer stream advantageously includes one or more liquid-phase components that enable passage of the stream through the microfluidic device ","At one or more points along the microfluidic device is provided stimulation for enabling the formation and polymerization of particles in the monomer stream. For the example of  in which the monomer stream includes a photo-polymerizable monomer PEGDA, at one or more selected points along the length of the microfluidic device there is provided a source  of illumination  that is directed toward the microfluidic device . The walls of the microfluidic device are preferably substantially transparent to the wavelength of the illumination . Visible light, ultraviolet (UV) light, infrared (IR) light, or other wavelength of light can be employed as suited for a selected monomer species. For the PEGDA, UV illumination is a suitable polymerizing radiation.","The polymerizing radiation is shaped in correspondence with desired particle shapes. For example, interposed between the illumination source and the microfluidic device is provided one or more lithographic masks or other lithographic system for shaping the illumination. In the example of , there is provided a dark field lithographic mask  including one or more shapes  desired for particles to be synthesized. As shown in  the mask can include a plurality of distinct shapes or can include a number of replications of a single shape.","In the illustrated embodiment, a lens system  is interposed between the lithographic mask and the microfluidic device if desired for controlling magnification, focus, or other aspect of the illumination  directed through the mask. The illumination exits the lens system and is directed to the microfluidic device. In accordance with various embodiments, the illumination is temporally controlled to provide pulses of illumination of a selected duration. A shutter  or other mechanism for controlling the duration of illumination is advantageously provided in a suitable configuration with the lens system  and illumination source . The duration of each illumination pulse is set based on the flow rate of the stream, the polymerizing characteristics of the monomers in the stream, and the desired shape of a particle. The flow rate of the monomer stream is also controlled, and can be stopped, in coordination with the temporal control of the illumination. The illumination pulses can be provided as a sequence of pulses, each of a selected duration, or as a single long-duration pulse, as prescribed for a given application.","Exposing microfluidic device  to a pulse of the shaped illumination  polymerizes mask-defined shaped microstructure particles  (also called microstructures or polymerized microstructures or polymerized particles or hydrogel particles) directly in the stream of the pre-polymer mixture. The illumination exposure simultaneously defines the shapes of polymeric particles and polymerizes the shaped particles. This dual lithography-polymerization action occurs in the continuous phase of the stream; that is, the one or more liquid-phase constituents in the stream operate as a continuous phase of the stream and are themselves polymerized in some embodiments. Thus the polymerized particles resulting from the dual lithography-polymerization action include polymeric material from the continuous phase of the monomer stream in such embodiments.","As stated above, flow of the stream can be controlled in a coordinated manner with the illumination exposure to, in turn, control characteristics of the polymerization. The flow rate and exposure duration are preferably together selected such that there is sufficient dwell time of a given volume of the monomer stream at the site of illumination exposure for substantially full polymerization of mask-defined shaped particles in the stream. If desired, the stream flow can be substantially stopped in coordination with illumination pulse exposure. With continuous monomer stream flow, a high synthesis through-put, e.g., 100 particles per second and greater, can be achieved. Such can further be enhanced with the inclusion of multiple illumination points along the length of the microfluidic device, in the manner described above, and by increasing the illumination area and the corresponding number of microstructure shapes projected to the increased area.","Once particles  are polymerized in the stream, the particles  advect through un-polymerized monomer stream or other liquid phase through the microfluidic device. A set  of such particles are schematically shown in  downstream of the lithography-polymerization point. The volume of un-polymerized liquid phase constituents remaining in the stream after the lithography-polymerization step operates to conduct the particles through and out of the microfluidic device . A reservoir  is provided for collecting the output stream , which includes a population  of particles. As can be recognized, if only one transparent mask shape is employed, then the particle population is homogeneous, and preferably is mono-disperse.","The synthesized particles are rinsed in the reservoir or, e.g., taken by pipette into another container for rinsing. For example, the stream including the particle population is taken by pipette from the reservoir into an eppendorf tube, suspended in a buffer with a surfactant to prohibit agglomeration, and centrifuged to retrieve the particles from the stream. The particle population can then be employed for a selected application.","According to various embodiments, the contents of the pre-polymer mixture  determine, at least in part, the flexibility and chemistry of the synthesized particles output by the system .  is a block diagram that illustrates measurements of flexibility of particles, according to an embodiment. These measurements allow the flexibility of the synthesized particles to be quantitatively determined based on the contents of the pre-polymer mixture. The measurements include a constricted channel  with a wide portion having a width  greater than the greatest dimension of particles to be measured and a constricted portion having a width  smaller than a greatest dimension of the particles to be measured. The thickness of the channel, perpendicular to the view of , is no greater than the constricted width .","Particles , , , (collectively referenced hereinafter as particles ) are suspended in a fluid  that is forced to flow in the direction indicated by dashed arrow  by a pressure gradient. In the constricted portion of the channel the particle might become deformed in order to pass through the constriction (in vivo such a constriction includes a small capillary through which the particle must pass) compared to the size or shape of the particle in the wide portion. For example, particles , are deformed while particles and are un-deformed.","The pressure difference to drive the particles through the constricted portion of the channel is taken as a measure of the flexibility of the particles. The greater the minimum pressure difference to drive the particles through the constricted portion, the less flexible, e.g., the stiffer, the particle. The pressure difference is determined by two or more pressure sensors , (collectively referenced hereinafter as pressure sensors ) disposed at opposite ends of the constricted portion.","A separate measure of flexibility is based on the amount of deformation of the particle in the constricted portion of the channel , as described in more detail below with reference to . The greater the deformation, the greater the flexibility (less stiff) the particle. To measure the deformation in some embodiments, an optical imager , such as an analog or digital camera or charge coupled device (CCD) array is directed to at least a portion of the constricted channel . These measurements combine the flexibility of the material of the particle, e.g., as measured or described by the elastic modulus of the material, with the flexibility imparted by the structure, e.g., rings, disks or crosses, among others.","The pressure sensor and image data are reported to a controller  to determine the pressure difference or deformation or both to characterize the flexibility of particles . In some embodiments the controller is an analog or digital computer with an analog to digital converter as desirable to convert digital or analog data from the pressure sensors  and imager . An example computer is described in more detail below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C"],"b":["240","240","240","240","242","241","240","242","242","242"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","a ","a ","b ","a ","b.

In some embodiments, the shape is a flattened oval or rectangle  in a side view of the shortest dimension with a shortest size represented by a thickness. A cross section closer to the center is shown as view .","An advantage of selecting the flexibility of a particle is to tailor the particle for a particular use. A stiff spherical particle contacts a target at a limited contact region that approaches a single point. A disk can contact a flat target along an entire face. A flexible particle can contact even a curved target along an extended contact region.  is a block diagram that illustrates extent of contact for a flexible particle  on a curved target object  in a side view, according to an embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["302","304","312","314","316","318","312","312","314","316"]},"The pressure change along the direction of flow is plotted in graph  that shares the distance axis  but uses a pressure (P) axis  in which pressure is measured in millimeters of Mercury (mmHg, 1 mmHg=133.3223684211 Newtons per square meter, also called a Pascal, Pa).

The stiffness of particles was discovered also to be related to the amount of cross linking during polymerization among monomers in the pre-polymer mixture. The amount of cross linking affects hydrogel swelling, and flexibility, in solution.  is a block diagram that illustrates different extents of cross-linking in different microparticles, according to various embodiments. In solution a hydrogel particle is swollen as demonstrated by particle . When the particle is dried, e.g., all water is removed, the particle shrinks. A particle formed from a pre-polymer mixture with only 10% monomers shrinks more than particles formed from pre-polymer mixtures with 20% and 40% monomers, as indicated by particle , particle  and particle , respectively. The additional cross-linking is believed to lead to increased stiffness of the particle.","According to various embodiments, the stiffness of hydrogel particles is controlled over several orders of magnitude by varying the relative amounts of Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (called PEGDA herein) and Poly(ethylene glycol) (called PEG herein) in the pre-polymer mixture. By using a pre-polymer with a higher proportion of the cross-linking active monomer agent (PEGDA), it was found to be possible to generate hydrogel particles with higher cross-linking densities that are more resistant to deformation. In the following embodiments Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate of molecular weight 700 (called PEGDA 700 herein) and Poly(ethylene glycol) of molecular weight 200 (called PEG 200 herein) are used. However, in other embodiments other molecular weights may be used, such as molecular weights in a range from about 50 to about 10,000. The presence of PEG without diacrylate, e.g., PEG 200, forms a semi-interpenetrating network to the resultant particle, which increases the effective surface area of the particle in solution.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["510","512","514","516"],"sup":["\u22123 ","\u22123 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["520","512","524","328","526"]},"In another set of embodiments, acrylic acid was included in the first fraction of the pre-polymer mixture to provide a functional group, such as a carboxyl group, that allows the particles to bind to one or more molecules each with an affinity for one or more targets (called herein \u201ctarget affinity molecules\u201d such as antibodies or receptors or antigens), thereby imparting variations in the chemical properties or functionality of the particles, as described in more detail below. Acrylic acid (prop-2-enoic acid) is an organic compound with the formula CH2CHCO2H. It is the simplest unsaturated carboxylic acid, consisting of a vinyl group connected directly to a carboxylic acid terminus. Acrylate chemistries for modifying the surface of a particle are well known in the art. In these embodiments, the pre-polymer mixture includes 20% by volume aqueous buffer and 15% by volume of DAROCUR 1173 as described above. However, a different first fraction can also be used, for example one that includes: 1% by volume Rhod-A as a fluorophore; acrylic acid (AA) in concentrations from about 1% to about 40% to alter the chemical properties of the particles; and variable relative fractions of PEGDA 700 and PEG 200 in order to tune the flexibility of the hydrogel particles. In some embodiments, other acrylate (AR) chemistries such as biodegradable cross-linker molecules are added to create colloids that degrade over time, which is an important consideration for drug delivery applications. In embodiments with Rhod-A or AA added to the pre-polymer mixture, the percentage of PEG (e.g., PEG 20) was lowered to compensate in the first fraction.","Certain embodiments are directed to biodegradable hydrogel particles. Applicants have described one such hydrogel, a diacrylated triblock copolymer composed of poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA), that has been extensively characterized as a degradable tissue scaffold. (See Hwang, D. K., Oakey, J., Toner, M., Arthur, J., Anseth, K., Lee, S., Zeiger, A., Van Vliet, K., and Doyle, P. S., \u201cStop-Flow Lithography for the Production of Shape-Evolving Degradable Microgel Particles\u201d, 131, pp 4499-4504, 2009, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein). Diacrylate PLA-b-PEG-b-PLA is a highly cross-linked, water-swollen gel network that degrades through the isotropic hydrolysis of hydrolytically labile ester linkages in the PLA block. As degradation proceeds, water content of the gel increases exponentially until complete dissolution of the network is reached. The products of degradation are poly(acrylic acid), PEG, and lactic acid. Other biodegradable cross linking reagents can be used in the present invention, including those described in Buisman, G. J. H., \u201cBiodegradable binders and cross-linking agents from renewable resources,\u201d , Springer Boston, v82, No. 3, March, 1999, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, except as the terminology conflicts with that explicitly set forth herein.","The presence of AA in the reaction results in free carboxyl groups cross-linked into the backbone of the polymers in the particle. Carboxyl chemistry is a well established way to functionalize colloids with proteins and antibodies. In various embodiments, the particle surfaces and pores can be modified using any basic physical chemical method, including basic organic and inorganic coupling chemistries known in the art, both with or in place of AA.","The sizes and shapes of the particles were defined independently by photo-masks and the polymerization was done using SFL. For the experimental results presented next, four shapes were polymerized, e.g., disk and ring shaped particles as shown in  and , respectively, with about 8 \u03bcm outer diameters and 2 \u03bcm thicknesses. These shaped particles were forced through microfluidic contractions with channel dimensions of 4 \u03bcm\u00d74 \u03bcm in cross-section, on the order of capillaries in a human vascular system.","The pressure difference (e.g., pressure difference ) required to push the shaped particles through the constricted regions was plotted as a function of the concentration of reactive PEGDA 700 in the pre-polymer solution.  is a graph  that illustrates pressure differential to transport four different shaped microparticles through micro-constrictions, according to various embodiments. The horizontal axis  is PEGDA 700 concentration in percent by volume; and the vertical axis is pressure difference (e.g., ) across the constricted region in mmHg. Data points for disk-shaped particles, data points for ring shaped particles, data points for cross shaped particles and data points for S shaped particles are shown. By changing particle geometry slightly (e.g., between disk shapes and S shapes) and changing the concentration of reactive PEGDA 700, the flexibility of the resulting hydrogel particles with variable chemistry represented by the AA content was changed about four orders of magnitude. The minimum pressure differences of less than about 1 mmHg are physiological while the stiffest particles demand pressures of hundreds of mmHg. This ability to tune the mechanical properties of colloidal particles while maintaining independent control over their chemistry has not been previously demonstrated.","Observations of images indicated that stiff disk shaped particles unable to pass through under significant pressure drops fold into \u201ctaco\u201d shapes within a contraction.

An infrared detector serving as communications interface  receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus  carries the information to memory  from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory  may optionally be stored on storage device , either before or after execution by the processor .","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings and in which like reference numerals refer to similar elements and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 7A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 7C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 7D","FIG. 7F"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 11A","FIG. 11B","FIG. 11C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 11D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
