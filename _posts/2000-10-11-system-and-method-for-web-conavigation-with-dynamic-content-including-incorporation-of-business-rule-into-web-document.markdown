{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to providing communications between users over a network. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system for providing co-navigation of web documents with dynamic content.","2. Background Information","Today, people may jointly browse the same web site while being miles away from each other. For instance, a customer and a customer service representative located remotely from each other may jointly view online product demonstrations, fill out forms on the Internet, or walk through online transactions. However, existing co-browsing services that provide these joint online activities have some deficiencies. Typically, the available co-browsing systems fall short because they are based on \u201cURL pushing,\u201d a technology that allows users to \u201cco-browse\u201d a web page by allowing one user to send (i.e., f\u201cpush\u201d) this web page to a browser of another user.","URL Pushing works well with static web content, but because of failures inherent in its architecture, URL pushing has trouble handling dynamic web content. In addition, URL pushing does not allow the participants of the co-browsing session to interact with each other in real time. For instance, the users may not simultaneously go from one web page to another by simply entering a new URL or clicking on a link in the web page. Instead, when one wishes to access a different web page, this participant must change the location of the other browser by \u201cpushing\u201d the new URL to the other participant. Similarly, the users cannot jointly complete a web form in real time. That is, when text is entered into a web form, this text is not displayed to the other participant until the first participant pushes the web page with the text to the other user. When submitting a web form using URL pushing technology, often the web site records duplicate transactions. For example, if a customer buys a computer during a URL pushing-based session with a customer service representative, two or more computer orders would be submitted to the company web site.","Another problem arises when a web page to be co-browsed has dynamic content, i.e., content that may change each time it is viewed depending on the user input or cookies. Dynamically generated web pages, which are used by most web sites, may be created using Perl, ASP, Cold Fusion, Servlets, WebObjects, Broadvision, etc . . . URL pushing technology does not support dynamically generated web pages, as those pages show different information for the same URL. Similarly, URL pushing does not support cookies that are used by many web sites to create customized web pages based on the user's past preferences and to keep track of the user's movements within the web site. Furthermore, the URL pushing technology fails to support personalized sections of a web site, i.e., sections requiring a user to enter the user name and password to log in. As a result, web pages with personalized content cannot be displayed on multiple browsers. Accordingly, companies cannot use existing co-browsing services based on URL pushing\u2014unless they are willing to remove such functionality from their web sites. Thus, the currently available co-browsing systems do not provide sufficient functionality due to the limitations of the URL pushing technology.","Therefore, it would be advantageous to create an alternative co-browsing mechanism, which will provide synchronized, interactive co-navigation of dynamic web pages without imposing limitations on technologies used by companies in creating the web pages.","A method and system for exchanging information over a communications network are described. According to one embodiment, an exemplary method of the invention includes connecting two or more clients to a proxy over the communications network, activating a shared session between the clients, and enabling co-navigation of one or more web pages with dynamic content by the clients during the shared session.","A method and system for exchanging information over a communications network are described. In the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.","Some portions of the detailed descriptions that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of processing blocks leading to a desired result. The processing blocks are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","The present invention also relates to apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and each coupled to a computer system bus.","The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.","Overview","The present invention provides a method and apparatus for \u201cco-navigating\u201d web pages by two or more clients. Co-navigation may include jointly viewing online product demonstrations, filling out web forms, cycling through online transactions, and any other joint online activity of two or more remotely located clients.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00028","num":"00028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","120","120","120","110","110"]},"In one embodiment, co-navigation service  communicates to clients  and  and a web site . Clients  and  represent any device that may enable user's access to data. For simplicity,  shows only two clients, client  and client , that can communicate to co-navigation service . However, it will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that co-navigation service  may communicate to a various number of clients and that a wide variety of client devices may be used with this invention without loss of generality. Such devices may include, for example, a conventional computer system, a network computer or thin client device (e.g., WebTV Networks\u2122 Internet terminal or Oracle\u2122 NC), a laptop or palm-top computing device (e.g., Palm Pilot\u2122), a digital consumer device (e.g., a digital TV, a digital camcorder, or a \u201ckitchen\u201d computer\u201d), etc. In one embodiment, clients  and  may have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to allow users to access data. GUIs may include, for example, Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, UNIX Motif, or UNIX OPENLOOK. Clients  and  may be connected to co-navigation service  and web site  in various ways. In one embodiment, clients  and  may be connected to co-navigation service  and web site  through wide area network . In an alternate embodiment (not shown in FIG. ), a client, such as client  or client , may be directly connected to co-navigation service  or through a modem in a conventional way. In yet another embodiment, any or all the clients can communicate with co-navigation service  and web site  via a wireless carrier. In one embodiment, any client may be a part of an organization's internal network which may be protected from external access by a firewall.","In one embodiment, when the World-Wide Web (WWW) portion of the Internet is used for wide area network , the HTTP, HTTPS, TCIP\/IP and UDP protocols and a web-based programming language, such as HTML, JavaScript, DHTML, VBScript, Active X, Applet, Flash, XML, XSL, may be used to communicate data between web site , co-navigation service  and clients  and . In this configuration, clients  and  may use a client application program known as a web browser such as the Netscape\u2122 Navigator\u2122 published by Netscape Corporation of Mountain View, Calif., the Internet Explorer\u2122 published by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., the user interface of America On-Line\u2122, or the web browser or a web language translator of any other conventional supplier. Using such conventional browsers and the World-Wide Web, clients  and  may access graphical and textual data or video, audio, or tactile data provided by web site  and\/or co-navigation service . Conventional means exist by which clients  and  may supply information to web site  and\/or co-navigation service  through the World-Wide Web  and web site  and co-navigation service  may return processed data to clients  and .","A web site  represents any remote web site having a collection of web pages, such as web page . In one embodiment, web page  has \u201cdynamic content\u201d. Dynamic content refers to the web page content that may change each time it is viewed depending on the user input. For example, when the user enters a uniform resource locator (URL) to retrieve a certain web page from web site , a different web page may be displayed to the user depending on the user's geographic location, time of day, previous pages viewed by the user, profile of the user, user login, user session, cookie of the user, or any other information previously provided by the user. Dynamic content may be created using both client and server languages, such as HTML, JavaScript, DHTML, VHTML, VBScript, Active X, Applet, Flash, XML, XSL on the client and Servlet,s CGI scripts, etc. on the server. Additionally, the web page dynamic content may be dependent on data retrieved from a user cookie. A cookie represents a small amount of \u201cpersistent\u201d information, which is generated by a web server and is stored on the computer of the user when the user requests a web page from the server. Subsequently, each time the user sends a request for information to this web server, the cookie is sent back to the server along with the user request. The cookie may be used to prepare customized web pages, identify users, or identify user sessions. For instance, when the user enters web site , the user may be asked to fill out a form providing such information as user name and interests. When the user submits this information, a cookie is sent to the user computer and stored there for later use. The next time the user goes to web site , the cookie is sent to web site  which uses it to present the user with a customized web page. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, the user might see a welcome page with his or her name on it. Cookies can also be used to help enable shopping carts, logins, etc.","When client  wishes to initiate a co-navigation session pertaining to web page  with another client (e.g., client ), current co-browsing techniques fail to provide co-navigation of dynamic portions of web page . The current techniques typically use \u201cURL pushing\u201d to enable co-browsing of a web page. URL pushing initiates a co-browsing session by allowing one user to \u201cpush\u201d (i.e., send) a web page to another user. However, when the web site being co-browsed includes POST commands (which are used to provide a higher level of security), URL pushing fails because different web pages have identical URLs, relying on data passed to the server outside the URL to determine the content. Other major limitations of URL pushing technology include inability to provide synchronized co-navigation of web pages and secured exchange of data (e.g., using the secure socket layer (SSL) technology) between participants of the co-navigation session, as well as inability to jointly fill web forms, to display web pages with personalized content to multiple participants, and to support cookies.","The present invention overcomes the above limitations by using co-navigation service  that acts as a proxy between the participants of a co-navigation session and web site . Specifically, when a client (e.g., client ) sends a message indicating a willingness to begin a shared session, co-navigation service  receives this message, activates the shared session between client  and another client (e.g., client ), and enables co-navigation of one or more web pages  by the clients  and  during the shared session. In one embodiment, the shared session may be activated between more than two clients. In one embodiment, the participants may include one or more customers and one or more customer service representatives or sales agents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00034","num":"00034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["130","140","110"]},"Referring to , the process begins with connecting two or more clients to a proxy over a communications network (processing block ). The proxy may be co-navigation service , which acts as an intermediary between the clients and a remote web site, and is capable of generating web pages. In one embodiment, the clients are connected to the proxy upon receiving a message from one client indicating a willingness to co-navigate a web page. For instance, if the client encounters a problem while performing some online activity pertaining to a web page (e.g., filling a web form), the client may ask for help (e.g., by clicking on a \u201cHelp\u201d button), thereby indicating his or her willingness to initiate a shared session with another client. In this example, the client asking for help may be a customer, and the client providing help may be a customer service representative (CSR).","At processing block , a shared session between the clients is activated. In one embodiment, the activation process includes collecting client state information and storing this information for use during the shared session. The client state information may include a client cookie, a URL of a current web page displayed to the client, information entered into a form on that page, and any information from this web page that can be used during the shared session. For example, if the client encounters a problem while shopping online, the information indicating what items the client has already purchased may be collected and stored for use during the shared session. The activation process will be described in more detail below in conjunction with FIG. .","At processing block , processing logic in co-navigation service  enables co-navigation of one or more web documents with web content by the clients during the shared session. Web documents include web pages, word files, pdf files, flash files, etc. As discussed above, co-navigation may include jointly filling online forms, viewing online product demonstrations, cycling through online transactions, etc. Various co-navigation features will be discussed in more detail below.","Architecture of a Co-Navigation System","A co-navigation system such as co-navigation system  of  activates a shared session between two or more clients and then acts as an intermediary between the clients and a remote web site in maintaining the shared session, during which the clients perform joint online activity pertaining to one or more web page retrieved from the remote web site. One embodiment of an architecture of a co-navigation system is illustrated in FIG. .","Referring to , co-navigation system  includes software residing on each client  and several server-based systems characterized as co-navigation service . Client software consists of two components\u2014applet  and shared browser . Applet  is responsible for establishing the connection to co-navigation service  and managing the details of the co-navigation session. Shared browser  provides communication between client  and co-navigation service  during the co-navigation session. In one embodiment, both applet  and shared browser  operate within a strict security protocol (i.e., the Java sandbox).","In one embodiment, applet  is dynamically launched on client  when client  is connected to co-navigation service  and shared browser  is launched when the co-navigation session begins. In this embodiment, the client software is not persistent on client . When the co-navigation session ends, the client software removes itself from client . In one embodiment, more than two clients may participate in a shared session. These clients may include one or more customers and one or more CSRs. In this embodiment, each client includes applet  and shared browser , both of which may be dynamically launched and then removed from each client after the shared session ends.","Co-navigation service  includes one or more routing servers , one or more application servers  and one or more database servers . Routing server  manages web requests, load balancing, and routing. Routing server  is primarily responsible for setting up the co-navigation sessions, i.e., connecting various users to a specific application server . Routing implementation may be based on capacity planning and a configurable software router. In addition, routine implementation may be extended to utilize dynamic load balancing and a broader set of routing business rules, such as geography, company, specific company representatives, co-navigation session details, etc.","Application servers  are responsible for identifying clients wishing to co-navigate and connecting them in a shared session. Some of the functions performed by each application server  include managing shared sessions and processing system events, synchronizing participants within shared sessions, and providing various co-navigation features used to perform online activity pertaining to web pages retrieved from remote web site  during shared sessions. One embodiment of the application server architecture is discussed in greater detail in conjunction with .","Database server  stores all of the persistent data and is responsible for login authentication and storage of metrics. In one embodiment, login authentication is performed by authenticating the participants as either registered users or guests upon establishing a connection between client  and co-navigation service . Registered users may be required to enter a username and password to login to co-navigation service , while guest users may receive temporary usernames and do not need to enter a password. In one embodiment, database server  securely stores usernames and passwords in an encrypted form.","At the end of each co-navigation session, application server  connects to database server  to store the data associated with the session (e.g., session time, specific URLs traversed, number of session participants, etc.). This information may then be used to produce various reports for web sites to assists in their sales and customer service evaluations.","It should be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above components of co-navigation system  are shown merely to illustrate the functions performed by co-navigation service . That is, co-navigation service  may have more or less components than the components shown in FIG. .","Architecture of an application server will now be described in more detail.  are block diagrams for the application server architecture, according to one embodiment of the present invention.","Referring to , application server  includes communication drivers , session manager , web server , co-navigation engine , and server application interfaces (APIs) . Communication drivers  ensure that client applet  of  efficiently connects to application server . This client-to-server link is established in one of two ways: HTTP\/HTTPS tunneling  or a socket connection . In one embodiment, these approaches are attempted simultaneously. If socket connection  is successful, then it is used. If socket connection  fails for some reason, then standard HTTP tunneling  is used. Socket connection  is preferred because it does not require periodic polling (unlike HTTP tunneling). HTTP tunneling  may be used for connections with clients behind firewalls because firewalls can be configured to block the port which enables socket connection .","Session manager  is responsible for establishing and maintaining co-navigation sessions.  illustrates three components of session manager  which are session engine , reporting manager , and authentication module . Session engine  ensures that all of the shared sessions perform correctly. This module manages the creation and administration of the shared sessions, and keeps track of which clients are in specific sessions. Session engine  also coordinates the exchange of system messages with other application server modules. In addition, session engine  ensures that the appropriate information is stored and the security of the sessions is not compromised.","Reporting manager  stores data associated with the co-navigation session such as session time, specific URLs traversed, number of session participants, etc. This information is recorded in local memory while the sessions are in progress. This data is thenstored in the database server or delivered to a third-party system  via server API . In one embodiment, the above data is considered confidential information and is only provided to authorized users.","Authentication module  manages all user authentication and security. In one embodiment, to ensure that users are not impersonated, a unique session management key is assigned to each Internet co-navigation session. This session token may, for example, comprise 30 random alphanumeric characters (15 for the user and 15 for the session), providing approximately 150-bit encryption. Each time a link is clicked or text is entered into a web form, authentication module  verifies whether the user is a participant of the session using the session management key. If a mismatch occurs, then the associated user is rejected from the system.","Referring again to , application server  also includes a web server  that communicates requests between client shared browser  of FIG.  and co-navigation engine . In one embodiment, web server  sends all information via SSL security (e.g., 40- or 128-bit encryption).","Co-navigation engine  manages all of the co-navigation functionality within a shared session.  illustrates various components of co-navigation engine . These components include parsing and lexing engine , business rules engine , shared state manager , and pseudo client . Parsing and lexing engine  modifies standard web pages to enable their co-navigation during shared sessions. In particular, parsing and lexing engine  prepares web pages retrieved from a remote web site  to be presented to the clients participating in the shared session and converts responses generated by the clients into standard HTTP-based requests that are then sent to remote web site . While preparing a web page for display to the clients, parsing and lexing engine  relies on co-navigation rules (referred to as \u201cbusiness rules\u201d) specified by business rules engine .","Business rules engine  maintains a set of business rules that control co-navigation of web pages during the shared session. Business rules reflect companies' legal and corporate policies affecting co-navigation of companies' web sites. In one embodiment, business rules differ depending on a web site being co-navigated. One example would be web applications that request sensitive information from customers such as social security numbers; in these applications, the sensitive information needs to be hidden from the company representative during the co-browsing session. Alternatively, all or part of business rules are common for all companies using co-navigation service . For example, in e-commerce applications, companies do not want their customer service agents to complete transactions for customers (the physical world analogy is having a customer service agent sign the credit card receipt on the behalf of a customer); in this scenario, the \u201csubmit\u201d button to commit the transaction is visible to the customer but hidden from the customer service agent. In another example, users may need to enter their credit card and\/or social security numbers to complete a transaction. This is information that the users most likely would not want the CSR to be able to see. In this scenario, the user would be able to see this information as it is entered, but the CSR would not be able to, due to permissions set on the credit card and\/or social security number entry fields.","Business rules engine  cooperates with parsing and lexing module  to enforce the rules and security constraints. With business rules engine , co-navigation service  can define and administer company guidelines and policies to allow the company to implement its co-navigation rules without changing the company web site in any way.","Shared state manager  stores and manages the dynamic state information used or modified during the shared session. The dynamic state information may include cookies, web page cache, session history, etc. This information is stored in local memory while the shared session is in progress, and then deleted when the session is over.","Pseudo client  is a server-side component that emulates a client browser. Pseudo client  relays web requests to and from the web site being co-navigated, e.g., web site . This module also frequently communicates with parsing and lexing engine , where the incoming web pages are modified and new page requests are generated. In one embodiment, pseudo client  supports SSL (both 40- and 128-bit encryption) to ensure that the information exchanged with the web site is completely secure.","Returning to , application server  further includes server integration APIs  which enable third-party systems to integrate with co-navigation service . Server integration APIs  provide interfaces that allow to control and monitor the application server software from external applications. Server integration APIs  are also used by application server  to interact with database server .","Co-Navigation Features","Various features provided by co-navigation service  will now be described in more detail. As described above, co-navigation service  receives a message from client  indicating a willingness to initiate a shared session. In one embodiment, a web site may include a button (e.g., a \u201cHelp\u201d button) allowing client  to request the shared session. Upon receiving the message from client , co-navigation service  connects this client and other appropriate client(s) (via a shared key known to all clients) to application server  using client applets and activates a shared session between the clients. In one embodiment, the shared key that allows a connection of one client to one or other appropriate clients is a random temporary key generated by the server and passed from one client to another. In one embodiment, the clients include at least one customer and at least one customer service agent or sales representative.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00061","num":"00061"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["310","315"]},"Referring to , at processing block  each participant of a shared session is authenticated (processing block ). In one embodiment, a participant can be authenticated as either a registered user or a guest. The registered user may be required to enter a user name and password to login to the co-navigation service. A guest user may receive a temporary user name for the session and does not need to enter a password. In one embodiment, the authentication process is triggered by the participant activating a \u201cHelp\u201d button located on a web page or other web document.","Next, at processing block , a unique session identifier is assigned to the requested shared session. The session identifier is used to ensure that the participants of the shared session are not impersonated. In one embodiment, the session identifier is associated with the participants. Each time an event (e.g., a link is clicked, a button is pushed, or text is entered into a web form) occurs during the shared session, the session identifier is used to verify whether the user initiating the event is a participant of this session. If a mismatch occurs, the user is ejected from the system.","At processing block , client state information existing at the time the session is about to begin is collected. The client state information may include client cookie, a URL of a web page currently displayed to the client, any information from the current web page that may pertain to the shared session, the state of any form elements on the page, etc. In one embodiment, the client state information is stored on Application Server .","It should be noted that the sequence of steps shown in  can be changed without loss of generality. For instance, processing block  may be performed in parallel with processing blocks  and , or before processing blocks  and .","Further, at processing block , browsers of all the clients participating in the shared session are synchronized using the collected information. That is, all the clients participating in the shared session are presented with the same information as was displayed to the client requesting the shared session at the time he or she made this request.","Presenting a web page to the participating clients may occur upon activating the shared session as described above. Alternatively, one of the participating clients may request a new web page while the shared session is being conducted (e.g., by entering a new URL or by clicking on a link referring to a new web page). In either embodiment, before the web is presented to the participating clients, it goes through the parsing and lexing process.  is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a process for parsing and lexing a web page before presenting the web page to participants of a shared session. The process is performed by processing logic, which may comprise hardware, software, or a combination of both. The processing logic may be either in the computer systems of clients  and co-navigation service , or partially or entirely in a separate device and\/or system(s).","Referring to , the parsing and lexing process begins with identifying every dynamic event in a web page (processing block ). Dynamic events include functions within the code of a web page that enable creation of a new web page on the client side by accessing the web site being co-navigated, and various functions within the code of a web page that enable creation of web page portions on the client side without accessing the web site being co-navigated. Some examples of these latter functions are JavaScript methods (e.g., document.write, eval, etc.) which allow users to dynamically create HTML content and links as the web page loads. Other examples may include such HTML functions as onclick and mouseover events. The onclick function may be used to execute JavaScript code when a user clicks a form element or a link. The mouseover function may be used to trigger a change on an item (e.g., a graphic) in a web page when the mouse passes over it. In one embodiment, the JavaScript command \u201cOnChange\u201d or \u201cOnClick\u201d traps actions by both the CSR and the client, and pass them to each other's shared browsers. Examples of this include clicking on links, filling information into a form, and opening pop-up windows.","Next, at processing block , each link directing a dynamic event to the web site is replaced with a link directing this dynamic event to the co-navigation service. That is, the parsing and lexing process results in \u201ctrapping\u201d every dynamic event within the web page. Accordingly, when a dynamic event subsequently occurs during the shared session, the co-navigation service is aware of this event and can manipulate with it. For instance, when a customer triggers a dynamic event (e.g., by clicking on a link or a form button) during the shared session, the co-navigation service enables display of the resulting web content to all the participating clients.","At processing block , processing logic in the co-navigation service incorporates relevant business rules into the web page being modified. As discussed above, business rules reflect companies' legal and corporate policies affecting co-navigation of companies' web sites. In one embodiment, if any business rules apply to the web page being modified, these rules are incorporated into the web site.","Afterwards, at processing block , the web page is delivered to all the clients participating in the shared session. Accordingly, before the web page is displayed to the clients, it is modified to trap all dynamic events within the web page and to incorporate the applicable business rules. As a result, synchronized, interactive co-navigation of web content is provided to the participants of the shared session.","In one embodiment, the web page to be displayed is modified to circumvent the framebusting technique used by the creator of the original web page. The framebusting technique is a technique for preventing a display of the creator's content within a frame of a web site of another owner. For example, a web site could provide news to users simply by linking to news articles on another web site, and include these news articles into its own frame with its own advertisements, instead of the frame of the other web site. The actual creator of the web content can prevent this from happening by embedding JavaScript code in its web pages. Specifically, a scripting language may be used that references the top frame in each frame of its web documents, and then checks to see whether the frame being used is the expected frame or whether the frame being used has the expected parent-child relationship to the top frame. If neither of these two conditions is true, the content reloads itself into the top frame. To circumvent the framebusting, processing logic in the co-navigation service replaces all the references to the top frame with a code that does not reference the actual topmost window in the shared browser, but instead references the frame which would be the top window, had the page not been loaded in a co-navigation session. When this is done, the \u201cframebusting\u201d code does not detect a problem, and the conavigation service can place this content within its own frames.","When browsing the modified web page or performing any other online activity, a participating client may send a web response to the co-navigation service. For instance, a response may be generated when a participating client clicks on a link that refers to a new web document, enters a URL of a new web page, or triggers a dynamic event in the modified web page.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00074","num":"00074"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["704","706","708"]},"During the co-navigation service, a participating client may want to draw attention of other participants to a particular object (e.g., a word, a form field, etc.) within the displayed web content.  is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a process for coordinating pointers on display screens of multiple clients during a shared session.","Referring to , the process begins by a first client identifying an object of interest on the screen (processing block ). The object may be a particular word, text, picture, link, etc. In one embodiment, the first client identifies the object by pointing a cursor to the object and clicking on a right mouse button. At processing block , on-screen documents displayed to other participants scroll to the location of this object on the other participants' screens. Further, at processing block , a pointer pointing to the object identified by the first participant is displayed on the screens of other participants.","Another co-navigation feature is directed to providing back and forward functionality during the shared session. That is, the participants of the shared session have the ability to go back and forward in a co-navigation setting. The co-navigation service may also selectively hide web features from certain participants during the shared session and\/or selectively hide personal information of one participant from other participants in the shared session. For instance, certain form fields may be seen by a customer but not by a CSR (e.g., a client social security number or password). Another example, which typically occurs in e-commerce applications, is that companies do not want their customer service agents to complete transactions for customers (the physical world analogy is having a customer service agent sign the credit card receipt on the behalf of a customer); in this scenario, the \u201csubmit\u201d button to commit the transaction is visible to the customer but hidden from the customer service agent.","It will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that a variety of co-navigation features other than those described above may be provided using the co-navigation technology of the present invention without loss of generality.","Computer System Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00080","num":"00080"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"1000"},"The computer system  includes a processor , a main memory  and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .
