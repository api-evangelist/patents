{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Myriad standards exist for configuring, maintaining, and auditing computer infrastructures and the data that is stored by the infrastructures. The standards are often many-faceted and may be industry-specific. For example, entities in healthcare, financial, federal government, and other industry sectors making use of computer infrastructures may be subject to certain standards. Some standards may be regulatory in nature, such as Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations for publicly traded companies. Standards may overlap and require similar policy, configuration, and management enforcement and auditing measures. Other standards may have unique requirements that are specific to a particular industry sector.","Entities that are subject to standards may wish to use various computing infrastructure services. Some services, for example, provide a wide range of resources to an entity without requiring the entity to maintain a computer infrastructure. As one example, a provider may supply dynamically scalable and virtualized resources as services over the Internet. The provider typically supplies computers on which the entities can run their applications and store their data. For example, the entities may upload applications, libraries, data, network resources, directory resources, and associated configuration settings to the provider's storage repository and request a number of virtual machines (i.e., server instances), on which they can load their applications. The entities also may increase or decrease, as needed, how much central processing unit (CPU) and storage capacity is needed to run the applications.","An entity using these services, although not maintaining a computing infrastructure, must nevertheless comply with standards that pertain to the configuration, maintenance, and auditing of its data. Consequently, the entity may need to expend a substantial amount of time and resources to configure and maintain its data, resources, and activity logs in manner that is compliant with applicable standards. Furthermore, using these services may complicate these tasks, because providers do not provide functionality that allows entities to configure resources to comply with such standards. Accordingly, the time and expense necessary to configure computing resources for standards compliance may present a significant barrier to entry for entities that may otherwise use computer infrastructure services. Therefore, there is a need for improved systems and methods that facilitate standards compliance for entities that use computer infrastructure services.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or similar parts. While several illustrative embodiments are described herein, modifications, adaptations and other implementations are possible. For example, substitutions, additions or modifications may be made to the components illustrated in the drawings, and the illustrative methods described herein may be modified by substituting, reordering, removing, or adding blocks to the disclosed methods. Accordingly, the following detailed description is not limiting of the disclosed embodiments. Instead, the proper scope is defined by the appended claims.","Disclosed embodiments provide systems and methods that enable entities to configure computing resources to comply with standards. As the term is used herein, a \u201cstandard\u201d may refer to any norm or requirement, and may include regulations, laws, and policies promulgated by the Federal government, a state, a locality, a government agency, other entity (e.g., a standards body), or requirement of an entity that is enforced upon itself (e.g., an entity may wish to enforce its own internal standards, such as corporate retention policies). For example, a standard may specify who can access data, specify network and systems configurations, mandate auditing requirements for the data, and mandate reporting of audit logs to certain authorities. Furthermore, a standard may mandate compliance and\/or may be advisory in nature (i.e., recommended standards).","Disclosed embodiments provide systems and methods that enable entities to provide verification of compliance with standards to third parties, such as auditors and\/or authorities. For example, disclosed embodiments may enable entities to achieve a desired certification and configuration, and then enable the entities to maintain that certification through appropriate logging, auditing, and enforcement mechanisms. Entities may efficiently select settings for their computing resources in order to regulate who has access to data, automate auditing of data, and provide reporting of audit logs to certain authorities. For example, the entities may further configure their resources to ensure that network, operating system, firewall, intrusion detection or prevention systems, virtual private network (VPN), email retention, data retention, and routing configurations are compliant with applicable standards.","Disclosed embodiments may enable entities that are involved in a variety of industry sectors to comply with applicable standards and provide certification of that compliance. The following provides an overview of industry sectors (e.g., healthcare, financial, federal government sectors, etc.) and standards with which these entities may need to comply. Although certain examples are discussed below, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the disclosed embodiments provide a framework in which entities that are involved in a wide-range of industry sectors may maintain and certify compliance with a wide-range of standards.","Entities involved in the healthcare sector may be subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which specifies standards for electronic health care transactions. Other entities, such as financial entities, may be subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI: DSS), which applies to entities which hold, process, or pass cardholder information from credit cards. Financial entities also may be subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which regulates the sharing of personal information regarding individuals who obtain financial products or services. Entities also may be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002, which specifies standards for financial reporting and auditing for U.S. public company boards, management and public accounting firms, or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which enforces federal securities laws and regulates the securities industry.","Entities within the Federal government may need to comply with standards, such as the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, which requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement programs to secure information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agencies. FISMA further may apply to information and systems that are provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other entity on behalf of the agencies.","Consistent with a disclosed embodiment, a computer-implemented method is provided for configuring and monitoring computing resources of an entity for compliance with one or more standards. A server may receive one or more identifiers of one or more standards and determining a plurality of configuration settings for the computing resources of the entity. The determination may be based on the received one or more identifiers and the plurality of configuration settings may comply with the one or more standards. The method may configure the computing resources of the entity according to the plurality of configuration settings. The server may detect an event related to the computing resources of the entity. The method may include evaluating the detected event and the plurality of configuration settings of the entity for compliance with the one or more standards and determining whether the entity is compliant with the one or more standards, based on the evaluation.

One of skill in the art will appreciate that although one compliance server, three storage servers, and three terminals are depicted in , any number of these components may be provided. Furthermore, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that one or more components of system  may be combined and\/or divided into subcomponents. For example, functionality provided by compliance server  may be combined with one or more of storage servers -.","Network  provides communications between the various components in system , such as compliance server , storage servers -, and terminals -. In addition, compliance server , storage servers -, and\/or terminals - may access legacy systems (not shown) via network , or may directly access legacy systems, data stores, or other network applications. Network  may be a shared, public, or private network, may encompass a wide area or local area, and may be implemented through any suitable combination of wired and\/or wireless communication networks. Network  may further comprise an intranet or the Internet.","Compliance server  may comprise a general purpose computer (e.g., a personal computer, network computer, server, or mainframe computer) having one or more processors that may be selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in memory. Compliance server  may be implemented in a distributed network, such that compliance server  may communicate via network  with additional compliance servers (not shown). Alternatively, compliance server  may be specially constructed for carrying-out methods consistent with disclosed embodiments.","Compliance server  may include a processor , a memory , and a data store . Memory  may comprise one or more memory or storage devices that store data as well as software. Memory  may also comprise, for example, one or more of RAM, ROM, magnetic storage, or optical storage. Memory  may store program modules that, when executed by processor , perform one or more processes for enabling access to data residing on data store .","Data store  may store data reflecting configurations settings and compliance reporting requirements for one or more entities using computing services provided by compliance server  and\/or storage servers -. For an entity, data store  may store data specifying standards that the entity has selected, along with data specifying configuration settings that are allowed or disallowed by the selected standards. For example, standards may regulate who has access to certain data, mandate auditing requirements for the data, and specify requirements for reporting audit logs to certain authorities. Standards may further specify network, operating system, firewall, virtual private network (VPN), intrusion detection or prevention systems, email retention, data retention, and routing configurations. The standards may specify time periods, operational requirements, security procedures, etc. that relate to these settings. For example, standards may specify encryption requirements for data at rest (e.g., on live volumes or backup media) and data that is being transmitted.","Storage servers - may each comprise a general purpose computer (e.g., a personal computer, network computer, server, or mainframe computer) having one or more processors that may be selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program. Storage servers - may be implemented in a distributed network. For example, storage servers - may communicate via network  with additional storage servers (not shown), which may enable storage servers - to distribute processes for parallel execution by a plurality of storage servers. Collectively, storage servers - (and any additional storage servers) may comprise a storage area network (SAN). Alternatively, storage servers - may be specially constructed for carrying out methods consistent with disclosed embodiments.","Storage server  may include a processor , a memory , and a data store . Memory  may comprise one or more memory or storage devices that store data as well as software. Memory  may also comprise, for example, one or more of RAM, ROM, magnetic storage, or optical storage. Memory  may store program modules that, when executed by processor , perform one or more processes for storing and\/or accessing data residing on data store . Although not depicted in , storage servers  and  may include components that are equivalent to that of storage server .","Data store  may comprise a plurality of storage devices, such as disk storage devices, optical storage devices, etc. For example, data store  may comprise multiple disk drives that combine to form a disk array. The disk array may include, for example, a disk array controller, a cache, disk enclosures, and a power supply. The disk array controller may connect to network  via a port (not shown), which may serve as an interface between the disk array controller and network .","Storage server  may host various data for entities, and may provide functionality for authenticating users and providing access to the data. For example, storage server  may host applications, libraries, data, and associated configuration settings. Furthermore, storage server  may host other data, such as electronic mail messages, Internet sites, or intranet sites.","Storage server  may allow users at, for example, terminals - to access the data being hosted by storage server . Furthermore, storage server  may allow entities storing data that is hosted by storage server  to access, modify, and load data onto storage server . For example, entities may access data hosted by storage server  over network  through an Internet browser or software application running on any one of terminals -. Alternatively, entities may access data hosted by storage server  over network  through an application program interface (API).","In one embodiment, storage server  may transmit a document (e.g., a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document, an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document, or a web page) that is accessible by an Internet browser executing on one of terminals -. The document may include options for a user (e.g., an administrator of an entity) to log onto a secure site provided by storage server . For example, a user may log onto a secure site provided by storage server  by supplying credentials, such as a username and a password. Because the Internet site may use a secure communication environment, such as an HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) environment to transfer data over network , data transfer is assumed to be secure.","Terminals - may be any type device for communicating with compliance server  and\/or storage servers - over network . For example, each of terminals - may correspond to various entities that use computing services. Administrators of these entities may use terminals - to access and\/or receive data from compliance server  and\/or storage servers -. Terminals - may be personal computers, handheld devices (e.g., PDAs, cellular phones, etc.), or any other appropriate computing platform or device capable of exchanging data with network . Terminals - may each include a processor (not shown) and a memory (not shown). Furthermore, terminals - may execute program modules that provide one or more graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for interacting with network resources, such as compliance server  and\/or storage servers -. Alternatively, as discussed above, in other embodiments, users of terminals - may access data through other network mechanisms, such as through an API of a Web service.","In operation, compliance server  may permit an administrator of an entity, via one of terminals -, to select or update a standard or a set of standards (e.g., HIPAA, GLBA, SOX, PCI:DSS, etc.) with which the entity must comply or wishes to comply. For example, using a Web service or a GUI, an administrator of an entity at terminal  (e.g., a financial services entity) may select or update one or more standards (e.g., PCI: DSS, GLBA, etc.) from a variety of different standards that compliance server  supports. The standards that compliance server  supports may be constantly evolving such that new standards are being added and existing standards may be updated, as needed.","Following selection of the standards, compliance server  may automatically configure the computing services of an entity such that it complies with the selected standards. Furthermore, compliance server  may automatically deny configurations and\/or changes to existing configurations that would violate the selected standards. As part of the configuration process, for an entity that selects two or more standards, compliance server  may resolve any conflicts between the two or more standards. For example, one standard may require data retention time period (e.g., 30 days) that is different from a data retention time period (e.g., 90 days) required by another standard. Accordingly, compliance server  may resolve the conflict such that the entity's computing resources are compliant with both standards (e.g., enforcing a data retention period of 90 days).","In other embodiments, once the standard or standards have been selected, compliance server  may recommend or identify configuration settings that must be enabled and configuration settings that must not be enabled for an entity to comply with one or more sets of standards (e.g., HIPAA, GLBA, SOX, PCI:DSS, etc.). An administrator acting on behalf of the entity may then select which configuration settings to enable and disable based on the recommendations that were provided by compliance server . For example, compliance server  may transmit a document to one of terminals - indicating configuration settings that are allowed\/disallowed by the selected standard or set of standards. An administrator or agent acting on behalf of the entity may make selections (e.g., using checkboxes, selecting icons, etc.) to indicate whether or not the entity wishes to accept or ignore the recommendations. Accordingly, an entity may configure its computing resources manually in such an embodiment in lieu of having compliance server  automatically configure its computing resources.","Compliance server  may further provide an entity or a third party (e.g., an auditor, authority, etc.) with a certification indicating that the entity has chosen specified compliance constraints. For example, once an entity has selected configuration settings for one or more standards, compliance server  may generate a certification of compliance. Compliance server  may transmit the certification to the entity or to a third party via network . For example, compliance server  may generate subsequent certifications at period intervals or at a predetermined later date in order to certify that compliance is ongoing (or to inform a third party that an entity is no longer compliance). Furthermore, compliance server  may maintain an audit log for changes that are made to the selected configuration settings. Compliance server  may further record data to an audit log reflecting other events or changes that relate to an entity's computing resources, such as records reflecting accounts used to access, store, alter, or transmit data.","Compliance server  may automatically run queries against an entity's access logs, data, instance logs, and any other data stored on storage servers -. For example, compliance server  may automatically transmit reports to an entity at one of terminals -. For example, compliance server  may generate such reports at a frequency that is specified by the standards that were chosen and\/or based on user selections. Furthermore, compliance server  may provide an interface that permits an administrator or other authorized person to review the reports. Compliance server  may transmit or otherwise make available reports to other third parties, such as auditors and\/or authorities. For example, a third party auditing firm may examine configuration, access and\/or audit logs, and service choices to certify compliance with one or more selected standards. Review of access logs, audit logs, and\/or reports (e.g., by a representative of an entity or other third party) may need to occur on a regular basis in order for an entity to maintain compliance.","In one embodiment, compliance server  may provide verification that data has not been altered or tampered with. One area in which compliance server  may provide such a verification relates to machine images. In computing, a \u201cmachine image\u201d refers to a package of software that can be used to instantiate a virtual machine in system . A machine image may include an operating system and additional software that provides a service. For example, an entity may deploy a machine image on one of storage servers -. In order to verify the machine image, compliance server  may label the machine image with an identifier. The entity may, at a subsequent point in time, add software to the machine image, and then re-bundle the machine image for deployment. Compliance server  may confirm that every instance of the machine image running in the entity's network is derived from a certified, approved machine image, through the use of the identifier.","In one embodiment, compliance server  may provide compliance services to an entity that maintains its own computer infrastructure and stores its own data. In other embodiments, compliance server  may provide compliance services to any entity that uses a computer infrastructure services provider to host its data. Accordingly, in some embodiments, compliance server  and one or more of storage servers - may be under the control of a single entity (e.g., a computer infrastructure services provider) and, in other embodiments, compliance server  may be under the control an entity (e.g., a compliance services provider) and one or more of storage servers - may be under the control of another entity (e.g., an entity storing its own data and using services provided by compliance server ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","110"]},"Prior to the start of routine , a user may be authenticated by, for example, compliance server . For example, prior to the start of routine , compliance server  may transmit a document (e.g., a web page) that is accessible by an Internet browser executing on, for example, terminal . The document may include options for a user to log onto a secure site provided by compliance server . The user may log onto the secure site by supplying credentials, such as a username and a password. Once authenticated, routine  may begin.","In block , compliance server  (e.g., a service provided by compliance server ) may receive a selection of one or more standards. For example, continuing with the above example, a user (e.g., an administrator of an entity) at terminal , following being authenticated, may have selected one or more standards using a GUI. The selection may include, for example, identifiers that correspond to the selected standards. Furthermore, in other embodiments, receiving the selection of one or more standards may comprise receiving one or more standards that are uploaded by the user at terminal . The uploaded standards may include identifiers and may specify requirements related to the standards (e.g., the user may upload a data retention standard). In yet other embodiments, the user at terminal  and\/or an administrator of compliance server  may change one or more standards (e.g., revise or update the standards).","In block , compliance server  may determine configuration settings for the entity's computing resources such that the entity is compliant with the selected standards. For example, compliance server  may determine configuration settings that regulate who has access to certain data, mandate auditing requirements for the data, and\/or specify requirements for reporting audit logs to certain authorities. Standards may further specify network, operating system, firewall, virtual private network (VPN), intrusion detection or prevention systems, email retention, data retention, and\/or routing configurations. Furthermore, the configuration settings may enforce time periods, operational requirements, security procedures, etc., that relate to these settings. Still further, during the configuration of an entity's resources, compliance server  may schedule certain reminders to be sent to an administrator of the entity that remind the administrator of any actions that the selected standards require, such as reviewing certain reports (e.g., a log) at periodic intervals.","In one embodiment, following the determination made in block , compliance server  may proceed to block  and automatically configure the entity's computing resources, based on the determination. In other embodiments, routine  may instead proceed to block . In block , compliance server  may recommend or identify configuration settings that must be enabled and\/or that must not be enabled for an entity to comply with the selected standards. For example, following the determination made in block , compliance server  may transmit a document to terminal  indicating configuration settings that are allowed\/disallowed by the selected standard or set of standards.","In block , compliance server  may receive selection of configuration settings from a user, such as an administrator at terminal . The administrator, acting on behalf of the entity, may select which configuration settings to enable and which to disable based on the recommendations that were provided by compliance server . For example, the administrator may make selections (e.g., using checkboxes, selecting icons, using pull-down menus, etc.) to indicate whether or not the entity wishes to accept or ignore the recommendations provided by compliance server .","In block , compliance server  may update the configuration settings for the entity. For example, compliance server  may store data reflecting the configuration settings for the entity in data store .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","300","110","300","110"]},"In block , compliance server  may transmit a reminder (e.g., an email message) to one of terminals -. The reminder may relate to a task, which a standard may mandate that an entity perform at a certain time. For example, an entity may be required to review certain audit logs on a regular basis and certify that the entity has reviewed the logs.","In block , compliance server  may receive a request from one of terminals -. For example, an administrator of an entity at one of terminals - may, in response to the reminder, request certain data (e.g., audit logs) for review. Prior to transmitting the request, the user may have been authenticated by compliance server  (e.g., the administrator may have supplied credentials, such as a username and a password, as discussed above).","In block , compliance server  may transmit the requested data to one of terminals - for review. For example, compliance server  may transmit certain audit logs (e.g., access logs) or other data for the entity's review.","In block , compliance server  may receive a response from one of terminals -. For example, using one of terminals -, the administrator may complete a document indicating that the data was reviewed (e.g., a certification by the administrator).","In block , compliance server  may update an audit log or other record to indicate that the entity has completed the task, based on the received response. Compliance server  may store the updated audit log or record in data store .

For example, compliance server  may monitor resources and configuration settings of an entity for changes and\/or new events through a monitoring service. For example, the event may constitute an access request, an intrusion detection, a transfer of data, a change to a configuration setting, etc.","In block , compliance server  may determine whether the event requires logging, according to the configuration settings of the entity. For example, compliance server  may determine whether one or more selected standards require the entity to log the event. If compliance server  determines that the event should be logged, then routine  may proceed to block . If compliance server  determines that the event does not require logging, then routine  may proceed to block .","In block , compliance server  may update a log. For example, compliance server  may maintain an event log in data store . The log may include data reflecting the event (e.g., a classification of the type of event, a date and time of the event, a username, etc.).","In block , compliance server  may evaluate compliance of the entity. The evaluation may include consideration of data of the entity that is stored in one or more of storage servers -, the configuration settings of the entity, and\/or an event that was detected in block . For example, compliance server  may execute one or more queries according to the selected standards to evaluate whether the entity's data, configuration settings, or the detected event are consistent or inconsistent with the selected standards.","In block , compliance server  may determine whether the entity is compliant. If the entity is not compliant or the detected event would result in a configuration that is not compliant, routine  may proceed to block . In block , compliance server  may take an action. The action may bring the entity into compliance with the selected standards and\/or may prohibit the entity from becoming non-compliant with the one or more standards (e.g., preventing the entity from using a non-compliant configuration setting or changing a configuration setting such that the changed setting would be non-compliant). In other embodiments, the action may comprise recording the detected event. Compliance server  may certify the recording of the detected event with a digital signature.","In yet other embodiments, the action may include transmitting a notification of compliance status (e.g., a notification of compliance or non-compliance). For example, the notification may indicate that remedying the non-compliance is within the entity's discretion or remedying the non-compliance is mandatory. Compliance server  may transmit the notification to an administrator and\/or a third party. For example, a notification that is sent to an administrator may identify an event or configuration change that resulted in non-compliance so that the administrator may bring the entity back into compliance. Alternatively, in other embodiments, compliance server  may transmit a report (e.g., an audit log) providing additional data regarding the entity's compliance and\/or non-compliance with certain standards. If the entity is compliant, routine  may proceed to block .","In block , compliance server  may take an action to certify compliance of the entity. For example, compliance server  may generate a report reflecting that the entity is fully compliant with one or more standards. Furthermore, compliance server  may generate separate reports on a per standard basis. The reports may constitute and\/or include audit logs. Still further, the action may comprise recording the detected event and certifying that detected event was compliant. Compliance server,  may certify the recording of the detected event or the report reflecting compliance with a digital signature. Furthermore, in addition to being able to determine the compliance state of an entity at intervals, compliance server  may continuously monitor the entity. For example, in some embodiments, compliance server  may continuously monitor configuration settings, detect events, and\/or store records relating to configuration changes and\/or the detected events. Through such monitoring and detection by compliance server , compliance server  may continuously certify that an entity has remained compliant with one or more standards over a time interval.","In block , compliance server  may transmit the report. The report may be in the form of a PDF document or compliance server  may transmit a URL identifying a location from which the report may be retrieved. As part of block , the report may be transmitted to the entity and\/or other third parties (e.g., auditor, government agency). For example, the entity, as part of its configuration settings, may specify a third party auditing firm that is an authorized recipient of reports and\/or audit log results (e.g., an accounting firm receives the data).","As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, one or more of blocks -, -, and - may be optional and may be omitted from implementations in certain embodiments.
