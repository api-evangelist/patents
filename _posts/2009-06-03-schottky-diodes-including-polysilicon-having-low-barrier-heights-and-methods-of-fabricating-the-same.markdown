{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under ONR\/DARPA Contract No. 05-C-0202. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention generally relates to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to Schottky diodes and methods of fabricating the same.","High voltage silicon carbide (SiC) devices can handle voltages above about 600V or more. Such devices may handle as much as about 100 amps or more of current, depending on their active area. High voltage SiC devices have a number of important applications, particularly in the field of power conditioning, distribution and control. High voltage semiconductor devices, such as Schottky diodes, MOSFETs, GTOs, IGBTs, BJTs, etc., have been fabricated using silicon carbide.","Schottky barrier diodes are used extensively as output rectifiers in switching-mode power supplies and in other high-speed power switching applications, such as motor controls, for carrying large forward currents and supporting large reverse blocking voltages. Diodes exhibit low resistance to current flow in a forward direction and a very high resistance to current flow in a reverse direction. A Schottky barrier diode produces rectification as a result of nonlinear unipolar current transport across a metal semiconductor contact.","Silicon carbide (SiC) Schottky diodes are a promising technology because such devices can provide a low forward voltage drop, high breakdown voltage, and fast switching speed with essentially no reverse recovery current. However, the operational characteristics of a Schottky diode can depend heavily on the type of metal used for the Schottky contact. The power dissipated by a Schottky diode depends on the forward voltage drop and the reverse leakage current, both of which should be as low as possible. The forward voltage drop and the reverse leakage current are related to the barrier height of the Schottky contact, i.e., the magnitude of the potential barrier between the metal and semiconductor regions of the Schottky contact.","A low barrier height metal will have a low forward voltage drop and a large reverse leakage current. Conversely, a high barrier height metal will have a larger forward voltage drop and a smaller reverse leakage current. Therefore, it is desirable to have a Schottky diode which exhibits the forward characteristics of a small barrier height metal and the reverse characteristics of a large barrier height metal. A trench type Schottky diode can be configured to partially satisfy these conflicting design criteria by using lines of high barrier metals to pinch-off or electrically shield intervening trenched lines of low barrier metals. Although such trench type Schottky diodes may provide improved forward and reverse operational characteristics, their fabrication cost may be increased by the processes needed to form the trenches and high\/low barrier metal lines, and their forward and reverse characteristics can be limited by the trench and high\/low metal line feature sizes that are obtainable.","SiC PIN diodes are very attractive for RF limiter applications. In particular, the high breakdown strength and high thermal conductivity of SiC may enable much higher RF power levels and faster switching speeds than may have been possible using silicon (Si) or gallium arsenide (GaAs) technologies. In these applications, a Schottky diode is commonly used to rectify the RF signal and produce a bias current for the PIN diode, which will limit the RF signal to acceptable levels. The barrier height of the Schottky diode used in these applications should be relatively low to rectify low-level RF signals. Many applications require a barrier height of 0.5 eV or less. However, most commonly used materials, such as chromium (Cr) and Titanium (Ti) only provide barrier heights of about 0.8 eV or higher on SiC.","Some embodiments of the present invention provide hybrid semiconductor devices including a PIN diode portion and a Schottky diode portion. The PIN diode portion is provided on a semiconductor substrate and has an anode contact on a first surface of the semiconductor substrate. The Schottky diode portion is also provided on the semiconductor substrate and includes a polysilicon layer on the semiconductor substrate and the polysilicon layer acts as a Schottky contact.","In further embodiments of the present invention, the semiconductor substrate may include Gallium Nitride (GaN).","In still further embodiments of the present invention, the semiconductor substrate may include silicon carbide (SiC). In certain embodiments, the SiC substrate may be a semi-insulating SiC substrate.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the polysilicon layer may be an N-type polysilicon layer.","In further embodiments of the present invention, a SiC layer may be provided on the SiC substrate. A P-type SiC layer may be provided on the SiC layer. The SiC layer and the P-type SiC layer may define a trench that extends through the P-type SiC layer and exposes the SiC layer. The polysilicon layer may be on the exposed portion of the SiC layer. The ohmic contact may be on the polysilicon layer and the anode contact of the PIN diode portion may be on the P-type SiC layer. The SiC layer may be insulating SiC layer.","In still further embodiments of the present invention, the anode contact of the PIN diode portion may be an ohmic contact including aluminum, titanium and\/or nickel.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the trench may be a first trench. An N-type SiC layer may be provided on the SiC substrate between the SiC substrate and the SiC layer. The SiC layer and the N-type SiC layer may define a second trench that extends through the SiC layer and exposes the N-type SiC layer. An ohmic contact may be provided on the exposed portion of the N-type SiC layer.","In further embodiments of the present invention, the device may have a barrier height of less than about 0.8 eV to about 0.3 eV.","In still further embodiments of the present invention, the device may be stable at operating temperatures up to about 250\u00b0 C.","Some embodiments of the present invention provide Schottky diodes including a drift layer on a first surface of a semiconductor substrate, a polysilicon layer on the drift layer and an anode contact on the poly-silicon layer.","In further embodiments of the present invention, the drift layer may include a silicon carbide (SiC) drift layer and the semiconductor substrate may be a SiC substrate.","In still further embodiments of the present invention, the polysilicon layer may be an N-type polysilicon layer. A cathode contact may be provided on a second surface of the semiconductor substrate, opposite the first surface of the substrate. In certain embodiments, the diode may be a junction barrier Schottky (JBS) diode. In these embodiments, the diode may further include a plurality P-type regions in the SiC drift layer. The anode contact may form a Schottky junction with the exposed portions of the SiC drift layer and an ohmic contact with the plurality of P-type regions.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the drift layer may be a layer including gallium nitride (GaN) and the semiconductor substrate may be a GaN substrate. The diode may further include a cathode contact on the layer including GaN that is spaced apart from the polysilicon layer and the anode contact.","In further embodiments of the present invention, the layer including GaN may include aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN).","Still further embodiments of the present invention provide a Schottky diode including a drift layer on a first surface of a semiconductor substrate; a barrier layer on the drift layer; and an anode contact on the barrier layer. The barrier layer provides a diode having a barrier height of from about 0.2 eV to about 0.8 eV. The barrier height may be 0.5 eV or less, 0.4 eV or less, 0.3 eV or less or from about 0.2 eV about 0.5 eV.","Although embodiments of the present invention are primarily discussed above with respect to device embodiments, related methods of fabricating these devices are also provided herein.","Embodiments of the present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein, the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincludes\u201d and\/or \u201cincluding\u201d when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms used herein should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of this specification and the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present.","Relative terms such as \u201cbelow,\u201d \u201cabove,\u201d \u201cupper,\u201d \u201clower,\u201d \u201chorizontal,\u201d \u201clateral,\u201d \u201cvertical,\u201d \u201cbeneath,\u201d \u201cover,\u201d etc., may be used herein to describe a relationship of one element, layer or region to another element, layer or region as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that these terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.","Embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the invention. The thickness of layers and regions in the drawings may be exaggerated for clarity. Additionally, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and\/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a discrete change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.","Some embodiments of the invention are described with reference to semiconductor layers and\/or regions which are characterized as having a conductivity type such as N-type or P-type, which refers to the majority carrier concentration in the layer and\/or region. Thus, N-type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of negatively charged electrons, while P-type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of positively charged holes. Some material may be designated with a \u201c+\u201d or \u201c\u2212\u201d (as in n, n, p, p, n, n, p, p, or the like), to indicate a relatively larger (\u201c+\u201d) or smaller (\u201c\u2212\u201d) concentration of majority carriers compared to another layer or region. However, such notation does not imply the existence of a particular concentration of majority or minority carriers in a layer or region.","As discussed above, SiC PIN diodes are very attractive for RF limiter applications. In particular, the high breakdown strength and high thermal conductivity of SiC may enable much higher RF power levels and faster switching speeds than may have been possible using silicon (Si) or gallium arsenide (GaAs) technologies. In these applications, a Schottky diode is commonly used to rectify the RF signal and produce a bias current for the PIN diode, which will limit the RF signal to acceptable levels. The barrier height of the Schottky diode used in these applications should be relatively low to rectify low-level RF signals. Many applications require a barrier height of 0.5 eV or less. However, most commonly used materials, such as chromium (Cr) and Titanium (Ti) only provide barrier heights of about 0.8 eV or higher on SiC. Barrier heights of 0.8 eV may only detect larger signals. Accordingly, there is a need for devices that can detect relatively smaller signals on sic.","Thus, according to some embodiments of the present invention, RF diodes are provided that have the capability of detecting smaller signals on SiC. In particular, as will be discussed further herein, devices in accordance to some embodiments of the present invention may have barrier heights significantly less than 0.8 eV. For example, in some embodiments, the barrier height may be 0.5 eV or less. In some embodiments, the barrier height may be 0.4 eV or less, 0.3 eV or less, or from about 0.2 eV to about 0.5 eV without departing from the scope of the present invention. In some embodiments of the present invention, these RF diodes include N-type polysilicon in a Schottky diode on SiC. Devices in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention may provide RF diodes having low barrier heights, robust device performance due to the polysilicon contact on SiC, improved avalanche capability and high temperature capability as will be discussed further herein with respect to .","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be discussed with respect to . Referring first to , a hybrid semiconductor device  in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention will be discussed. As illustrated in , an N drift layer  is provided on a substrate . The substrate  may be a semi-insulating silicon carbide (SiC) substrate, that may be, for example, the 4H polytype of silicon carbide. Other silicon carbide candidate polytypes may include the 3C, 6H, and 15R polytypes. The term \u201csemi-insulating\u201d is used descriptively herein, rather than in an absolute sense. In some embodiments of the present invention, the silicon carbide bulk crystal may have a resistivity equal to or higher than about 1\u00d710\u03a9-cm at room temperature.","Silicon carbide has a much closer crystal lattice match to Group III nitrides than does sapphire (AlO), which may be a common substrate material for Group III nitride devices. The closer lattice match may result in Group III nitride films of higher quality than those generally available on sapphire. Silicon carbide also has a relatively high thermal conductivity, and as such, the total output power of Group III nitride devices formed on silicon carbide may not be as limited by thermal dissipation of the substrate as similar devices formed on sapphire and\/or silicon. Also, semi-insulating silicon carbide substrates may provide for device isolation and reduced parasitic capacitance.
