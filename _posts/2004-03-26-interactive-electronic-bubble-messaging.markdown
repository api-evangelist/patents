{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention pertains generally to electronic communication and, more particularly, to computerized messaging.","Desktop and laptop personal computers, personal digital assistants and mobile phones: networked computing devices have become part of the way that people communicate. These devices support various modes of communication including synchronous and asynchronous, text, audio and video, telephone calls, instant messaging and electronic mail. Some of the modes of communication are supported by several device types. Some modes are limited to particular device types.","At times, conventional modes of communication supported by networked computing devices can hinder, rather than facilitate, communication between people. Communication is foremost a human activity. Different groups or subcultures may be empowered or restricted by different modes of communication. Modes of communication that are too complex may alienate one group of people. Modes that are too simple may be insufficiently expressive for another group. One group may be frustrated with modes of communication that are unstructured, another with modes that are inflexible.","One group of particular interest in this respect is the group of people familiar with networked computing devices from an early age (\u201cThe Net Generation\u201d). This group's familiarity may make some artificialities imposed by networked computing devices transparent, while also making this group particularly sensitive to other artificialities. In addition, the familiarity itself may be a problem. For example, messaging modes of communication that lack sufficient ability for a sender to personalize messages, and thus socially distinguish them from others, may hinder relationship building aspects of communication.","In some modes of communication supported by networked computing devices (e.g., conventional email and instant messaging) there may be an ability for a message recipient to modify and\/or duplicate the received message without restriction. Such aspects of modes of communication may socially devalue the received message and thus attenuate its role as, for example, a suitable memento or special keepsake for individuals or groups. In addition, a lack of control over artistic and other works may impoverish modes of communication by making artists and other premium service providers reluctant to contribute to those modes.","This section presents a simplified summary of some embodiments of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key\/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some embodiments of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In an embodiment of the invention, bubble messaging includes creating a bubble message (e.g., a personalized graphical message) and seamlessly sending the bubble message to one or more recipients. The bubble message may include message text and a bubble message shape specification. As a result of the bubble message being sent, a notification of the bubble message may be received. The notification of the bubble message may be displayed and, in response to recipient interaction with the displayed notification, a bubble message open animation may be displayed that provides a transition to a shape specified by the bubble message shape specification. The bubble message may be displayed with the shape specified by the bubble message shape specification.","In an embodiment of the invention, a bubble message editor is configured to enable the creation and seamless sending of the bubble message. In an embodiment of the invention, a bubble message viewer is configured to enable the display of bubble messages. In an embodiment of the invention, the bubble message is unmodifiable after creation.","The bubble message may be specified by a bubble message data structure. The bubble message data structure may include bubble message version data, bubble message identification data, bubble message sender data, bubble message shape data and bubble message body data. The body message shape data may include the bubble message shape specification. The bubble message body data may include the bubble message text.","Prior to proceeding with a description of the various embodiments of the invention, a description of a computer in which the various embodiments of the invention may be practiced is now provided.

In the bubble messaging mode of communication, a bubble message (e.g., a personalized graphical message) may be created by a computing device user and seamlessly sent to one or more computing device users (e.g., sent from within a bubble message editor). Bubble message creation may be a quick, streamlined process involving minimal personalization. In addition, bubble message creation may involve progressively more elaborate personalization and customization, to a point where the bubble message is considered a gift by sender and receiver. The bubble message may be received soon after being sent (i.e., synchronously) or at some later time (i.e., asynchronously), for example, if the recipient(s) are offline. Where there are multiple recipients, some of the recipients may receive the bubble message synchronously while others receive the bubble message asynchronously. In an embodiment of the invention, the bubble message is not modifiable by the recipient(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","300","302","304","306","302","304","306","202","204","206","208","210","212"]},"The sending client computing device  may include a display and graphical user interface (GUI). The graphical user interface may include a workspace , for example, the graphical user interface may utilize desktop, window or document visual metaphors. The graphical user interface workspace  may be a graphical user interface of a messaging application, for example, a MICROSOFT MSN MESSENGER messaging application. The graphical user interface workspace  may include one or more icons  visually representing individuals or groups of potential message (e.g., bubble message) senders and\/or recipients. The icons  need not be in the graphical user interface workspace . The icons  may be accessed from any suitable conventional graphical user interface component, for example, a graphical user interface menu. Conventional graphical user interface components are known in the art and need not be described here in detail.","A bubble message editor  may be invoked by a send bubble message action associated with the icons  (e.g., \u201cblow a bubble\u201d or \u201csend a bubble\u201d). The bubble message editor  may create (i.e., instantiate, personalize and\/or customize) bubble messages and may save them to a file system  of the sending client computing device  and\/or send them to, for example, the receiving client computing device  by utilizing a messaging client  of the sending client computing device . The file system  may incorporate a conventional computer file system that manages files in, for example, non-removable storage  (), removable storage  and\/or system memory .","The messaging client  may be a client for a messaging system capable of transporting messages between networked computing devices  and . The messaging system may incorporate conventional messaging system components, for example, instant messaging system components and\/or electronic mail (e-mail) system components. The messaging system may be dedicated to transporting bubble messages or the messaging system may transport bubble messages along with other types of computer-readable message. Relevant context, details and example application programming interfaces (APIs) for a suitable messaging system are described in the Windows Messenger section of the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN\u00ae) Library.","The messaging client  may exchange messages, including bubble messages, with a messaging server  of the server computing device , for example, over one or more communication connections  (). The messaging server  may be a server for the messaging system capable of transporting messages between networked computing devices  and . The messaging server  may store bubble messages in a message store . The message store  may incorporate any suitable conventional database. The messaging server  may exchange messages, including bubble messages, with a messaging client  of the receiving client computing device . The messaging server  may store bubble messages intended for a particular recipient, for example, until one or more communication connections  () may be established between the server computing device  and the receiving client computing device  and\/or until the recipient authenticates with the messaging server  by utilizing the messaging client . The recipient may authenticate with (or register with or login to) the messaging server from any suitable computing device, for example, the computing devices , , , ,  and  of .","The recipient may be associated with more than one computing device, for example, the recipient may be associated with the PC  and the mobile phone . The messaging server  may be configured with a multiple computing device delivery policy. For example, the bubble message may be delivered to the PC , the mobile phone , both the PC  and the mobile phone  or neither the PC  nor the mobile phone  depending upon the multiple computing device delivery policy and, for example, computing device attributes that the multiple computing device delivery policy references such as whether the computing device is a mobile computing device and whether the computing device is online.","As with the sending client computing device , the receiving client computing device  may include a display and graphical user interface. The graphical user interface may have a workspace  and the graphical user interface workspace  may include one or more icons  visually representing individuals or groups of potential message (e.g., bubble message) senders and\/or recipients. The messaging client  may notify the recipient of the newly dispatched bubble message(s), for example, by displaying one or more new bubble message indicators (i.e., graphical representations of new bubble message notifications) in proximity to one of the icons  associated with the sender. Icons  that may be associated with the sender include icons representing the sender and icons representing groups that the recipient participates in with the sender. Suitable examples of new bubble message indicators include iconic forms of bubble messages as described in more detail below with reference to .","The recipient may invoke a bubble message viewer  to view the newly dispatched bubble message(s), for example, by selecting the new bubble message indicator(s). Some bubble message details such as the sender's name, an icon representing, associated with and\/or chosen by the sender, and\/or an icon having a same custom color scheme as the bubble message may be viewed by the recipient before invoking the bubble message viewer , for example, the messaging client  or the new bubble message indicator may display such details to help the recipient differentiate between received bubble messages. An instance of the bubble message viewer  may be instantiated for each bubble message to be viewed. Alternatively, the bubble message viewer  may be capable of displaying multiple bubble messages. The new bubble message notification(s) may incorporate the dispatched bubble message(s), in which case, the bubble message(s) to be viewed may be passed to the bubble message viewer  at invocation. Alternatively, the bubble message viewer  may request the messaging client  to retrieve the bubble message(s) referenced by the new bubble message notification(s) from the messaging server . As well as displaying the bubble message(s), the bubble message viewer  may save the bubble message(s) to a file system  of the receiving client computing device .","It will be helpful to describe the bubble message editor  and the bubble message viewer  in more detail.  illustrates an example bubble message editor  in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
