More particularly, this invention relates to a modified arthropod, an arthropod-modifying bacterium, and use thereof as an agent for control of diseases transmitted by arthropods, particularly mosquitoes.","Arthropods are a source of, or transmit, many diseases and conditions in humans and other animals. Some arthropods may simply cause localized irritation of the skin without transmission of disease, such as occurs with mites and ticks, or by transmission of disease-causing pathogens such as arboviruses, protozoa, bacteria and nematodes. These disease-causing pathogens are responsible for a variety of different diseases of humans and other animals including malaria, Dengue fever, Eastern Equine encephalitis, Western Equine encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, West Nile fever, Yellow fever, LaCrosse encephalitis Asian spotted fever, Q fever, Lymphatic filariasis (Elephantiasis), Chikungunya fever, Ross river fever and Chagas disease.","Most pathogens that are transmitted by mosquitoes share a common property; they have to undergo a significant period of development in their insect vector before they can be transmitted to a new host. After a female mosquito ingests an infectious blood-meal, parasites or arboviruses, such as dengue, penetrate the mosquito's midgut and replicate in various tissues before infecting the salivary glands, where they are transmitted to a new host during subsequent blood-feeding. This time period from pathogen ingestion to potential infectivity is termed the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), and lasts approximately two weeks for both dengue (Siler et al., 1926; Watts et al., 1987) and malaria (Gilles et al., 2002). A female mosquito must survive longer than its initial non-feeding period (usually less than 2 days) plus the EIP to successfully contribute to pathogen transmission. Mosquito survival is therefore considered a critical component of a vector population's capacity for pathogen transmission (Dye, 1992). Interventions that aim to reduce the daily survivorship of adult mosquitoes, such as the spraying of residual insecticides in houses and insecticide-treated bednets for malaria control, yield large reductions in pathogen transmission rates (Masabo et al., 2004; Schellenberg et al., 2001) because of the sensitive relationship between mosquito survival and vectorial capacity (Garrett-Jones, 1964; MacDonald, 1957).","The control of diseases such as dengue primarily targets , a domesticated mosquito that prefers to live in and around human habitation (Gubler et al., 1997). With few exceptions, dengue management strategies have been complicated by the inability to completely eradicate from urban settings, and the ineffective application of long lasting vector control programs (Morrison et al., 2008). This has led to a worldwide resurgence of dengue, and highlighted the urgent need for novel and sustainable disease control strategies.","A strain of the obligate intracellular bacterium , wMelPop, has been described that reduces adult lifespan of its natural fruit fly host (Min and Benzer, 1997). are maternally-inherited bacteria that use mechanisms such as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), a type of embryonic lethality that results from crosses between infected males with uninfected females, to rapidly spread into insect populations (Hoffmann and Turelli, 1997).","However, life-shortening strains do not occur in mosquitoes naturally and experimental transfer of between host species (transinfection) has lacked success (Van Meer and Stouthamer, 1999). In some cases, transferred strains can be stable and maternally inherited, primarily when is transferred within or between closely related species in a family or genus (Boyle et al., 1993; Xi et al., 2005; Zabalou et al., 2004). In other cases, the new infection appears poorly adapted to its new host, showing fluctuating infection densities and variable degrees of transovarial transmission. The result is often loss of infection within a few host generations. infections tend to be more susceptible to loss when they have been transferred between phylogenetically distant hosts (Kang et al., 2003; Riegler et al., 2004). Similarly, those species that do not naturally harbour have proven refractory to transinfection (Curtis and Sinkins, 1998; Rigaud et al., 2001).","Most pathogens require a relatively long incubation period in their arthropod host before they can be transmitted to a new host. Thus, it has been proposed that a life-shortening bacterium may be used to reduce disease transmission by arthropod hosts that do not naturally harbour ","However, despite significant efforts, researchers have been unable to achieve colonization of in distantly related arthropod species due to the inability of to quickly adapt to new intra-cellular environments. To overcome this problem, the inventors have identified a need for a modified bacterium that can be easily introduced into populations of disease-transmitting arthropod vectors and reduce transmission of pathogens such as dengue virus and malaria.","The invention therefore arises from the inventors' unexpected finding that long-term serial passage of in an arthropod cell line resulted in the production of an arthropod-adapted bacterium that can be successfully transferred into, and maintained in, an arthropod and populations thereof. Furthermore, the inventors surprisingly discovered that arthropods harbouring this arthropod-adapted bacterium have a shorter lifespan, a reduced fecundity, altered feeding behaviour, and\/or are less susceptible to pathogens, including viruses, fungi, worms, protozoans, and bacteria, than their wild-type counterparts.","In a first aspect, the invention provides an isolated arthropod-adapted

Such agents include entomopathogenic fungi and mosquito densoviruses, although without limitation thereto.","So that the invention may be fully understood and put into practical effect, the skilled reader is directed to the following non-limiting detailed Examples.","Cell Lines and Maintenance","Three cell lines were used in this study: (i) Aa23.T derived from embryos (O'Neill et al., 1997) (ii) RML-12 derived from larvae (C. E. Yunker; personal communication) (Kuno, 1983) and (iii) MOS-55 derived from larvae (Marhoul and Pudney, 1972). All these cell lines were confirmed as negative for infection prior to this study by PCR as outlined below. Aa23.T and RML-12 cell lines were maintained in growth medium consisting of equal volumes of Mitsuhashi-Maramorosch (Mitsuhashi and Maramorosch, 1964) (1 mM CaCl, 0.2 mM MgCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 120 mM NaCl, 1.4 mM NaHCO, 1.3 mM NaHPO, 22 mM D (+) glucose, 6.5 g\/L lactalbumin hydrolysate, and 5.0 g\/L yeast extract) and Schneider's Insect Medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS). MOS-55 was maintained in Schneider's Insect Medium supplemented with 20% HIFBS. Both media also contained penicillin (50 U\/mL) and streptomycin (50 \u03bcg\/mL). For routine maintenance, cells were grown in 25 cmplastic tissue culture flasks containing 5 mL of medium at 26\u00b0 C. without COincubation. Cells were passed every 3-4 days by vigorous shaking of the flask, and seeding a new flask with 20% of the resuspended cells with 5 mL fresh media.","Establishment of wMelPop Infected Cell Lines","wMelPop was purified from wembryos (Min and Benzer, 1997) and established in an uninfected cell line (Aa23.T) using the shell vial technique (Dobson et al., 2002). Embryos were collected every 45 min on molasses agar plates covered with live yeast paste and dechorionated using freshly prepared 50%-diluted bleach (White King, Victoria, Australia) (2.1% sodium hypochlorite final concentration) for 2 min. Embryos were then rinsed several times in sterile dHO, immersed in 70% ethanol for 15 sec, and rinsed three times in sterile PBS, pH 7.4. Approximately 20 mg of surface sterilized embryos (\u02dc50-100 \u03bcL of packed embryos) were then transferred to a mini Dounce tissue homogenizer (Wheaton, USA) and suspended in 400 \u03bcL of PBS. Embryos were then homogenized for 2-3 min with a tight pestle. 200 \u03bcL of homogenate was then overlaid separately onto two 80% confluent wells of Aa23.T cells prepared 24 hr earlier in a 12-well cell culture plate. The plate was then centrifuged at 2000 g for 1 hr at 15\u00b0 C. Cells were then incubated at 26\u00b0 C. for 24 hr and the contents of each well transferred to individual 25 cmcell culture flasks with 5 mL of fresh media. After a confluent monolayer had formed, cells were split 1:5 and passaged as usual.","To establish the infection in RML-12 and , MOS-55 cell lines, wMelPop, was purified from Aa23 cells as described below and introduced into these cell lines using the shell vial technique.","Characterization of wMelPop in Cell Lines",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0222","num":"0221"},"i":"Wolbachia "},"(i) PCR Screening and Sequencing","To monitor infection status of cells, DNA was extracted from cultures as previously described (Dobson et al., 2002) and amplified using the general surface protein (wsp) primers 81F and 691R, or the diagnostic wsp primer set for wMelPop, 308F and 691R (Zhou et al., 1998). To confirm the presence of wMelPop in these three cell lines, fragments of the 16S rRNA and wsp gene were PCR-amplified, cloned and sequenced. DNA was extracted from cells using a DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen) and amplified as previously described using the diagnostic primers 99F and 994R for the 16S rRNA gene (O'Neill et al., 1992), and the primers 81F and 691R for the wsp gene (Zhou et al., 1998). Total DNA from cell lines was also PCR-amplified using the general eubacterial 16S rRNA primers 10F\/1507R (Mateos et al., 2006) and 968F\/R1401R (Nubel et al., 1996). The resulting PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and four clones from each infected cell line randomly picked and sequenced for each product. The presence of wMelPop and no other contaminating bacteria in cell lines was verified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), using a general primer set targeting eubacterial 16S rRNA genes (F-968-GC and R-1401) (Nubel et al., 1996), using previously described methods (Pittman et al., 2008).","(ii) Electron Microscopy","Insect cells were washed in PBS and rapidly fixed with microwave processing in 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution containing 0.1% CaCland 1% sucrose in 0.1 M Na cacodylate, enrobed in 2% agarose, and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M Na cacodylate buffer. Samples were then dehydrated in a sequence of increasing ethanol concentration and in a final step in acetone (100%), and then embedded in epoxy resin (Epon 812) using microwave processing (Feinberg et al., 2001; O'Neill et al., 1997). Ultra-thin sections (50-80 nm) prepared on a Leica Ultracut T ultramicrotome (Leica Inc.) were then placed on copper grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate followed by Reynolds lead citrate. The sections were then examined in a JEOL-1010 electron microscope operated at 80 kV.","Purification of from Cell Culture for Embryonic Microinjection","Insect cells from the confluent monolayers of two 175 cmflasks were harvested and centrifuged in 50 mL conical flasks at 1000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0 C. and the cell culture media discarded. The cellular pellet was then washed in SPG buffer (218 mM sucrose, 3.8 mM KHPO, 7.2 mM KHPO, and 4.9 mM L-glutamate, pH 7.2) and the centrifugation and wash steps repeated. After washing, the pellet was resuspended in 5 mL SPG and sonicated twice on ice for 10 sec at 12.5 W with a Fisher Scientific model 60 Sonic Dismembranator (3 mm microtip diameter) to lyse the cells. This suspension was then centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0 C. to pellet cellular debris. The supernatant was then passed through a 5 \u03bcM Acrodisc syringe filter (Pall Life Sciences) and the filtrate collected in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. These were then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0 C. to pellet . The supernatant was then discarded, pellets were combined and resuspended in 400 \u03bcL SPG buffer and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min to remove any remaining debris (Xi and Dobson, 2005). The supernatant was then transferred into a clean tube and stored on ice until used for injection (<3 hr).","Embryonic Microinjection","Purified from RML-12 was microinjected into embryos of the line w.T (Min and Benzer, 1997). Prior to microinjection, this line was confirmed to be free of by PCR using primers specific for the wMelPop IS5 repeat: IS5-FWD1 (5\u2032-GTATCCAACAGATCTAAGC) (SEQ ID NO: 1) and IS5-REV1 (5\u2032-ATAACCCTACTCATAGCTAG) (SEQ ID NO: 2). IS5 is a multi-copy insertion element, and as such a much more sensitive target for determining infection status than single copy genes such as wsp. For microinjection, early (pre-blastoderm) stage embryos were collected every 30 min using molasses agar plates with live yeast paste. Purified was microinjected into the posterior pole of embryos within 30 min of collection using standard techniques (Ashburner, 1989; Boyle et al., 1993; Xi and Dobson, 2005). After hatching, larvae were transferred to a standard cornmeal based rearing medium (Ashburner and Roote, 2000) and incubated at 24\u00b0 C.",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0019","num":"0000"},"i":"Drosophila "},"Virgin females resulting from injected embryos (generation 0 [G0]) were placed in vials with three w.T males to establish isofemale lines. After egg laying G0 females were sacrificed and DNA extracted using the Holmes-Bonner DNA extraction protocol (Holmes and Bonner, 1973). was detected in samples using PCR primers specific for the IS5 repeat element in wMelPop. The quality of the insect DNA was assessed using the primer set 12SA1 and 12SB1 that amplifies the 12S ribosomal RNA gene (O'Neill et al., 1992). Amplification of DNA was carried out in a 20 \u03bcL reaction volume which included: 2.0 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7 buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.), 25 \u03bcM of dNTPs, 0.5 \u03bcM of forward and reverse primer, 0.75 U of Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.), and 1.0 \u03bcL of DNA template. PCR conditions were as follows; denaturation at 94\u00b0 C. for 3 min; 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0 C. for 30 sec, annealing at 55\u00b0 C. for 30 secs, and extension at 72\u00b0 C. for 1 min; followed by a final 10 min extension step at 72\u00b0 C.","To select for a stable infection, only offspring from females that tested positive for by PCR screening were used as parental stock. Each generation, 25-50 females from each line were isolated as virgins, placed into individual vials and outcrossed to three w.T males. Females that tested negative for were discarded along with their progeny. This selection regime was maintained for three generations after which the lines were closed. The two resulting lines, wMelPopCLA-1 and wMelPopCLA-2, were then monitored periodically by PCR to confirm infection status. The selection regime was again repeated at Gdue to fluctuations in infection frequencies in both lines.","Lifespan Assays","The lifespan of wMelPopCLA-1, wMelPopCLA-2 and wMelPop lines was compared to tetracycline-cured derivatives of each line created by the addition of tetracycline into the adult diet (3 mg\/mL) according to standard methods (Hoffmann et al., 1986). Treated flies were reared on tetracycline for two generations, and then transferred to a normal diet for a minimum of five generations before being used in experiments. To reduce genetic drift effects that may have occurred in these lines during tetracycline treatment, 100 females from each fly line (including infected lines) were backcrossed with 100 males from the same w.T stock line and the progeny combined to form the next generation. This was repeated for five generations (G-G). Longevity assays were then conducted at G, Gand G. To control for any crowding effects or size variability, the larval density of each stock bottle used to obtain flies was standardized (200 larvae\/bottle) prior to longevity assays. Stock bottles were kept at 24\u00b0 C. until adult eclosion 9-10 days later, when flies were sexed as virgins and separated. In each assay, six vials of 20 flies for each sex were maintained at 29\u00b0 C. in standard cornmeal food vials without additional live yeast. Each day the number of new deaths were recorded. Flies were moved to fresh food vials every five days. Survival curves for the various treatment groups were compared using a mixed effects Cox Proportional Hazard (coxme) model of survival analysis using the kinship package of the R suite of statistical software (www.r-project.org).","Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI) Tests","CI tests were conducted at G36 and G38 post-transinfection using the previously backcrossed lines. To standardize rearing conditions for CI tests, fly stock bottles were grown under low-density conditions (n=150-200) at 24\u00b0 C. with a 12 hr light\/dark cycle. To obtain offspring for CI crosses, stock bottles were seeded with a set density of 200 eggs per 40 mL of diet. After eclosion, flies were sexed and separated as virgins and aged until CI tests. Male flies were collected on day 2 of emergence and were used within 24 hr of eclosion (Reynolds et al., 2003; Yamada et al., 2007). The female flies used were 5-7 days old. For each cross, single mating pairs (n=40) were introduced to plastic bottles with molasses plate lids. Pairs were given 24 hr to mate, then the males were removed and the females allowed to lay eggs. Eggs were collected every 24 hr on molasses agar plates dotted with live yeast suspension for three days. Females that laid <50 eggs total across the three plates were discarded from the experiment. The plates were then placed at 24\u00b0 C. for a further 36-48 hr, and then the number of total and unhatched eggs were counted. Statistical significance of hatch rates for various crosses was determined using a Mann-Whitney U-Test. A Bonferroni correction was used to compensate for multiple comparisons.","Quantitative PCR and Density Determination","To examine if the density of in had changed after long-term serial passage in mosquito cell lines, infection densities were monitored in head tissues of wflies carrying the wMelPopCLA-1, wMelPopCLA-2 or wMelPop strain over their lifespan using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Heads were selected for qPCR as wMelPop infection densities had previously been shown to rapidly increase in nervous tissue with adult age (McGraw et al., 2002; Min and Benzer, 1997). Density of the closely-related non-virulent strain wMel was also examined after introgression for three generations from ywinto the wgenetic background. qPCR assays were conducted at Gpost-transinfection. Flies reared as described for lifespan assays were collected at four-day intervals (from 4-32 days) until all the flies in a line were dead, and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. before analysis. Total DNA was extracted from dissected head tissues using the DNeasy tissue kit protocol (Qiagen). To estimate the relative abundance of in each sample, we compared abundance of the single-copy ankyrin repeat gene WD0550 to the single-copy gene Act88F. The following primers were used to amplify a 74 bp amplicon from WD0550 (For 5\u2032-CAGGAGTTGCTGTGGGTATATTAGC (SEQ ID NO: 3) and Rev 5\u2032-TGCAGGTAATGCAGTAGCGTAAA (SEQ ID NO: 4)); and a 78 bp amplicon from Act88F (For 5\u2032-ATCGAGCACGGCATCATCAC (SEQ ID NO: 5) and Rev 5\u2032-CACGCGCAGCTCGTTGTA (SEQ ID NO: 6)). 12 biological replicates were examined per time point for each treatment. For each sample, qPCR amplification of DNA was performed in triplicate using a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Research, Australia). Amplification was carried out in a 10 \u03bcL reaction volume which included: 5 \u03bcL Platinum SYBR Green I Supermix (Invitrogen, CA), 1 \u03bcM of forward and reverse primer and 1 ng DNA template. The PCR conditions were 50\u00b0 C. for 2 min; 95\u00b0 C. for 2 min; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0 C. for 5 sec, 60\u00b0 C. for 5 sec and 72\u00b0 C. for 10 sec; followed by a melt curve from 67\u00b0 C. to 95\u00b0 C. A standard calibrator was used to normalise between qPCR runs; and the specificity of PCR products was determined by melt-curve analysis. Crossing threshold (C) and amplification efficiency values for each sample were calculated using Corbett Rotor-Gene (Version 1.7.75) software. The relative abundance of in each sample was then determined using the method discussed by Pfaffl (Pfaffl, 2001). Regression analysis was used to detect trends in density of over the lifetime of individual fly lines. ANCOVA was then employed to examine the relationship between density and the covariates age and strain. All abundance data were log transformed prior to analysis. A Bonferroni correction was used to compensate for multiple comparisons.","Several initial attempts to establish wMelPop in the embryonic cell line Aa23 were unsuccessful. Typically infection was lost after several passages, or lines were discontinued due to a complete loss of confluence or growth of mosquito cells. This situation mirrors that observed when wMelPop purified from is injected into mosquitoes, with large fluctuations in infection density eventually leading to loss of infection (EAM and SLO unpublished data). In total, only 2 out of 68 (3%) independent attempts to establish the wMelPop infection in Aa23 cells were successful.","Once established in Aa23, wMelPop was serially passaged for 237 passages (\u02dc2.5 years) before being transferred to the cell line RML-12 and the cell line MOS-55. Stable establishment of wMelPop in these two cell lines occurred much more easily than the initial infection of Aa23, with 2 out of 2 independent attempts for each cell line forming stable wMelPop infections. Partial sequences of the 16S rRNA and wsp genes from the three cell lines used were all identical to the sequence from wMelPop, confirming that infections were not the result of contamination with other strains. Infection in mosquito cells was also confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM micrographs of the three infected mosquito cell lines show that representative cells from each line were heavily infected by wMelPop (). wMelPop was purified from the RML-12 cell line, and re-introduced back into its native host, w, that had been previously cured of its natural wMelPop infection by tetracycline treatment. At the time of re-introduction, wMelPop had been maintained for over 3 years outside its native host: 237 passages in Aa23 and 60 passages in RML-12 cell lines. In total, 446 embryos were microinjected giving rise to 108 Glarvae (24% hatch). All 10 surviving Gfemales were PCR positive for . Of these, 8 produced offspring, and 2 produced PCR positive Gisofemale lines. These two independent isofemale lines were named \u201cwMelPopCLA-1\u201d and \u201cwMelPopCLA-2\u201d (wMelPop Cell Line Adapted).","The infection frequency in wMelPopCLA lines was then monitored periodically over time (). Both wMelPopCLA lines were initially observed to display variable maternal transmission rates in the original host, reflected in fluctuating infection frequencies in the absence of experimental selection. During an initial period of experimental selection for increased infection (G-Gpost-transinfection), frequencies as detected by PCR were observed to increase in both wMelPopCLA-1 (58% to 87%) and wMelPopCLA-2 (55% to 100%). In the absence of experimental selection from Gonwards, infection frequencies in both lines initially were stable or fluctuated, but then rapidly decreased such that by Gpost-transinfection only 32% of wMelPopCLA-1 and 24% of wMelPopCLA-2 individuals remained infected. Selection was repeated again at Gand after one additional generation infection frequencies in both lines moved to 100% and remained fixed for infection to Gwhen last assayed.","To assess the effect of continuous cell line culture on the ability of this strain to colonize , we compared infection densities in flies that contained wMelPopCLA with those carrying the original wMelPop infection by qPCR. Since it is known that wMelPop densities increase rapidly in adult flies when held at 29\u00b0 C., we assessed densities across the adult lifespan. As populations of flies aged, densities in head tissue rapidly increased in wMelPop infected flies (). The density of also increased in wMelPopCLA-1 and wMelPopCLA-2 infected flies as they aged, although these increases were noticeably less than wMelPop. densities were roughly four fold higher in wMelPop-infected flies when compared to wMelPopCLA-1 or wMelPopCLA-2 infected flies at day 12 post-emergence. Flies infected with the non life-shortening wMel strain had the lowest infection which only increased slightly over the lifespan of flies. Overall, there was a significant effect of age and strain on density (F=41.92, P<0.001 for age; F=678.37, P<0.001 for strain) for all lines. This was reflected by significant differences in the effects of strain and age after pair-wise comparisons between lines (P<0.001 for all comparisons), except for wMelPopCLA-1 and wMelPopCLA-2 lines where strain effects were not significantly different from one another (F=0.09, P>0.05).","To test whether the ability of wMelPop to induce the life-shortening phenotype had changed during long-term serial passage, we conducted a series of longevity assays at G, Gand Gpost-transinfection. For these experiments, the survival of infected flies from wMelPopCLA-1, wMelPopCLA-2 and wMelPop lines was compared with uninfected tetracycline-treated lines of each strain at 29\u00b0 C. Survival curves for males and females of each treatment group were measured independently. In all assays, male and female flies from the wMelPop-infected line demonstrated the most pronounced lifespan reduction when compared to flies from the wMelPop-CLA lines and tetracycline-treated controls (). The lifespan of wMelPopCLA-1 and wMelPopCLA-2 lines appeared intermediate relative to wMelPop, but were shortened relative to tetracycline treated controls. For example, at Gpost-transinfection the mean time to death (\u00b1SE) for wMelPop females (9.8\u00b10.1 days) was noticeably shorter than that of wMelPopCLA-1 females (22.2\u00b10.3 days), or wMelPopCLA-2 females (23.4\u00b10.3 days). Mean time to death was increased for tetracycline-treated control lines, with wMelPop.T females (32.1\u00b10.5 days), wMelPopCLA-1.T females (34.6\u00b10.5 days), and wMelPopCLA-2.T females (33.4\u00b10.6 days) all having extended lifespan relative to infected counterparts. For females, the proportional hazard of death associated with carrying infection was significantly greater for individuals with wMelPop (relative risk ratio, 135.7; 95% confidence interval, 40.3-456.5), compared to those either carrying wMelPopCLA-1 (relative risk ratio, 30.0; 95% CI, 15.4-58.5) or wMelPopCLA-2 (relative risk ratio, 17.7; 95% CI, 10.5-30.7) (P<0.001 for all comparisons to wMelPop). The same trends were also observed for males. These results were consistent with those obtained from measurements at Gand Gpost-transinfection (data not shown).","In order to examine effects of long-term cell culture on CI expression we established test crosses between uninfected and infected flies and examined hatch rates of the resulting eggs. Results from incompatible test crosses indicated that wMelPop.T females mated with wMelPop males produced embryos with a mean hatch rate of 24%, which was significantly lower than the same cross with wMelPopCLA-1 males or wMelPopCLA-2 males (Mann Whitney, P<0.001) (). A statistically significant difference in mean hatch rate for crosses with wMelPopCLA-1 males relative to those with wMelPopCLA-2 males (P<0.001) was also observed. In rescue tests, mean hatch rates of embryos produced from crosses between wMelPop males and wMelPop females; wMelPopCLA-1 females; or wMelPopCLA-2 females were not significantly different from one another. As such, lines infected with wMelPopCLA have a reduced ability to induce CI when compared to wMelPop. In contrast, the ability to rescue an incompatible cross appears unchanged in the cell-adapted lines.","Mosquito Strains and Maintenance","The naturally uninfected JCU strain of was established from eggs that were field-collected from Cairns (Queensland, Australia) in 2005. For routine maintenance, eggs were hatched under vacuum for 30 min, and larvae reared at a set density of \u02dc150 larvae in 3 L of distilled water in plastic trays (30\u00d740\u00d78 cm). Larvae were fed with 150 mg (\u00bd tablet) fish food per pan per day (Tetramin Tropical Tablets, Tetra, Germany) until pupation. Adult mosquitoes were maintained in screened 30\u00d730\u00d730 cm cages enclosed within transparent plastic bags, with damp cotton wool to maintain elevated humidity (25\u00b11\u00b0 C., \u02dc80% relative humidity (RH), 12:12 h light:dark). Adults were provided with constant access to 10% sucrose solution, and females (5 day old) supplied with a human blood source for egg production. PGYP1 and PGYP2 lines were maintained continuously without prolonged desiccation of eggs.","Embryonic Microinjection","Methods used for embryo injections were based upon those successfully used for the transfer of to both and (Example 1; Xi et al., 2005). To collect eggs for microinjection, approximately ten gravid JCU females (\u02dc5 days post-blood meal) were placed in a vial with a wet filter paper funnel, and the vial moved to a dark place to promote oviposition. Embryos were collected after allowing females to oviposit for \u226690 min. Pre-blastoderm stage embryos (grey in colour) (Lobo et al., 2006) were aligned on double-sided tape (Scotch 665, St. Paul, Minn.), briefly desiccated, and covered with water-saturated halocarbon 700 oil (Sigma-Aldrich) (Xi et al., 2005). Embryos were then microinjected in the posterior pole with wMelPop, purified as previously described from the cell line RML-12 (see Example 1), using an IM-200 micro-injector (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Microinjection needles were prepared from borosilicate microcapillaries (#30-0038, Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK) using a PC-10 micropipette puller (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). After injection, embryos were incubated at 80% RH and 25\u00b0 C. for approximately 40 min, after which time excess oil was removed and embryos transferred to wet filter paper. Embryos were then allowed to develop for 4-5 days, before being hatched and reared to adulthood using the standard maintenance procedures outlined above.","Isofemale Line Rearing and Selection for Stable Infection","Females (G) resulting from microinjected embryos were isolated as pupae to assure virginity, and subsequently mated with JCU males. Following blood feeding and oviposition, Gfemales were sacrificed and DNA extracted using the DNeasy protocol (Qiagen). was detected in samples using PCR primers specific for the IS5 repeat element in wMelPop (see Example 1). Gfemales that tested negative for were discarded along with their progeny. Offspring from females that tested positive for by PCR screening were used as parental stock to select for stable infections. PGYP 1 females were outcrossed with JCU males for three generations (G-G), after which time this line was closed and infected females and males allowed to interbreed. Typically 50 JCU males and 50 virgin PGYP1 females were used in an outcross. Experimental selection to increase infection frequencies was applied to this line from G-G(). In the PGYP2 line, females were outcrossed with JCU males for five generations (G-G), after which time the line was closed. Experimental selection to increase infection frequency was applied to the PGYP2 line from G-G, and subsequently for one generation at G().","Tetracycline-Treatment of Mosquito Lines","PGYP1 and PGYP2 lines were cleared of wMelPop infection at Gand Grespectively, by introducing a 1 mg\/ml tetracycline solution (final concentration)-dissolved in 10% sucrose\u2014into adult cages (Dobson and Rattanadechakul, 2001). Lines were treated with tetracycline for two generations (with a 14 day course of tetracycline) and then allowed to recover for at least two generations before being used in experiments. Tetracycline-treated lines were confirmed to be cured of wMelPop by PCR as described above. The tetracycline-cleared mosquito strains, designated PGYP1.tet and PGYP2.tet, were also re-colonized with resident gut microflora by adding 100 ml water used to rear untreated JCU larvae to the larval water of treated lines for two generations after tetracycline treatment had ceased.","Lifespan Assays","Three different experimental designs were used for lifespan assays: First, the lifespan of GPGYP 1 mosquitoes was compared with those from the naturally uninfected JCU strain at two different temperatures. For these assays, larvae were hatched and reared at 25\u00b0 C. or 30\u00b0 C. using the standard method described above. After emergence, adult mosquitoes were maintained in 2.2 L plastic buckets at their treatment temperature; with 80% RH and a 12:12 h light:dark cycle in a controlled growth chamber (Model 620RHS, Contherm Scientific, New Zealand). For each strain at each temperature, six buckets of 50 mosquitoes (25 of each sex) were maintained and checked daily. Cotton balls soaked in 2% sucrose solution as a carbohydrate source were placed inside each cage and changed daily. Second, the lifespan of GPGYP1 and JCU mosquitoes was compared under fluctuating abiotic conditions designed to simulate a summer day in Cairns, North Queensland, Australia. Mosquitoes were exposed to a diurnal cycle of 12 h light, 32\u00b0 C., and 50% RH; and a nocturnal cycle 12 h dark, 25\u00b0 C. and 80% RH in a controlled growth chamber as above. For this experiment a cohort of 300 adult mosquitoes (150 of each sex) from each strain were maintained in 30\u00d730\u00d730 cm cages. A sugar cube suspended 10 cm below the top of each cage was provided to necessitate flight to obtain a carbohydrate source. A human blood meal was provided to females in each cage daily for 15 min, in addition to a water-filled cup lined with filter paper as an oviposition substrate. Third, larger lifespan assays were conducted to compare survivorship of PGYP1, PGYP2, JCU and tetracycline-cleared strains. These assays were conducted at Gand Gfor PGYP1 and PGYP2 lines respectively. For each strain, three replicate 30\u00d730\u00d730 cm cages of 200 mosquitoes (100 of each sex) were maintained at 25\u00b11\u00b0 C., 70-90% RH, 12:12 h light:dark in a temperature-controlled insectary, with 2% sucrose changed daily. For all three classes of experiments, the number of new deaths was recorded each day until all mosquitoes in the cages were dead. Mosquito survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis, and log rank tests were used to determine the equality of the survival distributions between treatments.","Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI) Tests","Mass crosses were conducted between 35 virgin individuals (3 d old) of each sex from GPGYP1 and JCU strains; GPGYP1 and PGYP1.tet; and GPGYP2 and PGYP2.tet strains to assess CI levels. Groups were allowed to mate for 2 days before females were blood-fed and isolated individually for oviposition. Eggs were hatched 120 hours after oviposition by submersion in nutrient-infused deoxygenated water (75 mg Tetramin\/L) for 48 hr. To hatch any remaining eggs, egg papers were dried briefly and then resubmerged for a further 5 days before the final numbers of hatched larvae were recorded. All females used in crosses were checked for insemination by dissection of spermathecae followed by direct observation of sperm by light microscopy. CI expression was determined by comparing the percentage of hatched eggs from each of the crosses. Statistical significance of hatch rates for various crosses was determined using a Mann-Whitney U-Test. A Bonferroni correction was used to compensate for multiple comparisons. To examine the role of male age on CI, virgin GPGYP1 and PGYP1.tet males were aged to 3, 10 and 17 d old prior to mating with 3 d old PGYP1.tet virgin females.","Maternal Transmission","The proportion of -infected progeny derived from the first and third reproductive cycles of GPGYP1 females was assessed to provide an estimate of maternal transmission over lifespan. Cohorts of virgin PGYP1 females and uninfected wild-type JCU males were mass-mated. Five days after mating, females were blood-fed, and 72-96 hour post-blood meal, eggs were collected for three days. PGYP1 females were 9 days old at the time of oviposition for the first cycle, and 23 days old for the third cycle. After development, eggs were hatched and DNA extracted from larval offspring using the DNeasy protocol (Qiagen). In total, 515 larvae collected from 31 females (\u02dc17 larvae per female); and 527 larvae collected from five cohorts of 20 females (\u02dc105 larvae per cohort), were screened from the first and third reproductive cycles respectively. To establish the presence or absence of , PCR analysis was performed on individual larvae using IS5 repeat primers as previously described (see Example 1). To ensure that negative results were not a result of low quality DNA template, samples were also tested with primers specific for the single-copy gene, Ribosomal protein S17 (RpS17) (Cook et al., 2006): Forward 5\u2032-CACTCCCAGGTCCGTGGTAT (SEQ ID NO: 7), Reverse 5\u2032-GGACACTTCCGGCACGTAGT (SEQ ID NO: 8). If samples that were initially negative for tested positive for host DNA, they were screened once again with IS5 primers on a range of DNA template concentrations before infection status was finally assigned.","To facilitate the transfer of the life-shortening strain wMelPop that infects (Min and Benzer, 1997) into the mosquito , we adapted the bacteria by continuous serial passage in mosquito cell culture for three years. A consequence of this culturing was a reduction in growth rates and associated virulence when transferred back into (see Example 1). We purified the mosquito cell-line adapted isolate of wMelPop and microinjected it into naturally uninfected embryos (JCU strain). Surviving adult females were isolated, blood-fed, and after egg laying were assayed for infection using diagnostic PCR (see Example 1; Materials and Methods). Eight independent isofemale lines carrying the wMelPop infection were generated. Six of these lines were lost from G-G(See Materials and Methods), and the remaining two lines formed stable associations. These two lines, \u2018PGYP1\u2019 and \u2018PGYP2\u2019 were chosen for further characterization, and after a period of experimental selection have remained persistently infected by wMelPop (100% infection frequency) until Gand Grespectively, when last assayed ().","In species, wMelPop shortens the lifespan of adult flies by up to 50% (Min and Benzer, 1997; McGraw et al., 2002). We performed several lifespan assays in for a range of experimental conditions. As wMelPop-induced early death in is temperature sensitive (Min and Benzer, 1997); Reynolds et al., 2003), we compared the lifespan of the newly generated wMelPop-infected PGYP1 line to the naturally uninfected JCU strain at 25\u00b0 C. and 30\u00b0 C. ().","In contrast to , where the life-shortening phenotype is weakly expressed at 25\u00b0 C. and strongly at 30\u00b0 C., rapid mortality of PGYP1 mosquitoes (G) relative to the uninfected parental JCU strain was observed at both temperatures. Under lab conditions at 25\u00b0 C. and 80% RH (), the median adult longevity for PGYP1 females of 27.0 days was significantly different from the JCU control of 61.0 days (log-rank statistic 11.67, P=<0.0001). A similar trend was observed for males (). At a higher temperature of 30\u00b0 C. and 80% RH (), the differential effect on median adult longevity was still apparent although the lifespan of all the mosquitoes was reduced: females PGYP1, 25.0 days; JCU, 43.0 days (log-rank statistic 11.50, P=<0.0001).","To examine the effect of the wMelPop infection under more biologically realistic conditions, we exposed a cohort of PGYP1 (G) and JCU strains to a fluctuating temperature and humidity regime, and provided female mosquitoes with daily access to a human blood meal (). Under these conditions, the lifespan of PGYP1 females was reduced by more than half relative to JCU females. Median longevity was significantly different between treatments: PGYP1, 21.0 days; JCU, 50.0 days (log rank statistic, 10.13, P=<0.0001). A smaller difference in median survival times was observed for males from both strains (PGYP1, 9.0 days; JCU, 10.0 days), although overall PGYP 1 males still died at a significantly faster rate than JCU males (log-rank statistic=3.34, P=0.0009).","To exclude the possibility that observed reductions in lifespan resulted from genetic drift during the establishment of the PGYP 1 strain, we generated an uninfected strain from PGYP1 (PGYP1.tet) by addition of the antibiotic tetracycline to the adult diet (Dobson and Rattanadechakul, 2001). After antibiotic curing of the wMelPop infection (Materials and Methods), no significant differences in the rate of mortality were observed between females or males of uninfected PGYP1.tet and JCU strains (e.g. females, log-rank statistic=1.23, P=0.2191). Both females and males from the PGYP 1 (G) strain had significantly reduced lifespan when compared to those from the PGYP1.tet strain (e.g. females, log-rank statistic=13.70, P=<0.0001), indicative of wMelPop-induced life-shortening (). These results were confirmed using identical assays with the PGYP2 (G) strain as a biological replicate ().","To test for CI we made crosses between the PGYP1 and wild-type JCU and PGYP1.tet strains and measured egg hatch rates. Consistent with the induction of strong CI in (Xi et al., 2005), no eggs hatched from more than 2500 embryos obtained from crosses between male PGYP1 (G) and uninfected JCU females (). Similarly, only 2 eggs hatched from more than 1900 embryos obtained from crosses between male PGYP1 (G) and the tetracycline-cleared PGYP1.tet females (). In both assays, PGYP1 females were capable of rescuing CI, as indicated by the high egg hatch seen in PGYP1\u00d7PGYP1 crosses.","In its natural host wMelPop infection induces CI that quickly diminishes with male age (Reynolds et al., 2003). This effect could slow the invasion of the strain into natural populations. Crosses between uninfected females and wMelPop-infected males up to 17 days old resulted in a complete absence of egg hatch from more than 9500 embryos (Table 1), indicating wMelPop infection induced CI that is insensitive to male age.","Overall, no significant differences in fecundity between PGYP1, PGYP1.tet or JCU strains were observed at Gpost-transinfection (). An evaluation of CI and reproductive fitness in PGYP2 at Grevealed that the wMelPop infection induced very strong CI, but unlike PGYP1 had a 19% fecundity cost when compared to its tetracycline-cleared counterpart (). In , fecundity costs associated with the wMelPop infection were initially high after transinfection, but subsequently attenuated, while the life-shortening effect remained stable (McGraw et al., 2002). Further studies are required to determine if this will be the case for PGYP2, and whether observed differences in reproductive fitness between PGYP1 and PGYP2 are related to or host genotypes.","High maternal inheritance of from infected females to their progeny is a key parameter for successful population invasion. The maternal transmission rate predicts stable prevalence of the infection once it has invaded a population under the action of CI (Hoffmann and Turelli, 1997). To estimate maternal transmission rates of wMelPop over the lifespan of , we used the polymerase chain reaction to determine the proportion of -infected progeny derived from the first and third reproductive cycles of PGYP1 females (G) mated with uninfected wild-type JCU males. Of the 515 larvae screened from 31 females (\u02dc17 larvae sampled per female) from the first reproductive cycle (females aged 9 days old), 99.74\u00b10.26% were infected. This estimate of maternal inheritance was not significantly different from that obtained from the third reproductive cycle (females aged 23 days old) in which 527 larvae were screened from five cohorts of 20 females (\u02dc105 larvae sampled per cohort) and were 99.45\u00b10.37% infected (Mann Whitney, P=0.208).","Experimental Organisms","The wMelPop-infected line (PGYP1) used in this study was generated as previously described (see Example 2). In brief, the strain, wMelPop, native to (Min and Benzer, 1997) was transferred into by embryonic microinjection. Descendants of this isofemale line were outcrossed for several generations to the original recipient line of mosquitoes and selected for stable infection before closing the colony. At generations 8 & 9 post-transinfection, an aposymbiotic control line was created by antibiotic treatment of the infected line (see Example 2). All experiments reported here were carried out on mosquitoes at generations 14-16 post trans-infection (i.e. 4-6 generations post treatment), with replicates representing different generations. Mosquitoes were reared under standard conditions (25\u00b0 C., 12:12 LD, 80% RH) (Gerberg et al., 1994). Larvae were reared in plastic trays at a density of 150 per three liters of water and supplied with a daily dose of 0.15 g TetraMin aquarium fish food (Tetra, Germany). Adults were separated by sex and maintained as virgins in cages (30\u00d730\u00d730 cm) of \u02dc150 individuals. Adults were supplied with a basic diet of 10% sucrose solution administered through cotton pledgets. The adult ages of 3, 15, and 25 days of age were selected to represent the periods when 100%, \u02dc90%, and \u02dc20% of the wMelPop infected population was still surviving, respectively (see Example 2).","Videorecording of Mosquito Locomotion","Our locomotor assay was based on several previously published models (Allemand et al., 1994; Bonatz et al., 1987; Grobbelaar et al., 1967; Kawada and Takagi, 2004; Liseichikov and Zakharevskii, 1978; Mankin, 1994; Reynolds and Riley, 2002; Rowley et al., 1987; Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos, 2005), but was most heavily influenced by Williams and Kokkinn (Williams and Kokkinn, 2005). Mosquitoes were placed in an observation chamber during experiments and their motion captured via a video camera. The observation chamber was constructed using white (sides and back) and transparent Perspex (front pane) and contained distinct cells that allowed for the simultaneous observation of 10 individual mosquitoes, one per cell. Mosquitoes were provided with 10% sucrose solution ad libitum during observation periods dispensed through dental cotton wicks (1\u00d7\u00f80.5 cm). The wicks placed in each observation cell also provided constant humidity (80-85% RH). Mosquitoes were transferred from rearing cages to observation chambers 20 min prior to recording of activity to allow them to adapt to the new environment. Recording began daily at 14:30 pm, was paused during the hours of darkness (21:00-07:00) and was completed at 12:30 the following day to allow time to transfer in the next set of mosquitoes. After each observation period mosquitoes were aspirated out of the chamber and sacrificed. The chambers were cleaned with ethanol (80%) and food supply replaced prior to subsequent observation periods. No mosquito mortality was observed during the observations. A total of three replicates each of 10 mosquitoes were studied per sex\u00d7strain\u00d7age per study chamber.","A two-color camera (DR2-13S2m\/C-CS, Point Grey Research, Vancouver, BC, Canada) was fitted with a CCTV lens (12VM412ASIR, Tamron, Commack, N.Y., USA) and fixed on a mounting bracket 110 cm from the chamber. The distance of the camera to the object, the zoom, and the focus and iris aperture were optimized to reduce barreling and distortion of images. A flat light source emitting light intensity was placed 10 cm behind the chamber, which provided sufficient lighting for the camera sensor to capture high quality images but did not increase ambient temperatures. The light source power switch was synchronized with the room lights using a timer. The entire experimental setup was enclosed in cardboard to minimise intrusion of additional stimuli.","The file format used for recording, Audio Video Interleave (AVI), is limited to a maximum size of 2 GB, which amounted to approximately 8 min of video footage. To obtain a continuous video recording, we developed a program called Mossiecap that recorded multiple sequential 1.5 GB AVI files. This file size captured six minutes of video (i.e. 10 files=60 min) at 12 frames s. Each day's footage (\u02dc420 GB) was recorded onto an external hard drive connected to a desktop computer. The contents of each hard drive were then transferred to the hierarchical storage management (HSM) system at The University of Queensland. Video files stored on the HSM were then evenly distributed to local disks on 20 workstations located in the Visualization and Advanced Computing (ViSAC) laboratories at The University of Queensland. Mossiefly, a custom program developed in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc, Natick, Mass.) was used to process videos for motion detection and tracking. This program detected and tracked movement (walking and flying separately) of individual mosquitoes and digitised the coordinates and time for each movement. The files containing data from movement detection were then analysed using Mossiestat, a program developed in Matlab that summarised the movement data captured with Mossiefly into numerical values used for statistical analysis. A total measure of activity (summation of time spent flying and walking) reported per hour was used for all subsequent statistical analysis as it was more informative than examining the variables independently.","Metabolic Rate","Closed-system respirometry was used to measure COproduction () in the mosquitoes. COproduction has been shown extensively to be an accurate measure of the metabolism for small and highly aerobic organisms such as insects (Lighton, 1991; Lighton and Duncan, 2002; Van Voorhies et al., 2004). Our experiment was designed to determine whether metabolic rate was significantly different between wMelPop-infected and -uninfected mosquitoes in each of two, day time intervals lasting 4 hours. Fifteen individual mosquitoes were measured for each sex\u00d7strain\u00d7age\u00d7interval combination. These measurements were replicated 3 times. Mosquitoes were discarded after the recording interval and replaced with fresh mosquitoes from the same rearing cage.","An ADInstruments gas analyzer (ML205) and a PowerLab (85P) analog-to-digital converter connected to a computer running data acquisition software (ADInstruments, Chart 5) were used to measure COproduction from mosquitoes. Before each experiment, the gas analyser was calibrated with gas of a known COcontent. Individual mosquitoes were loaded into 25 ml syringes, mounted with a three-way valve stopcock. Before closing the three-way valve the syringe was carefully flushed with room air to remove possible COtraces. Immediately after closing the 15 syringes, a separate syringe was filled with air and kept as a control sample for initial room air COconcentration. After the 4 h interval, the syringes were injected into the gas analyser at 2 ml suntil 5 ml of air remained. The gas concentrations for each mosquito were used to calculate mosquito metabolic rate. The dry mass of each mosquito was obtained after freezing them for 48 h at \u221220\u00b0 C. and desiccating the tissue in a dry vacuum pump. Dry mass was measured with an electronic balance (Sartorius BP211D) to the closest 0.01 of a milligram. Mosquitoes were not weighed before metabolic rate experiments because immobilisation methods (i.e. COasphyxiation) may alter metabolic rates.","The following formulas based on (Bartholomew et al., 1985) were used for calculations of metabolic rates:\n\nCO(mlCO)=V*V\n\nwhere Vwas the increase in volume of carbon dioxide in the samples (calculated from the difference between final and initial COfractional concentrations), Vwas the effective volume in the syringe (25 ml minus the mosquito volume, estimated as 1.01*body mass), and t was the elapsed time in hours. Due to variation in mass between male and female, mosquitoes metabolic rate was allometrically scaled using the following formula based on (Fuery et al., 1998):\n\nScaled MR(mlCO)=(( \/M)^)*CO\n\nwhere  is the mean mass of male and female mosquitoes used for each of the metabolic experiments, and M is the mass of individual mosquitoes. This formula assumes that COproduction is proportional to the mass(West et al., 2002).\n\nStatistical Analysis\n","Transformations (square root) of the activity measures and the scaled metabolic rate were necessary to generate normal distributions. General linear models were then constructed in Statistica Release 8 (StatSoft) for each of the sexes separately to explore the effects of age, infection status, time of day and replicate on each of the activity and metabolic rate datasets separately. T-tests were then employed to specifically test for differences in metabolic rates between infected and uninfected mosquitoes at each of the three ages.","Mosquito Activity","On average, infected individuals were more active during the day than their uninfected counterparts at each of the three adult ages examined (). Increases in activity were significant for both females (d.f.=1, F=54.8, P<0.0001) and males (d.f.=1, F=33.3, P<0.0001). Median increases in activity over the daytime period ranged from 1.0- to 2.5-fold higher for infected mosquitoes depending on the adult age. Age itself also played a role in mosquito activity (females: d.f.=2, F=20.7, P<0.0001, males: d.f.=2, F=13.1, P<0.0001). In general, both infected and uninfected, male and female, mosquitoes showed decreasing activity with age (). Only males, however, demonstrated a significant interaction between age and infection status (d.f.=2, F=5.1, P<0.01), where the increase in activity due to infection was enhanced with age (, D, &F).","Mosquito Metabolic Rate","Metabolic rate was measured for separate sets of mosquitoes during two daytime windows, 07:30-11:30 and 11:30-15:30. The data from the two windows were combined after they were shown not to differ from one another using a general linear model (data not shown). In females (), both infection status (d.f.=1, F=9.7, P=0.002) and age (d.f.=2, F=15.7, P<0.0001) were significant predictors of metabolic rate. On average infected females had higher metabolic rates than uninfected, with young mosquitoes showing no difference and 15 day old mosquitoes showing the greatest increase (d.f.=58, t=2.6, P<0.01). Female mosquitoes, both infected and uninfected, were most active at 15 days of age (). In males, infection played a much less consistent role in metabolic rate over the ages examined (). Infection alone was not a factor (d.f.=1, F=0.81, P=0.36) in determining metabolic rate, while age was statistically significant (d.f.=2, F=15.7, P<0.0001). There was, however, a significant interaction between age and infection (d.f.=2, F=16.7, P<0.0001). This interaction can be seen between 15 and 25 day old males (), where at 15 days of age infected males have higher metabolic rates (d.f.=55, t=4.1, P<0.001) and at 25 days of age they have lower rates (d.f.=58, t=\u22122.40, P<0.05).","Fly Stocks","All fly lines were maintained on standard cornmeal diet at a constant temperature of 25\u00b0 C. with a 12 hour light\/dark cycle. The Oregon RC (ORC) line was obtained from the Bloomington stock centre at Indiana University in 2004, whereas the Oregon R (OR) and wlines have been maintained long term in the O'Neill lab. The Champeti\u00e8res (Champ) stock was obtained in 2005 from the Genetic Resource Centre at Kyoto Institute of Technology (stock number 103403) and maintained in the Johnson lab.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0265","num":"0264"},"i":["Drosophila ","Drosophila "]},"The concentration of tissue culture infectious units (IU) of each virus preparation was","determined essentially as previously described (Scotti, 1980). Briefly, 50 \u03bcl of a suspension of DL2 cells (1\u00d710cells\/ml) was transferred to individual wells of a flat bottomed 96 well tissue culture tray and cells were allowed to attach for at least 1 hour. A ten-fold dilution series was prepared in standard cell culture medium for titration. Each virus dilution was used to inoculate 8 wells (50 \u03bcl per well). The plates were incubated at 27\u00b0 C. for 4-5 days before scoring for cytopathic effects (CPE) and the concentration of IU in the virus sample calculated as described previously (Scotti, 1980).\n\nSurvival Assays\n","For survival assays 4-6 day old adult male were infected by microinjection of virus into the upper lateral part of the abdomen. For negative controls flies were injected with PBS. Samples were injected into flies anaesthetised with carbon dioxide, using needles pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries and a pulse pressure micro-injector. Virus was diluted to a standard concentration (DCV 1.8\u00d7108 IU\/ml, CrPV 1.8\u00d7108 IU\/ml and 1.8\u00d7108 IU\/ml FHV) in PBS and approximately 100 nl was injected into each fly. For each fly line assayed, three groups of 15 flies were injected with virus and one group of 15 flies were injected with PBS. Flies were maintained in vials at a constant temperature of 25\u00b0 C. with a 12 h light\/dark cycle and mortality was recorded daily. Mortality that occurred within 2 days of injection was deemed to be due to injury. Negligible mortality (<10% in all cases) was observed in negative controls (data not shown). Each experiment was repeated in triplicate. Survival curves were compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis (Statview).","Diagnosis of and DCV Infection","Five flies were pooled from each fly line and genomic DNA was extracted using the previously described STE method (O'Neill et al., 1992). The DNA was PCR screened for presence of using the diagnostic wsp primer set 81F and 691R (Zhou et al., 1998) and the integrity of the DNA was confirmed using the 12S primer set 12SA1 and 12SB1 (Simon et al., 1994). All fly stocks were confirmed to be DCV free (data not shown).","Tetracycline Treatment","All infected fly lines used were treated with 0.03% tetracycline (Hoffmann et al., 1986) to generate uninfected fly lines. Following the tetracycline treatment flies (designated ORCT or wT) were held for more than five generations to recover before being used for experiments.","RT-qPCR Analysis of Virus","RNA concentration in flies Flies from the ORC and ORCT lines injected with DCV as described above were harvested immediately following injection (0 day time point), 2 days or 7 days post infection. Four flies were pooled, RNA extracted, random primed cDNA synthesised and the amount of DCV RNA quantified using the primers DCV-rt-fw1 5\u2032 AGGCTGTGTTTGCGCGAAG 3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 9) and DCV-rt-rv1 5\u2032AATGGCAAGCGCACACAATTA3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 10) as previously described (Hedges and Johnson, 2008). For each time point shown four pools flies were independently assayed.","We compared the survival of flies infected with DCV in the presence or absence of infection () (Materials and Methods). In flies from the standard laboratory strain Oregon RC, infection delayed DCV-induced mortality compared to Oregon RC flies cured of infection (). The delay in mortality corresponded with a delay in virus accumulation in infected flies (). The experiment was repeated with the fly strain wwith similar results observed (). The survival curves of Oregon RC and w-free flies were similar to those of two wild type laboratory populations (Champeti\u00e8res and Oregon R) that are naturally uninfected with (compare  with ). Oregon RC and wflies are infected with two closely related strains of , wMelCS and wMelPop, respectively (Riegler et al., 2005). These results indicate that these strains of , in different genetic backgrounds of , have an antiviral effect. Two further viruses were tested using the survival bioassay; cricket paralysis virus (CrPV; Dicistroviridae) a natural pathogen and Flock House virus (FHV; Nodaviridae). The latter is unrelated to DCV and CrPV and is pathogenic in adult flies (Wang et al., 2006) although natural infections have not been reported. Like DCV, both CrPV and FHV induce rapid mortality when injected into adult . All, Oregon RC flies infected with and CrPV died within 17 days post infection (). In contrast, the -free Oregon RC flies all died within seven days of infection. Similarly, -free flies challenged with FHV died within 8 days of infection, whereas 26 days post infection only 35% of the -infected flies had succumbed to FHV induced mortality (). These results indicate that the antiviral effect observed in -infected functions to protect flies from diverse RNA viruses.","Viruses","Plaque purified DCV isolate EB (Hedges and Johnson, 2008) and FHV (Johnson et al., 2001) were propagated and purified from DL2 cells (Schneider, 1972). DL2 cells were maintained in Schneider's media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1\u00d7 glutamine and 1\u00d7 penstrep (Invitrogen) at 27.5\u00b0 C. Cells grown in 75 cmflasks were infected with either DCV or FHV at a low multiplicity of infection (<1) and harvested at 4-5 dpi. Cells were lysed by two rounds of freeze-thawing and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. The virus was purified from the supernatant by pelleting through a 6 ml 10% sucrose cushion at 27,000 rpm at 12\u00b0 C. for 3 hours in a SW28 swing bucket rotor (Beckman). The resuspended virus was layered onto a continuous 10-40% w\/v sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 27,000 rpm at 12\u00b0 C. for 3 hours in a SW41 swing bucket rotor (Beckman). The virus-containing fractions were harvested, diluted in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 and virus was pelleted by centrifugation at 27,000 rpm, 12\u00b0 C. for 3 hours. The virus was resuspended in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 at 4\u00b0 C. overnight, aliquoted and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. The concentration of tissue culture infectious units (IU) of each virus preparation was determined by replicate TCIDanalysis on two separate frozen aliquots, as previously described (see Example 4).","Flies and ","All infected fly lines were obtained from the culture collection in the O'Neill lab and were maintained on standard cornmeal diet at a constant temperature of 25\u00b0 C. with a 12-hour light\/dark cycle. The fly line Me29 is infected with wMel. The wMel infection was established by injection of containing cytoplasm from Wien 5 embryos into NHaTC embryos (Poinsot et al., 1998). The other lines are naturally infected with strains as previously described and are listed in Table 2 (Hoffman et al., 1986; Mercot and Poinsot, 1998; O'Neill and Karr, 1990; and Hoffman et al., 1996).","Preparation of - and Virus-free Fly Lines","Virus-free populations of each of the containing fly line were prepared essentially as previously described (Brun and Plus, 1980). Briefly, flies were aged for at least 20 days, transferred to fresh media (supplemented with dry yeast) and allowed to lay eggs for up to 16 hours. The eggs were collected from the surface of the media and treated for 4 minutes in 1.7% (w\/v) sodium hypochlorite solution to remove the chorion. After treatment the eggs were thoroughly rinsed with water, transferred to moist filter paper and placed on fresh virus-free media. Virus-free flies were maintained separately from untreated stocks.","To generate fly lines free of each virus-free infected fly line was treated with 0.03% tetracycline (Hoffman et al., 1986). Following the tetracycline treatment flies were held for more than four generations to recover before being used for experiments.","Survival Bioassays",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0277","num":"0276"},"i":"Drosophila ","sup":"8 "},"Virus Accumulation Assays","The accumulation of infectious DCV particles in both infected and uninfected flies was measured. For each of the five fly lines, groups of flies with and without were injected with DCV as for survival bioassays. At designated times post injection, two pools of four live DCV injected flies were collected and frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C. Flies from all infected and uninfected fly lines were collected at 2 dpi. For Me29, DSR and CO flies infected with samples were also collected at 10 days post injection; for N7NO and DSH containing and all tet-treated lines there were not enough live flies remaining at 10 days for collection. For CO-flies an additional collection was included at 30 dpi.","Each pool of four flies was homogenised in 100 \u03bcl of PBS with two 3 mm beads (Sigma-Aldrich) using a Mini BeadBeater-96 (Biospec Products) for 60 seconds. The homogenates were clarified by centrifuging at 14 K for 8 minutes. The virus-containing supernatant was aliquoted and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. Virus titre was determined using the TCIDassay as previously described (see Example 4). The two replicates for each fly population were assayed on different days to control for between-day variation in TCIDassays. Statistical analysis of the data was done using unpaired t tests to compare the geometric means of the duplicate samples between flies of each line with and without at 2 dpi (GraphPad Prism).","Analysis of Density","For each fly line 200 eggs were collected and incubated on fresh food with a constant temperature of 25\u00b0 C. for 10 days. Freshly emerged flies were collected for 8 hours, aged to 4 days old and then five male flies from a single collection were pooled. For each fly line a total of 10 pools of flies were collected from independent bottles and the DNA extracted using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit as per the Manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The relative ratio of to fly genomic DNA was determined by quantitative PCR. Each 10 \u03bcL qPCR reaction included 5 \u03bcL of Sybr Green qPCR Supermix-UDG (Invitrogen), 1 \u03bcL of DNA template and 1 \u03bcM each of the forward and reverse primers.

The median survival time of DSH and N7NO flies challenged with DCV was 4 days regardless of infection status for fly lines infected by wHa or wNo, respectively (). While there was a small but statistically significant (p=0.001) difference between the survival curves for the DSH flies with and without wHa infection for the representative experiment shown in , a significant difference was evident in only 2 out of 4 experiments replicated on independent cohorts of flies (data not shown). Taken together, the minor difference in survival and non-reproducible nature of the result suggests that it is unlikely that this difference is biologically relevant, and as such we interpret the results as indicating that there is no protection against DCV induced mortality in the DSH flies infected with wHa. There was no difference between the survival curves of N7NO flies with and without wNo infection (p=0.7). To investigate whether protection would be evident for these lines challenged with reduced amounts of virus we decreased the concentration of DCV injected by 10- or 100-fold.

Interestingly, although wAu infected flies survived DCV infection (), virus continued to accumulate beyond 2 dpi and high titres of DCV were observed in wAu-infected flies harvested at both 10 and 30 dpi (). This shows that these flies did not clear the virus infection.

The CO flies without infection reached 100% mortality within 7 days of injection with FHV (). Similar to challenge with DCV the wAu-infected flies survived FHV infection; more than 90% were alive when the experiment was terminated at 24 dpi. The wRi-infected DSR flies had significantly better survival (p<0.0001) than -free DSR flies (). The median survival times or DSR flies challenged with FHV were 10 days as compared to 7 days with and without wRi, respectively.

A genetically diverse line derived from PGYP 1, named PGYP1.out was generated by backcrossing PGYP1 for three generations to F1 males of 52 independent field-collected isofemale lines from Cairns, Australia. A further two generations of backcrossing were conducted with F2 field-collected material before the colony was used in experiments. This backcrossing scheme is expected to replace 96.9% of the original inbred genotype. A tetracycline-cured counterpart (PGYP1.out.tet, \u2212Wolb) was generated by antibiotic treatment of backcrossed adults, followed by two generations of recovery and recolonization with gut bacteria as previously described (see Example 2). A genetically diverse wild type line was also generated at the same time from field-collected material sourced from 245 ovitraps across seven suburbs of Cairns, Australia in late 2008 and named Cairns3. For the malaria experiments, a susceptible strain (Rodrigues et al., 2008) was used in parallel with PGYP1.out (+Wolb) and PGYP1.out.tet (\u2212Wolb) mosquitoes. Insects were kept in a controlled environment insectary at 25 C, \u02dc80% RH and a 12 hour light regime. Larvae were maintained with fish food pellets (Tetramin, Tetra) and adults were offered 10% sucrose solution, ad libitum. Adult females were bloodfed on human volunteers for egg production. Three to five day old female mosquitoes were used for the DENV and malaria infection experiments. Seven day old females were used for the CHIKV experiments.","Viruses","Dengue Virus","Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) (92T) was isolated from human serum collected from a patient from Townsville, Australia, in 1992. Virus stocks were passaged five times in cell line (C6\/36) grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 \u03bcg\/ml), streptomycin (100 \u03bcg\/ml), and 1\u00d7 glutamax (Invitrogen), and maintained at 28\u00b0 C. Supernatants were collected 5 days after infection, separated into 0.5 ml aliquots, and then frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. Virus used in microinjection experiments was obtained from thawed stocks of above and had a titer of 107.6 CCID50 per ml. To prepare the DENV-2 for oral feeding, the frozen virus stock was passaged once more through C6\/36 cells and the supernatant was harvested at 5 days and then mixed directly with blood to formulate a bloodmeal for feeding. Virus solution with higher titer (108.85 CCID50\/ml) was obtained by harvesting the viral supernatant and the intracellular virus from cell lysates.","Chikungunya Virus","CHIKV strain 06113879, isolated from a viremic traveler returning from Mauritius to Victoria, Australia in 2006 was provided by the Victorian Infectious Diseases Research Laboratory, Melbourne, Australia. Cultures were grown at 37\u00b0 C. in Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells for 4 days before the supernatant was harvested and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. This CHIKV stock was passaged once more in Vero cells and the virus was concentrated from 1.8 L of infected culture supernatant via ultracentrifugation at 10 000 g for 17 hrs at 4\u00b0 C. Pelleted virus was resuspended in 20 ml of Opti-MEM\u00ae reduced serum medium (Gibco BRED, Invitrogen, California) supplemented with 10% FCS before aliquots of the prepared virus were frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. The stock concentration had a final viral titer of 108.0 CCID50\/ml.","Exposure of Mosquitoes to Viruses","Intrathoracic Injection with DENV-2","Female mosquitoes were briefly anesthetized with COand placed on a glass plate over ice. Insects were handled with forceps under a dissecting scope and injected into their thorax (pleural membrane) with a pulled glass capillary and a handheld microinjector (Nanoject II, Drummond Sci.). Sixty-nine nanoliters of DENV-2 stock was injected into each mosquito, which corresponds to approx. 2,750 virus particles\/mosquito. After injection mosquitoes were transferred to 1 L plastic cages within polystyrene boxes and these boxes were maintained inside an environmentally controlled incubator 12:12 (L:D) h, 27\u00b0 C. and 70% RH. Sucrose solution and apple slices were provided on top of each cage. Mosquitoes were collected from each cage 5 and 14 days after infection and 5 dpi (days postinfection) samples were dissected into abdomen and thorax plus head. Samples were placed on dry ice and then transferred to \u221280\u00b0 C. until RNA extraction (see below). Fourteen days after thoracic injection eight mosquitoes were collected from each cage, briefly anesthetized with CO2 and placed on a glass plate over ice. Wings and legs were removed with forceps and their mouthparts were introduced into a 1 cm piece of polypropylene tubing (0.61\u00d70.28 mm, Microtube Extrusions, NSW, Australia) filled with light mineral oil (Novak et al., 1995). Females were allowed to salivate into these capillaries for 5 minutes at room temperature, and then the capillaries were rinsed into 20 \u03bcl of fetal calf serum with a Hamilton syringe. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 2 minutes and kept frozen (\u221280\u00b0 C.) for further virus detection using a cell culture enzyme immunoassay (CCEIA). Mosquito whole bodies were frozen on dry ice and kept at \u221280\u00b0 C. for quantitative PCR virus detection.","Oral Feeding with DENV-2 and CHIKV","Mosquitoes were starved for 24 hrs and then transferred to 1 L or 2.5 L plastic feeding containers. Prior to feeding, DENV-2 was harvested from C6\/36 cell culture supernatant and diluted 1:5 in defibrinated sheep's blood. For the CHIKV experiments, frozen aliquots of stock virus were rapidly thawed, and diluted in washed defibrinated sheep blood and 1% sucrose. Blood-virus mixtures were maintained at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 h and 4 h for DENV-2 and CHIKV, respectively, using membrane feeders (Rutledge et al., 1964) and covered with a porcine intestine as the membrane. After feeding, mosquitoes were anesthetized using COand partially and non-engorged mosquitoes were discarded. Fully engorged mosquitoes were maintained on a 15% sucrose solution at 12:12 (L:D) h, 27-28\u00b0 C. and 70% RH. To determine DENV-2 infection and dissemination rates, up to 40 mosquitoes were processed separately at 7 and 14 d post-exposure. To follow the replication and dissemination of CHIKV, 10-30 mosquitoes were processed on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 post-exposure. Mosquitoes were anesthetized using CO, and the legs (for DENV-2) and legs and wings (for CHIKV) from each mosquito were removed, and these and the remaining body and head were stored separately at \u221280\u00b0 C. Samples were processed using the CCEIA method (DENV-2) or qRT-PCR (CHIKV) described below. Differences in the frequency of DENV-2 infection and dissemination between mosquito lines were analyzed using chisquare goodness of fit tests after the 7 or 14 d extrinsic incubation period for DENV-2 and at 14 d for CHIKV (Zar, 1999).","Cell Culture Enzyme Immunoassays","Titration of DENV-2 and CHIKV stocks and blood\/virus mixtures was performed using a CCEIA method similar to that previously described (Broom et al., 1998). For DENV-2, C6\/36 cell monolayers (60-90% confluent) in 96-well plates were inoculated with 50 \u03bcl\/well of virus dilutions and plates were incubated at 28\u00b0 C. with 5% COfor 5 d. Cell monolayers then were fixed and examined for DENV-2 antigens using a cocktail of cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (4G4 and 4G2) (Hall et al., 1991). For CHIKV, all titrations were performed in Vero cells, which were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO2. After 7 d plates were examined for cytopathic effect (CPE), which was confirmed using the CCEIA and the broadly reactive alphavirus monoclonal antibody, B10.",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0080","num":"0000"},"i":"Plasmodium gallinaceum "},"Two to three day-old White Leghorn chickens were infected through intraperitoneal or intradermal injection of 8A strain parasitized blood (Rodrigues et al., 2008). Parasitemia was determined every other day through Giemsa-stained blood smears. Ten microscopic fields were examined under immersion oil to count one hundred red blood cells and determine the ratio of infected cells. Presence of gametocytes and rising parasitemia was ensured in order to enhance the chance of mosquito infection. Before infection mosquitoes were deprived of sugar solution overnight and on the next morning chickens were placed on top of the cages and mosquitoes were fed for about 45 minutes. Only bloodfed female mosquitoes were kept for further observations. Four independent experiments were performed with independent cohorts. Seven days after bloodfeeding mosquitoes had their midguts dissected in 1\u00d7PBS and after staining the midguts with 0.2% Mercurochrome solution oocysts were counted under a microscope (DIC, 100\u00d7). Fifteen days after infection mosquitoes were collected and DNA was extracted (Qiagen Blood & Tissue kit) for detection. For detection around 1 ng of genomic DNA was used in quantitative PCR reactions as described below. Primers for the spp. 18S ssu rRNA gene (Schneider and Shahabuddin, 2000) were used for the parasite sequence amplification and Actin primers were used as a host control gene (see primer sequences in Table 6). Analyses were performed with qGENE (Joehanes and Nelson, 2008) and Mann Whitney-U tests (STATISTICA V8, StatSoft, Inc.) to compare relative abundance between lines.","Quantitative DENY PCR Analysis","Individual frozen mosquito whole bodies or body parts were placed into 2 ml screw cap vials with a glass bead (2 mm diameter, Sigma-Aldrich). 200 \u03bcl of Trizol (Invitrogen) was added and the sample homogenized for 150 s using a Mini BeadBeater (Biospec Products). Tubes were incubated at room temperature for 5 min, 40 \u03bcl of chloroform was added to each tube and samples were thoroughly vortexed for 10 s. Tubes were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 g at 4\u00b0 C. and the supernatant containing the RNA was transferred to new tubes. RNA was precipitated by adding 40 \u03bcl of isopropanol and incubated at \u221220\u00b0 C. overnight. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C. to pellet the RNA. Pellets were washed with 200 \u03bcL of 70% ethanol and after centrifugation (7,500\u00d7g for 5 min at 4\u00b0 C.) ethanol was removed and pellets were dried for 10 min in a fume hood. RNA was resuspended in 25 \u03bcL of RNAse-free milli-Q water and tubes were incubated for 10 min at 56\u00b0 C. Samples were maintained at \u221280\u00b0 C. until further analysis. cDNA synthesis was based on the protocol described by Richardson (Richardson et al., 2006), which allowed us to determine both the genomic (+RNA) and replicative (anti-genomic) virus forms (\u2212RNA). Briefly, 0.5 \u03bcg of each RNA (2 \u03bcg for saliva samples) was mixed with 0.625 \u03bcM of either the DENV-2 NS5 forward or reverse primer (see Table 6) plus 0.2 mM dNTPs in separate cDNA reactions. Samples were incubated at 86\u00b0 C. for 15 min and 5 min on ice, then 5\u00d7 first strand buffer and 100U of Superscript III (Invitrogen) was added to a total volume of 20 \u03bcl. Samples were incubated at 25\u00b0 C. for 10 min, followed by 42\u00b0 C. for 50 min and 10 min at 95\u00b0 C. to inactivate the transcriptase. Negative controls (no template) were included in each reaction. For DENV-2 detection, cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 with milli-Q water. The qPCR reaction consisted of 2 \u03bcl of the diluted cDNAs, 5 \u03bcl of Sybr Green mix (Invitrogen) and 1 \u03bcM of each primer (see above), in 10 \u03bcl total volume. Reactions were performed in duplicate in a Rotor-gene thermal cycler (Corbett Life Sciences) with the following conditions: 50\u00b0 C. 2 min, 95\u00b0 C. 2 min, 45 cycles (95\u00b0 C. 5 s, 60\u00b0 C. 5 s, 72\u00b0 C. 10 s) followed by the melting curve (68\u00b0 C. to 95\u00b0 C.). Melting curves for each sample were analyzed after each run to check specificity. A standard curve was created by cloning the DENV-2 NS5 fragment into pGEM\u00aeT-Easy (Promega). After linearization with Pst I the plasmid was serially diluted into known concentrations and run in parallel, in order to determine the absolute number of DENV-2 copies contained in each sample. Mann-Whitney U tests were employed (STATISTICA V8, StatSoft, Inc.) to examine the effect of infection on dengue number for each for each paired strain combination (PGYP1\u00d7PGYP1.tet; PGYP1.out\u00d7PGYP1.out.tet)\u00d7body part (whole, abdomen, thorax)\u00d7age (5 or 14 d) post inoculation. The tests were based on the means from each of 4 independently replicated experiments.","CHIKV qRT-PCR Analysis","Individual frozen mosquito bodies and heads or legs and wings were homogenized for 3 min in 1 ml of Opti-MEM\u00ae reduced serum medium respectively using glass beads and a mechanical homogenizer (Spex Industries, Edison, N.J.). The supernatant from each sample was removed for potential virus isolation and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. The remaining mosquito pellet from each sample was resuspended in equal volumes (200 \u03bcl) of Opti-MEM\u00ae reduced serum medium and TRIzol\u00ae LS reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, California) and homogenized again as described above. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min and addition of 40 \u03bcl of chloroform, the entire homogenate for each sample was then vortexed for 15 sec and transferred to a pre-spun Phase Lock Gel\u2122 Heavy tube (5 Prime, GmbH, Germany). The lysed contents of each tube were allowed to settle for 5 min at room temperature and organic and aqueous phases were separated by centrifugation at 16 000 g for 10 min at room temperature. Aqueous phases were recovered from each tube before total RNA was extracted at room temperature using a modification of the RNeasy Mini Kit protocol (Qiagen, Australia) and on column-DNase treatment. RNA was eluted from the column with 30 \u03bcl of RNasefree HO and a final centrifugation step for 1 min. All RNA samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. prior to analysis by qRT-PCR. RNA standards were produced for the relative quantification of CHIKV RNA copy numbers normalized to RNA levels of the ribosomal housekeeping gene RpS17 (see Table 6).","Immune Genes","PGYP1.out and PGYP1.out.tet mosquitoes were analyzed by RT-qPCR for a selection of immune genes. Two biologically independent cohorts of ten sugar-fed, 5-6 day old, female mosquitoes were collected and analyzed from each mosquito line. Total RNA was extracted from whole mosquitoes using TRI REAGENT (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) or RiboZol (AMRESCO). The RNA samples were DNase treated (Promega) and reverse transcribed using random primers and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was carried out as per Platinum SYBR Green protocol (Invitrogen). The sequences of the primers used for qPCR are detailed in Table 6. Primer sequences for REL1, REL2, CECG and DEFC were obtained elsewhere (Xi et al., 2008) and the other primers were designed using gene sequences obtained from VectorBase. The temperature profile of the qPCR was 95\u00b0 C. for 2 min, 50\u00b0 C. for 2 min and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0 C. for 10 s, 60\u00b0 C. for 10 s and 72\u00b0 C. for 20 s. The house-keeping gene RpS17 (Cook et al., 2006) was used to normalize expression. Target gene to house-keeping gene ratios were obtained for each biological replicate using QGene 4.2 (Joehanes and Nelson, 2008). Treatment effects on the expression ratios were examined using Mann Whitney-U tests in STATISTICA V8 (StatSoft, Inc.) and fold change was calculated by the REST method (Pfaffl et al., 2002).","Immunofluorescence","Following the removal of legs and wings, 14 dpi mosquitoes were fixed overnight at 4\u00b0 C. in 4% (w\/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, containing 0.5% (v\/v) Triton X-100. Fixed mosquitoes were dehydrated in an ethanol series of 50, 70, 90, 95, 100% ethanol, followed by two toluene treatments and then infiltrated with paraffin wax (Paraplast-Xtra, McCormick Scientific) at 60\u00b0 C. Paraffin-embedded mosquitoes were sectioned using a rotary microtome to obtain 8 \u03bcm sections that were adhered to superfrost plus slides (Menzel-Gl\u00e4ser). Slides were dried, deparaffinated in 100% xylene, rehydrated in an ethanol series and then washed in PBS-T before being blocked overnight in 2% (w\/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS-T at 4 C. Sections were then incubated simultaneously for 1 hour with antirabbit WSP (1:100) and anti-dengue (1:10) 4G4 or anti-CSP (Krettli et al., 1988) antibodies (1:100) (both monoclonal, developed in mouse), diluted in blocking solution. Tissue sections were washed twice with PBS-T and the slides were then incubated simultaneously with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa-488 developed in rabbit or Alexa-594, developed in mice, respectively, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) diluted 1:1000 each in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. After two washes in PBS-T, the slides were incubated in DAPI for 10 min, rinsed in PBS-T and then mounted using an antifading reagent (ProLong, Invitrogen). Immunostaining was analyzed with a Zeiss Axio Imager II epifluorescence microscope equipped with an Axiocam camera, using the same exposure conditions for each filter channel. Photos are representative of at least 10 mosquitoes of each treatment.","Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization","FISH was done using a modified protocol adapted from GeneDetect.com. Briefly, paraffin-embedded mosquitoes were sectioned and de-paraffinated as described above. Sections were then dehydrated in an ethanol series and hybridised overnight at 37\u00b0 C. in a hybridization buffer containing 4\u00d7SSC, 50% formamide, 250 mg\/ml dextran sulfate, 250 \u03bcg\/ml poly(A), 250 \u03bcg\/ml tRNA, 250 ug\/ml salmon sperm DNA, 100 mM DTT and 0.5\u00d7Denhardt's solution and 200 ng of specific 16S rRNAprobes (W2: 5\u2032-CTTCTGTGAGTACCGTCATTATC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 15) and W3: 5\u2032-AACCGACCCTATCCCTTCGAATA-3\u2033 (SEQ ID NO: 16)) labelled at the 3\u2032 end with rhodamine. Both probes are 100% homologous to both wMelPop and wFlu. Following overnight hybridizations, sections were washed twice in 1\u00d7SSC containing 10 mM DTT and twice in 0.5\u00d7SSC containing 10 mM DTT for 15 min each at 55\u00b0 C., followed by a 10 min wash at 0.5\u00d7SSC containing 10 mM DTT and 1 \u03bcg\/ml DAPI. Slides were briefly rinsed in water, mounted using an antifading reagent (ProLong, Invitrogen) and observed and photographed as described in the immunofluorescence method.","Western Blot Analysis","Total protein from 5 mosquitoes of each treatment was extracted using protein lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 0.5% (v\/v) Triton X-100, 1.5 \u03bcg\/ml DNAseI and protease inhibitors (Roche). Samples were boiled for 10 min in the presence of protein loading buffer, run on a 12% Laemmli SDS gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) through the semidry Transblot SD (BioRad). Because the 4G4 antidengue antibody recognizes a conformational epitope, \u2212mercaptoethanol was omitted from the sample loading buffer. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk in TBS-T overnight at 4 C, and then probed with antiwsp polyclonal antibody (Braig et al., 1998) (diluted 1:1,000 in 5% (w\/v) skim milk in TBS-T) or anti-dengue (4G4) monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes in TBS-T, membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody (Sigma) (1:4,000) for 1 h, respectively. Following washing in TBS-T blots were developed with NBT\/BCIP (Promega). Western blots on -infected mosquitoes revealed a single band around 26 kDa that corresponds with the correct molecular weight of wsp (25540 Da) (Braig et al., 1998), whereas the 4G4 antibody revealed a band of around 50 kDa in dengue-positive mosquitoes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0087","num":"0000"},"i":["Wolbachia ","Aedes "]},"A standard curve was created by cloning a wsp gene fragment (Braig et al., 1998) into pGEM T-Easy (Promega). After linearization with Pst I the plasmid was serially diluted into known concentrations and run in parallel, in order to determine the absolute number of copies contained in each mosquito sample. Mann-Whitney U tests were employed (STATISTICA V8, StatSoft, Inc.) to examine the density of in both mosquito species.","PCR Amplification of Sequences from ","The surface protein gene wsp was amplified using the primers 81F and 691R that amplify a wide range of strains (Braig et al., 1998). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0 C. 3 min, (94\u00b0 C. 30 s, 52\u00b0 C. 30 s, 68\u00b0 C. 90 s)\u00d735 cycles, then 68\u00b0 C. 10 min. The reaction mixture contained 625 nM of each primer, 125 \u03bcM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 20 ng of mosquito DNA and 0.5 \u03bcL, of proof-reading Elongase enzyme mix (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 25 \u03bcl. PCR products were separated in 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Six independent PCR amplicons were cloned into the pGEM T Easy vector (Promega) and six clones were sequenced with T7 and M13R universal primers using the AB Big Dye terminator Version 3.1 kit with fluorescent sequencing (FS), AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and analysed on (AB) 3730x1-96 capillary sequencer. Sequencing was done at the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF). Sequence similarity searches were performed using the BLAST algorithm (Altschul et al., 1997) at NCBI, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using DNAstar (Lasergene). A partial wsp gene sequence from wFlu has been deposited in GenBank (Accession number GQ917108).","Relative Quantification of CHIKV RNA Copy Numbers","RNA standards were produced for the relative quantification of CHIKV RNA copy numbers normalized to RNA levels of the ribosomal housekeeping gene RpS17. Firstly, a CHIKV RNA synthetic transcript was produced by RT-PCR amplification of a 588 bp fragment from the CHIKV strain 06113879 using primers designed from its deduced partial E1 structural gene sequence (GenBank accession number EU404186) (see Table 6). The one-step RT-PCR was performed using the Superscript\u00ae III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum\u00ae Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen Life Technologies, California) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 400 nM of each primer and 5 \u03bcl of CHIKV RNA in a final reaction volume of 50 \u03bcl. Amplification was performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler epgradient S (Eppendorf, Germany) and included one cycle at 50\u00b0 C. for 15 min for reverse transcription, an inactivation step at 94\u00b0 C. for 2 min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0 C. for 2 min, 59\u00b0 C. for 30 sec and 68\u00b0 C. for 2.5 min and final extension at 68\u00b0 C. for 5 min. Amplicon DNA was purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Australia) and supplied instructions and then cloned into the plasmid vector pGEM\u00ae-T Easy (Promega). After the presence and orientation of the insert DNA was verified by nucleotide sequencing, the plasmid was linearized for in vitro RNA transcription by digestion with SpeI. Synthetic RNA transcripts were then prepared using the Riboprobe\u00ae T7 System (Promega) before multiple treatments with DNase 1 (RQ1 RNase-Free DNase; Promega Corporation, WI, USA). The final CHIKV transcript of 654 bp was stored in single use aliquots at \u221280\u00b0 C. and RNA levels were determined by spectrophotometry immediately prior to use. For the housekeeping gene RpS17 RNA standard, total RNA from whole mosquitoes was extracted as before with the exception that on-column DNase treatment was omitted. In this instance, RNA was DNase treated and stored as described for the CHIKV RNA transcript. To enable a direct comparison of CHIKV RNA copy numbers in prepared mosquito body plus head, and legs plus wings samples, two specific one-step qRT-PCR real-time TaqMan\u00ae assays were developed targeting the CHIKV E1 and RpS17 genes respectively. Both were performed using the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calfornia) and all reaction mixes, amplification parameters, result analysis and CHIKV primer and probe sequences were used as previously reported. Primers and dual labelled probe (5\u2032-FAMCAGGAGGAGGAACGTGAGCGCAG-TAMRA-3\u2033) (SEQ ID NO: 17) for the RpS17 housekeeping assay were derived from the RpS17 gene sequence\u2014GenBank accession number AY927787. Standard curves for qRT-PCRs were generated using triplicate 15-fold serial dilutions of either the CHIKV T7 RNA transcript or the prepared RpS17 reference RNA. Equivalent CHIKV RNA copy numbers normalized to reference RpS17 RNA levels were then calculated for the CHIKV infected mosquito samples by comparing threshold cycle numbers (Ct) with the respective standards.",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0091","num":"0000"},"i":"Wolbachia "},"We tested the effect of on vector competence in two mosquito genetic backgrounds: the original inbred PGYP1 line, which was stably transinfected with wMelPop-CLA (see Example 2) and the same strain after 5 generations of backcrossing to the F1 progeny of wild-caught , collected in Cairns, Australia and named PGYP1.out. These mosquito strains were compared to tetracycline-treated counterparts that were genetically identical but lacked the infection, named PGYP1.tet and PGYP1.out.tet, respectively. In addition, a wild-type strain of established from field-collected material in Cairns, Australia (Cairns3) was used as an additional negative control.","Mosquitoes were fed an artificial blood meal spiked with DENV-2 in four independent experiments to examine possible interactions with . The presence of DENV-2 in whole mosquito bodies was examined 7 and 14 days post exposure using a cell culture enzyme immunoassay (CCEIA) (Knox et al., 2003). In three separate experiments no -infected mosquitoes (PGYP1.out) tested positive for DENV-2, but DENV-2 infection rates in -uninfected mosquitoes (PGYP1.out.tet and Cairns3) ranged from 30-100% (Table 3, Exp 1-3). The body viral infection rates in PGYP1.out.tet mosquitoes ranged from 30-100% after 7 d and 48-97% after 14 d, while the body viral infection rates in Cairns3 ranged from 50-95% after 7 d and 57-95% after 14 d. The disseminated viral infection rates measured through the presence of virus in mosquito legs in tetracycline-treated ranged from 10-23 and 37-43% after 7 and 14 d respectively. Disseminated infections in -free wildtype Cairns3 strain of ranged from 5-13% and 20-33% after 7 and 14 d, respectively (Table 3) (P<0.001, chi-square). In one experiment (Table 3, Exp 4) when mosquitoes were fed the highest titer (107.8 Logs) of DENV-2 a small number of -infected mosquitoes tested positive for DENV-2 at both 7 and 14 days post infection (5 and 8%, respectively) but this was significantly fewer than uninfected controls (63-78% and 70-75%, respectively) (P<0.001, chi-square). To provide a more conservative test of -mediated interference, mosquitoes were intrathoracically injected with DENV-2. These experiments circumvented the midgut barrier to infection (Woodring et al., 1996) and allowed for the delivery of a repeatable inoculating dose (around 2,750 infectious particles\/mosquito) of DENV-2 that produced consistent high-titre infections in control mosquitoes. Accumulation of genomic (+RNA) and anti-genomic (\u2212RNA) RNA strands was assessed at 5 and 14 d post-injection by quantitative real time PCR using DENV-2 specific primers (Richardson et al., 2006). At both time points, the amount of DENV-2 RNA present was reduced by up to 4 logs in both the PGYP 1 and PGYP1.out -infected strains compared to their paired tetracycline treated counterparts (, Table 5). Furthermore, when mosquito saliva collected from mosquitoes 14 d post injection was tested for the presence of infectious virus by CCEIA, none of the -infected mosquitoes samples tested positive for virus. A dramatic reduction in viral protein synthesis was also observed by immunofluorescent microscopy (IFA) () and Western blot analysis (). Double immunofluorescent staining of paraffin sections of -uninfected control mosquitoes 14 days post-injection showed DENV-2 infection predominantly in mosquito fat body as well as ommatidia () and nervous system. DENV-2 was not detected in any of these tissues in -infected mosquitoes (PGYP1 and PGYP1.out) whereas was clearly visible in the fat tissue, ommatidia (), brain, ovaries, and Malpighian tubules. Only in a few rare individuals was DENV-2 detected in patches of fat tissue in PGYP1.out mosquitoes. However in these cases and DENV-2 were not co-localized in the same cells and DENV-2 was only seen in occasional patches of cells that were not infected with (). The presence of DENV-2 in some injected PGYP1.out mosquitoes was also confirmed by Western blot ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0092","num":"0000"},"i":"Wolbachia "},"We then went on to determine if the virus interference phenotype would extend to the alphavirus CHIKV. The virus strain used in the experiments contained the alanine to valine mutation in the membrane fusion glycoprotein E1 gene (E1-A226V), which has been linked to increased infectivity in . An Australian population of was recently shown to also be a highly efficient laboratory vector of this virus strain. Mosquitoes were exposed to a blood\/virus mixture containing 106.4 CCID50\/ml of CHIKV, and at various timepoints post exposure, mosquitoes were processed for quantification of the number of viral RNA copies using qPCR and CHIKV-specific primers and probes. Immediately after feeding, the number of CHIKV genomic (+RNA) RNA copies in the body and head were comparable for all three lines, suggesting that they imbibed similar amounts of virus (Table 4). The median number of copies then decreased in all three lines on days 2, prior to it increasing in the PGYP1.out.tet and Cairns3 mosquitoes to its highest level at day 14-post exposure. The day 14 infection rates were 87% and 79% for the PGYP1.out.tet and Cairns3 controls and 17% for the infected PGYP1.out line (P<0.001, chi-square). In all three groups, CHIKV RNA was detected in the legs and wings immediately after feeding, as percentage of dissemination (Table 4). This may represent either direct contact between the legs and\/or wings and the blood\/virus mixture or a rupture of the mesenteron, which released virus directly in the hemolymph (Turell, 1988). After day 0, CHIKV was not detected in the legs and wings of any PGYP1.out (+Wolb) mosquitoes. In contrast, on all days post exposure, virus was detected in the legs and wings of PGYP.out.tet and Cairns3 control mosquitoes (\u2212Wolb) and by day 14, the virus was detected in the legs and wings of 100% and 90%, respectively, of mosquitoes which had positive bodies and heads (P=0.125, chi-square).",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0093","num":"0000"},"i":["Wolbachia ","Plasmodium "]},"Considering that the viral interference effect appeared robust for two unrelated arboviruses we then went on to test for the effect on the protozoan parasite . While not a human pathogen, this species of malaria parasite is known to be able to infect mosquitoes in the laboratory. infected and uninfected mosquitoes (PGYP1.out and PGYP1.out.tet strains) as well as a susceptible strain of were fed in parallel on infected chickens. has a broad geographical distribution in Latin America and has been used in the laboratory as a safe avian malaria () model vector, as it does not naturally transmit DENV or yellow fever virus (Tason de Camargo and Krettli, 1981). Seven days post-feeding on infected chickens, mosquito midguts were dissected and the number of oocysts counted. The presence of wMelPop-CLA significantly reduced the oocyst load in mosquitoes (P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test) () by 67 to 88%, in four independent experiments, in comparison to tetracycline treated mosquitoes. Furthermore, the proportion of mosquitoes that contained oocysts in the midgut was significantly lower in PGYP1.out (43%), than in PGYP1.out.tet (74%) or (88%). To quantify the difference in parasite loads, fifteen days after infection mosquitoes were collected and the DNA was extracted. The relative abundance of genomic DNA was measured by the 18S ssu rRNA gene (Schneider and Shahabuddin, 2000) and normalized to the mosquito Actin gene using qPCR and the results showed the same pattern of interference as observed from oocyst count data. In PGYP1.out mosquitoes genomic DNA was 26-fold less abundant than in PGYP1.out.tet lines (). Immunofluorescence analysis using an anti-CSP (circumsporozoite protein) monoclonal antibody shows the presence of mature oocysts in both mosquito species (), but very rarely in -infected mosquitoes.","When we incubated the mosquito sections with an anti-(wsp) antibody we serendipitously discovered a infection in mosquitoes indicating that this species of mosquito was naturally infected with . PCR using general wsp primers (Braig et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 1998) amplified a fragment from all tested. Sequence of the amplified DNA indicated that this strain (named wFlu) belongs to the B supergroup and is distantly related to wMelPop-CLA. qPCR analysis revealed that the density of wFlu in is about 20-fold lower than the density of wMelPop-CLA in (). We then examined the tissue localization of in both mosquito species and whereas wMelPop-CLA is distributed throughout most tissues of the mosquito including the fat body, anterior midgut, muscle, nervous tissue, malpighian tubules and ovaries, wFlu is present only in ovaries, malpighian tubules and less frequently in the head, but absent from ommatidia ().","Immunity Genes","To examine whether resistance of infected mosquitoes to pathogen infection may be related to stimulation or priming of the mosquito innate immune system, we quantified the expression of a sample of immune genes. It was recently demonstrated that some immune genes are differentially regulated in mosquitoes infected with dengue virus (Xi et al., 2008). Interestingly, regulation of the immune pathway genes in these mosquitoes was also stimulated by their natural gut microbiota and rearing mosquitoes aseptically, and so depleting their bacterial flora, resulted in a 2-fold increase of dengue virus in the midgut (Xi et al., 2008). We chose a subset of the genes that were shown to be upregulated upon dengue virus infection to assess the effect of infection on the mosquito immune system. The expression levels of eleven immune pathway genes in the wMelPop-CLA infected PGYP1.out and its uninfected control line were compared for two independently reared cohorts of mosquitoes (). In each of the experiments four genes encoding representatives of the immune effector molecules cecropin, defensin, thio-ester containing proteins (TEP) and C-type lectins were significantly upregulated in the presence of wMelPop-CLA, whereas FREP18 (fibrinogenrelated protein 18) levels remained unchanged ( A and B). In contrast, while a statistically significant (P<0.05) differential mRNA expression between mosquitoes with and without was observed for a subset of the genes from the Toll, IMD and Jak\/STAT signaling pathways ( Experiment 1-Rel 1A and SOCS36E;  Experiment 2\u2014IMD and Rel 2) these differences were inconsistent across the two experiments, suggesting that the variation between cohorts was greater than any differences induced by . In addition, in these cases the fold-change of mRNA expression was low (below 2-fold), whereas the effector genes were induced as much as 100-fold by the presence of (). These results indicate that the presence of wMelPop-CLA in mosquitoes stimulates expression of at least some immune effector genes, although a clear stimulation of the classical innate immune signaling pathways was not repeatably identified.","Mosquito Strains and Maintenance","wMelPop-infected PGYP1 and tetracycline-cleared PGYP1.tet strains of (see Example 2) were maintained at 25\u00b0 C., 75-85% relative humidity, with a 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod. Larvae were reared in plastic trays (30\u00d740\u00d78 cm) at a set density of 150 larvae in 3 L distilled water, and fed 150 mg fish food (TetraMin Tropical Tablets, Tetra, Germany) per pan every day until pupation. Adults were kept in screened 30\u00d730\u00d730 cm cages, and provided with constant access to 10% sucrose solution and water. Females (5 days old) were blood-fed using human blood for egg production. For routine colony maintenance, eggs from PGYP 1 were hatched 5-7 days post-oviposition (i.e. without prolonged desiccation) to initiate the next generation. All fitness experiments with PGYP 1 were conducted at Gto Gpost transinfection.","Pre-imaginal Development and Survivorship","Eggs (120 h old) from PGYP 1 and PGYP1.tet strains were hatched synchronously in nutrient-infused deoxygenated water for 1 h. After hatching, individual first instar larvae (n=156 per strain) were placed into separate plastic 30 mL plastic cups with 20 mL of water, and fed 1 mg powdered TetraMin suspended in distilled water each day until pupation. The number of days spent in each pre-imaginal life stage (i.e., 1, 2, 3and 4instars, pupae), mortality at each stage, and sex of eclosing adults were recorded every 24 h. Stage-specific development and eclosion times for each strain were compared using Mann-Whitney U (MWU) tests conducted in Statistica Version 8 (StatSoft, Tulsa, Okla.).","Adult Wing Length Measurements","As an indicator of adult body size, wing lengths of PGYP1 and PGYP1.tet mosquitoes (n=50 of each sex) derived from the pre-imaginal development time assay were measured (Nasci, 1986). Wing lengths of males and females from each strain were compared using MWU tests.","Viability of Quiescent Embryos Over Time","PGYP 1 and PGYP1.tet females were blood-fed on human blood, and 96 h post-blood meal isolated individually for oviposition in plastic vials with wet filter paper funnels. After oviposition, egg papers were kept wet for 48 h, after which time they were removed from vials, wrapped individually in paper towel, and conditioned for a further 72 h at 25\u00b0 C. and 75-85% relative humidity. Egg batches were then moved to their respective storage temperature of 18\u00b0 C., or 25\u00b0 C. in glass desiccator jars; maintained at a constant relative humidity of 85% with a saturated KCl solution (Winston and Bates 1960). For each temperature, 20 oviposition papers from each strain were hatched at seven time points at 7 day-intervals (5 to 47 days post-oviposition) by submersion in nutrient-infused deoxygenated water for 48 h. To hatch any remaining eggs, oviposition papers were dried briefly then submersed for a further 5 days and before the final number of hatched larvae was recorded. Regression analysis was used to detect trends in the viability of eggs from each strain over time. MWU tests were used to compare viability of eggs between strains at the same storage age.","Lifetime Productivity Measurements","Replicate 30\u00d730\u00d730 cm cages containing 200 individuals of each sex from PGYP1 and PGYP1.tet strains were maintained over multiple gonotrophic cycles, with ad libitum access to 10% sucrose solution and water, for the duration of their lifespan. During each cycle, females were provided with a human blood meal for 2\u00d710 min periods on consecutive days, and 96 h post-blood meal a random sample of females (n=48) was collected from each cage and isolated individually for oviposition. Following a set 24 h period for oviposition, females were returned to their respective cages and the proportion of females laying eggs determined. Eggs were conditioned and hatched 120 h post-oviposition as described above, and the total number of eggs (fecundity) and hatched larvae (fertility) from each female were recorded. To ensure that gravid females not sampled for oviposition could also lay eggs every cycle, oviposition cups were introduced into each stock cage (96 h post-blood meal) for a period of 48 h. Females were then blood fed to initiate the next gonotrophic cycle.","Cages were sampled until all females in the population were dead, which occurred after 7 and 16 gonotrophic cycles for PGYP 1 and PGYP1.tet strains respectively. To ensure PGYP1.tet females did not become depleted of sperm, young males (3 days old) were supplemented to this cage after 8 gonotrophic cycles. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine the relationship between mosquito fecundity\/fertility and the covariates mosquito age and infection status. Regression analysis was used to detect trends in fecundity\/fertility of mosquitoes from each strain over their lifespan. Student's t-test was used to compare the fecundity\/fertility of mosquitoes from both strains of the same age.","Pre-imaginal Development and Adult Size","No significant differences in development times for larval stages of wMelPop-infected PGYP1 or tetracycline-cleared PGYP1.tet males () were found (MWU, P>0.05 for all comparisons). In contrast, the mean development time for male PGYP1 pupae (64.88\u00b11.38 h) was significantly greater relative to PGYP1.tet (57.00\u00b11.25 h) (MWU, U=1892.00, P<0.001), resulting in a longer cumulative time to eclosion for this strain (MWU, U=1484.50, P<0.001). For females (), development times for immature stages were not significantly different between strains; except for third instar larvae where PGYP 1 development times were increased by \u02dc5 h relative to PGYP1.tet (MWU, U=1929.00, P=0.013). Despite this delay, eclosion times for PGYP1 females were not significantly different from PGYP1.tet (MWU, U=2185.50, P=0.15). Overall, the survivorship of immature stages from both strains to adulthood was identical (96.15%).","A comparison of the wing lengths of newly emerged adults from both strains revealed a minor, yet statistically significant adult size cost to wMelPop infection for both sexes (). Wing lengths of PGYP1 males (2.36\u00b10.01 mm, n=50) were significantly shorter than those of PGYP1.tet males (2.46\u00b10.02 mm, n=50) (MWU, U=661.50, P<0.0001). A smaller size difference (MWU, U=955.00, P=0.04) was found between PGYP1 females (3.03\u00b10.03 mm, n=50) and PGYP1.tet females (3.09\u00b10.03 mm, n=50).","Viability of Quiescent Embryos Over Time","The viability of quiescent embryos from the wMelPop-infected PGYP1 strain decreased over time at 25\u00b0 C. and 18\u00b0 C., whereas viability of embryos from of the tetracycline-treated PGYP1.tet strain was relatively stable at both storage temperatures (). At 25\u00b0 C. (), there was no significant difference in embryonic viability between PGYP1 (80.93\u00b15.12%) and PGYP1.tet strains (74.96\u00b14.37%) at 5 days post oviposition (MWU, U=146.50, P=0.1478). As quiescent embryos aged, however, PGYP1 embryonic viability decreased rapidly over time (R=0.6539, F=260.73, P<0.0001), such that by 40 days post oviposition very few PGYP1 eggs hatched (0.44\u00b10.24%). In contrast, PGYP1.tet embryonic viability remained relatively constant over time (R=0.0005, F=0.07, P=0.7897) with \u02dc75% of quiescent eggs hatching at each time point. An analogous trend was observed at 18\u00b0 C. (), where initially hatch rates were comparable between the two strains, but subsequently a greater loss in embryonic viability was observed for PGYP1 (R=0.4035, F=93.34, P<0.0001) relative to PGYP1.tet (R=0.0803, F=12.05, P<0.001). This was particularly evident at 12 days post oviposition where embryonic viability declined more rapidly in PGYP1 (9.88\u00b12.96%) compared to PGYP1.tet (68.06\u00b14.12%) after being moved to a cooler storage temperature (MWU, U=5.00, P<0.0001).","Reproductive Output Over Lifespan","PGYP1 and PGYP1.tet females had similar reproductive outputs in terms of the number of eggs oviposited and the number of viable larvae hatched per female during their first gonotrophic cycle ( and B). However, during subsequent cycles both fecundity () and fertility () of PGYP1 females decreased at an accelerated rate relative to those from the PGYP1.tet strain (ANCOVA, P<0.0001 for both comparisons). As PGYP1 females aged, the average number of larvae produced per female decreased such that by the second cycle a 15% cost to reproductive output was observed relative to uninfected PGYP1.tet females, which progressively declined to a 40% cost by the fifth cycle (t-tests, P<0.05 for all comparisons). A large proportion of PGYP 1 females that were randomly sampled for oviposition at the six and seventh gonotrophic cycles did not produce eggs (), leading to a further decline in fecundity and fertility of this strain ( and B). This appeared to be due to defects in feeding behaviour, as many of these older PGYP1 females were observed to be unsuccessful in obtaining a blood meal (data not shown). Such a dramatic decrease in oviposition rates was not evident for PGYP1.tet females as they aged ().","Mosquito Rearing","For all experiments two laboratory lines of were used, the PGYP1 line, previously generated by transinfection with wMelPop and its cured control line, PGYP1.tet (see Example 2). Mosquitoes were reared at 26\u00b12\u00b0 C., RH 75% with 12 h:12 h light\/dark cycle. Larvae were fed 0.1 mg\/larvae of TetraMin Tropical Tablets once per day. Females were separated from males at the pupal stage and placed into 300 mmcages for emergence at a density of 400 individuals per cage. The females were fed 10% sucrose solution ad libitum until the day before feeding trials.","Confirmation of Infection Status","Mosquito lines were screened to confirm presence (PGYP1) or absence (PGYP1.tet) of infection every two generations using a PCR based assay. Five days after eclosion, DNA was extracted from 10 females using DNeasy spin columns (QIAGEN, Australia), following the Manufacturer's protocol. PCR was then carried out using primers for the IS5 transposable element present in (see Example 1). Reaction conditions were as follows: 0.01-0.09 \u03bcg of each DNA sample, 2 \u03bcl of 10\u00d7 Buffer, 0.5 \u03bcl 1 mM dNTPs, 0.5 \u03bcl of 20 \u03bcM IS5 primers, 0.15 \u03bcl Taq DNA polymerase and water up to 20 \u03bcl. Samples were denatured for three minutes at 94\u00b0 C. then cycled 34 times for 30 seconds at 94\u00b0 C., 30 seconds at 55\u00b0 C. and one minute at 72\u00b0 C. This cycle was followed by a final 10-minute extension at 72\u00b0 C. in a MJ Research PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (Geneworks Pty Ltd, SA). Presence of the expected size product was then confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis.","Preparation for Feeding Trials","Experiments were conducted with five, 26 and 35-day-old adult mosquitoes. Behaviours were measured in either small populations (proportion of population fed, number and length of attempted bites) or for single mosquitoes depending on feasibility (response time to human, blood-meal weight). The afternoon prior to each trial the required number of mosquitoes were removed from their rearing cages and stored in mesh-covered holding buckets at a density of five mosquitoes per bucket. At the same time an additional population of five mosquitoes were set aside to replace any mosquitoes that died during the starvation period. Mosquitoes were starved of sucrose but given access to water for \u02dc16 hours until trials began the next morning. Prior to each trial, mosquitoes were transferred from holding buckets into a 645 cmcage and allowed to acclimate for 5 minutes. All human volunteers cleaned both of their forearms with 70% isopropyl alcohol wipes, rinsed their forearms with distilled water and dried them with paper towel, and placed latex gloves on both their hands before feeding.","Population Trials","All population trials were carried out in two cages placed next to one another. One cage contained five PGYP1 mosquitoes and the adjacent cage contained five PGYP1.tet mosquitoes. The position (left or right) of the two lines was randomised throughout the experiment. Volunteers inserted their left and right arms into the respectively into the two cages and rested their hands on buckets placed within each cage. Both the volunteer and an external assistant monitored the number of attempted bites each mosquito made on the volunteer's forearm. An attempted bite was recorded when a mosquito landed and actively attempted to probe the volunteer's skin at a location. A single mosquito could probe multiple times at a single location, but if a mosquito moved to a new position and attempted to probe again this new location was recorded as another attempted bite. Mosquitoes in both cages were monitored for 15 minutes before the volunteer shook their arms and withdrew both arms from the cages. Mosquito abdomens were examined for presence of a blood meal and the proportion of the population that imbibed a blood meal was recorded. This experiment was replicated with six volunteers (3 female, 3 male)\u00d74 replicate trials for each of the three adult mosquito age classes.","Individual Trials","A single mosquito from each line was separately aspirated into on a pre-weighed 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and weighted on a Satorius BP211D balance (Selby Biolabs). Each mosquito was then released simultaneously into the adjacent 645 mmcages. Randomisation of cage position, mosquito settlement time and trial length were as per population trials. The volunteer inserted his arms into the cage and the times at which mosquito's made their first attempted bite (host-seeking time) were recorded by the volunteer into a voice recorder (Olympus VN-1100). After the trial, mosquitoes were transferred back into the tubes they were originally weighed in and the tubes were re-weighed. The weight of the blood-meal imbibed by each mosquito was then calculated. The volunteer (male) hosted four groups of 10 mosquitoes from each of the three age classes.","Statistical Analysis","All analysis was conducted using STATISTICA v8 (StatSoft, Inc). The variables, host-seeking time and blood-meal weight were normally distributed. The number of attempted bites was transformed by square root to achieve normality. The role of infection and age on these variables was examined using general linear mixed models. The role of human volunteer was not examined as there were only 6 replicate individuals and they were internally controlled. When infection status was significant, t-tests were then used to further identify specific differences between infected and uninfected lines within each of the three age classes. The proportion of mosquitoes obtaining a blood meal did not respond to transformation and so non-parametric Mann Whitney U-tests tests were employed instead of linear models to examine differences between infected and uninfected mosquitoes for all three ages.","Host Seeking","If the infected mosquitoes were hungrier than uninfected counterparts they might be more rapid in their response to an offered human forearm. Over the short distances in a laboratory cage environment, infected mosquitoes were no different to uninfected controls (F=0.10, df=1, P=0.77) in the time it took them to land on the human volunteer and initiate an \u201cattempted bite\u201d (). Age of the mosquitoes was also not a significant determinant of time to first \u201cattempted bite\u201d (F=0.99, df=2, P=0.43). These data suggest that wMelPop does not alter mosquito capacity to sense and respond to human hosts in the laboratory.","\u201cAttempted Biting\u201d","The number of \u201cattempted bites\u201d made by infected mosquitoes was examined as a possible indicator of hunger. As per our methods, an attempted bite included both probing and attempted probing in a particular region on the arm. Given the cage sizes and numbers of mosquitoes involved we could not visually differentiate between a probing event that broke the skin and one that did not. See the subsequent associated study by Moreira et al. for dissection of biting behaviour into successful and unsuccessful probing events (see Example 9). Infection status (F=13.37, df=1, P=0.014), age of mosquitoes (F=5.72, df=2, P=0.021), and the interaction between age and infection status (F=5.76, df=2, P=0.021) were significant determinants in the number of attempted bites made. In particular, -infected mosquitoes at 26 (t=\u22123.70, df=238, P<0.001) and 35 days of age (t=\u22125.35, df=235, P<0.001) attempted to bite more than their uninfected counterparts (). This was not the cased for five-day-old mosquitoes (t=\u22121.12, df 236, P=0.26). The significant interaction between infection status and age as reported above is seen in the increase in biting attempts by infected mosquitoes in the older age classes (). For example, if we directly compare infected 26-day-old versus 35-day-old mosquitoes we see an increase (t=\u22122.70, df=235, P=0.0073) in the mean number of attempted bites while this is not the case for uninfected mosquitoes (t=1.72, df=238, P=0.085). Lastly, we also measured the length of time each mosquito spent on an attempted bite (data not shown), which was not influenced by infection status (F=0.75, df=1, P=0.45) or age (F=1.68, df=2, P=0.26) of the mosquitoes. These data suggest that as infected mosquitoes age they are exhibiting a greater number of attempted bites than uninfected mosquitoes, but are not spending more time on any one attempt. In a subsequent study (see Example 9), it was shown that infected mosquitoes were actually less likely to pierce the skin and obtain a blood meal compared with uninfected mosquitoes and that this effect worsened with age.","Blood Meal Acquisition","Blood-meal weight () was examined as a measure of feeding success in the infected mosquitoes. Linear models revealed that blood-meal weight could be partially explained by the infection status (F=87.07, df=1, P<0.001) and age of mosquito (F=16.87, df=2, P<0.001). There was also a significant interaction between age and infection status (F=5.59, df=2, P=0.004). The blood-meal weight of wMelPop-infected mosquitoes was smaller than uninfected mosquitoes for all ages examined, (5 d, t=\u22122.80, df=67, P=0.007; 26 d, t=\u22127.15, df=67, P<0.001; 35 d, t=\u22126.09, df=66, P<0.001) with the differential increasing with age (). If infected mosquitoes were on average smaller than their uninfected counterparts, then smaller blood-meal weights would also be expected. A comparison of average weights of the infected and uninfected mosquitoes' pre-blood meal indicated there were no size differences between the lines, PGYP1 and PGYP1.tet (df=204, t=1.57, P=0.11). The median proportion of mosquitoes that imbibed a blood meal () was also reduced for infected 26 (Z=4.10, P<0.001) and 35-day-old (Z=5.39, P<0.001), but not 5-day-old (Z=0.83, P=0.74) mosquitoes relative to uninfected. These data indicate that as infected mosquitoes age, an increasing proportion of the population fails to successfully obtain a blood meal and that when they do feed the meals are smaller.","Behavioural Observations","Normally during biting a mosquito may probe unsuccessfully, but will ultimately insert its stylet into a host. In this study, infected mosquitoes were observed in which the proboscis repeatedly bent as the mosquito pushed its head towards the skin while probing. This phenotype appeared to be correlated with old age and poor ability to obtain a blood meal. Due to its correlation with old age, the behaviour was not observed in the study until much of the other work was completed, hence its quantification and correlation with biting success is reported in another study (see Example 9).","Mosquitoes",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0333","num":"0332"},"i":"Aedes aegypti "},"Behaviour Assays","Fertilized and non-blood fed females of different ages (5, 15, 26 and 35 days old) were used in all behaviour experiments. Sucrose solutions were removed from cages on the night before the experiments. Forty females were used per age and per infectious status. Single mosquitoes were transferred to a transparent Perspex cage (25 cm) and filmed through a digital camera with 6 mm Microlens (IEEE-1394, Point Grey Research) mounted on a tripod. Mosquitoes were given about five minutes to settle within the cage before a human gloved-hand was inserted into the cage. A window of about 15 cmwas cut of the upper part of the latex glove in order to delineate the probing field.","Movies were recorded (QuickTime Player) for a maximum of 10 minutes or until blood was seen within the mosquito midgut and subsequentially watched for time calculations. Two electronic timers were used, one for recording pre-probing time and the second for probing time. Pre-probing time was defined and the time since the mosquito has landed on the bare hand area until the insertion of mouthparts into the human skin. Probing time is defined as the initial insertion of insect mouthparts until blood can be seen within the mosquito midgut through the abdominal pleura (Ribeiro et al., 1984). Timing stopped when mosquitoes left the bare hand area or withdrew their mouthparts before taking blood and began again when the mosquito came back or after subsequent stylet penetration. If blood was not found by the end of 10 minutes, we defined this case as unsuccessful probing and it was measured as a proportion. Movies were also used to visualize additional abnormal phenotypes as the jittering action of mosquito body while landed on top of the human hand, and named \u201cshaky\u201d. Furthermore, the inability of mosquitoes to insert their mouthparts due to a bendy proboscis (Example 8) was also analysed.","Mosquito Saliva Collection","Mosquitoes of different ages (5, 26 and 35-days-old) and infectious status were starved overnight (without sucrose solution or water). On the following morning mosquitoes were briefly anesthetized with COand placed on a glass plate over ice. Wings and legs were removed with forceps and their proboscis introduced into a 1 cm piece of polypropylene tubing (0.61\u00d70.28 mm, Microtube Extrusions, NSW, Australia) (see Ribeiro et al., 1984). Females were allowed to salivate for 5 minutes and then the diameter of the saliva droplets was measured through an ocular micrometer at 40\u00d7 magnification. Volumes were calculated via the sphere formula (Novak et al., 1995). Saliva was then collected into 20 \u03bcL of 0.05 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 by attaching the needle of a 10 \u03bcL Hamilton syringe and rinsing the tubing content a few times. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 2 minutes and kept frozen (\u221280\u00b0 C.) in 20 \u03bcL of 0.05 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 for enzymatic assay (see below).","Apyrase Assay","Saliva samples (8 \u03bcL) were transferred, in duplicates, into individual wells of a plastic 96-well ELISA plate (NUNC Maxisorp). For the blank, 8 \u03bcL of the 0.05 mM Tris buffer was added to the wells. To each well, 100 \u03bcL was added of a mixture containing 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.95), 5 mM CaCl, 2 mM ATP and 20 mM B-Mercapthanol. The plate was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 min and then the reaction was immediately stopped, by adding 25 uL of acid molybdate solution (1.25% ammonium molybdate in 2.5 mM HSO). Immediately after termination of the reaction, 2 \u03bcL of a reducing solution (0.11 mM NaHSO, 0.09 mM NaSOand 8 mM 1-amino-2-naphthol-4-sulphonic acid) was added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 20 min (Novak et al., 1995). Plates were read at a FLUOstar OPTIMA ELISA plate reader (BMG Technologies) at 660 nm. Readings were quantified by comparison with an inorganic phosphate standard curve (1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.06125, 0.03125, 0.015625 mM of sodium phosphate).","PCR Confirmation of Mosquito Infection Status and Saliva Screening",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0338","num":"0337"},"i":["Wolbachia ","Wolbachia ","Wolbachia "]},"Statistical Analysis","In all cases, general linear models were employed to examine the effects of the variables age and infection status and their interaction with one another. Models demonstrating significance for the variable infection status were then followed by individual t-tests examining the differences between infected and uninfected mosquitoes for each age class. The proportion of infected and uninfected mosquitoes that obtained blood meals were examined using Mann-Whitney U tests instead of linear models, given the deviation of the data from normality. Chi-square 2\u00d72 contingency tests were employed to examine the relationship between observed behavioural traits and lack of feeding success. The correlation between these traits was quantified using a cox-proportional hazards model for age, with the behavioural traits and lack of blood meal success covariates. All statistical analyses were carried out in STATISTICA v8 (StatSoft, Inc. Tulsa, Okla.).","Pre-probing Time","We measured the time mosquitoes spent from first contact with a human volunteer until the insertion of the insect's mouthparts as a measure of pre-probing time. All feeding trials were carried out with individual mosquitoes, which had been starved prior to the assay, at four adult ages (5, 15, 26 and 35-days-old). Mosquitoes that never successfully achieved a blood meal were excluded from this analysis. Overall both age (df=3, F=13.73, P<0.0001) and infection status (df=1, F=23.18, P<0.0001) had a significant effect on the length of pre-probing time. On average infected mosquitoes spend more time pre-probing especially as they age (). This change with age is clearly exhibited by a significant interaction between the variables age and infection status (df=3, F=8.11, P<0.0001). At five days of age infected and uninfected mosquitoes do not differ in their pre-probing time (df=78, t=0.63, P=0.52), which lasted on average 11 seconds. Uninfected mosquitoes maintained the same foraging time as they aged, while wMelPop insects exhibited a steady and significant increase (15 d: df=75, t=\u22123.37, P=0.0012; 26 d: df=63, t=\u22124.17, P=0.014; 35 d: df=48, t=\u22122.25, P=0.0034), reaching a mean length of 45 sec by 35 days of age ().","Probing Time","In the same feeding trials described above, the length of time between insertion of mouthparts and the first visible sign of blood in the abdominal pleura (Ribeiro et al., 1984) was recorded as probing time for the mosquitoes. As with pre-probing time, the variables of age (df=3, F=11.36, P<0.0001), infection status (df=1, F=29.46, P<0.0001) and the interaction (df=3, F=10.56, P<0.0001) between these two variables were highly significant. Infected and uninfected mosquitoes did not differ in their probing time (\u02dc33 sec) at 5 (df=78, t=\u22120.46, P=0.64) and 15 (df=75, t=1.43, P=0.15) days of age (). In contrast, infected mosquitoes at 26 (df=63, t=\u22123.76, P<0.001) and 35 (df=48, t=\u22124.06, P<0.001) days of age took significantly longer during probing, exhibiting up to a seven-fold increase in their probing time relative to uninfected mosquitoes ().","Blood Meal Acquisition","In the assays detailed above we then compared the ability of infected and uninfected mosquitoes to obtain blood meals () using Mann-Whitney U tests. At 5 (Z=0, P=1) and 15 (Z=0, P=1) days of age infected and uninfected mosquitoes did not differ in their success. At 26 (Z=\u22122.39, P=0.020) and 35 (Z=\u22122.39, P=0.020) days of age infected mosquitoes were less successful at obtaining blood meals in comparison to their uninfected counterparts.","Number of Probings","It is important to note that as infected mosquitoes aged, the frequency of events where they pierced the skin did not increase despite failed attempts at feeding (). A general linear model revealed that age (df=3, F=20.47, P<0.0001), infection (df=3, F=29.12, P<0.0001) and age X infection (df=3, F=27.18, P<0.0001) were significant determinants of the number of probings. Subsequent t-tests comparing the number of probings between infected and uninfected mosquitoes at each of the age points (data not shown), however, demonstrated that only 35 day old (df=1, t=\u22128.44, P<0.0001) mosquitoes differed. In this case, uninfected females probed more on average per session (1.05\u00b10.05) than wMelPop infected mosquitoes (0.3\u00b10.073). This is due to other behaviours, which impaired the infected mosquitoes to feed (see below).","Additional Behavioural Phenotypes","In other work we have reported the appearance of a \u201cbendy\u201d proboscis in association with wMelPop, which was the inability of the mosquito to properly orient its mouthparts and insert the stylet into the skin (Example 8). During the feeding trials in this study we quantified the occurrence of this trait. The bendy proboscis was never observed in any of the uninfected mosquitoes regardless of age, nor was it present in 5 day-old infected mosquitoes. The trait first appeared at a low level (2.5%) in 15 day-old mosquitoes and rose to a frequency of 65% by 35 days of age (). Another phenotype observed, although in lower frequencies, was the jittering action of the insect body (named here as \u201cshaky\u201d) when the mosquito was sitting on top of the human hand (). The association between each of these traits and lack of success in blood meal acquisition was explored using 2\u00d72 contingency tests in each of the age classes where the trait was expressed. There was a significant association between the failure to obtain a blood meal and both the bendy phenotype (26 d: df=1, \u03c72=14.1, P=0.0002; 35 d: df=1, \u03c72=11.8, P=0.0006) and the shaky phenotype (35 d: df=1, \u03c72=4.2, P=0.038). Using survival analysis we obtained estimates of the correlation between lack of feeding success and the bendy phenotype (0.63) and the shaky phenotype (0.19). These correlations reveal the presence of a relationship between the traits and success in feeding, but do not completely explain lack of success. There are mosquitoes in the older age classes that fail to feed and that are not shaky or bendy. To discard any possibility that this other abnormal phenotypes were due to the lack of blood feeding, which could have physiologically compromised the mosquitoes we also blood fed females of both groups when they were 3 to 5-days-old and then after 38 days evaluated their feeding behaviour. None of the wMelPop mosquitoes were able to feed and all presented the bendy proboscis, although all the tetracycline-treated mosquitoes successfully imbibed blood (data not shown).","Saliva Volume and Apyrase Activity","To check whether the probing behaviour and the additional phenotypes we observed were due to differences in saliva volume and salivary gland apyrase activity we measured both traits in infected and uninfected mosquitoes at three adult ages. Apyrase activity () did not differ in infected and uninfected mosquitoes regardless of age (df=1, F=0.44, P=0.51). Infection status (df=1, F=11.99, P<0.01) and age (df=2, F=14.54, P<0.0001), however, were determinants of saliva volume () and on average infected mosquitoes produced less saliva. When saliva volumes of infected and uninfected mosquitoes were compared to each other for each age class, only the 26 days old mosquitoes were significantly different (df=1, t=\u22122.9, P<0.01).","Evidence of in the Saliva","In an attempt to interpret the effects of on host-feeding behaviour we tested for the presence of in the saliva and salivary glands of infected mosquitoes. PCR amplification of the wsp gene or mosquito apyrase has shown only the presence of in salivary glands, but not in saliva (. The transposable element IS5, present in at least 13 copies within the bacteria genome (Wu et al., 2004), was also used in extra samples as a very sensistive PCR target (N=16 of each group) but no amplification was obtained. These results are supported by the size of the intracellular (around 1 \u03bcm in diameter) (Min and Benzer, 1997) and the diameter of mosquito salivary ducts (also about 1 \u03bcm) (Janzen and Wright, 1971), which indicate that even if was able to be present in the secreted salivary fluid it would be unlikely to be able to freely move through the salivary ducts.","We have recently sequenced the complete wMelPop and wMelPop-CLA genomes and we have identified, by using a comparative genomics approach, a series of mutations that have occurred during the 3 years in cell culture. These mutations are part of the wMelPop-CLA strain present in the transinfected mosquitoes.","The wMelPop-CLA strain has at least 5 major genetic differences with the original wMelPop strain. These differences include gene insertions, deletions and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The combination of these 5 elements is unique to wMelPop-CLA and can be used to differentiate this strain from any other strain, including very closely related strains such as wMelCS. As a result of these genetic differences, the wMelPop-CLA genome is approximately 20952 bp smaller that wMelPop (1247197 bp vs 1268149 bp).","wMelPop-CLA Unique Genetic Features","SNP in Gene WD0200","The gene WD0200 encodes for a hypothetical protein, according to the wMel genome annotation (Wu et al., 2004). During the adaptation of wMelPop to mosquito cell culture in our laboratory, the sequence of this gene has mutated resulting in the substitution of a C residue for a T in wMelPop-CLA (). This nucleotide change results in the replacement of an aspartic acid (D) for asparagine (N) in the C-terminus of the encoded protein. The presence of this mutation has been confirmed by PCR and sequencing of the wMelPop and wMelPop-CLA strains.","10 Bp Deletion in Gene WD0413","Gene WD0413 encodes an aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (aspS) [6.1.1.12] involved in protein biosynthesis. Following the sequencing of wMelPop and wMelPop-CLA WD0413 we have identified a 10 bp deletion in wMelPop-CLA that was not present prior to cell culture adaptation ().","This 10 bp deletion occurs just before the TGA stop codon and creates a frameshift that extends the wMelPop-CLA encoded protein by an extra 10 aminoacids before a new stop codon is read ().","IS5 Element Insertion","IS5 insertion elements are common transposable elements identified in several genomes. The IS5 insertion element is 918 bp long and is constituted by two ORFs (OrfA and B), flanked by a terminal inverted repeat. The closely related wMel genome, (Wu et al., 2004), contains 13 identical IS5 elements. wMelPop also contains 13 IS5 elements, although 2 of them have translocated when compared to wMel.","The novel IS5 insertion present in the wMelPop-CLA strain is located in the intergenic region between the genes WD0765 and WD0766 (). WD0765 encodes a Na\/H+ ion antiporter family protein, whereas WD0766 encodes an ankyrin domain protein. The role of both proteins in is currently unknown, although the expression of these two genes is probably affected by the insertion of this IS5 element in the middle of their promoter region.","21.6 Kb Deletion","The wMelPop-CLA strain contains a 21.6 Kb deletion when compared to the original wMelPop strain (). This deletion includes 13 genes (WD0506 to WD0518), whose putative function is listed in Table 7. Since the 2 genes flaking the deletion (WD0506 and WD0518) are the result of a duplication event and have similar sequences, the exact coordinates of the 21.6 kb deletion are difficult to determine. Several of the genes present in the deletion have homologues elsewhere in the genome, and 3 of them (WD0512, WD0513 and WD0514) are part of an operon in those strains (wMel, wMelPop, wMelCS) where the genes are present.","The presence of a similar 21.6 Kb deletion was previously described by our group in the wAu strain (Iturbe-Ormaetxe et al., 2005), although none of the other four wMelPop-CLA unique features have been found in wAu.","We have also identified WD0513 as a potential candidate for horizontal gene transfer between mosquitoes and (Woolfit et al., 2009).","Insertion of a G in Gene WD0758","Gene WD0758 encodes for a glutaredoxin family protein. This gene contains an extra G at position 196 in wMelPop-CLA when compared with its counterpart in wMelPop. This mutation creates a premature stop codon in wMelPop-CLA and as a consequence, the WD0758 protein is 46 residues shorter in wMelPop-CLA than in wMelPop (). The effect of this mutation on the function of WD0758 is currently unknown.","PCR Characterization of Unique wMelPop-CLA Features","Three of the 5 described genetic features that distinguish wMelPop-CLA from its predecessor wMelPop can be easily identified and diagnosed by PCR, as shown in . The identification of the SNP in WD0200 and the insertion of a G in WD0758 require PCR-amplification and sequencing.","The use of an in vitro cell culture system provided an ideal means to examine the adaptation of to a novel host environment. This approach contrasts with directly transferring between insects, where selective forces are presumably different and more complex, and where longer insect generation times, vertical transmission, and the labour intensive nature of rearing live insects make selection for transinfected lines challenging.","The initial difficulty in establishing wMelPop infection in the cell line Aa23 demonstrated that wMelPop was not naturally pre-adapted for growth in mosquito cells. Following stable infection of Aa23 and serial passage for several years, wMelPop was successfully established in RML-12 and MOS-55 cell lines, two species that are not naturally infected by (Curtis and Sinkins, 1998; Kittayapong et al., 2000; Rasgon and Scott, 2004; Ricci et al., 2002; Tsai et al., 2004). Transfer of wMelPop between Aa23 and these two mosquito cell lines occurred much more readily than the initial transfer from to Aa23, potentially due to (i) a higher infective dose of wMelPop purified from Aa23 and used for transfer; and (ii) a smaller divergence in intracellular environments among these mosquito cell lines as opposed to the initial transfer from . The cell line-adapted displayed reduced infectivity and maternal transmission when injected back into its original host. It grew to lower densities and showed phenotypic shifts for both life-shortening and CI expression. Taken together, these results provide evidence for the active genetic adaptation of wMelPop to mosquito cell lines during long-term serial passage.","A comparison of results from this study, with simulations from recent theoretical models that examine the potential of life-shortening to modify mosquito population age structure (Brownstein et al., 2003; Rasgon et al., 2003), suggests that wMelPop should be able to initiate a population invasion of . Given the relationship that exists between mosquito survival and vectorial capacity (Garett, 1964; MacDonald, 1957), if the longevity of adults can be approximately halved under field conditions, as observed in our laboratory experiments, then the introduction of life-shortening strains would be predicted to reduce pathogen transmission and the incidence of human disease.","Vertically inherited parasites like are predicted to evolve towards reduced virulence over time (Lipsitch and Moxon, 1997). Unlike chemical insecticides, biological agents that induce mortality in late life, such as wMelPop or entomopathogenic fungi, are expected to impose relatively weak selection pressures for the evolution of resistance (Thomas and Reed, 2007). This is because the majority of individuals in the population are able to initiate several reproductive cycles prior to death, minimizing costs to reproductive output. Moreover, since the initial description of wMelPop in over ten years ago, no signs of resistance to life-shortening have emerged in laboratory stocks.","Furthermore, our finding that the wMelPop infection eliminates the ability of dengue virus to establish a productive infection has significant implications for any future control measure based on the use of life-shortening . Life-shortening effects on mosquitoes would become secondary and only act on any rare individuals that might escape the direct interference effect. We could also presume that because of the observed effects on dengue virus accumulation that any mosquitoes that did escape the interference effect despite the presence of would likely have extended extrinsic incubation periods. This in turn would act synergistically with the life-shortening effect to eliminate dengue virus transmission.","Our recent studies have also revealed that, as infected with wMelPop-CLA age, they show increasing difficulty in completing the process of blood feeding effectively and efficiently. These effects on blood feeding behaviour may reduce vectorial capacity and point to underlying physiological changes in -infected mosquitoes.","Thus, the ability of to spread into and populations and persist over time may provide an inexpensive approach to dengue and malaria control, particularly in urban areas that are less amenable to conventional control strategies. Given the ability of wMelPop to induce life-shortening, cytoplasmic incompatibility, altered feeding behaviour, and reduced pathogen susceptibility in a range of insect hosts, this strategy may be broadly applicable to reduce pathogen transmission by other insect disease vectors of medical or agricultural importance.","The fact that many insect species are infected with raises the possibility that -mediated antiviral protection could be a widespread phenomenon. To test the generality of -mediated antiviral protection further, the inventors used and its naturally occurring infections.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0367","num":"0366"},"i":["Wolbachia ","Wolbachia ","D. melanogaster ","Wolbachia ","D. simulans ","Wolbachia ","D. simulans Wolbachia ","Wolbachia "]},"With the exception of the Me29 flies infected by wMel, natural host-combinations were used. The strains are known to be associated with different mitochondrial haplotypes (Ballard, 2000) and we did not control for host nuclear genetic background which can have an impact on virus infection (Teixeira et al., 2008). As a consequence it is not possible to rule out that intrinsic variability in susceptibility to virus that is linked to the host background has an influence on the outcome of -mediated protection in our experiments. Indeed there is variation in the time to death of -free lines used in this study when challenged with DCV (see ), although interestingly these same -free lines showed similar time to death when challenged with FHV (see ). Antiviral protection was observed in both and when infected with wMel. This indicates that antiviral protection mediated by can be transferred between different host species.","Since protection against DCV was not seen in all the fly lines infected with the strains, we tested whether there is specificity in protection against different viruses. Infection of by protected the flies from all RNA viruses tested (see Example 4 and Teixeira et al., 2008). Although each of these viruses was a non-enveloped, positive sense RNA virus, the viruses come from a broad spectrum of virus families. Compared to DCV the most divergent of these viruses is FHV. DCV is a member of the Dicistroviridae family and has a single genomic RNA that is not capped but is polyadenylated (Christian et al., 2005). The genome is a bicistronic mRNA from which the structural and non-structural polyproteins are translated via internal ribosome entry sites (Wilson et al., 2000; Johnson and Christian, 1998; Sasaki and Nakashima, 1999). DCV RNA replication occurs on membranes derived from the golgi (Cherry et al., 2006). In contrast, the nodavirus FHV genome comprises two mRNA sense RNAs which are capped but not polyadenylated and a third subgenomic RNA is synthesised during replication (Ball and Johnson, 1998). FHV genome replication occurs on mitochondrial membranes (Kopek et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2001). Interestingly, although DCV and FHV have distinct infection cycles the same strains protected lines from both DCV and FHV induced mortality. This suggests that the mechanism of protection from virus-induced mortality may be common across diverse viruses, although it is not currently known what the mechanism of viral pathogenesis is in flies infected with either DCV or FHV. It remains to be seen whether the same host-combinations that do or do not protect against DCV and FHV have similar outcomes for other viruses, or indeed other types of pathogens.","Concurrent with protection from virus induced mortality in was a delay in accumulation of DCV (see Example 4). Here a similar result was seen with wMel protection in , the amount of infectious virus accumulated 2 dpi was significantly lower in infected flies. By 10 dpi the DCV titre in infected flies was similar to the day 2 titre for -free flies. This may suggest that the resistance to DCV accumulation protects the flies from DCV induced mortality, however, the results observed with the strains complicate this interpretation. The CO flies infected with wAu survived DCV infection beyond 30 dpi, whereas the -free flies were clearly susceptible to DCV-induced mortality. wAu infected flies had by 10 dpi accumulated high titres of DCV and the virus titre remained high at 30 dpi. This shows that wAu infected flies were tolerant of DCV infection, that is the virus accumulated but did not cause mortality (Schneider and Ayres, 2008). Interestingly, although wRi-infected DSR flies were protected from DCV induced mortality, at 2 dpi there was no difference in virus accumulation in flies with and without wRi. We cannot rule out that accumulation was delayed in wRi-infected flies earlier than 2 dpi.","Taken together our results indicate that -mediated antiviral protection could arise in flies in two ways. can interfere with the virus infection cycle to delay virus accumulation, that is, it can induce resistance to virus infection in the host. In addition infection can protect flies from the pathogenesis associated with virus infection, that is, it can increase host tolerance to virus infection. The processes or mechanisms involved in resistance and tolerance may be the same, independent or overlap. Our results show that strains can induce both resistance and tolerance to DCV infection, but importantly prolonged resistance is not a requirement for protection against DCV-induced mortality. These results are consistent with those reported for FHV in infected , where there was no difference in FHV accumulation 6 dpi but infection protected flies from FHV induced mortality (Teixeira et al., 2008).","The strains of that mediate antiviral protection were anticipated to be present at higher density in infected flies (Giordano et al., 1995; Sinkins et al., 1995). We confirmed the density of in the particular fly lines used in this study correlated with protection. The density of was assayed in whole flies as previous assays have shown that in addition to reproductive tissues somatic tissues are commonly infected with (Dobson et al., 1999; Ijichi et al., 2002). Further experiments controlling the density of a single strain are required to determine if high density is a pre-requisite for antiviral protection.","The mechanisms or processes by which protects the host from virus are not yet understood. The correlation of high bacterial density of the strains that protect the host suggests that density may be important for antiviral protection. Potentially protection may require a threshold of density to be exceeded, which would be consistent with protection being a consequence of competition between the two intracellular microbes for limited host resources. Antiviral protection may also be dependent on the distribution of between tissue or cell types. have been identified in a range of somatic and reproductive tissues in insects and are known to display variable tissue tropism depending on infecting strain and host combination (Dobson et al., 1999; Ijichi et al., 2002; Miller and Riegler, 2006). Late in infection DCV is widely distributed in tissues including both reproductive and somatic tissues (Cherry and Perrimon, 2004; Jousset et al., 1972; Lautie-Harivel and Thomas-Orillard, 1990), giving abundant opportunity for overlap with distribution. However, little is known about the spread of virus from the initial infection site or if replication of the virus is equivalent in all of the susceptible tissues. It is possible that there are tissues or cell types that are critical to virus replication or pathogenesis and that -mediated protection occurs by exclusion or regulation of virus in these tissues. In addition, if particular tissues are critical for pathogenesis, tolerance may be a result of protection of those tissues.","The relatively close phylogenetic relationships of the strains that do confer antiviral protection compared to non-protective strains, suggests that other features of the strains could determine the outcome of virus infection. Protection via both resistance and tolerance could be induced by modulation of host antiviral responses by . For example, proteins from the ankyrin family, which can play a role in innate immune pathways, vary considerably both in number and sequence between strains (Duron et al., 2007; Iturbe-Ormaetxe et al., 2005; Walker et al., 2007). Interestingly defence against bacterial infection in flies via the melanisation response has been shown to involve both resistance and tolerance effects (Ayres and Schneider, 2008).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0375","num":"0374"},"i":["Wolbachia ","Wolbachia ","Wolbachia ","D. simulans","Wolbachia ","Wolbachia","Wolbachia "]},"Throughout the specification the aim has been to describe the preferred embodiments of the invention without limiting the invention to any one embodiment or specific collection of features.
