The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","1. Field of Invention","The present invention relates to an online game commerce system, which in one embodiment serves as an architecture for enabling the interactive trade, collection, advertisement, purchase, cataloging, and sales of video game components through the representation and use of an online marketplace such as an auction, store, trading hub or similar expression within a video game.","2. Discussion of Background","Traditional video game play has been typically viewed as an individual experience in which game players may immerse themselves interactively against the characters, scenery, and challenges presented by the game itself. Interactive play with real people opponents and teammates occurs within the boundaries of one's living room or immediate environment from where game players may share the same physical game system and accessories needed to play with each other.","Although with traditional offline games, playing with real people is limited by one's physical environment and game system, indirect interaction about the game does occur within a larger social and cultural setting outside the immediate context of game play. Just as people discuss the latest episode of ER or news and magazine article headlines, game players discuss and share the challenges and enjoyment that they experience while playing a game. Moreover, although game players may not be directly competing with each other physically, they may do so indirectly by sharing, discussing, and bragging about their achievements after playing alone.","Another aspect of traditional video game play is the ability of game players to save the state of their game on a memory card or hard drive of the game system on which they are playing. Specifically, game players may save the objects, weapons, characters, and components that one has collected, the location, level, or stage that one has achieved, and the total points, health, or ranking that one has acquired during the course of a game or set of successive game plays. The ability and desire of game players to save the state of their games is indicative of an inherent value system placed upon the components, actions, and accomplishments achieved during game play.","This value system may be subjective to an individual's own time investment and interests with a game, but, may also be relatively compared to the overall time investment and interests of the larger game community of players who have achieved the same or similar achievements by playing the same game. When considering the value of the different aspects of game state and game achievements within the larger context of a gaming community of players, the context and interactivity of a video game begins to transcend the physical boundaries of the game itself, into a social, cultural, and economic discourse and exchange of similar interests and experiences.","A business aspect of traditional offline video games is that game publishers generate revenues through the unit sales of games on the wholesale market. As the video games must be manufactured onto CDs or DVDs and packaged and distributed physically by distributors and retailers, the mark-up of a game by the time it reaches the end consumer usually is twice the amount of the wholesale price. Moreover, the physical distribution requirements of an offline game limits game production and development to a holistic approach whereby game characters, levels, actions, components, and \u201cbug\u201d fixes must be introduced according to one overall release schedule.","With the development of the Internet and online games, video game players may play against and with each other directly and are no longer bounded by the physical constraints of their location or game system. For example, game players playing on a personal computer with access to the Internet may race each other when playing a race car game or team up with each other when playing a role playing fantasy game. All players in this scenario may be located in different locations so long as their personal computer is running the same version of the game being played and is connected to the Internet.","What is most compelling about online games is that the social, cultural, and economic interaction that typically occur outside the immediate context of a traditional offline game may now occur within the game itself thereby becoming part of the overall gaming experience. Specifically the game components, levels, and achievements of a player may now be directly discussed, traded, advertised, sold, and purchased as part of the game itself according to the larger marketplace dynamics of the overall value system of the larger online gaming community.","Lastly with online games, the possibility for game publishers to forego the manufacturing and distribution costs of releasing a physical CD exists. Using the Internet as a distribution mechanism, game publishers may sell and distribute their games to consumers directly. Moreover, the flexibility of online distribution also allows game publishers to release games in a more granular fashion thereby staging their overall release schedules into several mini releases and\/or more finely pricing game characters, levels, actions and components into individual product offerings or groupings.","The present inventors have realized the need to provide dynamic updates and real time management of various parts of programs in general and gaming systems in particular. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a game, comprising, a game playing program wherein at least one part of the game playing program is configured to be populated with an add-on component. The invention may also be practiced as a system, comprising, a game playing program wherein at least one part of the game playing program is configured to be populated with an add-on component, a remote server configured to store and serve at least one add-on component compatible with the game playing program, and an interface coupled to the game playing program, the interface configured to interact with the remote server and facilitate importation of an add-on component from the remote server into said at least one part of the game playing program.","In another embodiment, the invention is a server configured to manage an area within a program hosted on a user computer, wherein the server is remotely located from the user computer.","The invention may also be practiced as one or more methods, for example, a method of on-line commerce, comprising the steps of, registering a user of a gaming system, uploading an add-on component to a game program of the registered user, wherein the game program is configured to accept and install the add-on component, and managing activities of the user during interactions of the user with the uploaded add-on component. As another example, the invention is a method of producing add-on components for games, comprising the steps of, preparing an executable program component capable of being imported into a game program and configured to interact with a game being played by a user of the game program.","In yet other embodiments, the invention is a component comprising, a software module configured to be imported into a commercially available gaming program, wherein said software module is configured to implement an additional feature of the gaming program, the additional feature comprising at least one of a sales component, on-line store, auction, equipment, characters, scenes, levels, weapons, strategies, actions, rooms, text, graphics, video, and objects used by the game program.","These and other embodiments and features of the invention may be conveniently implemented in programming on a general purpose computer, or networked computers, and the results may be displayed on an output device connected to any of the general purpose, networked computers, or transmitted to a remote device for output or display. In addition, any components of the present invention represented in a computer program, data sequences, and\/or control signals may be embodied as an electronic signal broadcast (or transmitted) at any frequency in any medium including, but not limited to, wireless broadcasts, and transmissions over copper wire(s), fiber optic cable(s), and co-ax cable(s), etc.","Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts, and more particularly to  thereof, there is illustrated a drawing of a gaming system according to an embodiment of the present invention. A remote server stores an add-on component A that is configured to be uploaded and installed in a program  on a user computer . The program  includes an Application Programming Interface (API)  that allows the program  to communicate with the remote server  through a standard network or Internet connection hosted on the user computer . The add-on component A (initially stored in database  or other storage device) is, for example, served to the user computer  by the remote server  via an Internet connection, and installed in the program  via the API. As shown in , add-on component A has been served to user computer , installed by API , and is shown residing within program  as add-on component B.","The add-on component is, for example, an executable program component, interpretable source code, or other software module, that, when executing within the program , implements a feature or otherwise adds value to the program . The program  may be any type of computer program, including any of games, business programs, entertainment programs, etc.","A publisher of program  releases program  with facilities or other hooks (programming techniques) in the program  that are needed to accept additional new components (e.g., game pieces, area updates, etc.). The API  accepts incoming new components from an Internet or other connection and provides the incoming component to the program in a manner needed by the program to accept additional programming. For example, the API saves a new component in an appropriate directory that is accessible to the program, or invokes a specific routine provided by the program to install the component.","We now turn to a specific example in which the program  is a game playing program of the type in which users select characters or other icons and then control movement of the selected character or icon via joystick or other input devices attached to the user computer . An example output play space  of an example \u201cshoot em up\u201d style game playing program is shown in . The game includes characters  and  which represent users of the game. In one embodiment, the game is an on-line game, and, for example, character  represents a remote on-line user and character  represents a local user of user computer . Gun  represents a game component used by character  during play of the game.","In this example, the add-on component is configured to provide a virtual store, and the add-on component includes all the data and programming to place \u201cBob's Ammo Shop\u201d  in the game. The program  has been programmed to have facilities to allow updates to a portion of the game playing space, and upon installation of the add-on component B, \u201cBob's Ammo Shop\u201d appears in the game playing space. As illustrated in this example, a part of the program  is updated with add-on component B (e.g., updates programming of the game), and the programs output, or play space, is also updated with an additional feature (e.g., Bob's Ammo) provided by the add-on component.","In one embodiment, \u201cBob's Ammo Shop\u201d is a virtual store that carries game weapons, and ammo that may be purchased by the local and\/or remote users via interaction of their respective characters with the virtual store. Payment is made, for example, via points, health, or other value accumulated through play of the game. The characters may enter the virtual store through doors or other mean of entry provided by the add-on component and use various ways to select products from the virtual store. In one embodiment, once inside the virtual store, a virtual shopping experience is provided, with aisles, and items on shelves, etc. In another embodiment, a traditional on-line store with a pictorial index and electronic shopping cart are provided. In one embodiment, game play is suspended during \u201cshopping.\u201d In other embodiments, game play continues while the characters shop the virtual store\u2014thus, while walking between aisles, a player in a shoot-em-up style game may be in peril of getting shot. In one embodiment, a motif of the add-on component B is programmed to match a motif of the program being updated.","Typically, a virtual store within a specific game playing program will contain equipment, ammo, characters, etc that are compatible with the game playing program. Thus, upon entry of the virtual store, character  would be able to \u201cpurchase\u201d his own game equipment, such as a particular model of a gun (pistol, rifle, machine gun, etc.), and character  may, for example, if the virtual store allows trading, trade up from a handgun to a more sophisticated weapon.","Various factors regarding each of the available game equipment. Game equipment is generally produced by the game publishers. The publishers may require certain items before equipment is provided to a user (e.g., a player must have accumulated a certain amount of points or playing time before being allowed to own a more sophisticated weapon). Such requirements are enforced via encrypted keys or other secure methods to check a users qualification before \u201cpurchase\u201d of certain items. Such checks may be made, for example, by the remote server , or the program . Other items are available to all players willing to pay for them. Some game pieces are available for \u201cpurchase\u201d using points, but others require purchase using currency.","Items stocked on the shelves of the virtual store may only be available in limited or fluctuating supply levels. In one embodiment, an on-line connection between the add-on component and the remote server provides up to date information on stock availability (e.g., the virtual store is an on-line store). The remote server  includes a manager program  that is configured to manage stock presented in the virtual or on-line store. The manager program  includes all the necessary programming to enforce game publisher rules about the sale and\/or trade of gaming components (e.g., evaluation and\/or production of keys needed to insure proper sale, trading, and\/or use of the component), and maintains all necessary hierarchies or other organization needed to present the components available for sale or trade in an efficient manner. Messages, such as management message (M) are sent form the manager, over a network (e.g., Internet), to the user computer, through the API , to the add-on component B with the latest information needed to properly implement the feature of the add-on component (e.g., latest game components or pieces, prices and styles). Relevant information about purchases or other aspects related to activities in the virtual store (or other feature) are sent back, as needed, to the manager via response (R) messages. The manager  is also configured to coordinate purchases via credit card, bank accounts, or other currency sources by sending billing information to any available 3rd party credit or bill paying service (e.g., VISA, paypal, etc.).","Although only one add-on component is shown in , the program  may be configured to accept multiple add-on components, and remote server  is preferably configured to serve many different types of add-on components. In addition, add-on component A\/B is not limited to implementing a single feature in the program , and may also be programmed to implement multiple features. A car sales area  is also shown in the example game playing space of . Like Bob's Ammo Shop, the car sales area is available for the selection and purchase of game equipment (cars) that can then be used in the game (e.g., car ). In some embodiments, the update area (e.g., Bob's Ammo Shop ) is required to have a similar motif as the program, or at least be related to the program (e.g., provide character's, equipment, etc. that is usable with or at least related to the game. However, in other embodiments, the updated area may not be related at all to the game being played. For example, instead of selling game equipment, car sales area  might be an actual auto dealership selling full sized automobiles. The car sales area is then, for example, and on-line store for Ford, Chevy, or Ferrari automobiles. In one embodiment, special gaming style programming is utilized to implement the car sales area. In another embodiment, the car sales area is a link that brings up a traditional browser into the game program that the user can view a car sales web site (the traditional browser may have a skin or other motif similar to a motif of the game program; motif of the online stores or other areas\/locations within the game play space may also be similarly updated using skins developed for add-on components).","Although additional aspects and features of the invention are discussed herein below, in several broad embodiments, the present invention includes: an add-on component server from a remote server that is installed (or imported) into a program of a user computer; an add-on component that implements one or more new features to a program; a remote server that manages a part of a program remotely (e.g., notifying a virtual store in a program about stock availability), in which the part may be either an add-on component or a permanent part of the program. Management by the remote server may also be configured to insure integrity of the sale and use of the add-on components via the use of keys and other privacy facilities that make those components, or aspects of the components, inoperable unless certain conditions are met (e.g., license is fully paid).","Thus, In one embodiment, the invention is a game, comprising, a game playing program wherein at least one part of the game playing program is configured to be populated with an add-on component, and the add-on component is populated from a remote source. The add-on component may be a sales component or an on-line store.","In one embodiment, the game playing program includes a character that represents a player utilizing the game playing program, the add-on component comprises a gaming style program that implements a shopping mall paradigm, the game playing program is configured to allow the player to direct the player's representative character into the shopping mall, and the add-on component is configured to allow the character to select and purchase items in the shopping mall.","The present invention is also a system, comprising, a game playing program wherein at least one part of the game playing program (e.g., ) is configured to be populated with an add-on component, a remote server (e.g., ) configured to store and serve at least one add-on component (e.g., A) compatible with the game playing program, and an interface (e.g., ) coupled to the game playing program, the interface being configured to interact with the remote server and facilitate importation of an add-on component from the remote server into said at least one part of the game playing program. The importation of the add-on component (e.g., B) may be a dynamic update (e.g., during game play) of contents of at least one of an area and location (e.g., ) within the game playing program. The add-on component may be, for example, a game component (e.g., any of a character, scene, level, weapon, strategy, action, object, or other component) utilized by the game playing program. In another example, the add-on component may define a virtual marketplace (e.g., Bob's Ammo Shop ) configured to at least one of trade, collect, buy, and sell game components through at least one of an online auction and store that are accessible as part of the game playing program.","In one embodiment, the remote server is further configured to register users of the system, transmit binary application code of the add-on component, and generate and transmit a license key that controls use of the add-on component.","The server includes facilities to manage an area within a program hosted on a user computer, wherein the server is remotely located from the user computer. In one embodiment, the server is further configured to define a virtual marketplace to at least one of trade, collect, buy, and sell items through any of online auctions and stores that have been dynamically updated into the program.","The server may also be further configured to facilitate fulfillment of purchase transactions incurred by a game player in a virtual store of the managed area, and bill the game player's purchases via interaction with a third party billing system to charge the game player and credit a selling party, and, for example, persist a billing record of fulfilled purchase transactions by saving relevant purchase information into a centralized storage device (e.g., to database ).","The server may also be configured to identify areas within the program that are capable of being dynamically updated from a remote source and then dynamically update the content of at least one of the identified areas, and, for example, the identified areas comprise at least one of a two dimensional and three dimensional space within an output of the game program.","On-line commerce includes a method, comprising the steps of, uploading an add-on component to a game program of the registered user, wherein the game program is configured to accept and install the add-on component, and managing activities of the user during interactions of the user with the uploaded add-on component. Preferably, the users are required to login to the system as shown in  and are registered with the system which includes, for example, ID information, and credit or other information used to bill the user for services and\/or products offered by any one or more features provided by the present invention. Illustrative examples are shown in , and . Managing activities includes, for example, managing shopping carts, managing display of items for sale or auction, and managing a hierarchical organization items for sale or auction. Managing also includes the steps of defining a set of guidelines governing a game component's sale, purchase, trade, collection, display, distribution, or behavior, and enforcing the guidelines through the step of managing activities, including any respective metadata, binary files, and license keys of the add-on component according to the set of guidelines governing the uploaded component (e.g., as provided by game publishers).","The invention also includes a method of producing add-on components for games, comprising, preparing an executable program component capable of being imported into a game program and configured to interact with a game being played by a user of the game program. The executable program component may be programmed or otherwise configured to implement a virtual store in which game players may participate by purchasing items offered for sale, and, for example to continue game play action of the game program in the virtual store.","An API (e.g., ) is utilized that allows the program (e.g., a game) to dynamically update the contents of an area\/location within the program from a remote source. This is particularly applicable to \u201ccommerce\u201d intended to take place, for example, in a game, such that the \u201carea\/location\u201d being updated is a store or an auction and the \u201ccontents\u201d are game objects, items, equipment, characters, etc that are for sale. \u201cBob's Ammo Shop\u201d , discussed previously, is one example, other examples include an FTD florist for sending virtual flowers to other game players in an on-line community (or outside the community). In another example, the FTD florist is an actual flower shop that accepts orders from game players, the real flowers are then delivered to street addresses worldwide.","The \u201carea\/location\u201d may also be a feature that is a non-commerce scenario as well. For example, an \u201carea\/location\u201d may also be defined in the game as a treasure chest and the \u201ccontents\u201d of the treasure chest may be coins, jewels, weapons, potions, etc. In one embodiment, the contents are dynamically determined by making a request (or response to a remote server management message) to a remote server that manages and maintains the catalog of items. Furthermore the \u201cremote server,\u201d on a Transplay Platform (e.g., ), may execute code at the time of the request to determine what specific item should display within the treasure chest depending upon \u201cgame rules\u201d that are set up as an administrative process by the game developer or publisher through, for example, a web based management console. Examples of such rules are show jewels if the main character opening the chest is a woman, show life potion if the main character's health is less than 50%, or randomly etc. Another example of this behavior is defining a building as a location within a game (e.g., an ammo shop, museum, gas station, fast food, etc.), different bad guys that run out of the building shooting at the main character as the content, and game rules such as run out only if the main character has rescued the President and is at risk of escaping. Any game rules for any particular game or group of games may be utilized.","We now provide a more detailed look at the various feature of the present invention. In one embodiment, the present invention provides an online game commerce system that provides game developers and publishers with the ability to define, sell, distribute, and manage \u201cgame components\u201d such as but not limited to characters, scenes, levels, weapons, strategies, actions, and objects. For example, game developers define a virtual marketplace where game players may interact with each other to trade, collect, buy, and sell their game characters, scenes, and components through online auctions and stores that become part of the gaming experience. Through the use of Web based management consoles, game publishers are allowed the flexibility to manage the pricing and distribution of game assets per download, per transaction, or on a subscription basis.","For example, consider the case in which a game player has invested significant time practicing and playing an online NFL football game. During the course of his game play, he has built a successful football franchise and has won five consecutive NFL titles with several star players that he has acquired and trained over time. The competition is getting a bit boring and he is ready for a new challenge, and therefore decides to sell his football team on the open market through an online auction. This online auction of video game characters is depicted within the video game as each of the game player's football team player's contracts expiring and deciding to become free agents. The virtual game sequence of the football player entering the open market as a free agent and signing a contract with a new team is actually conducted as a live transaction between two real game players where the original team owner is paid real money for the negotiated price of the virtual game character.","In another example, take the case in which a game enthusiast purchases an online race car game at a retail store that comes with five different starter cars. Once connected at home, the game player is offered the opportunity to purchase additional cars online for $5 each or a new engine for existing cars for $1.00 each. A month later after the initial release of the game, new cars and race tracks are downloadable for a price of $5.00 each or a promotional offer of $20 for any combination of five.","Register, upload, and categorize game components: In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for registering, uploading, and categorizing game components such as characters, weapons, objects, scenes, levels, strategies, or actions. In this context, the terms \u201cregistering\u201d and \u201cuploading\u201d refer to a unique process for defining the properties of a game component, transmitting the binary application code that represents such game component onto a remote game server, and generating a unique license key code that unlocks the use of a specific instance of a game component through the use of a user interface or an automated asynchronous system. \u201cCategorizing\u201d refers to a method of classifying or organizing registered game components into a hierarchical grouping by their specific properties such as but not limited to its skill set, color, dimensions, level, edition, version, price, rarity, age, and relationships to other game components. In one embodiment, the act of registering, uploading, and categorizing game components is fulfilled as shown in , item  through the use of a Web based management console as illustrated in .","Define and register game locations: In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for defining and registering game locations. A game \u201clocation\u201d in this context is defined as any two or three-dimensional area within a game whose contents may be dynamically updated, changed, or retrieved from a remote source. In one embodiment a game location may be defined as a store or auction and the \u201ccontents\u201d being updated are game objects, items, equipment, characters, etc that are for sale. In another embodiment, a game location may be defined in a game as a treasure chest and the contents of the treasure chest being updated may be coins, jewels, weapons, potions, etc and may be dynamically determined by making a request to a remote server that manages and maintains the catalog of items. In one embodiment, the act of defining a game location is achieved through the use of a Game and Game Service API as shown in , Items  and  and the act of registering a game location is achieved through the use of a web based management console as illustrated in , Item  and .","Define and register game players: In one embodiment the present invention provides a method for defining and registering game players. A \u201cgame player\u201d in this context may be defined as any person directing the control of a game character, component, or object within a game. Types of information associated with a game player that may be registered with the system include but are not limited to account identification information such as a game player id\/username and password, personal contact information such as home address, email address, phone number, etc, and billing information such as credit card account, expiration, or preferred billing preferences. In one embodiment, an administrative user may register a game player through the use of a web based management console such as that depicted in . In another embodiment, the game player may register him\/herself with the system through a set of user interface screens that are part of the game itself as depicted in .","Authenticate and authorize game players: In one embodiment the present invention provides a method for authenticating and authorizing a game player within the game system. \u201cAuthenticating\u201d in this context may be defined as the act of ensuring the identity of a game player by comparing the combination of a game player id and password with an existing account already present within the game system. This is achieved through the use of an in game screen such as that depicted in . \u201cAuthorizing\u201d in this context may be defined in one embodiment as the act of determining whether an authenticated game player has the appropriate permissions to view a protected area within a game and download and execute protected game components. For example, in , both the local and remote game players controlling game characters  and  maintain their own unique authorization permissions to game components such as guns and cars. For example, game player  may have access to a Colt 45, a hand grenade, and a Uzi machine gun, while game player  may have access to 38 special, rocket launcher, and a Ford Mustang get-away car. Each game player may modify his\/her access rights to additional game components by purchasing or collecting additional rights through the game commerce system described by the present invention. The authentication and authorization metadata of a game player that determines a game player's rights and restrictions to game components within the system in one embodiment are stored by a Game server (, Item ) within a relational database or networked file system (, Item , or , Item ).","Persist game component and location metadata: In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for persisting game component and location metadata into a centralized storage device such as a relational database catalog or networked file system. In this context, the term \u201cmetadata\u201d refers to any describing property or feature of a game component or location defined during registration of the game component or location into the game server system. Examples of such properties include but are not limited to: name, description, game component type, color, categories, genre, dimensions, weight, speed, strength, health, weaknesses, relationships, weapons, price, age, rarity, etc. The act of persisting game component and location metadata is achieved, in one embodiment, through a Game Server such as one depicted in , item  receiving user input from a Web based management console (, Item  and ) and saving them to relational database as shown in , item . In one embodiment, the specific structure of the data within the relational database may be stored in tables such as those depicted in .","Define provisioning rules: In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for defining provisioning rules for an individual game component or a grouping or category of game components. In one embodiment, \u201cprovisioning rules\u201d refers to a set of guidelines that govern the dynamic display or behavior within a game location. In the scenario in which a treasure chest is defined as a game location and the contents of the treasure chest are dynamically retrieved from a remote server and may be game items such as jewels, coins, weapons, etc, examples of provisioning rules that are determined by the server are \u201cshow jewels if the main character opening the chest is a woman,\u201d \u201cshow life potion, if the main character's health is below 50%,\u201d or \u201cshow demons if the main character has previously opened the chest.\u201d In another embodiment, the term \u201cprovisioning rule\u201d refers to a set of guidelines governing a game components sale or purchase. Examples of such guidelines include but are not limited to the ability to define a game component or group of components for sale through an online auction and\/or an online store, the ability to set maximum and minimum sale prices, the ability to define an inventory of available game components to be sold by any auction or store, the ability to limit the number of game component items sold by a given store or auction as a fixed numerical limit or a percentage of available inventory, the ability to define weighted discounts for multiple purchases of related or bulk purchases, and the ability to define subscription bundles of game component offerings and updates. Moreover, \u201cprovisioning rules\u201d may refer to a set of guidelines that are based upon the specific game environment variables that determine game players' ability to purchase, trade, collect, and\/or sell specified game components. Examples of such game environment variables include but are not limited to the skill set, level, points, experience or other identifying characteristics of a game player or of the game objects and characters that a game player owns, and past actions taken against different game objects or characters performed by the game player or through characters or objects that the game player controls and owns. The act of defining provisioning rules is achieved, in one embodiment, through the use of a Web based management console as shown in , Item  and .","Browse game catalog: In one embodiment, the present invention provides a unique method for game developers to allow game players to navigate through or search a hierarchical grouping of game components and view the metadata associated with each game component and category.
