{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/003,205 filed Dec. 3, 2004 and entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Providing a Handoff Leg Associated with a Preexisting Leg in a Network Environment\u201d.","The present invention relates generally to network communications, and, more particularly, to a system and a method for providing a handoff leg associated with a preexisting leg in a network environment.","Networking architectures have grown increasingly complex in communications environments. In addition, the augmentation of clients or end users wishing to communicate in various network environments has caused many networking configurations and systems to respond by adding elements to accommodate the increase in networking traffic and the various enhancements that have been provided by numerous communicative platforms. In recent years, a series of protocols and architectures have been developed in order to accommodate a diverse group of end users having various needs. Some of these protocols relate to issues associated with handoffs (sometimes referred to as handovers).","As both public and private network systems grow in size and in sophistication, proper routing and efficient management of communication sessions and data flows becomes even more critical. In cases where protocols are unable to accommodate a given flow, an end user is precluded from enjoying the benefits of a given communication architecture. Advances in technology have resulted in the deployment of various types of wireless networks. However, while most of these wireless networks often provide service to adjacent and\/or overlapping physical spaces, most cellular and enterprise network protocols are incompatible. Accordingly, the ability to provide an effective mechanism to properly process, handoff, and direct communications for an end user seeking to realize the benefits provided by multiple network environments offers a significant challenge to network operators, component manufacturers, and system designers.","In accordance with the present invention, techniques for supporting handoff between cellular and enterprise wireless networks are provided. According to some embodiments, these techniques enable a mobile station to maintain a communication session that is handed between cellular and enterprise wireless networks. In particular, these techniques can enable a mobile station, alone or in combination with a mobility application, to produce a handoff leg association with a pre-existing call leg.","According to a particular embodiment, a method for facilitating communications between wireless networks is provided that includes communicating with a mobile station and transferring a communication session from a first wireless link to a second wireless link. The mobile station is operable to negotiate a first wireless link with a first wireless network, to establish a communication session with a device using the first wireless link, and to facilitate a session handoff with a second wireless link with the second wireless network using the second wireless interface. The handoff is enabled by associating the first wireless link to the second wireless link.","More particular embodiments of the present invention include the use of one or more of the following: a unique session ID, a unique handoff number, caller ID or automatic number identification values, and dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) codes. These items may be used to provide an effective association between two call legs (e.g. a cellular call and a voice over IP (VoIP) call). In addition, certain operations performed by a mobility application unit or device may also be associated with authentication procedures, whereby auth-codes are exchanged with an associated mobile station.","Embodiments of the invention provide various technical advantages. For example, one or more of the techniques may provide for an effective handoff to allow a mobile station to roam between cellular and enterprise wireless networks. According to some embodiments, these techniques may reduce cost and increase performance by empowering the mobile station to select between available networks. Furthermore, by utilizing both cellular and enterprise networks, a mobile station may increase its range of use. In addition, handoff between cellular and enterprise networks may be provided with little or no change to service provider networks and\/or enterprise networks. Also, these techniques may be used without modification of signal protocols and without dependence upon any existing signal protocol. Furthermore, using the disclosed techniques, trust boundaries between service providers and enterprises may be preserved.","Other technical advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims. Moreover, while specific advantages have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include all, some, or none of the enumerated advantages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10"]},"Communication system  comprises a cellular network  and an enterprise network  interconnected through public switched telephone network (PSTN) . One or more base stations  couple to cellular network , and one or more access points  couple to enterprise network . Enterprise network  includes a gateway , a call manager , and a mobility application . System  also includes mobile station . In general, mobile station  may communicate with a remote device through cellular network  using base station  and\/or through enterprise network  using access point . The elements of system  can operate to permit mobile station  to maintain a communication session that is handed between cellular network  and enterprise network . According to particular embodiments, mobility application  and\/or mobile station  utilize one or more of various private branch exchange (PBX) functions to effect handoff between cellular network  and enterprise network .","Communication system  executes an effective and a superlative handoff, whereby the call is anchored in enterprise network  (e.g. via mobility application ). When a call is placed, the call lands on mobility application , which recognizes, and is aware of, the call. Hence, when mobile station  moves to cellular network , mobility application  receives a \u201csilent call\u201d from mobile station  and, in response to the silent call, mobility application  collaborates with call manager  to switch (or to transfer [on the fly]) the call. In a similar, reciprocal fashion, when mobile station  moves back to enterprise network  it communicates with mobility application , which transfers the call from a cellular call leg to a voice over IP (VoIP) call leg.","The transfer can be executed in several ways, but the net effect of the transfer is that a real-time protocol (RTP) stream remains constant such that voice traffic can be understood. The RTP stream is essentially switched back and forth from a voice gateway and the VoIP handset platform. One problem associated with this operation is that when a call is made to mobility application  (which is generally anchoring the call), mobility application  needs to coordinate or associate multiple call legs (i.e. match a VoIP call to a cellular call). The situation can be even more challenging when mobile station  is roaming.","In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, communication system  addresses these issues and others in the following manner. Mobility application  provides handoff services for multiple calls to multiple dual mode phones (e.g. mobile station ). When mobility application  receives a handoff-call via cellular network , it needs to identify the particular dual-mode phone and to recognize the active call in order to perform the handoff.","Several methods are provided herein to achieve this goal. (Note that each of these methods is detailed below with reference to , however a brief discussion is offered here in order to provide an overview of these processes).","The first process is associated with a unique handoff-number. In the first process, mobility application  maintains a pool of E.164 DNs and it can assign a unique handoff-DN. Thus, mobility application  can select one number from the pool of numbers and assign this DN to the dual-mode phone: either for the duration of the call or for a duration of a handoff transaction. On receiving the handoff-call, mobility application  uses the handoff-DN (on which it received the call) to lookup the ongoing active call for handoff. For example, the dual-mode phone may send a handoff-request message with the call ID of the active call, whereby mobility application  selects a unique handoff-DN and returns it to the phone in the handoff-response.","Mobility application  maintains the binding between the handoff-DN and the call-ID of the active call from the dual-mode. Mobile station  (i.e. the dual-mode phone) places a call to the handoff-DN. When this call is received by mobility application , it looks up the binding between the DN on which it received the call and the call-ID to determine the active call for the handoff.","The second process is associated with a unique session-ID and the second process implements use of SMS or any of the signaling channel (e.g. use of dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) codes). In this method, mobility application  may assign the same handoff-DN to more than one mobile station. A unique session-ID is used to identify the dual-mode phone and the ongoing active call for the handoff. The session-ID may be agreed upon earlier, for example, during call-setup. Mobility application  maintains a binding between the session-ID and the active call. Mobile station  may use DTMF to signal the session-ID to mobility application  when it is in cellular network . For example, for a wireless local area network (WLAN) cell handoff, mobile station  makes a cell call to the handoff-number and then dials the session-ID using DTMF. Mobility application  uses the detected session-ID to bind the handoff call to the ongoing active call. When mobile station  initiates or receives a call when it is in cellular network , it may generate the session-ID, and transmit it to mobility application  using DTMF.","The third process is related to a caller-ID\/calling line identification (CLI)\/automatic number identification (ANI) scenario. In this process, mobility application  may issue the same handoff-DN to more than one dual-mode phone (e.g. mobile station ) and, further, use the caller-ID of the dual-mode phone (cell-number) to identify the ongoing active call to handoff. Mobility application  maintains a binding between the dual-mode phones cellular-DN and the active call from that dual-mode phone. When the call comes in to a handoff-DN at mobility application , it uses the caller-ID to determine the active call for handoff.","In an alternative embodiment, an authentication procedure may also be executed. In this scenario, the process is used to authenticate a handoff call to the handoff-DN with any of the above association methods. The dual-mode phone and mobility application  can use an auth-code for authentication. The auth-code may be statically configured, or it may be agreed upon by mobility application  and mobile station  dynamically (e.g. during handoff signaling at call set-up). The dual-mode phone, after making the handoff-call, dials the auth-code using DTMF and mobility application  uses the detected auth-code to authenticate the phone. This method could be used to prevent erroneous or malicious calls to a handoff-DN from triggering a \u201ctakeover\u201d handoff of an active call. Note also that any combination of the above methods can be used.","Cellular network  represents communications equipment, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, for providing wireless telephony services using cellular protocols and technology. Various cellular protocols and technologies may be used by cellular network , including but not limited to global system for mobile communications (GSM), time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), and any other appropriate analog or digital cellular protocol or technology. Furthermore, cellular network  may utilize signaling system  (SS) protocol for signaling purposes. Cellular network  may include any number of base stations , as well as base station controllers, mobile switching centers, and other appropriate communications equipment for use in communicating with mobile station  and PSTN . Thus, as illustrated, cellular network  may couple to base station  to receive and transmit wireless signals to and from mobile station .","Enterprise network  represents communications equipment, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, for interconnecting elements coupled to enterprise network . Thus, enterprise network  may represent a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), and\/or any other appropriate form of network. Furthermore, elements within enterprise network  may utilize circuit-switched and\/or packet-based communication protocols to provide for wireline telephony services. For example, elements within enterprise network  may utilize Internet Protocol (IP). In addition, elements within enterprise network  may utilize wireless standards such as the 802.11 family of wireless standards to provide for wireless telephony services. Note that the 802.11 family of wireless standards includes, among others, 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g. Enterprise network  may also utilize interactive voice response (IVR). Enterprise network  may include any number of wireless network devices , gateways , call managers , and other appropriate communications equipment for use in communicating with mobile station  and PSTN . In the embodiment illustrated, enterprise network  includes access point , gateway , call manager , and mobility application . Access point  represents communications equipment, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, for providing wireless access to enterprise network . Access point  may utilize one or more of the 802.11 standards. However, any appropriate wireless standard or protocol may be used.","Note that both cellular network  and enterprise network  represent a series of points or nodes of interconnected communication paths for receiving and transmitting packets of information that propagate to or from an end user or mobile station . A subscription or an agreement may be provided by either of the networks to offer cellular service to an end user of mobile station . Both networks offer a communicative interface between mobile station  and any suitable location within or external to communication system  and, thus, may be representative of a GPRS service provider or any suitable LAN, WLAN, metropolitan area network (MAN), WAN, virtual private network (VPN), or any other appropriate architecture or system that facilitates communications in a network environment. Each network may implement a user datagram protocol (UDP)\/Internet protocol (UDP\/IP) communication language protocol in a particular embodiment of the present invention. Communication system  may utilize any form of transmission control protocol (TCP)\/IP, or alternatively implement any other suitable communications protocol for transmitting and receiving data or information within communication system .","Gateway  represents communications equipment, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, for interconnecting enterprise network  with cellular network  and\/or PSTN . Gateway  may be used to convert communications between different communication protocols. For example, gateway  may convert communications received from cellular network  in SS protocol to any of various other protocols that may be used by enterprise network , such as protocols associated with the an integrated services digital network (ISDN) standard in the case of circuit-switched trunking and H.323, session initiation protocol (SIP), or other appropriate protocols in the case of IP-based trunking.","Call manager  represents communications equipment, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, for providing telephony services over enterprise network . For example, call manager  may support voice over IP (VoIP) communications, using any of various protocols such as SIP, signaling connection control point (SCCP) protocol, media gateway control protocol (MGCP), H.323, and\/or any other appropriate protocol for VoIP. Furthermore, call manager  may act as an IP PBX and support PBX functions, such as hold, park, transfer, redirect, and\/or other high level and low level call management features.","Mobility application  represents a server in one embodiment of the present invention, but alternatively could be replaced with any other appropriate device (e.g. a router, switch, bridge, gateway, etc.) that facilitates the operations detailed herein. Mobility application  includes any suitable collection of hardware, software, and controlling logic to support handoff between cellular network  and enterprise network . For example, mobility application  may, when appropriate, utilize PBX features to effect handoff of a communication session between cellular network  and enterprise network .","It should also be noted that the internal structure of mobility application  and mobile station  are malleable and can be readily changed, modified, rearranged, or reconfigured in order to achieve their intended operations as they pertain to the handoff function outlined herein in this document. As identified supra, software and\/or hardware may reside in these elements in order to achieve the teachings of the leg association features of the present invention. However, due to their flexibility, these elements may alternatively be equipped with (or include) any suitable component, device, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), processor, microprocessor, algorithm, read-only memory (ROM) element, random access memory (RAM) element, erasable programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or any other suitable element or object that is operable to facilitate the operations thereof. Considerable flexibility is provided by the structures of mobility application  and mobile station  in the context of communication system  and, accordingly, they should be construed as such.","Note also that any number of additional functions (other than the call association operation detailed herein) may be provided by mobility application . For example, one functionality provided by mobility application  is to keep track of a feature state (e.g. hold, transfer, conference, etc.). Mobility application  may also translate between DTMF feature-codes and IP-PBX VoIP feature invocation, as appropriate. (Note that DTMF represents the system used by touch-tone telephones. DTMF assigns a specific frequency (consisting of two separate tones) to each key so that it can easily be identified by a microprocessor.) This would enable IP-PBX features (e.g. hold, caller ID, display functions, redirect, three-way calling, barge, web browsing, etc.) to be provided to mobile station  when the dual-mode phone is in cell network : even when there is no simultaneous data path. These operations also offer feature transparency across handoff scenarios. One operation of communication system  is to have the feature-invocation from the dual-mode phone. This could be provided by communicating directly with mobility application  and, then, having mobility application  invoke the feature on the call-leg between mobility application  and the IP-PBX\/far-end. When the dual-mode phone (e.g. mobile station ) moves to cell network , it invokes features by dialing or initiating the corresponding DTMF codes. Mobility application  then maps the codes to the appropriate VoIP feature invocation signaling, and then continues to invoke them on the call-leg between itself and the IP-PBX\/far-end.","In operation of an example embodiment, when mobile station  goes to cellular network , there is a functionality in mobility application  that invokes features on the end user's behalf. From an architecture perspective, when mobile station  is in enterprise network  it can represent itself in such endeavors. However, once mobile station  moves to cellular network , it can no longer participate in such signaling. Thus, some device or element should offer a phone feature proxy function for mobile station  (for the purpose of invoking the feature), as well as for the other participant (called party or calling party). Without such a proxy feature, mobile station  becomes a \u201cdumb device\u201d that cannot take full advantage of a number of network capabilities. This phone feature proxy, as well as the leg association feature outlined herein, can reside in mobility application  (and\/or mobile station ) or in any other suitable location or element, where appropriate and based on particular needs.","PSTN  represents communications equipment, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, through which cellular network  and enterprise network  may communicate. PSTN  may include switches, wireline and wireless communication devices, and any other appropriate equipment for interconnecting cellular network  and enterprise network . PSTN  may include portions of public and private networks providing network transport services between various geographic areas and networks.","Mobile station  represents a mobile device, including hardware and any appropriate controlling logic, capable of communicating with remote devices through cellular network  and enterprise network  and maintaining communication sessions with remote devices during handoff between cellular network  and enterprise network . Mobile station  may communicate through cellular network  using base station  and through enterprise network  using access point . Furthermore, mobile station  may interact with call manager  and\/or mobility application  when appropriate to utilize PBX features to effect handoff between cellular network  and enterprise network .","In operation, mobile station  may initiate and receive telephone calls through cellular network  and\/or enterprise network  to establish communication sessions with remote devices. Note that, as used herein, a remote device refers to any communications device capable of establishing communications sessions with mobile station , such as devices located in cellular network , enterprise network , PSTN , or other linked networks. Furthermore, as used herein, a communication session refers to the transfer of voice, video, data, and\/or other information between two or more communication devices. For example, according to particular embodiments a communication session may involve a call between two communication devices or a conference call involving two or more communication devices.","When mobile station  is in an area serviced by cellular network  and\/or enterprise network , callers who dial a telephone number or other appropriate identifier of mobile station  may initiate a communication session with mobile station  through an appropriate network. Similarly, mobile station  may dial a telephone number or other appropriate identifier of a remote device and initiate a communication session with the remote device through an appropriate network. Thus, mobile station  may function in two modes simultaneously or separately. For example, when in an area serviced by access point , mobile station  may act as an 802.11 wireless telephony device. When in an area serviced by base station , mobile station  may act as a cellular phone. These areas may or may not overlap.","Given the capability of mobile station  to place and receive calls through at least two networks, this presents at least four scenarios for initiation of a communication session. In a first scenario, mobile station  initiates a communication session by placing a call through enterprise  using a wireless link with access point . In a second scenario, mobile station  initiates a communication session through cellular network  using a wireless link with base station . Note that in either scenario, mobile station  may couple to a single remote device or to a conference call involving multiple remote devices. In a third scenario, a remote device initiates a communication session with mobile station , where mobile station  receives signaling and data through cellular network  using base station . In a fourth scenario, a remote device initiates a communication session with mobile station , where mobile station  receives signaling and data through enterprise network  using access point . Again, the communication session may be associated with a single remote device or with a conference call, and the remote device or devices may be located in cellular network  and\/or enterprise network .","At any point in time, mobile station  may determine to handoff a communication session from cellular network  to enterprise network  or from enterprise network  to cellular network . For example, after establishing a communication session, mobile station  may lose or begin to lose connectivity with base station  or access point . Signal degradation may occur due to various causes. For example, mobile station  may begin to lose wireless connectivity due to physical movement. When possible, mobile station  may switch between using base station  and access point  for communications. Moreover, in certain circumstances mobile station  may maintain a communication session during handoff between cellular network  and enterprise network .","Handoff may occur when mobile station  travels from an area serviced by cellular network  to an area serviced by enterprise network . Handoff may also occur in the opposite direction, when mobile station  travels from an area serviced by enterprise network  to an area serviced by cellular network . However, handoff may occur at any other appropriate time. For example, handoff may occur when mobile station  is located in an area serviced by both network types due to a predetermined preference of one type of network, due to a spontaneous choice of a user of mobile station , or in response to analyzing error rates or other data associated with signaling provided by one or both types of networks. For example, error rates may be associated with signal strengths of base station  and access point , and may be dependent upon a location of mobile station .","In general, mobile station  and\/or mobility application  may utilize PBX features such as hold, park, transfer, redirect, and other high level and low level PBX functions to provide for handoff between cellular network  and enterprise network . Mobile station  may couple to call manager  or mobility application  through parallel call legs through two networks. The PBX feature may be used to terminate use of an old call leg and initiate use of a new call leg to effect handoff of a communication session from the old call leg to the new call leg.","One PBX feature that may be used to effect handoff is the park feature. The park feature may be provided in two forms, undirected park and directed park. In undirected park, when a communication session is parked, a serving system such as call manager  may dynamically assign a park number associated with the parked communication session and report the park number to the entity parking the communication session. In directed park, the entity parking the communication session may select a park number to be associated with the communication session to be parked. To utilize directed park, the entity parking the communication session may monitor a set of park numbers to determine an available park number to prevent simultaneous use of any of the park numbers. Both park variants may be utilized to support handoff of communication sessions.","Consider mobile station  having a call established through access point  and enterprise network  to a remote device. Any of the four embodiments discussed above or a combination or modification of the embodiments may be used to effect handoff of the call. The call includes at least two call legs, a first leg between mobile station  and enterprise network , and a second leg between enterprise network  and the remote device. Mobile station  may determine to utilize cellular network . For example, when exiting an area serviced by access point , mobile station  may detect a session handoff trigger such as a degradation in quality of communications through the first leg. In response to this or another session handoff trigger, mobile station  or mobility application  may use the park feature to park the call. For example, mobile station  may park the second call leg with call manager . As another example, mobile station  may request that mobility application  park the second call leg. This action may be called the park operation. Note that the first call leg may be dropped at any appropriate time. However, according to particular embodiments, the first call leg is maintained as long as the call has not been parked. Furthermore, according to particular embodiments, the first call leg may be maintained until a new call leg is created.","Mobile station  and\/or mobility application  may utilize base station  to create a new call leg through cellular network  to call manager  or mobility application . For example, mobile station  may dial a telephone number associated with mobility application . As another example, mobility application  may dial a telephone number associated with mobile station . After creating the new call leg, the park feature may then be used to couple the new call leg to the parked call. In other words, the new call leg may be coupled to the second call leg to allow mobile station  to resume communications with the remote device. This action may be called the park retrieval operation.","In some embodiments, anchoring a communication session in enterprise network  may provide for control of the communication session during handoff. Anchoring a communication session in enterprise network  represents routing signaling through enterprise network . When signaling and data flow to mobile station  through base station , anchoring the communication session in enterprise network  may be particularly useful, since enterprise network  might otherwise be excluded from the signaling path. If enterprise network  is excluded from the signaling path, mobility application  and call manager  cannot process handoff of the communication session.","Various methods may be used to anchor a communication session in enterprise network . Calls placed to mobile station  may be anchored in enterprise network . For example, cellular network  may be provisioned to route calls directed to the telephone number of mobile station  to enterprise network . Furthermore, mobility application  may control the cellular number associated with mobile station . Mobility application  may indicate to cellular network  when mobile station  is registered with enterprise network  so that when calls are made to the telephone number, cellular network  will obtain a handoff number associated with enterprise network  from mobility application . In addition, a separate enterprise telephone number may be associated with mobile station  so that calls to the separate enterprise telephone number will route through enterprise network , which can extend the call to mobile station  through cellular network .","After receiving a telephone call intended for mobile station , call manager  and\/or mobility application  may include itself in a signaling path associated with the resulting communication session, whether the signaling path proceeds through cellular network  or enterprise network . Note that when a remote device exists outside enterprise network , for example on cellular network , and mobile station  is outside of a coverage area of access point , hairpinning media through gateway  may be appropriate. That is, media communicated to gateway  from the remote device may be routed to mobile station  without requiring the media to pass through enterprise network . Similarly, media communicated to gateway  from mobile station  may be routed to the remote device without requiring the media to pass through enterprise network .","Calls placed by mobile station  may be anchored in enterprise network  by first seeking to utilize enterprise network  when a user of mobile station  dials a telephone number. To the extent mobile station  is in an area serviced by access point , any communication session may be anchored in enterprise network  by utilizing access point . When mobile station  is located outside the area serviced by access point , mobile station  may first couple to mobility application  through cellular network . For example, cellular network  may be provisioned to redirect calls into enterprise network . Mobility application  may then couple mobile station  to the intended remote device by dialing the phone number on behalf of mobile station . Alternatively or in addition, mobile station  may dial an IVR service provided by enterprise network . A user of mobile station  may then use the IVR service to dial the target number.","Anchoring a call in enterprise network  may allow mobile station  alone or in combination with mobility application  to invoke PBX features within enterprise network , such as PBX features controlled by call manager , to effect handoff between enterprise network  and cellular network . For example, consider the case in which a caller in PSTN  calls mobile station  while mobile station  is an area serviced by base station . In this case, if the phone number of mobile station  is associated with enterprise network , call signaling travels through PSTN  and enters enterprise network  through gateway . Gateway , alone or in combination with call manager  and\/or mobility application , extends the call back through PSTN  and cellular network  to mobile station . Using appropriate communications, mobile station  or mobility application  may invoke a PBX feature when appropriate to effect handoff from cellular network  to enterprise network . For example, if mobile station  enters or is located in an area serviced by access point , and mobile station  desires to utilize enterprise network , steps may be taken to effect handoff from cellular network  to enterprise network  using a PBX feature hosted by enterprise network . According to a particular embodiment, dial tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals may be communicated to mobility application  or call manager  to invoke a PBX feature.","Note that communication system  represents one embodiment of a system that supports handoff between cellular and enterprise wireless networks. Various alternative embodiments are possible. For example, while in the illustrated embodiment enterprise network  couples to cellular network  through PSTN  using gateway , various other embodiments may include enterprise network  coupling to cellular network  in other ways. For example, enterprise network  may couple to cellular network  using a service provider that supports VoIP. Thus, in alternative embodiments, cellular network  and gateway  may not be included in communication system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["26","26","24","40","42","44","28","12","14"]},"Processor  controls the operation and administration of elements within mobility application . For example, processor  operates to process information received from network interface  and memory . Processor  includes any hardware and\/or logic elements operable to control and process information. For example, processor  may be a programmable logic device, a microcontroller, and\/or any other suitable processing device.","Network interface  communicates information to and receives information from devices coupled to enterprise network . For example, network interface  may communicate with gateway , call manager , and access point . Furthermore, network interface  may receive information from and transmit information to remote devices as well as mobile station . Thus, network interface  includes any suitable hardware or controlling logic used to communicate information to or from elements coupled to mobility application .","Memory  stores, either permanently or temporarily, data and other information for processing by processor  and communication using network interface . Memory  includes any one or a combination of volatile or nonvolatile local or remote devices suitable for storing information. For example, memory  may include random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), magnetic storage devices, optical storage devices, or any other suitable information storage device or a combination of these devices. As illustrated, memory  may include one or more memory modules, such as code  and handoff numbers .","Code  includes software, executable files, and\/or appropriate logic modules capable when executed to control the operation of mobility application . For example, code  may include executable files capable of supporting handoff between cellular network  and enterprise network . Code  may include instructions to enable mobility application  to utilize PBX features to redirect incoming call legs to parked communication sessions. Handoff numbers  include E.164 telephone numbers that mobility application  may use and\/or provide to mobile station  for use in effecting handoff between cellular network  and enterprise network . For example, mobility application  may be assigned static E.164 numbers for handoff purposes.","In operation, network interface  may receive an indication from mobile station  that mobile station  intends to utilize a second network, for example cellular network . In some embodiments, processor  may communicate a handoff number selected from handoff numbers  to mobile station  through network interface .","Note that mobility application  may utilize session description protocol (SDP) to bridge media. Use of SDP may provide for more secure handoff by associating incoming legs with parked legs only when SDP identifiers match. Furthermore, mobility application may use any appropriate protocol to communicate with other elements of system . For example, mobility application  may utilize Java telephony application programming interface (JTAPI) to interact with call manager .","While this example includes specific functional components for mobility application , mobility application  may include any collection and arrangement of components, including some or all of the enumerated functional components, for supporting handoff between cellular network  and enterprise network .

Thus, in one embodiment mobile station  is a mobile phone. In other embodiments, mobile station  may be a personal digital assistant (PDA), laptop computer, or other device operable to establish communications with cellular network  and enterprise network .","Prior to discussing , the problems or situations that are being addressed by the proposed flows should be understood. Consider an operation of an example embodiment, where a call associated with mobile station  is being properly anchored by mobility application . In order to execute a handoff, a new cellular call must be made. Hence, mobile station  will make the cellular call over cellular network  and to mobility application , whereby a switch occurs over to that call leg. Mobility application  is handling multiple calls and multiple mobile stations. Hence, mobility application  needs to associate that particular call to a given mobile station, particularly in the context of handoff scenarios. A significant obstacle is present in trying to associate a first call (e.g. a cellular call) and a second call (e.g. a VoIP call). This challenge is successfully overcome by the teachings of the present invention, as evidenced by , which is detailed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["26","102","126"]},"The park scenario of  illustrates another method  for effecting handoff between cellular network  and enterprise network . Mobile station  establishes a communication session with a remote device using enterprise network  at step . Note that in some embodiments mobile station  maintains registration with call manager  and\/or mobility application  while mobile station  remains within range of access point . Thus, call manager  may direct incoming calls intended for mobile station  through access point  when mobile station  is registered, and direct incoming calls intended for mobile station  through PSTN  when mobile station  is not registered. Similarly, a user of mobile station  may dial a telephone number and mobile station  may communicate signaling information through access point  to enterprise network  and call manager  when mobile station  has registered with call manager . Note that the remote device associated with the communication session may be located in enterprise network  or outside enterprise network , such as in PSTN  or cellular network .","Mobile station  may detect eminent loss of signal on the enterprise network  at step . For example, as discussed above, mobile station  may monitor data associated with enterprise network  and compare the data with session handoff thresholds . Mobile station  invokes undirected park at step . Undirected park may be invoked by a user of mobile station  or automatically by mobile station . Mobile station  receives a park number from call manager  at step . At step , mobile station  determines whether the received park number is in an E.164 range. If the received park number is an E.164 range, mobile station  registers with cellular network  at step  and dials the park number at step . At step , mobile station  is reconnected to the parked communication session.","Returning to step , if the received park number is not in an E.164 range, mobile station  communicates the park number to mobility application  at step . At step , mobile station  receives a handoff number from mobility application . The handoff number received may be a dialable number in an E.164 range so that mobile station  may use the handoff number to couple to mobility application  through cellular network . Thus, mobile station  registers with the cellular network  at step  and dials the handoff number at step . At step , mobility application  dials the park number on behalf of mobile station . At step , mobile station  is reconnected to the parked communication session.","In some embodiments, a media break may occur during handoff. However, audio notifications associated with the handoff, such as music on hold, ringing, and other indications and sounds may be suppressed by mobile station . Alternatively or in addition, mobile station  may communicate information to a user of mobile station  that a handoff is occurring. Furthermore, note that method  might involve parking the communication session before placing the stealth call. However, in some embodiments, mobile station  may place a stealth call before parking the communication session, and only park the communication session after detecting answer by mobility application . Using this sequence, the length of the media break may be reduced or eliminated.","Note that method  utilizes undirected park. Alternatively or in addition, directed park may be utilized. Using directed park, mobile station  may determine available park numbers and select one of the available park numbers for use in handoff. In some embodiments, mobile station  and\/or particular communication sessions may be assigned specific park numbers to use when appropriate. Furthermore, mobile station  may be able to monitor what park numbers are being used at any time. If the selected park number is an E.164 number, when mobile station  determines to utilize cellular network , mobile station  may dial the park number directly. If the park number is not an E.164 number, mobile station  may register the park number with mobility application , and mobility application  may map the park number to an E.164 number for park retrieval.","Method  illustrates handoff from enterprise network  to cellular network . However, handoff from cellular network  to enterprise network  may occur using similar techniques. In some embodiments, handoff from cellular network  to enterprise network  may include use of DTMF signals communicated from mobile station  to cellular network  being converted into a feature indication when mobile station  enters an area serviced by access point . To utilize DTMF signals to invoke PBX features, communication sessions may be required to anchor in enterprise network . After anchoring a communication in enterprise network , when mobile station  determines that enterprise network  may be available, mobile station  may provide a sequence of DTMF signals corresponding to a feature activation code. When the DTMF signals traveling through cellular network  enter enterprise network , the DTMF signals may be converted into a feature activator in order to park the communication session. In the undirected park embodiment, a park number may be communicated via DTMF signals to mobile station . In the directed park embodiment, the park number may be provided along with the feature activation code. Mobile station  may couple to the parked communication session through a new call leg established through access point .","To provide for increased security, park retrievals may be required to be validated before allowing an incoming call leg to be coupled to a parked communication session. For example, an identifier of a calling party may be required to be matched to an identifier of the parking party. Furthermore, utilizing a method including mobility application  may allow mobility application  to perform a security function without altering a native park feature in call manager .","There are three other cases that can achieve the function of properly associating call legs. The three processes are permutations or alternatives of the first process outlined above, but differ in a number of aspects as described in the following discussion. The three processes outlined are identified with number designations: , , and , as is illustrated in . Each of the processes may share the first two steps (step  and ) of the preceding discussion associated with the park feature. The first process () relates to using a unique handoff number. This allows for a determination of which active session should be bound to the incoming call. This is because it can be recognized to which number the incoming call is addressed. Thus, a pool of phone numbers exist and when the incoming cellular call is received, it can be properly matched. Recall that the task is to match the incoming cellular call with an existing VoIP call. Hence, a phone number can be dynamically or statically associated with the VoIP call leg. This is identified by step , where a unique handoff number is received. At step , the unique handoff number is communicated and then properly received at step . At step , the unique handoff number is dialed. At step , mobility application  would then use the handoff number to handoff the cellular call to the VoIP leg.","Turning to the second process (), the second process is associated with using a unique session ID. The second process begins at steep  (subsequent to step ), where a common handoff number and unique session ID are received. At step , the common handoff number and unique session ID are communicated and then suitably received from mobility application  at step . At step , the common handoff number is dialed. At step , the session ID is dialed, for example, using a DTMF code. At step , mobility application  then performs an effective handoff.","The third process () is associated with a caller ID scenario. The third process similarly picks up from step  and then moves to step , where the unique handoff number is then communicated. At step , the common handoff number is communicated and the common handoff number is then received from mobility application at . At step , registration with the cellular network occurs and the handoff number is then dialed in step . Following these operations, and at step , mobility application  uses the caller ID or ANI to associate the cellular call with the VoIP call. A proper handoff is then executed in step .","The preceding flowcharts illustrate particular methods for effecting handoff between cellular network  and enterprise network . However, these flowcharts illustrate only exemplary methods of operation. While discussion sometimes focuses on handoff in the enterprise-to-cellular direction, similar techniques may be used to provide for handoff in the cellular-to-enterprise direction. Furthermore, communication system  contemplates devices using any suitable techniques, elements, and applications for performing these functions. Thus, many of the steps in the flowcharts may take place simultaneously and\/or in different orders than as shown. In addition, the devices may use methods with additional steps or fewer steps, so long as the methods remain appropriate. Moreover, other devices of system  may perform similar techniques to support handoff between cellular network  and enterprise network .","It is critical to note that the stages and steps in  illustrate only some of the possible scenarios and operations that may be executed by, or within, the present system.
