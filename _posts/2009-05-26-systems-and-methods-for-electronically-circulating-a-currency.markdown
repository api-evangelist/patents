title: Systems and methods for electronically circulating a currency
abstract: One or more currency notes deposited at a currency reserve may be electronically circulated by a transaction provider. The transaction provider may maintain a record of the ownership status of the one or more currency notes in a computer-readable storage medium. The transaction provider may provide for an entity to obtain ownership of a currency notes. The entity may submit a request to the transaction provider to transfer a currency note to another entity. The transaction provider may authorize the request, and may perform the transfer if the request is authorized. The transfer of ownership may take place while maintaining the physical currency note in the currency reserve. A record of the transaction may be stored by the transaction provider and/or transmitted to the parties to the transfer. The transaction provider may allow for the exchange or currency notes into other denomination and/or currency types.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates to payment transaction systems and, in particular, to systems and methods for electronically circulating a currency.","Various payment systems are available through which a payee may accept payment from a payer. Many of these payment systems impose transaction costs. For example, a credit card transaction may include fixed and percentage-based transaction costs payable to the credit card issuer and\/or a credit card authorization service.","In addition, many conventional payment systems require that the payer and\/or payee be registered with a payment service (transaction provider). For example, in order to pay via credit card, the payee must apply, and be approved for, a credit account with a credit card issuer. Similarly, the payee may be required to have a merchant account with the card issuer (or have some other arrangement for accepting credit card payments). Some potential payees may not wish to register with a credit card issuer and\/or may not qualify for a credit line with the card issuer.","Furthermore, the transaction may require that the payer and payee provide personal information to the transaction provider. For example, the payer may be required to provide personal information in order to apply for an account with a transaction provider (e.g., credit card issuer), and the payee may be required to register a merchant account to receive payments through the transaction provider. Other transaction systems (e.g., bank transfers, many on-line transaction systems, and the like) may require that personal information be disclosed.","This private, personally-identifying information may be maintained in confidence by the transaction provider (e.g., credit card issuer). However, information leakage may occur. For example, merchants and transaction providers have experienced data breaches wherein customers' personal information has been exposed.","Moreover, the transaction between the payer and payee may require the payer to expose personal information. For example, in a credit card transaction, the payer may be required to provide a credit card number, verification number, and\/or a signature. This information could be used at a later time to make fraudulent transactions using the payer's card.","The systems and methods disclosed herein may provide for electronically circulating a currency to thereby provide low cost transactions, which may minimize the need for personal information to be exchanged between transacting entities. In addition, the transactions disclosed herein may be performed using little or no personally identifying information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110"]},"The currency reserve  may comprise a set of currency notes  that are dedicated for use by the currency circulation system . The currency notes  may include any currency type in any denomination. For example, the currency notes  may include a plurality of United States dollars in one (1) dollar denominations, five (5) dollar denominations, ten (10) dollar denominations, and so on.","Each of the currency notes  may have certain attributes from which a unique identifier of the currency note may be derived (a unique currency note identifier or \u201cUCNID\u201d). For example, United States dollar currency notes may include a serial number, a series date, and other attributes. These attributes may be used to generate a UCNID for the note, which may uniquely identify the currency note.","The system  includes a transaction provider . The transaction provider  may comprise one or more computing devices (e.g., server computers), each of which may comprise one or more processors (not shown), memory units (not shown), a computer-readable storage medium , human-machine interface (HMI) components (e.g., input\/output devices, displays, etc., (not shown)), communication interfaces , and the like.","The transaction provider  may be implemented using one or more computer-readable instructions stored on a computer-readable storage medium (e.g., the computer-readable storage medium ). Therefore, portions of the transaction provider  may be embodied as discrete software modules on the computer-readable storage medium . Other portions and\/or components of the transaction provider  may be implemented using one or more hardware components and\/or may be tied to particular hardware components. For example, the data structure  (discussed below) may be tied to the computer-readable storage medium, and\/or the communication interface  may be tied to particular communications devices (e.g., network interface cards, wireless transmitters, etc.). Therefore, portions of the transaction provider  may be tied to a particular machine.","The transaction provider  may be communicatively coupled to the currency reserve . The communication therebetween may be continuous and\/or periodic. The transaction provider  may receive from the currency reserve a listing of currency notes  in the currency reserve. The listing may include attributes of the currency notes , such as the denomination, serial number, and the like. The transaction provider  may be configured to derive respective UCNID for the currency notes  using this information. The transaction provider  may store a representation of each currency note  in a data structure  stored on the computer-readable storage medium . As will be described below, the transaction provider  may use the data structure  to maintain a record of the currency notes  and\/or to manage ownership of the currency notes  by one or more entities . The transaction provider  may be in communication with the currency reserve  to periodically audit the currency notes . An audit of the currency notes  may comprise verifying that the currency notes  represented in the data structure  are physically present at the currency reserve . In addition, the transaction provider  may be coupled to the currency reserve  to manage transfer of currency into and\/or out of the set of currency notes  dedicated to the electronic currency circulation system .","The data structure  may include a representation of the currency notes  in the currency reserve . The currency notes  may be represented using respective UCNIDs associated with each currency note . As discussed above, the UCNID of currency note may be derived from one or more attributes of the currency notes  (e.g., the issuer of the currency note, a serial number of the currency note, issue date of the currency note, or the like). In some embodiments, the UCNID of a currency note  may be embodied as a uniform resource identifier (URI), a uniform resource locator (URL), a distinguished name (DN), a hash value, or the like. Use of a URI or URL may allow the currency note representations to be referenced on the communication network  (e.g., may allow one or more entities  to access ownership (and other) information about a currency note circulated by the transaction provider  using the URI\/URL assigned to the currency note).","The transaction provider  may be communicatively coupled to one or more entities  via the communication network , which may comprise any communication network and\/or infrastructure known in the art (e.g., a TCP\/IP network, the Internet, a virtual private network (VPN), a wide area network (WAN), a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a combination of networks, or the like).","As shown in , the entities  may be communicatively coupled to the transaction provider  by the communication network  through respective computing devices. As used herein, an entity may refer to an individual person, an organization, a business organization (e.g., a limited liability company (LLC), a partnership, or any other business organization), a storefront, a group, a non-profit organization, or any other entity capable of entering into monetary transactions with other entities.","Each entity  may be identified using a respective identifier. The identifier for a particular entity  may be referred to as a unique entity identifier or \u201cUEID.\u201d A UEID may include, but is not limited to: an email address, a DN, a URI, a uniform name identifier (URN), an OpenID\u00ae identifier (registered trademark of the OpenID Foundation Corp., Portland, Oreg.), or any other identifier capable of uniquely identifying an entity (e.g., a legal name, a corporate name, a doing business as (DBA) name, or the like).","In some embodiments, one or more of the entities  may be associated with a third-party service , which may be configured to authenticate the entities  and\/or authenticate messages transmitted by the entities . The third-party service  may include, but is not limited to: a certificate authority (e.g., an X.509 certificate authority), an authentication authority and\/or identity provider (e.g., a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication authority, a Liberty Alliance Authenticating Authority, an OpenID\u00ae provider, etc.), or any other service capable of authenticating the identity of an entity  and\/or validating the authenticity of data transmitted thereby. In some embodiments, the transaction provider  may be configured to provide authentication and\/or authorization services (e.g., may act as an authentication\/authorization authority).","The transaction provider  may be configured to assign ownership of the currency notes  to one or more of the entities . In some embodiments, assigning ownership may comprise associating a UCNID of a currency note with a unique identifier of the current owner of the currency note in the data structure , while maintaining the currency notes  in the currency reserve . The transaction provider  may use the data structure  to maintain the ownership associations. As will be discussed below, the entities  may enter into currency circulation transactions (e.g., transaction to transfer ownership of the currency notes (e.g., make payments, etc.)) using the transaction provider . The transactions disclosed herein may take place without requiring the physical transfer of the currency notes  into and\/or out of the currency reserve , which may minimize transaction costs. Moreover, the transfers disclosed herein may take place using a third-party service  and, as such, minimal personally-identifying information about the entities  need be exposed to the transaction provider .","The data structure  may be implemented using any data storage technique known in the art including, but not limited to: a file system, structured data (e.g., XML, as delimiter-separated values, etc.), a relational data store (e.g., a database), a directory (e.g., a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory, an X.509 directory, or the like), or the like. In the  example, the data structure  may be implemented using a Structured Query Language (SQL) database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","120"]},"The table  includes a currency note identifier field , which may be used to store the UCNID of a particular currency note (e.g., one of the currency notes  deposed in a currency repository ). The UCNID  may be used as a \u201cprimary key\u201d of the table  and, as such, may be used to identify and\/or reference a specific instance of the table .","The table  may further include an owner field . The owner field  may be used to store an identifier of the owner of the currency note (e.g., the UEID of the owner). The owner field  may be used as a \u201cprimary key\u201d to index the table  (e.g., as a primary key, a foreign key, or other indexing data). This may allow for quick identification of the currency notes owned by a particular entity.","In other embodiments, the ownership field  may comprise a list of partial owners of the currency note. In this case, multiple owners may each own a portion (e.g., a percentage) of a currency note (e.g., two (2) owners may each own fifty (50) percent of a currency note). Each owner may be allowed to transfer his\/her ownership interest in the currency note.","In some embodiments, the owner field  may comprise a list that may include the current owner of the currency note as well as any previous owners. For example, the current owner of the currency note may be placed at the head of the field , with the following UEIDs being the previous owners of the currency note. Alternatively, or in addition, information regarding the ownership history of the currency note may be maintained in a separate field (not shown) of the table . Other embodiments may selectively omit the ownership history of the currency note.","In addition, although not shown in , the data structure  may include references (e.g., identifiers, foreign keys, etc.) to records of transaction in which the currency note was transferred between entities. As will be discussed below, a transaction provider may provide for transferring ownership of one or more currency notes from a first entity to a second entity. As transfers take place, the transaction provider may produce an electronic and\/or tangible record of the transfer, which may identify the parties to the transaction, the currency notes transferred, the date of the transfer, and the like. The data structure  may include a field (not shown) referencing the transactions in which the currency note was transferred. This may allow for auditing and\/or validation of particular transfers and\/or for the transaction history of a particular set of currency notes to be traced.","The table  may include information describing the currency note. A field  may identify the currency note type and\/or currency note issuer (e.g., identify the currency note as a United States dollar, a Euro, or the like). A field  may identify the denomination of the currency note (e.g., whether the note is a one (1) dollar bill, a five (5) dollar bill, and so on). Alternatively, or in addition, the UCNID of the currency note (stored in field ) may include the denomination information and\/or may be used to validate the denomination information in the field . In this way, the currency note denomination may be tied to the UCNID to thereby prevent the denomination field  from being tampered with and\/or modified. Although not depicted in , additional fields related to the currency note could be included, such as the date the currency note was deposited in the currency reserve (not shown), and the like.","In some embodiments, the table  may include information regarding the currency repository that holds the physical currency note. For example, a field  may provide a unique identifier of the currency repository (a unique currency repository identifier of \u201cUCRID\u201d). The UCRID may be a \u201cforeign key\u201d that identifies a table comprising information about the currency repository (not shown). A currency repository data structure (e.g., database table) could include an address of the currency repository, contact information for the currency repository, the date the currency note was verified to exist at the currency repository, auditing information (e.g., instructions for performing an audit of the currency repository to ensure that the physical currency note is present at the currency repository), and the like. Alternatively, the table  may include information regarding the currency repository directly in one of more fields (not shown).","Referring back to , the transaction provider  may be configured to maintain a record of the ownership of one or more the currency notes  using inter alia the data structure . An entity  may become the owner of a currency note in various ways, including, but not limited to: purchasing one or more currency notes  from a currency repository  and\/or the transaction provider , transferring one or more currency notes  into a currency repository , receiving ownership of one or more currency notes  from another entity  (e.g., via a transfer), or the like.","For example, a particular entity  may purchase one or more currency notes  from a currency repository . The purchase may be performed directly with the currency repository  (e.g., by exchanging currency, issuing a check, performing a wire transfer, a credit card transaction, or the like). Alternatively, the currency may be purchased through the transaction provider . For example, the entity  may issue a request to the transaction provider  to purchase one or more currency notes  in a currency repository . The transaction provider  may arrange a transfer of funds between the entity  and the currency repository  (e.g., via a currency exchange, check, wire transfer, credit card transaction, or the like). Purchasing a currency note by the entity  may not require that the currency notes  be relocated from the currency repository . For example, a number of currency notes  may be owned by the currency repository  and\/or the transaction provider . Therefore, as the currency notes are purchased by the entity , the ownership of the currency notes  may be updated, but no deposit or other physical handing of the notes  may be required. Alternatively, or in addition, the entity  may directly deposit one or more currency notes in the currency reserve  for inclusion in the currency notes .","The currency notes deposited by the entity  may be registered with the transaction provider . As described above, registration of a currency note may comprise the transaction provider  assigning respective UCNIDs to the currency notes and\/or assigning ownership of the currency notes (e.g., to the depositor\/purchaser of the currency notes, such as the entity , the transaction provider , and\/or the currency reserve  itself). As discussed above, assigning ownership to a currency note  may comprise associating the UCNID of the current note with a unique identifier of the owner (e.g., a unique identifier of an entity  (the UEID of the entity ), an identifier of the currency reserve , an identifier of the transaction provider , or the like).","The transaction provider  may provide a mechanism whereby ownership of currency notes  may be transferred between the entities . The transfer of ownership may be performed while maintaining the currency notes  in the currency reserve .","The transaction provider  may be configured to receive a transfer request from an entity , the request specifying one or more currency notes  to transfer to another entity . The transaction provider  may authorize the request and, if the request is authorized, may transfer ownership of the one or more currency notes . Transferring ownership may comprise the transaction provider  setting another entity  as the owner of the one or more currency notes in the data structure .","As an illustrative example, the transaction provider  may receive a transfer request  from the first entity  to transfer a particular currency note  to a second entity  (e.g., make a payment to the second entity ) over the network . The transfer request  may include an identifier of a currency note  to transfer (e.g., include the UCNID of the currency note ), the UEID of the first entity  and an identifier of the second entity .","The transaction provider  may authorize the transfer request  and, if the transfer request  is authorized, may transfer ownership of the currency note  to the second entity . Authorizing the request may comprise verifying that the first entity  is the current owner of the currency note . The transaction provider  may query the data structure  to determine ownership of the currency note . The query may comprise accessing a data entry associated with the currency note  (e.g., the UCNID of the currency note ) in the data structure  (e.g., database table, such as table  of ). Ownership may be determined by comparing the owner field of the data entry associated with the currency note (e.g., the value of the owner field  of ) to the UEID of the first entity . If the identifiers match, the transaction provider  may verify that the first entity  is the owner of the currency note  and the requested transfer may proceed; otherwise, the transaction provider  may determine that the first entity  is not the owner, and the request may be rejected.","After authorizing the request, the transaction provider  may transfer the currency note  from the first entity  to the second entity . As discussed above, transferring ownership may comprise associating the currency note  with the second entity  in the data structure . In the  example, transferring may comprise setting the current owner field  to an identifier (e.g., a UEID) of the second entity  (as provided in the transfer request ).","In some embodiments, the transfer request  may not specify a particular currency note , but instead, may request that ownership of a particular amount of currency (e.g., six (6) dollars) be transferred to the second entity . In this case, the transaction provider  may be configured to identify currency notes  owned by the first entity  in the data structure  that amount to the requested transfer amount. If the currency notes can be identified (e.g., if the first entity  owns enough currency to fulfill the transfer request ), the transfer may proceed as described above (e.g., ownership in the identified currency notes may be transferred to the second entity ). Alternatively, or in addition, the transaction provider  may be configured to automatically exchange one or more currency notes owned by the first entity  for currency notes of the requested type and\/or amounting to the requested transfer amount. For example, the transaction provider  may exchange a twenty (20) dollar currency note owned by the first entity  for one (1) ten dollar currency note, a five (5) dollar currency note, and five (5) one (1) dollar currency notes, and to transfer to the second entity , the five (5) dollar currency note and one (1) one (1) dollar currency note. Other exchanges may be made. For instance, the transaction provider  may be configured to exchange United States currency for Canadian currency, to transfer partial ownership in one or more currency notes, and so on.","The transfer request  may comprise a unique identifier UEID of the transferee (e.g., the UEID of the second entity ). The UEID of the second entity  may be an email address of the second entity , a DN of the second entity , or any other identifier of the second entity . Alternatively, or in addition, the second entity  may establish one or more aliases with the transaction provider . The aliases may provide for redirection of transfers to a particular unique identifier to another unique identifier. For instance, an alias may specify that transfers directed to \u201cjohn.doe@yahoo.com\u201d be redirected to \u201cjohn.doe@openid.org.\u201d Therefore, a transfer request specifying a transfer to \u201cjohn.doe@yahoo.com\u201d may result in a transfer to \u201cjohn.doe@openid.org.\u201d The first entity  may or may not be informed of the alias.","After processing the transfer request , the transaction provider  may be configured to transmit a record of the transaction to the first entity , the second entity , and\/or the currency reserve . In addition, the transaction provider  may store a record of the transaction in the data structure  (e.g., in a table or other data structure adapted to store transaction records) and\/or may generate a tangible record of the transaction (e.g., a paper receipt). The transaction request  may specify how the record of the transaction is to be processed (e.g., may specify confirmation email addresses, a physical address where a receipt may be mailed, and so on). The transaction provider  may be configured to provide recording of transaction requests that are fulfilled and\/or of transaction requests that are not fulfilled (e.g., due to insufficient funds, non-ownership of currency, or the like).","In some embodiments, authorizing a transfer request may further comprise authenticating the transfer request and\/or validating that the transfer request was authorized by the transferor. The transaction provider  may use one or more third-party authentication\/authorization services  to authenticate the entities  and\/or to verify communications received therefrom (e.g., verify transfer requests received from the entities ). For instance, the first entity  may be associated with a particular third-party authentication\/authorization service , such as an OpenID\u00ae provider. In this case, the transaction provider  may be configured to receive information authenticating the identity of the first entity  from the third-party service . For instance, the first entity  may provide an authentication credential to the service , which may authenticate the identity of the first entity  to the transaction provider  (e.g., via an application programming interface (API), such as the OpenID API, SAML API, Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), WS-Security API, or the like). In this way, the transaction provider  may authorize a transaction without receiving sensitive information from either entity  and\/or .","Alternatively, or in addition to authenticating the identity of the entities , the transaction provider  may be configured to verify that communications transmitted to the provider  were made by and\/or authorized by a particular entity  and\/or verify the integrity of the communications. In some embodiments, the transaction provider  may be configured to communicate with the entities  over a secure connection, such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection, or the like. The communications layer may provide verification of the integrity of messages transmitted thereon (e.g., verify that the request  was not tampered with and\/or modified). In addition, the communications layer may provide authentication services (e.g., mutually authenticated SSL). The communications themselves (e.g., the transfer request ) may include authentication\/verification information, such as an HTTP AUTH header, a token, a digital signature, or the like. For example, the transfer request  may include a digital signature referencing a digital certificate issued to the first entity . The transaction provider  may access a third-party server  (e.g., certification authority) to verify the authenticity of the signature\/certificate. This operation may validate the integrity of the message  and verify that the message was transmitted by and\/or authorized by the first entity .","Alternatively, or in addition, the transaction provider  may be configured to authenticate one or more of the entities  directly. For example, the transaction provider  may provide for registration of one or more entities. Registration may comprise associating an identifier of the entity  (the UEID of the entity ) with an authentication credential, such as a login name and\/or password. An entity  may provide the credential to the transaction provider , which may use the credential to verify the identity of the entity .","Although particular authentication and\/or message verification techniques are discussed herein, the transaction provider  could be configured to implement and\/or leverage any authentication and\/or verification technique available in the art. Therefore, this disclosure should not be read as limited in this regard.","The transaction provider  may provide for additional transaction types (e.g., may provide for other means for electronically circulating a currency). For instance, the transaction provider  may allow an entity  to exchange a first set of currency notes for a second set of currency notes. For example, the first entity  may be the owner of a currency note  for twenty (20) United States dollars. The first entity  may submit an exchange request to the transaction provider  to exchange the currency note  for a second set of currency notes (e.g., two (2) ten (10) United States dollar currency notes). The transaction provider  may authorize the exchange request (e.g., by verifying that the request was submitted and\/or authorized by the first entity  and\/or determining that the first entity  is the owner of the currency note ). If the exchange request  is authorized, the transaction provider may transfer ownership of the currency note from the first entity  to another entity , to the currency reserve , and\/or to the transaction provider , and may transfer ownership of the second set of currency notes (e.g., two (2) ten (10) dollar currency notes) to the first entity . The transaction provider  may provide for any type of currency exchange. For example, the first entity  may exchange United States currency for currency issued by another entity (e.g., Canadian currency, Euros, or the like). In this case, the currency reserve  may include currency notes  of many different types. Alternatively, or in addition, the transaction provider  may be communicatively coupled to additional currency reserves (not shown) in one or more foreign locales (e.g., in Canada, the European Union, and so on).","In addition, the transaction provider  may provide for adding currency notes to the currency reserve  (e.g., a deposit transaction), withdrawing currency notes and\/or exchanging currency notes from a currency reserve , and so on. In some embodiments, the transaction provider  may provide for adding currency notes in a point-of-sale or kiosk device (not shown). Currency may be fed into the device by the entity (e.g., the first entity ). Equivalent currency notes may be assigned to the first entity  responsive to the deposit. The first entity  may then use the currency notes in electronic currency circulation transactions using the transaction provider . Similarly, the first entity  may request disbursement of currency notes owned by the first entity (e.g., at a kiosk or other device). For example, the first entity  may transmit a request through the device for a particular note owned by the first entity  (e.g., currency note ). Upon authorizing the request, the transaction provider  may transfer ownership of the currency note  to the currency repository  and\/or to the transaction provider , and an equivalent currency note may be provided to the first entity  (e.g., dispensed from the device, provided as a redeemable receipt, or the like).","The transaction provider  may provide one or more user interface components to the entities . In some embodiments, the user interface components may be provided as web pages accessible using web browser software. Therefore, the transaction provider  may comprise and\/or be communicatively coupled to one or more web server computers (not shown) each comprising respective processors, memories, computer-readable storage medium, and the like. The transaction provider  may be implemented in a clustered configuration (e.g., may comprise a plurality of computing devices in a single location and\/or distributed geographically). Although web-based user interface components are described herein, the transaction provider could provide user interface components using any mechanism known in the art (e.g., a dedicated software application, a TELNET portal, or the like). Therefore, the teachings of this disclosure should not be read as limited in this regard.","The interface components provided by the transaction provider  may allow the entities  to view the currency notes  owned thereby, allow for the exchange of currency notes , transfer currency notes  to other entities , view the ownership status of various currency notes , view the ownership history of various currency notes , view a record of transactions performed by the transaction provider , and so on. Access to information regarding a particular entity  and\/or to particular currency notes  may be restricted to particular entities . For example, only the first entity  and\/or those entities authorized by the first entity  may be allowed to view the currency notes  owned by the first entity . Similarly, only the owner of a particular currency note  may be authorized to view the ownership status of the currency note , view the ownership history of the note, or the like. In other embodiments, access to ownership information may be provided to all interested entities. Access to records of transactions performed by the transaction provider  may be restricted to the one or more entities  that were parties in the transaction (e.g., access to a record of a transfer of the currency note  from the first entity  to the second entity  may be restricted to the first entity  and the second entity  and\/or to those entities  authorized by the first and\/or second entities  and\/or ). Alternatively, access may be open to all interested entities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 1"],"b":["120","300","310","318","120","150","150"]},"The interface  may be adapted to display information  regarding a particular entity . The interface may include a listing (e.g., wallet ) of currency notes A-E owned by the entity . The wallet  may display the total  value of the entity's currency notes A-E. Accordingly, access to the interface  may be restricted to the particular entity and\/or to those authorized to access the interface  by the particular entity (e.g., access to the interface  may be controlled by an authentication step, which, as discussed above, may be implemented by a third-party service).","An action interface  may allow the user to electronically circulate the currency notes A-E, while maintaining the currency notes in respective currency reserve(s). The action interface may perform a selected action (e.g., action -) on one or more selected currency notes A-E. As shown in , currency notes A-E may be selected using an interface component (e.g.,  shows a checkbox interface component in which currency notes B and E are selected). However, the interface  could include any interface component and\/or selection mechanism known in the art.","The transfer action  may cause a transfer request to be transmitted to the transaction service. Selection of the transfer action  may allow the user of the interface  to provide an identifier of the entity to which the selected currency notes are to be transferred (e.g., an email address, distinguished name, alias, or the like). In some embodiments, the interface  may provide a look-up mechanism, whereby an identifier of a particular entity may be found. The transfer action may transfer ownership of the selected currency notes to the specified entity (e.g., ownership of the currency notes B and E may be transferred to the specified entity).","Alternatively, or in addition, the transfer action  may be configured to allow the user of the interface  to enter a currency amount to be transferred (e.g., eight (8) U.S. dollars). Responsive to this request, a transaction provider (or other service) may be configured to automatically exchange one or more currency notes for the user to thereby obtain currency in the proper denomination(s) to transfer the requested amount. For example, the transaction provider may automatically exchange a U.S. twenty (20) dollar currency note for a ten (10) dollar currency note, a five (5) dollar currency note, and five (5) one (1) dollar currency notes. From these exchanged notes, the transaction provider may transfer the five (5) dollar currency note and three (3) one (1) dollar currency notes to the specified entity. If a currency note in the desired denomination does not exist (e.g., a transfer or fifty cents ($0.50) is requested), the transaction provider may provide for a transfer of a partial interest in a currency note (e.g., transfer of one-half ownership in a one (1) dollar currency note). Similarly, an automatic exchange to another currency type (e.g., from U.S. dollars to Euros) may be made.","The exchange action  may allow the entity to exchange the selected currency notes for one or more other currency notes.
