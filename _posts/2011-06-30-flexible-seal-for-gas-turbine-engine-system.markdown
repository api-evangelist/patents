No. 11\/947,814, filed Nov. 30, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. Northrop Grumman: PO 2660271 awarded by The United States Navy. The government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. 2594747 awarded by the United States Navy. The government therefore has certain rights in this invention.","This disclosure relates to the use of a flexible seal as a solution to eliminating an over constrained mounted system when specific entities of the system must be linked to one another in a particular manner that breaks the equilibrium each individual entity contained on its own. A particular example of this application is with a gas turbine engine.","Gas turbine engines are commonly known and used to propel aircraft. One or more gas turbine engines may be rigidly secured to an airframe of the aircraft.","Various aircraft conditions may result in large deflections and\/or load transfers within the gas turbine engine system as well as between the engine and airframe. If the system is not in equilibrium, there is a possibility for undesirable load to be transferred between engine components, and between the engine and mounting system. These loads may induce undesirable stresses on the engine.","A system according to the present invention includes a gas turbine engine, a nozzle structure located adjacent to the gas turbine engine, a flexible annular seal linking the gas turbine engine and the nozzle structure, the flexible annular seal having a plurality of corrugate sections, and a reinforcement member positioned between two of the plurality of corrugate sections.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["24","12","20","12","14","16","18","27","20","22","30","29","12","14","18","29","20","30","22"]},"As separate entities mounted to the airframe , the gas turbine engine  and the nozzle exhaust system  have deterministic load paths to the airframe . In contrast, when the gas turbine engine  and nozzle exhaust system  are hard linked together, the system no longer acts deterministically. The gas turbine engine  and airframe  act as an integral system. As such, the gas turbine engine  is a load bearing member supporting the airframe  and vise versa. These types of systems can transfer undesirable loads between one another. For example, a high impact landing can cause significant airframe  deflections, creating a high bending load in the gas turbine engine .","The gas turbine engine  and the nozzle exhaust system  must be coupled for the gas turbine engine  to operate properly within the aircraft. However, the gas turbine engine  and nozzle exhaust system  must remain in equilibrium with the airframe  in order to handle loads properly.","In the illustrated example, the axis  and axis  are generally parallel and coaxial, such as when there is no deflection between the gas turbine engine  and the nozzle exhaust system . However, under certain conditions, the nozzle exhaust system  may deflect relative to the gas turbine engine . In this regard, a flexible seal  located between the nozzle exhaust system  and the gas turbine engine  deflects to thereby minimize the load being transferred between the gas turbine engine  and the nozzle exhaust system  and allow system equilibrium to be maintained.","For example, the nozzle exhaust system  may deflect relative to the gas turbine engine  in response to the aircraft taking off, landing, an air maneuver, a bolter maneuver relative to an aircraft carrier, or thermally induced loads. That is, the flexible seal  may accommodate relatively large axial and transverse displacements between two rigid structures without significant load transfer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["12","20","26","28","20","12","24","12","20","12","20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["12","20","20","12","26","28","24"]},"Thus, as illustrated in the above examples, the flexible seal  is operable under a variety of different deflection conditions. As can be appreciated, the flexible seal  may also maintain load equilibrium under a variety of other deflection states than shown in these examples.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["24","24","38","38","40","42","24"]},"The reinforcement fibers  may be selected from any suitable type of material for providing strength and flexibility of the flexible seal . In one example, the reinforcement fillers  are glass fibers and may be continuous, discontinuous, woven, non-woven, or provided in any suitable type of arrangement. For example, the glass fibers are somewhat flexible, but are strong in an axial fiber direction to provide the flexible seal  with strength while maintaining a desired degree of flexibility.","The elastomer matrix  may also be selected from any suitable type of material for providing flexibility and other desired properties of the flexible seal . For example, the elastomer matrix  may include any suitable type of elastomer material, such as silicone, which may also resist the temperatures associated with the exhaust gases.","The elastomer composite  may be formed into a desired shape of the flexible seal  using any suitable forming process. In one example, the elastomer composite  is formed using a molding process. One example molding process includes laying-up a desired number of plies of the reinforcement fibers , infiltrating the reinforcement fibers  with the elastomer matrix , and curing the elastomer matrix . Autoclave and flexible bagging techniques may also be employed. Given this description, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other type of molding or forming processes to meet their particular needs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["52","24","52","54","56","54","58","60","56"]},"The flexible annular wall  extends between a first end  that is attachable to the discharge duct  and a second end  that is attachable to the nozzle duct  of the nozzle exhaust system . In this example, the first end  and the second end  include respective flanges  and . Each of the flanges  and  include openings  for receiving fasteners  to secure the flexible seal  within the gas turbine engine system . Alternatively, other desired shapes of the ends  and  may be provided for attaching the flexible seal .","Optionally, a reinforcement ring  may be used on a back side of either of the flanges  and  to secure the fasteners  and to provide stiffness to the flanges  and .","In the illustrated example, the fasteners  secure a clamp member , such as a Marman clamp, to the respective flanges  and . The clamp members  secure the gas turbine engine  and the nozzle exhaust system  with the flexible seal . Once secured, the flexible annular wall  may deflect in response to relative deflection between the nozzle exhaust system  and the gas turbine engine  as described above. As can be appreciated, other suitable type of clamps or attachment techniques may be used to secure the gas turbine engine  and the nozzle exhaust system  with the flexible seal .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIGS. 8A and 8B"],"b":["82","24","82","84","86","52","84","86","88","89","90","12","92","20","90","92","94","96","98","100","102","104"]},"In this example, the flexible annular wall  is continuous such that the flexible seal  forms a single, monolithic piece. That is, the flexible annular wall  extends continuously, without a mechanical joint, between the first end  and the second end  and completely around the axis . The continuity may facilitate resistance of the flexible annular wall  to fatigue or other durability related factors.","The flexible seal  includes a central section  between the first corrugate section  and the second corrugate section . The central section  forms a valley  and a peak  between the corrugate sections  and . The central section  is flexible, similar to the corrugate sections  and . In some examples, a lower degree of flexibility of the central section  may be desired to resist ballooning of the central section  outwards, such as from gas pressure within the flexible seal . In this regard, a reinforcement member , such as a strap, may be provided within the valley  to stiffen the central section . Alternatively, a reinforcement member \u2032, such as plies of reinforcement material, may be integrally formed into the flexible annular walls  to stiffen the central section . For example, the reinforcement member \u2032 may be molded directly into the flexible annular walls  during a processing step, such as laying-up the reinforcement member \u2032 during molding.","As illustrated in , two of the flexible seals  from the example of  may be secured together to form a flexible seal  that may be used as the flexible seal . In this regard, each of the flexible seals  forms a respective corrugate section  and  that are mechanically attached together using a clamp . The clamp  is also annular and coextends circumferentially with the flanges  and . For example, the flange  of one of the flexible seals  is sealed against the flange  of the other flexible seal , and the clamp members  and  secure the flanges  and  via fasteners .","The above example flexible seals , , and  not only provide a sealed connection between the gas turbine engine  and the nozzle exhaust system , but they also provide a relatively low spring rate that permits deflection between the nozzle exhaust system  and the gas turbine engine  without significant transfer of load. Depending upon an amount of available space and a desired spring rate in a particular aircraft, a single seal such as the flexible seal , a double seal such as the flexible seal  or , or a flexible seal having more than two corrugate sections may be used to provide a desirable spring rate. For example, a greater number of corrugated sections generally provides a lower spring rate to accommodate the deflections of the adjacent parts.","In the disclosed examples, the spring rates and the deflections of the flexible seals , , or  depend at least in part on the geometry of the annular seal walls  or .  illustrates an example deflection state of the flexible seal . In this example, portions  and  of the flexible annular wall  bend in response to relative deflection between the gas turbine engine  and the nozzle exhaust system . The portion  contracts under compression of the bending, and portion  expands under tension of the bending. The curved shape of the annular seal wall  facilitates smooth deflection of the flexible seal  to provide a relatively low spring rate without significant transfer of load. As can be appreciated, the flexible seal  may also have other deflection states, depending on the deflection state, as illustrated in the example of , for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["82","124","82","160","162","88","12","20","160","162","88","82"]},"In this example, using the two corrugate sections  and  provides a relatively lower spring rate than the flexible seal .
