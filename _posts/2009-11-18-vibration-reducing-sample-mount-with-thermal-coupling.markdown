{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO PROVISIONAL APPLICATION","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Provisional U.S. Patent Application 61\/193,325 filed on Nov. 18, 2008, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. DASG60-03-C-0075, awarded by the US ARMY SPACE & MISSILE DEFENSE COMMAND. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Disclosure","This disclosure relates to low temperature cooling devices. Particularly, this disclosure relates to a gas exchange housing for low stress and strain mounting of a sample while reducing vibrations transferred to, and providing optical access to, the sample.","2. Description of the Related Art","Cryogen-free refrigerators, also called cryo-coolers or cryostats, utilize a closed-cycle circulating refrigerant (often helium gas) to extract heat from a cold finger at cryogenic temperatures and pump it away to a heat exchanger. The cold finger is a metallic heat sink which is actively cooled by the refrigerant. The cold finger can be temperature controlled and serves as a mounting point for an object. The main goal of attaching the object to the cold finger is that the object will be cooled. Objects to be cooled can include semiconductor devices, detectors, mechanisms, material samples, or any other objects that require fixed, cryogenic temperature operation.","While direct contact coupling of the object can cool the object (i.e., cooling is where heat is transferred from the object to the cold finger), in some applications, direct contact alone does not provide adequate performance, because the mechanical operation of the cryo-cooler couples energy in the form of vibrations, acoustic noise, or other into the object via the thermal contacts of the object. In these applications, it is necessary to delicately mount the object such that it is cooled but isolated, or not disturbed, by cryo-cooling the apparatus.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIGS. 18A-D","FIG. 17"]},"In testing sensitive objects as mounted in open cycle cryostats, during sensitive experiments, problems are typically not observed. As is shown in , no negative effects on the mounted and cooled object arise due to coupling of energy from the mounting apparatus (such as that from the cold finger) during the experiment, since the mounted object is not experiencing any significant external disturbances from the transfer of liquid helium to the cold finger. Good performance in experiments is generally observed, independent of the function of the experiment, when the matter involved with the cooling has good thermal transfer, is stationary and not under any stress.","When moving from an open cycle system to a closed cycle system, one major change is seen. In an open cycle system, there is no force on the representative cold finger. However, in a closed cycle system a mechanical noise\/force is present. If one uses mounts created for an open cycle cryostat the forces are coupled directly into the sample as shown in . Closed-cycle cryo-coolers or cryo-refrigerators are mechanical devices which provide cooling to a cold finger via pressure cycling of gas.","In a conventional closed-cycle cryo-cooler, the sample is mounted to a cold finger in a vacuum, where good thermal contact is required. The thermal contact is ideally provided by a physical mount with substantial contact area and large thermal conduction with the sample. Good thermal contact is usually achieved with firm pressure and intermediary grease or other filling-material. Indium can be used to attach the object and the metal cold finger. However, a stiff contact from firm pressure can too easily couple vibrations or induce undesired stresses in sensitive materials.","The main problem in a closed-cycle cryo-cooler is that mechanical work is required to produce cooling power rather than obtaining cooling from a liquid source. This mechanical power produces the expansion of compressed gas at the cold finger, and thus typically transfers vibrations to the sample mount. This repeated rhythmic hammering, although at low frequency usually 1-2 Hz, drives higher frequency resonances inside the cryostat. High frequency, high intensity vibrations can also be created from the gas flow through the head across sharp corners or other imperfections in the piping, thereby creating noise that will interfere with a sensitive experiment. High intensity, high frequency vibrations couple into a sample through the physical contact of a mount. These high frequency vibrations produce a very unstable mounting platform for sample mounts. The best conventional sample holders in closed cycle cryostats coupled the least amount of vibrations into a crystalline sample, but still had inadequate performance.","To overcome the above mentioned problems, this disclosure identifies a sample mounting apparatus for a cryo-cooler comprising a housing having an outer wall surface for connecting to the cryo-cooler, and an inner wall surface; wherein the housing is sealable to contain an inert gas for thermal heat transfer; and a delicate mount attached to the inner wall surface of the housing for supporting the sample and substantially preventing vibrations from being transferred to the sample from the cryo-cooler.","Also disclosed is a method of reducing vibrations in a sample for use in a cryo-cooler comprising the steps of: a) mounting a sample in a sample mounting apparatus, wherein the sample mounting apparatus comprises a housing having an outer wall surface for connecting to a cryo-cooler, and an inner wall surface, and a delicate mount attached to the inner wall surface of the housing for supporting the sample and substantially preventing vibrations from being transferred to the sample from the cryo-cooler, b) sealing the walls of the housing by applying a sealant such that the walls do not allow gas to enter or leave the housing, c) evacuating the housing of gas via a gas inlet tube, d) adding an inert gas via the gas inlet tube, e) sealing the housing by closing the gas inlet tube, and f) attaching the outer wall of the housing to a cryo-cooler.","A block diagram representing the proposed solution is shown in . The forces that are coupled into the sample can disturb sensitive experiments, and instead the housing, or gas-exchange box (GXB) is used which provides cooling while de-coupling the forces from the mounted sample. This diagram shows two embodiments of the GXB, one with a cylindrical sample and one with a cube sample, where both samples are supported from a shaft. A key component to achieving this decoupling is the use of mounts such as bearings (ball bearings, jewel bearings, etc) to attach a support mechanism (shaft, etc) to the walls of the GXB.","Additional advantages and other features of the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from the practice of the disclosure. The advantages of the disclosure may be realized and obtained as particularly pointed out in the appended claims.","As will be realized, the present disclosure is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the disclosure. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Advantageous aspects of the described mounting system are good thermal contact through convection and conduction, de-coupling of external vibrations from the sample, preventing cracking of delicate samples from uncompensated thermal contraction, and avoiding temporary or permanent distortions of the sample from applied strains.","As shown in , the present disclosure is directed toward a sample mounting apparatus  for a conventional cryo-cooler (not shown) comprising a housing  having an outer wall surface  for connecting to the cryo-cooler, and an inner wall surface , an inert gas (not shown) sealed inside the housing  for heat transfer, and a delicate mount  attached to the inner wall surface  of the housing  for supporting a sample  and substantially preventing vibrations from being transferred to the sample  from the cryo-cooler.","The housing  comprises a main body and a removable end plate , and the endplate  is sealed to the main body with a sealant that can create an air-tight seal. Examples of sealants are indium, epoxy, and solder. The inert gas  sealed inside the housing  may be any inert gas suitable for heat transfer in low temperature applications. In certain embodiments, the inert gas is helium. Alternatively, nitrogen is used.","As also shown in , the delicate mount  comprises a shaft  attachable to the sample , and a vibration reducing connector for movably connecting the shaft  to the housing inner wall surface . In certain embodiments, the vibration reducing connector comprises a conventional ball bearing assembly  for rotatably mounting the shaft  to the housing inner wall surface . The vibration reducing connector optionally further comprises a sleeve  attached to the housing inner wall surface  and a ball bearing assembly  attached to the sleeve  and the shaft  for rotatably mounting the shaft  to the housing inner wall surface .","Alternatively, as shown in , the vibration reducing connector comprises a conventional jewel bearing  for rotatably mounting the shaft  to the inner wall surface . Alternatively, the delicate mount  comprises a hammock support for the sample. The hammock can use a spring attachment for connecting to the inner surface of the housing .","In another embodiment of the present disclosure, such as shown in , the housing  further comprises a transparent window portion  for optical access to the sample. The window portion  can be sealed to the housing  with any known sealant suitable for low temperature operations. In some embodiments, an indium seal, epoxy seal or glue is used for sealing the window portion . To prevent damage to the window , the housing  contains a housekeeper seal  to accommodate the differences in size of materials due to thermal expansion. In other embodiments, the sleeve  and bearing assembly  are attached to the housing inner wall  via epoxy, solder or mechanical attachments. Any suitable material for cold temperature applications may be used for the housing . One example of a suitable material is copper.","Further, the housing optionally further comprises recesses in the external housing for inserting at least one magnet such that a variable homogeneous or inhomogeneous magnetic field is applied to the sample. For example, as shown in , the housing  comprises a series of recesses  into which magnets (not shown) may be inserted.","A method of using the sample mounting apparatus for reducing vibrations in a sample for use in a cryo-cooler comprises the steps of mounting a sample in a sample mounting apparatus, such as the sample mounting apparatus described above in . Then, the endplates  of the housing are sealed by applying a sealant such that gas does not enter or leave the housing . The housing  is then evacuated of gas, e.g., via a gas inlet tube , then an inert gas is added for heat transfer via the gas inlet tube . The housing  is then sealed by closing the gas inlet tube . Then, the outer wall  of the housing is attached to a cryo-cooler in order to cool the housing.","Further details of particular embodiments of the present disclosure are discussed below.","In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a sample mounting apparatus , also called a gas exchange box (GXB), is described. As shown in , a cold helium GXB  encases a sample  in gaseous helium while also delicately mounting the sample  in the GXB that encases the helium, so as to significantly dampen the coupling of external vibrations to the sample . In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the delicate mount  is a shaft and ball bearings. The shaft  is attached to the GXB inner wall  at two locations, each location has a sleeve  to hold a conventional ball bearing , and the shaft  is attached to the sample , which is positionally referenced by press-fitted collars  on either side. Other embodiments of delicate mount use conventional jewel bearings or some form of point contact that does not hold the sample support tightly. The GXB optionally includes optical access ports such as windows  shown in  to allow light to irradiate the sample . Also provided is a method to fill the GXB  with helium gas and then seal the GXB .","According to one embodiment of the present disclosure as shown in , the GXB  comprises a sealed housing  with an exchange gas , such as helium trapped inside. The gas  in the GXB  allows cooling of the sample . The GXB  has a flange  for sealing, with a purging port , a safety blow off valve  in case of over-pressurization, a fill\/drain tube  from which to perform the final fill and sealing of the box via the fill\/drain port , a basis for mounting the sample , and windows  for optical access.","Sealing the GXB  can be accomplished by methods including solder, indium, and epoxy. They each have their advantages and drawbacks. For example, solder can be hard to apply to large perimeter seals due to the elevated working temperature. Indium can be difficult to work with due to continuity requirements needed for an effective pressed indium seal. Epoxy should only be used in very thin layers, otherwise shear driven cracking or fatigue of the base material may occur due to differential thermal expansion or contraction. In certain embodiments, the GXB uses a mix of all three sealing options in different locations.","In other embodiments of the present disclosure, copper is used as a base material for the housing . Advantages of using copper include that copper is readily solderable, has high thermal conductivity, and is fairly readily machineable.","The GXB  is alternatively made of other materials such as aluminum, steel, brass, plastic, molded epoxy, or composite materials having sufficient thermal conductivity.","The filling and sealing of the system occur in the housing. As shown in , blow-off valve  is designed into a flange  that is fastened to the housing  to allow for the system to safely release pressure in the event of over pressurization. The design makes a very compact slow release valve. One embodiment of a simple release mechanism comprises a piece of copper foil , shown in  soldered over a small hole  in the flange . This design can be either remotely located or incorporated directly into the housing . After the copper foil  is soldered into place the top is bolted on which contains the release pin . Upon pressurization, the foil  bulges and punctures itself on the pin . One advantage to this system is that it can be reused many times by soldering a new piece of foil in place. There is some control over what pressure this valve will release; options for adjustment include: varying the diameter of the hole below the copper foil  and hence bulge height, sharpness of the pin , and pin to copper foil spacing.","Conventional housings have been sealed using a single fill\/drain tube  soldered in place into the fill and drain port , which allows an access point that can be used to fill the GXB  with helium, then vacuumed out, and repeated until the purity of the atmosphere inside the GXB  is at a suitable level. In this manner, the purity of helium inside the GXB  increases in a geometric progression of rarefaction on each evacuation, multiplied by a reasonable number of repetitions. Using a copper fill\/drain tube , such as that shown in , allows for sealing the box with a pair of dulled wire cutters, completely crimping the fill\/drain tube  shut so that it is sealed before cutting the tube. If space permits, it is advantageous to crush one section of tube  then move down and crush another section in order to have a backup seal. A crimped tube is used because most valves will not work or are not reliable at 4 K, and extra space is required for a valve. Tubes can be made of many materials including aluminum, copper, copper-nickel, and brass. Copper is chosen for most designs because of its ability to solder directly to the housing, its ability to readily seal upon being crimped with dulled cutters, and the ability to place a backup solder seal at the tube end after crimping and cutting.","Alternatively, another style of fill\/drain tube can be used. Before adding the components that cannot be heated, an intermediate section of brass tubing is soldered to the housing. Then a copper fill\/drain tube is attached and soldered to the brass section. The low thermal conductivity of the brass will allow for a solder joint to be created at the interface between the brass tube and copper fill\/drain line without coupling excessive heat. This allows for crimping of a copper based tube. Another option is the use of a copper-nickel tube which has low thermal conductivity and material properties similar to that of copper.","Another aspect of the GXB  for use in cryogenic temperatures below 4 K is the use of helium as an exchange gas which allows for a good thermal cryogenic contact without significant vibrational coupling. The use of an exchange gas like helium for wide area thermal equilibration also allows for a very stable sample temperature. The main requirements are that the gas not leak from the GXB . If a leak occurs, the vacuum that is insulating the cryo-cooler may be compromised, resulting in potential warm up of the whole system, and loss of cooling at the sample.","Thermal oscillations of a cold finger without any helium gas can be approximately 300 mK with a frequency of about 1-2 Hz depending on the type of cryo-cooler. These oscillations can interfere with sensitive measurements or experiments. Through the use of GXB , these oscillations have been shown to be reduced to 1 mK levels.","When using a GXB , thermal drift is observed in the system due to changing environmental conditions or other unseen changes. This thermal drift is best described as oscillations in milli-Kelvin on a time scale of 10 minutes to several hours.","Another aspect of the GXB design is isolation of the sample from external closed-cycle cryocooler vibrations by using a GXB  that houses a carefully mounted sample  convectively cooled by an exchange gas . The mounts can be designed and altered for alternative samples that vary in sizes and constraints.","As shown in  a sample  is attached to a shaft , which is then loosely supported inside the GXB  with a bearing assembly . The bearing assembly  is supported by a thin copper sleeve  that is mounted to the inner surface  of the GXB  with an appropriate bonding method. In , a sleeve  is shown mounted to a window  surface with epoxy. In this embodiment, the sleeve  is mounted directly to the window surface . Other embodiments, such as that shown in , feature mounting the sleeve (not shown) to a metalized surface on the window  inside the GXB . Optionally, a bearing  is slipped into the sleeve  for mounting. The bearing  is typically a standard precision stainless steel ball bearing. However, many different types of bearings known in the art can be used. The size should be chosen based on parameters of the particular GXB. The bearings should be clean with no lubricants, but not so clean as to promote cold-welding. Otherwise when cooled, the lubricants will bind the system creating a rigid path for vibrations to travel into the mount.","When using epoxy, all bonding surfaces should cleaned thoroughly. The mating metal surface should be etched using some form of etching bath (such as sodium persulfate). All mating surfaces should be cleaned with an acetone wipe followed by a methanol wipe. This is to ensure no residual oils are left on the surface, and the combination of a clean etched surface will increase the strength of the epoxy bond, especially for use in challenging cryogenic environments.","When assembling the GXB , a shaft , (such as shown in ) is slipped into the inner race of the bearing  for support on one side. There has to be a second identical mount  on the opposite face of the GXB to allow the shaft  to be supported in such a way that it will rotate freely, and be able to slide axially inside the bearing races. If the shaft  is not allowed to slide axially, it could bind and break the windows  when the GXB  is cooled. In a windowless GXB, a shaft  that is not allowed to slide can create stress on the housing  which could break seals or compromise the structural integrity of the GXB . Generally, a shaft needs at least 0.005 in of axial shaft play for every inch of length to prevent stress.  shows window  with mounted bearing assembly .  shows a sample with a shaft  in a preassembly stage.","In other embodiments, a sample is supported with a point contact with the solid housing, such as a pointed jewel bearing. The bearings act as the point contact with the housing. This mounting style provides very little stress placed on the sample, and high frequency vibrations are dampened due to the movable jewel bearing interface. This type of bearing uses a pointed shaft usually made of stainless steel that contacts a cut in a conventional sapphire jewel called a Vee jewel. An example is shown in , with a tiny Vee Jewel bearing  embedded in the tip of a small #2-80 set screw.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["70","71","21"]},"All of the above mounting styles result in an amount of movement while at the same time supporting the sample. This movement is what allows some vibrational isolation from the cold finger. If the sample  is physically hard mounted to the cold finger, it would not be isolated. The easily implemented shaft  in the above examples could be replaced with some form of support like a sling setup, hammock or other apparatus that will support an object.","With the use of a GXB , a sample mount can be designed as if it were to be used in an open-cycle cryostat, which was a design for a sample mounted delicately in a helium environment. This mounting procedure allows for a very small force contact with the sample or just enough to keep the sample in position.  shows an example of a sample mount  which is held as gently as possible on a shaft . The shaft  is then supported by bearings  and races  (see ) through only point contacts. In the sample mount in , the sample  such as optical crystal, has a hole for the shaft to pass through in the center, then it is gently held in place with the two collars  on the shaft , one behind and one in front, to create reference points for holding the sample  securely.","Another style of sample mounting on a shaft is shown in . This embodiment is for a sample that is not large enough to allow for a shaft to pass through the center, or where it is desirable to have optical access to more of the sample, among other variations. The sample  is gently clamped to an aluminum cradle  with springy Bellville washers  to allow for light clamping force\u2014just enough force to hold the sample  in place. Other methods known in the art to gently attach the sample to the shaft may be used.","Mounting of a window onto a GXB allows for optical access to a cooled sample or device without birefringence created by strain from differing coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Various methods have been developed to allow for optical access, including seals made from epoxy, solder, or indium.","According to one embodiment, window mounting is performed with a thin mounting flange  that is machined into the window seat to relieve stresses induced from the housing. This rim is machined in to create a ledge for a window is sit in, thus reducing the stress and strain that occur on the window  while thermally cycling between about 300 K to about 4 K (see ). This method of stress relieving is known as a housekeeper seal . If the metal is thick around the mounted window it will shrink down when cooled and crush the window . Windows smaller than 0.5 in can be mounted directly into the housing  often without undesired stress, but for larger diameter windows a housekeeper seal  is advised.","Windows that have been metalized at the sealing locations with deposited metal films, as shown in , can be soldered into place using a fluxless solder. This joint can be suitable for smaller diameter windows. Alternatively, a thin layer of epoxy  is used to seal windows. The epoxy layer  must be of sufficient thinness in order to allow for thermal contraction forces to be small enough such that the window material is not under stress. When cooled, epoxy  will shrink, causing stress on the window  and crack it.","When sealing a window  in place, care is taken to make sure the epoxy layer  is substantially even around the whole perimeter of the window . One method of accomplishing this is to epoxy the window  in place and twist the window  in the mount before the epoxy cures. This will allow the epoxy to flow into all crevices and fill any imperfections therefore creating an even layer.","When using epoxy, all components should be cleaned thoroughly. The mating metal surface should be etched using some form of etching bath (such as sodium persulfate). All mating surfaces should be cleaned with an acetone wipe followed by a methanol wipe. This is to ensure no residual oils are left on the surface, and the combination of a clean etched surface will increase the strength of the epoxy bond.","An interchangeable window mount  as shown in  has also been developed for sealing the GXB. The resealable optical access mount  allows for cleaning a sample and cleaning of the GXB without having to rebuild the GXB. These interchangeable blanks allow for sealing of a window  to the mounting flange  using the methods described above, with the addition of an indium joint to seal the mounting flange  to the housing . An indium compression seal is used for the mount to the housing because it can be simply sealed and resealed without heating.","In certain embodiments, stiffer crystalline window materials such as sapphire or YAlO(YAG) are advantageous for several reasons. Fused silica windows are too fragile and prone to cracking over multiple thermal cycles, particularly in larger windows, and nominally non-birefringent BK7 glass windows became substantially birefringent under stress induced from compression forces from the mounts. Therefore, stiffer sapphire or YAG windows are used to overcome the birefringence effects and for their superior mechanical properties.","If applications where it is important that optical back reflections be minimized, the windows may be anti-reflection coated or wedged. Wedged windows reflect the optical beam in another direction, while anti-reflection coated windows allow the majority of the optical power to pass through with minimal reflected power.","The sample mount can, and in some cases is intended to, work with certain cryo-coolers, such as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/136,138, filed Aug. 14, 2008, entitled \u201cApparatuses and Methods for Improving Vibration Isolation, Thermal Dampening, Optical Access in Cryogenic Refrigerators\u201d.","The items described in that previous filing achieve low vibration by detailing another innovation which dampens vibration to any sample mount. It has been shown that the combination of the two items offers better decoupling of vibrations to the sample than the GXB  by itself, or the low vibration module by itself. The combination provides low displacement of the GXB  while still providing good thermal transfer, and also may reduce some of the forces transferred from the cold finger to the GXB . It is anticipated that while the low vibration module may be used by itself, and the GXB  may be used by itself, the most benefit for mounting delicate objects will be provided by these items being used together as shown in .","The present disclosure can be practiced by employing conventional materials, methodology and equipment.
