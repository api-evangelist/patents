title: Conditional actions based on runtime conditions of a computer system environment
abstract: Conditionally performing delegated actions based on runtime conditions of the environment. A component of an Information Technology environment conditionally performs an action, such as its own recovery, based on whether the component can have such action delegated to it and/or whether that component is currently being shared by multiple business applications of the environment.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates, in general, to managing customer environments to provide support for business resiliency, and in particular, to conditionally controlling performance of actions by components of the environment based on runtime conditions of the environment.","Today, customers attempt to manually manage and align their availability management with their information technology (IT) infrastructure. Changes in either business needs or the underlying infrastructure are often not captured in a timely manner and require considerable rework, leading to an inflexible environment.","Often high availability solutions and disaster recovery technologies are handled via a number of disparate point products that target specific scopes of failure, platforms or applications. Integrating these solutions into an end-to-end solution is a complex task left to the customer, with results being either proprietary and very specific, or unsuccessful.","Customers do not have the tools and infrastructure in place to customize their availability management infrastructure to respond to failures in a way that allows for a more graceful degradation of their environments. As a result, more drastic and costly actions may be taken (such as a site switch) when other options (such as disabling a set of applications or users) could have been offered, depending on business needs.","Coordination across availability management and other systems management disciplines is either nonexistent or accomplished via non-reusable, proprietary, custom technology.","There is little predictability as to whether the desired recovery objective will be achieved, prior to time of failure. There are only manual, labor intensive techniques to connect recovery actions with the business impact of failures and degradations.","Any change in the underlying application, technologies, business recovery objectives, resources or their interrelationships require a manual assessment of impact to the hand-crafted recovery scheme.","Based on the foregoing, a need exists for a capability that facilitates management of an IT environment. In particular, a need exists for a capability that enables the performance of actions (e.g., recovery) by a component of the environment to be conditionally controlled based on runtime conditions of the environment.","The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome and additional advantages are provided through the provision of a computer-implemented method of controlling performance of actions within an Information Technology (IT) environment. The method includes, for instance, determining, during runtime of an IT environment, whether a given component of the IT environment is being shared at a selected point in time during runtime; and directing the component to take action based on the determining, wherein the action is dependent on whether the resource is being shared at the selected point in time.","Computer program products and systems relating to one or more aspects of the present invention are also described and claimed herein.","Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention.","In managing a customer's environment, such as its business environment, there is a set of requirements unaddressed by existing technology, which causes unpredictable down time, large impact failures and recoveries, and significant extra labor cost, with resulting loss of business revenue. These requirements include, for instance:\n\n","The above set of requirements is addressed, however, by a Business Resiliency (BR) Management System, of which one or more aspects of the present invention are included. The Business Resiliency Management System provides, for instance:\n\n","One goal of the BR system is to allow customers to align their supporting information technology systems with their business goals for handling failures of various scopes, and to offer a continuum of recovery services from finer grained process failures to broader scoped site outages. The BR system is built around the idea of identifying the components that constitute a business function, and identifying successive levels of recovery that lead to more complex constructs as the solution evolves. The various recovery options are connected by an overall BR management capability that is driven by policy controls.","Various characteristics of one embodiment of a BR system include:\n\n","A Business Resilience System is capable of being incorporated in and used by many types of environments. One example of a processing environment to incorporate and use aspects of a BR system, including one or more aspects of the present invention, is described with reference to .","Processing environment  includes, for instance, a central processing unit (CPU)  coupled to memory  and executing an operating system .

Further details associated with a Business Resilience Runtime Component and a Business Resilience System are described with reference to .","In one example, a Business Resilience System  is a component that represents the management of recovery operations and configurations across an IT environment. Within that Business Resilience System, there is a Business Resilience Runtime Component () that represents the management functionality across multiple distinct Recovery Segments, and provides the service level automation and the support of creation of the recovery sequences. In addition, there are user interface (), administration (), installation () and configuration template () components within the Business Resilience System that enable the administrative operations that are to be performed. Each of these components is described in further detail below.","Business Resilience Runtime Component  includes a plurality of components of the BR System that are directly responsible for the collection of observations, creation of PSEs, policy acceptance, validation, error detection, and formulation of recovery sequences.

These design points include, for instance:","Goal Policy Support","BR is targeted towards goal based policies\u2014the customer configures his target availability goal, and BR determines the preparatory actions and recovery actions to achieve that goal (e.g., automatically).","Availability management of the IT infrastructure through goal based policy is introduced by this design. The BR system includes the ability to author and associate goal based availability policy with the resource Recovery Segments described herein. In addition, support is provided to decompose the goal policy into configuration settings, preparatory actions and runtime procedures in order to execute against the deployed availability goal. In one implementation of the BR system, the Recovery Time Objective (RTO\u2014time to recover post outage) is a supported goal policy. Additional goal policies of data currency (e.g., Recovery Point Objective) and downtime maximums, as well as others, can also be implemented with the BR system. Recovery Segments provide the context for association of goal based availability policies, and are the scope for goal policy expression supported in the BR design. The BR system manages the RTO through an understanding of historical information, metrics, recovery time formulas (if available), and actions that affect the recovery time for IT resources.","RTO goals are specified by the customer at a Recovery Segment level and apportioned to the various component resources grouped within the RS. In one example, RTO goals are expressed as units of time intervals, such as seconds, minutes, and hours. Each RS can have one RTO goal per Pattern System Environment associated with the RS. Based on the metrics available from the IT resources, and based on observed history and\/or data from the customer, the RTO goal associated with the RS is evaluated for achievability, taking into account which resources are able to be recovered in parallel.","Based on the RTO for the RS, a set of preparatory actions expressed as a workflow is generated. This preparatory workflow configures the environment or makes alterations in the current configuration, to achieve the RTO goal or to attempt to achieve the goal.","In terms of optimizing RTO, there are tradeoffs associated with the choices that are possible for preparatory and recovery actions. Optimization of recovery choice is performed by BR, and may include interaction at various levels of sophistication with IT resources. In some cases, BR may set specific configuration parameters that are surfaced by the IT resource to align with the stated RTO. In other cases, BR may request that an IT resource itself alter its management functions to achieve some portion of the overall RS RTO. In either case, BR aligns availability management of the IT resources contained in the RS with the stated RTO.","Metrics and Goal Association","In this design, as one example, there is an approach to collecting the required or desired metrics data, both observed and key varying factors, system profile information that is slow or non-moving, as well as potential formulas that reflect a specific resource's use of the key factors in assessing and performing recovery and preparatory actions, historical data and system information. The information and raw metrics that BR uses to perform analysis and RTO projections are expressed as part of the IT resources, as resource properties. BR specific interpretations and results of statistical analysis of key factors correlated to recovery time are kept as BR Specific Management data (BRMD).","Relationships Used By BR, and BR Specific Resource Pairing Information","BR maintains specific information about the BR management of each resource pairing or relationship between resources. Information regarding the BR specific data for a resource pairing is kept by BR, including information such as ordering of operations across resources, impact assessment information, operation effect on availability state, constraint analysis of actions to be performed, effects of preparatory actions on resources, and requirements for resources to co-locate or anti-co-locate.","Evaluation of Failure Scope","One feature of the BR function is the ability to identify the scope and impact of a failure. The BR design uses a Containment Region to identify the resources affected by an incident. The Containment Region is initially formed with a fairly tight restriction on the scope of impact, but is expanded on receiving errors related to the first incident. The impact and scope of the failure is evaluated by traversing the resource relationships, evaluating information on BR specific resource pairing information, and determining most current state of the resources impacted.","Generation and Use of Workflow","Various types of preparatory and recovery processes are formulated and in some cases, optionally initiated. Workflows used by BR are dynamically generated based on, for instance, customer requirements for RTO goal, based on actual scope of failure, and based on any configuration settings customers have set for the BR system.","A workflow includes one or more operations to be performed, such as Start CICS, etc. Each operation takes time to execute and this amount of time is learned based on execution of the workflows, based on historical data in the observation log or from customer specification of execution time for operations. The workflows formalize, in a machine readable, machine editable form, the operations to be performed.","In one example, the processes are generated into Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) compliant workflows with activities that are operations on IT resources or specified manual, human activities. For example, BRM automatically generates the workflows in BPEL. This automatic generation includes invoking routines to insert activities to build the workflow, or forming the activities and building the XML (Extensible Mark-Up Language). Since these workflows are BPEL standard compliant, they can be integrated with other BPEL defined workflows which may incorporate manual activities performed by the operations staff. These BR related workflows are categorized as follows, in one example:\n\n","Since the set of BR actions described above modify existing IT environments, visibility to the actions that are taken by BR prior to the actual execution is provided. To gain trust in the decisions and recommendations produced by BR, the BR System can run in \u2018advisory mode\u2019. As part of advisory mode, the possible actions that would be taken are constructed into a workflow, similar to what would be done to actually execute the processes. The workflows are then made visible through standard workflow authoring tooling for customers to inspect or modify. Examples of BPEL tooling include:\n\n","BR tooling spans the availability management lifecycle from definition of business objectives, IT resource selection, availability policy authoring and deployment, development and deployment of runtime monitors, etc. In one example, support for the following is captured in the tooling environment for the BR system:\n\n","The policy lifecycle for BR goal policies, such as RTO goals, includes, for example:\n\n","One of the points in determining operational state of a Recovery Segment is that this design allows for customers to configure a definition of specific \u2018aggregated\u2019 states, using properties of individual IT resources. A Recovery Segment is an availability management context, in one example, which may include a diverse set of IT resources.","The customer may provide the rules logic used within the Recovery Segment to consume the relevant IT resource properties and determine the overall state of the RS (available, degraded and unavailable, etc). The customer can develop and deploy these rules as part of the Recovery Segment availability policy. For example, if there is a database included in the Recovery Segment, along with the supporting operating system, storage, and network resources, a customer may configure one set of rules that requires that the database must have completed the recovery of in-flight work in order to consider the overall Recovery Segment available. As another example, customers may choose to configure a definition of availability based on transaction rate metrics for a database, so that if the rate falls below some value, the RS is considered unavailable or degraded, and evaluation of \u2018failure\u2019 impact will be triggered within the BR system. Using these configurations, customers can tailor both the definitions of availability, as well as the rapidity with which problems are detected, since any IT resource property can be used as input to the aggregation, not just the operational state of IT resources.","Failure During Workflow Sequences of Preparatory, Recovery, Preventive","Failures occurring during sequences of operations executed within a BPEL compliant process workflow are intended to be handled through use of BPEL declared compensation actions, associated with the workflow activities that took a failure. The BR System creates associated \u201cundo\u201d workflows that are then submitted to compensate, and reset the environment to a stable state, based on where in the workflow the failure occurred.","Customer Values","The following set of customer values, as examples, are derived from the BR system functions described above, listed here with supporting technologies from the BR system:\n\n","Management of the IT environment is adaptively performed, as described herein and in a U.S. patent application Ser.

Some resources possess the ability to perform detailed recovery actions while others do not. For resources capable of performing recovery operations, the BR system provides for delegation of recovery if the resource is not shared by two or more business applications, as described herein, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present invention.","Having evaluated the outage and formulated a set of recovery operations, the BR system resumes monitoring for subsequent changes to the IT environment.","In support of mainline BR system operation, there are a number of activities including, for instance:\n\n","In order to build a BR environment that meets recovery time objectives, IT configurations within a customer's location are to be characterized and knowledge about the duration of execution for recovery time operations within those configurations is to be gained. IT configurations and the durations for operation execution vary by time, constituent resources, quantity and quality of application invocations, as examples. Customer environments vary widely in configuration of IT resources in support of business applications. Understanding the customer environment and the duration of operations within those environments aids in insuring a Recovery Time Objective is achievable and in building workflows to alter the customer configuration of IT resources in advance of a failure and\/or when a failure occurs.","A characterization of IT configurations within a customer location is built by having knowledge of the key recovery time characteristics for individual resources (i.e., the resources that are part of the IT configuration being managed; also referred to as managed resources). Utilizing the representation for a resource, a set of key recovery time objective (RTO) metrics are specified by the resource owner. During ongoing operations, the BR manager gathers values for these key RTO metrics and gathers timings for the operations that are used to alter the configuration. It is expected that customers will run the BR function in \u201cobservation\u201d mode prior to having provided a BR policy for availability management or other management. While executing in \u201cobservation\u201d mode, the BR manager periodically gathers RTO metrics and operation execution durations from resource representations. The key RTO metrics properties, associated values and operation execution times are recorded in an Observation log for later analysis through tooling. Key RTO metrics and operation execution timings continue to be gathered during active BR policy management in order to maintain currency and iteratively refine data used to characterize customer IT configurations and operation timings within those configurations.","Examples of RTO properties and value range information by resource type are provided in the below table.

They do not have a decomposed RTO associated with them nor are they acted on for availability by BR. Assessed resources have the following characteristics, as examples:\n\n","Similarly, there are likely scenarios where a resource exists in a customer environment that already has an alternative availability management solution, and does not require BR for its availability. However, since other resources that are managed by BR may be dependent on them, they are observed and assessed in order to collect observation data and understand their impacts on managed resources. Additionally, there may be resources that do not have alternative management solutions, but the customer simply does not want them managed by BR, but other managed resources are dependent upon them. They too are classified as assessed resources.","These assessed resources share many of the same characteristics of managed resources, such as, for example:\n\n","Finally, there are a few restrictions that BR imposes upon assessed resources, in this embodiment:\n\n","To facilitate the building of the customer's IT configuration, observations regarding the customer's environment are gathered and stored in an observation log. In particular, the observation log is used to store observations gathered during runtime in customer environments, where each observation is a collection of various data points. They are created for each of the Recovery Segments that are in \u201cobservation\u201d mode. These observations are used for numerous runtime and administrative purposes in the BR environment. As examples the observations are used:\n\n","BR gathers observations during runtime when \u201cobservation mode\u201d is enabled at the Recovery Segment level. There are two means for enabling observation mode, as examples:\n\n","The administrator may also disable observation mode for a Recovery Segment, which stops it from polling for data and creating subsequent observation records for insertion in the log. However, the accumulated observation log is not deleted. In one example, an RS remains in observation mode throughout its lifecycle. The UI displays the implications of disabling observation mode.","In BR, the observations that are collected by BR during runtime can be grouped into two categories, as examples:\n\n","A periodic poll observation is a point-in-time snapshot of the constituent resources in a Recovery Segment. Observation data points are collected for those resources in the Recovery Segment(s) which have associated BR management data for any of the following reasons, as examples:\n\n","The full value of these observations is derived for an RS when they include data that has been gathered for its constituent resources, plus the resources that those are dependent upon. In one embodiment, the administrator is not forced to include all dependent resources when defining a Recovery Segment, and even if that were the case, there is nothing that prevents them from deleting various dependent resources. When defining a Recovery Segment, the BR UI provides an option that allows the customer to display the dependency graph for those resources already in the Recovery Segment. This displays the topology from the seed node(s) in the Recovery Segment down to and including the dependent leaf nodes. The purpose of this capability is to give the customer the opportunity to display the dependent nodes and recommend that they be included in the Recovery Segment.","Preparatory and recovery workflows are built by the BR manager to achieve the customer requested RTO policy based on resource operations timings. During active policy monitoring by the BR manager, measurements of achieved time for operations are recorded in observations to the log and used to maintain the running statistical data on operation execution times. Observations written to the log may vary in the contained resource RTO metrics and operation execution timings.","Observations are also collected from any of the BPEL workflows created by BR in the customer's environment. There is a standard template that each BR BPEL workflow uses. As part of that template, observation data is captured at the start of, during, and at the completion of each workflow. Specifically, in one example, one observation is created at the end of the workflow with data accumulated from completion of each activity. This information is used to gather timings for workflow execution for use in creating subsequent workflows at time of failure.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a component of an IT environment conditionally performs an action (e.g., its own recovery) based upon whether the component can have such action delegated to it and\/or whether that component is currently being shared by multiple business applications.","One example of a component that may be selected for delegation is a resource of an IT environment. In particular, certain types of resources support the ability to have a set of actions or policy delegated to them from a higher level management scope. There are cases where these resources are not shared by more than one business application, and there are cases where these resources are shared by more than one application. Management of an IT infrastructure is to handle both cases, and is to take into account customer specified\/tailored information of the effect that one resource's action (e.g., recovery) is allowed to have on another.","Some resources can also assess errors and formulate recovery actions within a defined scope. The actions taken by these resources are in the context of recovering a scope of failure, which may be significantly more narrow than the set of IT resources operating to achieve ongoing operation for an enterprise business application. Moreover, the recovery actions taken by these resources may need to be varied dependent on the criticality of the business application that is utilizing the resource. Increased complexity occurs if such a resource is utilized by more than one business application where there is a disparity in criticality between the two or more business applications. Customers require the ability to determine and manage:\n\n","Existing services do not provide the level of control required or desired by customers for IT resources shared by two or more business applications of different criticality, or for IT resources on which operations are to be executed on behalf of two or more management disciplines acting on independent policy directives. Specifically, adequate level of control is not provided where resources have built in operations to perform recovery and where that needs to be coordinated across an entire business application's recovery.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a structure of resource and resource relationship information is utilized in support of BR processing to determine, for example:\n\n","BR performs analysis of resource capabilities and based on resource capabilities and the current runtime environment:\n\n","Support for delegation of recovery decisions is built on representations of resources, and their relationship(s) to Recovery Segments (RS(s)). In one implementation, a business application is programmatically represented by a RS. When a RS is defined, resources are associated with the RS. If a resource is shared among two or more RSs, there exists the possibility of conflicts in recovery decisions (or other actions), as the resource is associated with two or more business applications, which may have different quantitative management goals, such as Recovery Time Objective (RTO) goals. Determination of recovery actions are performed by BR for shared resources utilizing the context of the business applications which are utilizing the shared resource.","RTO goals are specified by the customer at a Recovery Segment level and apportioned to the various component resources grouped within the RS by the BR system. There are RTO goals expressed as units of time intervals, such as seconds, minutes, and hours. RTO at the RS level is apportioned to the individual resources, as target recovery times, taking into account parallel or overlapping restart capability. Optimization of recovery choice is performed by BR, and may include interaction at various levels of sophistication with a managed resource. In some cases, BR may set specific configuration parameters that are surfaced by the manageable resource to align with the stated RTO. In other cases, BR may request that a manageable resource itself alter its management functions to achieve some portion of the overall RS RTO. Functional capabilities of a resource are expressed as BR management data on the resource. A resource which is capable of being delegated recovery assessment and recovery actions may support one or more of multiple interfaces. These interfaces are, for instance, programmatic interfaces that indicate to the resource that a particular action is to be taken. These interfaces can be implemented in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, as application programming interfaces (APIs) invoked through macros; as events that are listened for; as messages that are monitored for, etc. Examples of supported interfaces include, for instance:\n\n","Resources which can be shared by two or more business applications may enable two interfaces if those resources support delegation for independent error assessment and error recovery. One interface indicates that the resource is capable of being delegated to. An interface may be provided which accepts specification of an apportioned RTO time for the resource to attempt to achieve. Another interface which supports enabling or disabling of recovery decision and recovery action taken by the resource may be provided. BR examines each resource in a RS when the RS is made actively monitored for RTO goal management. For resource(s) which support being delegated to, BR attempts to determine what the apportionment of RTO to the resource can be while still meeting the overall RTO for the RS. BR determines if the resource is associated with a single RS or multiple RS(s). If a resource is associated with a single RS and supports being delegated to, BR utilizes the resource supported interface enabling delegation when the RS is made actively monitored for RTO goal management. Otherwise, BR does not enable the resource for delegated recovery decision and recovery action processing. If a resource becomes shared between two RSs by being added to a RS, BR utilizes the resource supported interface disabling delegation to the resource.","If a resource is not shared and does support delegation of recovery decisions and recovery actions, it may recover from error conditions or may fail to recover from error conditions.","If a resource recovers an error condition, its state reflects that recovery is in progress and if recovery was successful or failed. If recovery is successful, and assuming no impact to other resource(s) is caused by recovery, BR takes no further action. If a resource delegated to fails to recover, BR is notified of the state change of the resource and take actions in accordance with error processing.","If a resource is shared and is capable of being delegated to for recovery decisions and recovery actions, but has been prohibited from doing so by BR invoking the interface to disable delegated actions, the resource is obligated to transition state to reflect the error rather than attempt recovery. When the resource transitions state, BR initiates error processing which includes forming recovery operations.","The following customer example highlights one case where delegation is critical to a large enterprise financial sector customer\u2014here called ABC. At ABC, there exists two business applications which use a common set of data. A mission critical application relies on a large collection of storage volumes. A non-mission critical application also uses these same storage volumes, as well as a few additional storage volumes. ABC chooses to have the total set of these storage volumes replicated using a synchronous replication technology, such as IBM's Peer-to-Peer Remote Copy (PPRC) facility to insure there is data consistency if a switch from the primary to the alternate is required. However, if the only failure is with a volume required solely by the non-mission critical business application, ABC will not tolerate the hyperswap time required to move to the alternate volumes of the PPRC session. This is because the hyperswap time puts at risk losing the subsystem (e.g., CICS) regions for the mission critical business application. During the time I\/O is frozen for the hyperswap, transactions back up on the subsystem region causing it to go \u201cshort on storage\u201d (SOS) which will likely cause a region failure. So the objective stated is to have a RTO for the case where both applications are to be recovered, but preclude the non-critical application from compromising the business critical application.","Validation of Availability Goal Processing","Validation of achievability of a goal policy, such as an availability goal policy, may be initiated by the BR administrator through the BR UI and may be achieved in multiple ways. In one implementation, policy validation may occur in multiple discrete steps including, for example:\n\n","Alternatively, validation may be manually performed by inspection of IT resource capabilities including current state and measured timings for execution of recovery operations.","Evaluation of recovery operations for a resource establishes acceptable time duration for recovery of the business application represented by an RS. If a resource can have recovery processing delegated to it, the acceptable recovery processing execution duration is provided to enable the resource to comply. To insure a resource can comply with required recovery operation time, changes to the configuration of the resource may also be performed by the resource. For example, a database resource may alter the log frequency in order to insure achievability of recovery time processing.","Activation of Availability Goal Processing","Policy activation is driven by an administrator when the administrator wants to make a policy current for monitoring of the RTO goal associated with the policy. An RS with active monitoring for RTO achievement receives notification of changes to resource state, property\/value pairs and operation execution timings to be initiated, as examples. Queries can be achieved through multiple means including directly invoking interfaces provided by the resource to return data. Any suitable communications mechanism for requesting and receiving resource data may be acceptable. In one implementation, BR may use asynchronous data gathering, an implementation of which is described in \u201cManaging the Computer Collection of Information in an Information Technology Environment,\u201d Bobak et al., Ser. No. 11\/965,917, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Data returned on operation execution duration may be utilized during policy validation when establishing achievability of a desired availability goal.","Activation processing determines if resources are shared and if delegation for recovery processing is to be performed. One embodiment of the logic to activate resource delegation is described with reference to . As one example, RS performs this logic.","Referring to , processing retrieves the topology reflecting the resources which are part of the RS, STEP . For each resource in the topology DAG from leaf resources to root resources, STEP , the BR management data associated with the resource is retrieved from the BRMD table, STEP . (In another embodiment, a DAG is not used, but instead, a list of resources is provided or any other mechanism that indicates the appropriate resources.)","If the resource can be delegated to as indicated by the retrieved data, INQUIRY , and if the resource is part of two or more RS(s), as also indicated by the retrieved data, INQUIRY , the resource interface disabling recovery operations is invoked, STEP , and processing continues at STEP . This interface indicates to the resource that it is to turn off its own recovery processing. The manner in which recovery is disabled is resource dependent.","Otherwise, if the resource is not part of two or more RS(s), INQUIRY , the resource interface enabling recovery operations is invoked and the allowable time for the resource to complete recovery is provided as an apportionment of the overall RTO, STEP . As one example, the apportioned time for recovery is the time used for recovery of the resource in validation of the RTO. Specifically, this interface indicates to the resource that it is to perform its own recovery. Again, the manner in which recovery is performed is resource dependent. However, no matter how recovery is performed, it is to be within the specified goal or an error, as one example, is presented.","Thereafter, processing returns to STEP .","Returning to INQUIRY , if a resource cannot be delegated to, processing returns to STEP .","Remove Resource From RS","Resources can be removed from a RS if they are no longer associated with providing the business application's function. One embodiment of the logic associated with removing a resource is described with reference to . As one example, the RS component of the BR performs this logic.","Referring to , for each resource being removed from a RS, STEP , the BRMD entry is retrieved, STEP . If the resource is part of two or more RS(s) other than the one it is being removed from, INQUIRY , processing proceeds with the next resource, STEP . Otherwise, the resource is part of one or no RS. If the resource can be delegated to, INQUIRY , the resource interface enabling recovery operations is invoked, STEP . As one example, the apportioned time for recovery is the time used for recovery of the resource in validation of the RTO. Processing then continues with STEP .","Returning to INQUIRY , if the resource cannot be delegated to, processing continues with STEP .","Add Resource to RS","Resources can be added to a RS if they are utilized to provide the function of the business application. One embodiment of the logic to add a resource is described with reference to . As one example, the RS component of the BR system performs this logic.","Referring to , the RS topology of resources is retrieved, STEP , and each added resource in the topology DAG is evaluated from leaf resources to root resources, STEP . For instance, the BRMD associated with the resource is retrieved, STEP , and a determination is made as to whether the resource can be delegated to, INQUIRY . If the resource can be delegated to, a determination is made on the number of RS(s) in which the resource participates, INQUIRY . If the resource is part of two or more RS(s), the resource interface disabling recovery operation is invoked, STEP , and processing continues at STEP . Otherwise, the resource interface enabling recovery operations is invoked, STEP , and an apportioned recovery time within which the resource is to complete recovery processing is provided. As one example, the apportioned time for recovery is the time used for recovery of the resource in validation of the RTO. Processing then continues at STEP .","Returning to INQUIRY , if the resource cannot be delegated to, processing continues at STEP .","Deactivate RS Monitoring","Through the UI, the BR administrator may initiate termination of active monitoring of a RS to achieve an availability goal. One embodiment of the logic to deactivate RS monitoring is described with reference to . As one example, this logic is performed by the RS component of the BR system.","Referring to , processing performed by the RS for delegation begins by accessing the RS topology, STEP . For each resource in the topology DAG from leaf resource to root resource, STEP , the BRMD for the resource is retrieved, STEP . If the resource is part of two or more RS(s) after monitoring is discontinued for the RS processing the BR administrator's request, INQUIRY , the next resource is evaluated, STEP . Otherwise, if the resource can be delegated to, INQUIRY , the resource interface enabling recovery operations is invoked, STEP . As one example, the apportioned time for recovery is the time used for recovery of the resource in validation of the RTO. Processing then continues at STEP .","Returning to INQUIRY , if the resource cannot be delegated to, processing returns to STEP . This concludes deactivate RS monitoring.","Described in detail herein is a capability for conditionally controlling, based on current state of a runtime environment, when a resource is to take a particular action, such as its own recovery.","One or more aspects of the present invention can be included in an article of manufacture (e.g., one or more computer program products) having, for instance, computer usable media. The media has therein, for instance, computer readable program code means or logic (e.g., instructions, code, commands, etc.) to provide and facilitate the capabilities of the present invention. The article of manufacture can be included as a part of a computer system or sold separately.","One example of an article of manufacture or a computer program product incorporating one or more aspects of the present invention is described with reference to . A computer program product  includes, for instance, one or more computer usable media  to store computer readable program code means or logic  thereon to provide and facilitate one or more aspects of the present invention. The medium can be an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system (or apparatus or device) or a propagation medium. Examples of a computer readable medium include a semiconductor or solid state memory, magnetic tape, a removable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), a rigid magnetic disk and an optical disk. Examples of optical disks include compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM), compact disk-read\/write (CD-R\/W) and DVD.","A sequence of program instructions or a logical assembly of one or more interrelated modules defined by one or more computer readable program code means or logic direct the performance of one or more aspects of the present invention.","Advantageously, a capability is provided for conditionally controlling when a resource of an IT environment is to take a particular action, such as its own recovery. The delegation of such an action is based on, for instance, whether the resource can be delegated to and whether it is being shared at a selected point in time during runtime (e.g., when the RS associated with the resource is activated for monitoring or deactivated for monitoring, or when a resource is added or removed from a RS associated with the resource (or at other times, in other embodiments). This ensures that one resource does not unexpectedly affect another resource. Advantageously, this capability is dynamic allowing decisions by the delegated to resource to be made at runtime, and more specifically, at the time recovery is needed. Additionally, the decisions are dynamically determined as resources change in their use and support of one or more business applications.","Although various embodiments are described above, these are only examples. For example, the processing environments described herein are only examples of environments that may incorporate and use one or more aspects of the present invention. Environments may include other types of processing units or servers or the components in each processing environment may be different than described herein. Each processing environment may include additional, less and\/or different components than described herein. Further, the types of central processing units and\/or operating systems or other types of components may be different than described herein. Again, these are only provided as examples.","Moreover, an environment may include an emulator (e.g., software or other emulation mechanisms), in which a particular architecture or subset thereof is emulated. In such an environment, one or more emulation functions of the emulator can implement one or more aspects of the present invention, even though a computer executing the emulator may have a different architecture than the capabilities being emulated. As one example, in emulation mode, the specific instruction or operation being emulated is decoded, and an appropriate emulation function is built to implement the individual instruction or operation.","In an emulation environment, a host computer includes, for instance, a memory to store instructions and data; an instruction fetch unit to obtain instructions from memory and to optionally, provide local buffering for the obtained instruction; an instruction decode unit to receive the instruction fetched and to determine the type of instructions that have been fetched; and an instruction execution unit to execute the instructions. Execution may include loading data into a register for memory; storing data back to memory from a register; or performing some type of arithmetic or logical operation, as determined by the decode unit. In one example, each unit is implemented in software. For instance, the operations being performed by the units are implemented as one or more subroutines within emulator software.","Further, a data processing system suitable for storing and\/or executing program code is usable that includes at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements include, for instance, local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memory which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.","Input\/Output or I\/O devices (including, but not limited to, keyboards, displays, pointing devices, DASD, tape, CDs, DVDs, thumb drives and other memory media, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I\/O controllers. Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modems, and Ethernet cards are just a few of the available types of network adapters.","Further, although the environments described herein are related to the management of availability of a customer's environment, one or more aspects of the present invention may be used to manage aspects other than or in addition to availability. Further, one or more aspects of the present invention can be used in environments other than a business resiliency environment.","Yet further, many examples are provided herein, and these examples may be revised without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For example, in one embodiment, the description is described in terms of availability and recovery; however, other goals and\/or objectives may be specified in lieu of or in addition thereto. Additionally, the resources may be other than IT resources. Further, there may be references to particular products offered by International Business Machines Corporation or other companies. These again are only offered as examples, and other products may also be used. Additionally, although tables and databases are described herein, any suitable data structure may be used. There are many other variations that can be included in the description described herein and all of these variations are considered a part of the claimed invention.","Further, for completeness in describing one example of an environment in which one or more aspects of the present invention may be utilized, certain components and\/or information is described that is not needed for one or more aspects of the present invention. These are not meant to limit the aspects of the present invention in any way.","One or more aspects of the present invention can be provided, offered, deployed, managed, serviced, etc. by a service provider who offers management of customer environments. For instance, the service provider can create, maintain, support, etc. computer code and\/or a computer infrastructure that performs one or more aspects of the present invention for one or more customers. In return, the service provider can receive payment from the customer under a subscription and\/or fee agreement, as examples. Additionally or alternatively, the service provider can receive payment from the sale of advertising content to one or more third parties.","In one aspect of the present invention, an application can be deployed for performing one or more aspects of the present invention. As one example, the deploying of an application comprises providing computer infrastructure operable to perform one or more aspects of the present invention.","As a further aspect of the present invention, a computing infrastructure can be deployed comprising integrating computer readable code into a computing system, in which the code in combination with the computing system is capable of performing one or more aspects of the present invention.","As yet a further aspect of the present invention, a process for integrating computing infrastructure, comprising integrating computer readable code into a computer system may be provided. The computer system comprises a computer usable medium, in which the computer usable medium comprises one or more aspects of the present invention.
