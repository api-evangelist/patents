No. 60\/963,639, filed Aug. 6, 2007, each of which is also hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with Government support under Contract Number W911NF-09-C-0035 awarded by the U.S. Army RDECOM ACQ CTR. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present development relates to mechanical and medical devices and, more particularly, to prosthetic devices. More particularly, the development utilizes mechanical structure and user or motor stimuli to operate a prosthesis similarly to a human limb.","Existing prosthetic arms have limited movement for the user. Further, there are limited options for those patients who have lost their entire arm, shoulder to hand. Also, hand portions of existing prosthetic arms give the user, in many instances, one degree of movement. These known prosthetic devices provide limited capability with respect to, amongst other things, finer tasks.","Accordingly, there is a need for a prosthetic arm that replaces an arm from shoulder to hand and that has increased degrees of freedom. There is also a need for a prosthetic hand that moves in a realistic manner.","It is one aspect of the present device to provide a prosthetic device that will allow the user improved range of motion, improved tactile capabilities, increased comfort for the user, and decreased reliance on manual positioning of the prosthesis.","According to some aspects of the present invention, a compound motion assembly for providing a two-axis compound motion through a pre-determined path includes an input member and an output member moveably coupled to the input member. Actuation of the compound motion assembly generates movement of the output member relative to the input member along a compound motion path having motion about at least two axes. In some embodiments, the compound motion assembly includes a drive arrangement for controlling movement of the output member relative to the input member. In these embodiments, the rate of motion about each axis may vary as the drive arrangement is actuated at a constant rate.","According to some embodiments, the output member may be moveably coupled to the input member through at least a first joint having a first axis and a second joint having a second axis, the first and second joints being connected in series. The compound motion assembly may include a path member that is fixedly coupled to the input member and has a fixed path profile formed therein defining the compound motion path. A follower member may be coupled to the output member and engaging the fixed path profile of the path member such that pivotal movement of the output member relative to the input member about both the first axis and the second axis is generated as the follower member moves along the pre-determined path. In some embodiments, the drive arrangement may drive the compound motion assembly through one of the first or second joints to cause movement of the output member.","According to some aspects of the present invention, a prosthetic limb segment has a housing with an input interface and an output interface that are moveable with respect to one another and a motorized drive for effecting movement of at least one of the output interface or the input interface. The prosthetic limb segment also includes a controller disposed within the housing for controlling the motorized drive and also for communicating with and controlling at least a second motorized drive of at least a second prosthetic limb segment.","According to some embodiments, the prosthetic limb segment may include a user interface integrally formed in the housing and in communication with the controller. The user interface may include a status indicator for displaying information from the controller. In some embodiments, the status indicator may have one or more LEDs for displaying information from the controller. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the LEDs are arranged in an array. In some embodiments, the user interface includes at least one input member for providing a signal to the controller. The user interface may include a protective cover, which may be flexible and may include at least a portion that is translucent to allow light from an LED disposed beneath the protective cover therethrough.","According to some aspects of the present invention, a safety mechanism for a prosthetic device having at least one motorized drive and a controller for controlling the motorized drive is provided. The safety mechanism includes an actuator electrically coupled in parallel with the controller between the motorized drive and a power source so that actuation of the actuator supplies power to the motorized drive bypassing the controller and actuates the motorized drive until it reaches a safe position.","According to some embodiments, the safety mechanism may include an actuator that has at least two switches coupled to actuate simultaneously and electrically coupled in parallel so that actuation of only one switch of the at least two switches is sufficient to actuate the motorize drive, thereby providing redundancy. In some embodiments, the actuator is electrically coupled in parallel with the controller between the power source and a plurality of motorized drives such that actuation of the actuator supplies power to the plurality of motorized drives and actuates each motorized drive until it reaches a safe position.","These aspects of the invention are not meant to be exclusive and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art when read in conjunction with the appended claims and accompanying drawings.","The same compliance method is applied to the MRP drive, allowing it to store elastic energy.","Referring to , a prosthetic arm apparatus  for attachment to a shoulder of a shoulder disarticulated amputee includes a plurality of segments, including a shoulder abductor , a shoulder flexion assembly , a humeral rotator , an elbow flexion assembly , a wrist rotator , a wrist flexion assembly , and a hand assembly . The prosthetic arm apparatus , in the exemplary embodiment, has the dimensions and weight of a female arm of a fiftieth percentile, so that many different users may comfortably use the prosthetic arm apparatus . As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the prosthetic arm apparatus  may be constructed to larger or smaller dimensions if desired. The prosthetic arm apparatus  may be controlled by a control system (not shown), such as the various control systems described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/027,116, filed Feb. 6, 2008, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/706,575, filed Feb. 16, 2010, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/706,471, filed Feb. 16, 2010, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/088,085, filed Apr. 15, 2011, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Referring to , one embodiment of the shoulder abductor  is shown. The shoulder abductor  includes a harness mount  for connecting the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , to a support apparatus, as the various prosthetic supports described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/026,971, filed Feb. 6, 2008, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/706,340, filed Feb. 16, 2010, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/088,035, filed Apr. 15, 2011, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The harness mount  has harness interface holes  that may be used to attach the abductor  to a prosthetic harness (not shown) or other system for supporting the prosthetic arm apparatus . In the exemplary embodiment, the harness or prosthetic support apparatus may also be one disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/026,971, by Altobelli, et al., entitled Dynamic Support Apparatus filed on Feb. 6, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Referring to , the shoulder abductor  also has a shoulder flexion assembly mount , shown according to one embodiment. The shoulder flexion assembly mount  interfaces with the shoulder flexion assembly  to mount the shoulder flexion assembly  onto the shoulder abductor . In one embodiment, the flexion assembly mount  has interface holes  to facilitate connection of the shoulder flexion assembly  by attachment means such as bolts.","Referring to , the shoulder abductor  further includes an abductor joint , shown according to one embodiment. The abductor joint  is used to pivot the shoulder flexion assembly mount  away from the harness mount  and back toward the harness mount .","Referring to , the shoulder abductor  includes an abductor motor  to control the pivotal movement of the abductor joint , shown in , both the shoulder abductor  and abductor motor  shown according to one embodiment. In this embodiment, the abductor motor  is a brushed DC motor controlling the pivotal movement through an abductor belt  connected to a worm drive  driving a worm wheel  connected to an abductor harmonic drive gearing system .","Referring to , the shoulder flexion assembly , in one embodiment, has a main shoulder housing , with an abductor interface  for connecting the shoulder flexion assembly  to the shoulder abductor . The shoulder flexion assembly  also has a humeral interface  for connecting the humeral rotator  to the shoulder flexion assembly .","Referring to , in one embodiment, shoulder flexion motor magnets  are disposed around a shaft  of a shoulder flexion motor rotor . In this embodiment, a shoulder flexion motor armature  drives the shoulder flexion motor rotor , which in turn drives a shoulder flexion motor pulley  around a motor shaft . The shoulder flexion motor pulley  supports a shoulder flexion belt , which is linked between the shoulder flexion motor pulley  and a shoulder flexion belt-driven pulley . The shoulder flexion belt-driven pulley  drives a shoulder flexion harmonic drive gearing system wave generator . A shoulder flexion harmonic drive gearing system flexspline  rotates against the shoulder flexion harmonic drive gearing system wave generator  and a shoulder flexion harmonic drive gearing system circular spline , resulting in reduced speed for the joint movement. The shoulder flexion harmonic drive gearing system flexspline  is connected to the abductor interface , and is thus able to rotate the shoulder flexion assembly  in reference to the abductor interface.","Referring to , in one embodiment, a non-backdriving clutch  is disposed inside the main shoulder housing . The non-backdriving clutch  allows the prosthetic arm  to hold position by locking when the prosthetic arm  is not moving.","Referring to  and , in one embodiment, roller bearings  line the interface between an input cage  and an output hex . When a force is applied to the shoulder abductor interface , the output hex  locks against the bearing race  and the roller bearings . This prevents the shoulder flexion assembly  from moving due to force applied to its output, shoulder abductor interface . Upon the exertion of a necessary amount of input force through the clutch input cage , the output hex  disengages and allows the shoulder flexion assembly  to move. The clutch input cage  and the output hex  are both constrained by a clutch race . It should be understood by those skilled in the art, that other mechanisms could be used to prevent backdriving of the prosthetic arm , such as a clutch that locks in one direction or a solenoid with brakes that engage when the solenoid is powered. Additionally, although described in connection with the shoulder flexion assembly , it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the non-backdriving clutch  may be included in other prosthetic joints described herein.","Referring to , in one embodiment, a compliance subassembly , shown in , includes a compliance reactor  positioned on top of the shoulder flexion harmonic drive gearing system circular spline , shown in , and held in place by the clamp . The compliance reactor  measures the amount of displacement in the compliance subassembly  in relation to the position of a compliance sensor magnet .","Referring to , in one embodiment, the interior of compliance subassembly  includes series elastic elements . The shoulder flexion harmonic drive gearing system circular spline  defines the interior of the compliance subassembly  and is formed to accommodate the placement of the series elastic elements  around an outer diameter  of the shoulder flexion harmonic drive gearing system circular spline . The series elastic elements  are confined by the shoulder flexion harmonic drive gearing system circular spline  and the clamp .","Referring to , the placement of the compliance reactor  in relation to the series elastic elements  and reactor elements  is shown. In this embodiment, three reactor elements  are positioned around the compliance reactor , equidistant to each other. One series elastic element  is placed on either side of each reactor element . When the shoulder flexion assembly  is subjected to unexpected force, such as a sudden jolt or impact, the compliance reactor  and reactor elements  displace from their rest positions and compress against the series elastic elements . In that way, the compliance subassembly  attenuates the shock being transferred to the rest of the shoulder flexion assembly . The compliance reactor  may also measure the amount of displacement and compliance by measuring the movement of the compliance reactor  in relation to the stationary position of the compliance sensor magnet .","Referring to , one embodiment of the humeral rotator  is shown. The humeral rotator  includes an outer bearing carrier  attached to the first control housing , shown in . The first control housing , shown in , is used to connect the humeral rotator  to the shoulder flexion assembly . The inner rotational elements of the humeral rotator are held in place by a clamp , which is fastened to the outer bearing carrier . A humeral mount  passes through the clamp  and includes an elbow interface  for attaching the elbow flexion assembly  to the humeral rotator .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0144","num":"0142"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIGS. 16 and 2"],"b":["16","100","102","104","102","106","108","106","110","108","96","111","113","102","112","106","108","110","114","90","90","92"]},"Still referring to , the one embodiment, a humeral potentiometer  of the humeral rotator , measures the rotational displacement of a humeral potentiometer shaft  that rotates proportionately to the humeral mount .","Referring to , the elbow flexion assembly  includes an elbow joint  and a radial mount . The elbow joint  includes a slot  into which the elbow interface  of the humeral rotator is inserted to facilitate connection of the elbow flexion assembly  to the humeral rotator . The radial mount  provides a second electronics housing , in which an ACM stack  is located. \u201cACM\u201d as used herein refers to Arm Control Module. The radial mount  includes a wrist interface , for attachment of the wrist rotator .","In some embodiments, the ACM stack  may be integrated into the wrist rotator , as will be discussed in greater detail below. Integrating the ACM stack  into the wrist rotator may be advantageous since the wrist rotator  is likely to be present in prosthetic arms for essentially all types of amputees, whereas the elbow flexion assembly  may not be present, such as in a prosthetic arm for a transradial amputee.","Referring to , the elbow joint  includes an elbow motor armature  that drives an elbow motor rotor . Elbow magnets  are disposed at one end of the motor rotor , and the opposing end of the motor rotor  has a sun gear . As the motor armature  drives the sun gear , the sun gear  in turn drives four planetary gears  positioned equidistant from each other around the sun gear . The four planetary gears  in turn react against a ring gear , giving the elbow flexion assembly  a first stage of speed reduction through an elbow harmonic drive gearing system wave generator  which also acts as the planet carrier. The elbow harmonic drive gearing system wave generator  powers the elbow harmonic drive gearing system flexspline , which drives against the elbow harmonic drive gearing system circular spline , giving the elbow flexion assembly  a second stage of reduction. The elbow harmonic drive gearing system flexspline  then drives the motion of the elbow flexion assembly . Bearings  and crossed roller bearings  support the outer perimeter of the elbow flexion assembly . Although described with both a planetary gear system and an elbow harmonic drive gearing system, the elbow flexion assembly  could be controlled solely by a harmonic drive gearing system by changing the gear reduction ratio.","In various embodiments, it may be desirable to avoid having to perform additional measurement by using the measurement in the compliance process. One example includes, in various embodiments, where the planetary gears may be used for compliance and measurement of load.","Referring to , in the embodiment shown, the radial mount  is structurally fixed to the elbow joint , such that when the elbow joint is actuated, the radial mount  moves.","Referring to , an elbow compliance subassembly  is incorporated into the elbow flexion assembly . A plurality of arms  extends from the center portion of the elbow compliance subassembly . Each arm  has an elbow series elastic element  disposed on either side of the arm . Similar to the shoulder flexion assembly , if the elbow flexion assembly  is subject to a torque, the elbow compliance subassembly , with its series elastic elements , is capable of absorbing the shock attenuating the torque magnitude through the rest of the elbow flexion assembly .","Referring to , wherein like numerals represent like elements, in some embodiments, the elbow compliance assembly  may include a carrier having a magnet (not shown) disposed thereon and having a carrier top  and a carrier bottom  that connect to one another to surround the elbow harmonic drive gearing system circular spline  and that interface with a compliance grounding member . The carrier top  and carrier bottom  to restrict movement of the elbow harmonic drive gearing system circular spline , thereby allowing the circular spline  to operate substantially as discussed above to drive the elbow flexion assembly , shown in . The carrier bottom  includes clips  located around its periphery that slidably engage corresponding compliance shafts  of the compliance grounding member  to connect the carrier to the compliance grounding member . Each clip  is positioned on a compliance shaft  between two compliance springs  that inhibit sliding movement of the clips  relative to the shafts . The compliance springs  are preferably formed from metal and, in some embodiments, each spring  may include a plurality of stacked spring washers. In operation, as the elbow harmonic drive becomes loaded, the clips  of the carrier slide on the compliance shafts  and load the compliance springs , which deflect in proportion to the load. A sensor (not shown) measures the displacement of the magnet (not shown), thereby providing a measurement of the torque carried by the elbow harmonic drive and, therefore, the elbow flexion assembly , shown in . The elbow compliance assembly  advantageously provides improved compliance measurements due to its metal springs  as compared to elastomeric spring designs, which have greater hysteresis. Additionally, the carrier of the elbow compliance assembly  advantageously allows the circular spline  to be mounted without any modifications that may reduce its load capacity.","Referring to , the ACM stack , includes circuit boards  connected to one another by structural standoffs . The structural standoffs  are constructed of a conductive material, so that electrical power may be passed through the circuit boards . The structural standoffs allow power to be supplied to each circuit board  without conventional power connections.","Referring to , the wrist rotator  includes a wrist outer bearing carrier , a wrist clamp , a wrist potentiometer , an elbow interface , and a wrist flexion assembly interface .","Referring to , movement of the wrist rotator  is controlled by a harmonic drive gearing system similar to that described for the humeral rotator. A wrist rotator motor armature  drives a wrist rotator motor rotor  having wrist rotator magnets  disposed to its surface. The lower portion of the wrist rotator motor rotor  integrates a wrist rotator harmonic drive gearing system wave generator . A wrist rotator harmonic drive gearing system flexspline  rotates with the wrist rotator harmonic drive gearing system wave generator  against a wrist rotator harmonic drive gearing system circular spline , resulting in reduction in the speed of rotation as the wrist rotator harmonic drive gearing system flexspline  causes the wrist flexion assembly interface  to move with respect to the rest of the wrist rotator . Bearings  support the wrist rotator motor rotor . Bearings  support the harmonic drive gearing system components ,, and .","Still referring to , the wrist potentiometer  of the wrist rotator  is disposed at one end of a wrist shaft  and measures the rotational displacement thereof. The wrist shaft  may be tubular, having an electronics channel  for passing electronic power and controls through the wrist rotator .","Referring to , the wrist flexion assembly  includes hand control module circuit boards , an input support structure , an output arm , and a hand interface . The input support structure  connects the wrist rotator  with the wrist flexion assembly . The output arm  has positive and negative flexion, such that the output arm  is able to move in two opposite directions in reference to the support structure . The hand interface  allows the hand assembly  to be connected to the wrist flexion assembly . Referring to , the wrist flexion assembly , has wrist electrical connections  for supplying power to a wrist flexion motor .","Referring to , in the embodiment shown, the wrist flexion motor  drives a wrist flexion output gear , which in turn drives a wrist flexion final stage-driven gear . A wrist flexion pivot axle  of the output arm  is axially disposed inside an opening defined by the interior of the wrist flexion final stage-driven gear . Wrist flexion series elastic elements  are disposed in the interior of the output arm . Movement of the wrist flexion final stage-driven gear  facilitates the positive and negative motion of the output arm . A non-backdriving clutch  is disposed at one end of the wrist flexion output gear .","Referring to , the output arm  has a wrist flexion drive arm , which is driven by the wrist flexion final stage-driven gear . The end of the wrist flexion drive arm  accommodates a wrist flexion compliance sensor magnet . The wrist flexion series elastic elements  are disposed on either side of the wrist flexion drive arm , and the wrist flexion series elastic elements  and the drive arm  are substantially enclosed within the output arm . Similar to the elbow flexion assembly  and the shoulder flexion assembly , if the wrist flexion assembly  is subjected to a force, the wrist flexion drive arm  compresses the wrist flexion series elastic elements   and attenuates the force or impact through the rest of the wrist flexion assembly .","The following is a description of one embodiment of the hand assembly. Other embodiments of the hand assembly are described and shown elsewhere in this specification. Referring to  the hand assembly  includes a hand support  for providing an interface for connecting the hand assembly  to the wrist flexion output arm . The hand assembly  also includes a thumb structure , an index finger structure , and an MRP structure  replicating a middle finger , a ring finger , and a pinky finger . In various embodiments, the thumb structure  may be driven by two thumb drives  that feed into a single differential, giving the thumb structure  two degrees of freedom of movement. The index finger structure  may be driven by a single index drive  and the MRP structure  may be driven by a single MRP drive  that feeds a double differential. The MRP approach allows for an indeterminate versus determinate linkage.","Referring to , the index finger structure  (not shown) is driven by the index drive  through an index drive pulley , an index tensioner , an index tension belt , and an index finger pulley . The index drive pulley  is stage driven and transfers the torque to the index tension belt , which in turn rotates the index finger pulley , causing the index finger structure  to move. As the index tension belt  transfers the torque, one side of the index tension belt  tightens and the other side loosens, depending on which direction the index drive pulley  is rotated. The index tensioner  is located between the index drive pulley  and the index finger pulley  and the index tensioner  displaces in relation to the change in load to maintain the tension of the index tension belt . The index tensioner  has one side grounded and the other side capable of displacement upon the application of a load. The index tensioner  may instead ground the moveable side of the index tensioner  with a spring.","Referring to , in another embodiment, the index finger structure  is driven through an index sun shaft , a set of index planets , an index planet carrier , an index ring gear , and an index drive gear . The index drive  drives the index ring gear , turning the index planets , the turning of which causes the index planet carrier  to rotate. The index drive gear  is driven by the external teeth of the index planet carrier , causing the index structure  to move. Any torque transmitted by the index planet carrier  will react against the index sun shaft  causing it to rotationally displace the index spring  through the index spring mount . This rotational displacement, sensed by an index potentiometer  can be used to infer the load on the index finger structure . This rotational displacement may be used to store elastic energy and to provide the index finger structure  with a measure of compliance that may aid in gripping and with load absorption.","Referring to , the thumb structure  is mounted on a thumb support , which is driven by the two thumb differential drives . The thumb structure  has flexural cuts  at its base allowing the compliant thumb structure  to move when a load is applied to it. This compliance in the thumb structure  may aid in gripping and with load absorption, which may prevent the hand assembly  from damaging objects (not shown) by closing around them too quickly and forcefully.","Referring to , the hand assembly  includes an MRP drive pulley  driven by the MRP drive . The MRP drive pulley  is connected through an MRP tension belt  to the MRP pulley , enabling movement of the MRP structure . The MRP drive pulley  is stage driven and transfers the load to the MRP tension belt , which in turn rotates the linked MRP structure  via the MRP pulley . As the MRP tension belt  transfers torque, one side of the MRP tension belt  tightens as the other side loosens. An MRP tensioner  located at one side of the MRP tension belt  displaces in relation to the change in load to maintain the tension of the MRP tension belt . This also provides the MRP structure  with compliance to aid in gripping and with load absorption, which may prevent the hand assembly  from damaging objects (not shown) by closing around the objects (not shown) too quickly and forcefully.","Referring to , in another embodiment, the MRP finger structures  are driven through an MRP sun shaft , a set of MRP planets , an MRP planet carrier , an MRP ring gear , and an MRP drive gear . The MRP drive  drives the MRP ring gear , turning the MRP planets , the turning of which causes the MRP planet carrier  to rotate. The MRP drive gear  is driven by the external teeth of the MRP planet carrier , causing the MRP structures  to move. Any torque transmitted by the MRP planet carrier  will react against the MRP sun shaft  causing it to rotationally displace the MRP spring  through the MRP spring mount . This rotational displacement can be used to store elastic energy.","Referring to  the MRP differential drive  includes a main MRP drive gear . The MRP drive gear  drives a first MRP input axle . The first MRP input axle  drives a first differential idler gear  which optionally drives a middle spur gear  or a differential interface gear . The middle spur gear  drives a middle pivot axle . The middle finger  is mounted on the middle pivot axle  and is thus actuated by the MRP differential drive . The differential interface gear  drives a second MRP input axle . The second MRP input axle  drives a second differential idler gear  which optionally drives a ring spur gear  or a pinky spur gear . The ring spur gear  drives a ring pivot axle . The ring finger  is mounted on the ring pivot axle  and is thus actuated by the MRP differential drive . The pinky spur gear  drives a pinky pivot axle . The pinky finger  is mounted on the pinky pivot axle  and is thus actuated by the MRP drive . While the MRP drive  drives the middle finger , the ring finger  and the pinky finger , the gear configuration of the first input axle  and the second input axle  allows independent movement for the under-actuated finger gear system of the MRP structures .","Referring to , in another embodiment of the hand, the MRP differential drive  includes an MRP drive gear  which drives a double differential allowing the MRP fingers to conformably wrap around an object. The MRP drive gear  drives a first MRP input axle . The first input axle  drives a first differential idler gear  which optionally drives a middle spur gear  or a differential interface gear . The middle spur gear  drives a middle pivot axle . The middle finger  is mounted on the middle pivot axle  and is thus actuated by the MRP drive . The differential interface gear  drives a second MRP input axle . The second MRP input axle  drives a second differential idler gear  which optionally drives a ring spur gear  or a pinky spur gear . The ring spur gear  drives a ring pivot axle . The ring finger  is mounted on the ring pivot axle  and is thus actuated by the MRP drive . The pinky spur gear  drives a pinky pivot axle . The pinky finger  is mounted on the pinky pivot axle  and is thus actuated by the MRP drive . While the MRP drive  drives the middle finger , the ring finger  and the pinky finger , the gear configuration of the first input axle  and the second input axle  allows independent movement for the under-actuated finger gear system of the MRP structures .","Referring to  the thumb differential drives  control the movement of the thumb structure  and are driven by thumb actuators . The thumb actuators  have nonbackdriving thumb clutches  to prevent output loads from reaching and backdriving the thumb actuators. One thumb actuator  drives a first thumb output drive  and a first thumb output gear . The first thumb output gear  in turn drives a first thumb transfer gear , which drives a fixed differential shaft . The fixed differential shaft  drives one thumb differential bevel gear . The second thumb actuator  drives a second thumb output drive  and a second thumb output gear . The second thumb output gear  drives a second thumb transfer gear , which drives a thumb differential bevel gear . The two thumb differential bevel gears  and  operate the thumb structure  in its two degrees of motion.","The thumb structure , the index finger structure , and MRP structure  in one embodiment are covered in silicone, which provides additional friction and aids in gripping objects. In some embodiments, the entire hand assembly  may also be covered in silicone to provide additional grip for holding objects. In other embodiments, the silicone material may be replaced by other compliant materials.","The hand assembly  is advantageous because the thumb structure , index finger structure  and MRP structure  provide various degrees of freedom that allow the formation of various grasps or grips. Additionally, the different drives for each of the thumb structure , index finger structure  and MRP structure  provide various beneficial characteristics to the hand assembly . For instance, the thumb structure  moves relatively slow, but with greater force than the index finger structure  and MRP structure . The index finger structure  moves quickly, but with less force and is non-backdrivable. This combination of thumb structure movement and index finger structure movement allow the quick formation of strong hand grips. Additionally, the combination allows for a smaller index finger actuator, which reduces size and weight of the hand assembly . Additionally, the index finger structure  and MRP structure  move similar to human fingers, which makes them look more natural and makes them more intuitive for the user to control. The MRP structure  provides only bulk control for gripping objects, without providing for individual finger manipulation, since fine control is not necessary for the MRP structure . Additionally, the MRP structure  advantageously moves each finger of the MRP structure  with a single actuator, eliminating excessive bulk in the hand assembly . Like the index finger structure, the MRP structure  moves quickly with low force but is also non-backdrivable. Additionally, the fingers of the MRP structure  are highly flexible, allowing them to grip objects of varying size and shape. The MRP structure  functionality allows the user to grasp an object with the MRP structure  and thumb structure , while allowing the user to move the index finger structure  separately, for example, to activate a button on the object.","The various parts of the prosthetic arm apparatus  are, in some embodiments, constructed from plastic or magnesium. However, where more strength is desired, the parts may be made of aluminum, titanium or steel. In other embodiments, the various parts of the prosthetic arm may be constructed of other metals or plastics, depending on the desired characteristics, including strength, weight, compliance or other similar performance characteristics of the various parts.","Referring to , a tactile feedback sensor  may be positioned on the inner side of the thumb structure . The tactile feedback sensor  may be a pressure sensor, force sensor, a displacement sensor, or other similar sensor capable of providing the user with feedback. Referring to , the tactile feedback sensor  is operatively connected to a feedback actuator . The tactile feedback sensor  may be connected to the feedback actuator  by either wires or wirelessly. In operation, as the user grips an object with the hand assembly , feedback sensor  reads the displacement of or the force exerted on the thumb structure . That reading is then sent to the feedback actuator , which gives the user tactile feedback that indicates the strength of the grip. Feedback actuator  may be placed on the chest of the user, located on a prosthetic support apparatus  in an area of tactile communication with the user, or in any other location capable of receiving tactile feedback, such as on a user's residuum . Referring to , the feedback actuator  may be located on a foot controller  that is used to control hand assembly .","Feedback actuator  may be a vibration motor, such as any vibration motor known in the art, placed against the skin of the user. As the user grips an object, feedback actuator  begins vibrating, notifying the user how strong the object is being gripped. As the force on or displacement of the tactile feedback sensor  changes, frequency and\/or amplitude of vibration may also change, notifying the amputee of a changing grip. For example, if a vibrating actuator  is placed at the chest of the user as in , the user will feel the vibration at his chest.","The feedback actuator  may also be placed wherever the controller for the hand assembly  is located. For example, if a foot controller  controls the hand assembly , the feedback actuator  may be incorporated into the foot controller . The user will then receive tactile feedback of the strength of the prosthetic grip at the same location where the controller is located.","The actuator  may also be a pressure actuator that applies pressure against the user's skin. For example, the actuator  may have a rod that increases pressure against the amputee's skin as the hand assembly  increases its grip on an object.","Although described with a single tactile feedback sensor , additional tactile feedback sensors may be placed at other locations on the hand assembly . For example, additional tactile feedback sensors  may be placed on the index finger structure , the MRP structures , on the palm of the hand assembly , or on any combination of these positions or any other location. Each tactile feedback sensor  would then be operatively connected to an associated feedback actuator . Multiple tactile feedback sensors  and actuators  would provide more sophisticated tactile feedback of the strength of the grip, improving the control of the hand assembly .","In some embodiments, the tactile feedback sensor  may indicate a change in pressure or force, rather than an absolute pressure or force. For example, if the force detected by the tactile feedback sensor  is constant, the feedback actuator  does not actuate, but if that pressure or force increases or decreases, the actuator  would actuate to indicate the change in pressure or force. Additionally, although described in terms of grip strength, the tactile feedback sensors  and actuators  may provide a variety of other feedback in including temperature, an operational mode of the prosthetic arm , surface finish of a object, slip of an object within the hand assembly  or the like.","In operation, the prosthetic arm apparatus is able to move substantially similar to a human arm. Referring to , starting with the hand assembly , the thumb structure , index finger structure , and MRP structure  are each driven independent of the others, and therefore, each may be actuated without actuating the other two structures. Both of the thumb actuators  control motion of the thumb structure  in a direction toward or away from the center of the palm of the hand assembly , as shown in , through the miter gear  and in a direction toward or away from the side of the palm of the hand assembly , as shown in , through the lateral rotation shaft, depending upon the direction and speed of rotation of each thumb actuator . Thus, the thumb actuators , shown in , provide the thumb structure  with two degrees of freedom in the thumb structure's movement. Coupling the two thumb actuators  through the differential described above to provide the two degrees of freedom to the thumb structure  is advantageous over providing a single degree of freedom with each actuator  because the torque of each actuator  through the differential is used for movement in both degrees of freedom, which effectively doubles the torque of the thumb in each direction as compared to single actuators. Specifically, the index finger structure  may be actuated toward or away from the palm of the hand assembly , wherein the movement path is similar to that of a human index finger while making or releasing a fist. The middle finger , ring finger , and pinky finger  of the MRP structure  are actuated by the MRP differential drive . Additionally, the middle finger , ring finger , and pinky finger  are actuated toward or away from the palm of the hand assembly , similar to the index finger structure . However, the middle finger , ring finger , and pinky finger  are each geared separately, such that the rate of movement of each is different, simulating human finger movement and making the hand assembly  more similar to a human hand than conventional prior art prosthetic devices.","Referring to , the hand assembly  is mounted on the wrist flexion assembly  via the hand interface , as shown in . Referring to , as the output arm  of the wrist flexion assembly  is actuated, the hand assembly  is also caused to move. The output arm  of the wrist flexion assembly  may be actuated pivotally about wrist flexion pivot axle , as shown in , moving the hand interface  to the left or right, and thus pivoting the hand assembly  in relation to the input support structure .","Referring back to , the wrist flexion assembly  is attached to the wrist rotator  via wrist flexion assembly interface , shown in . Referring to , when actuated, the wrist flexion assembly interface  is rotated about wrist shaft  in relation to  the wrist outer bearing carrier . Therefore, the wrist flexion assembly , and attached hand assembly  are also caused to rotate in reference to the wrist outer bearing carrier  by actuation of the wrist rotator . Therefore, the wrist rotator  allows the prosthetic arm apparatus  to move in rotation similar to a human wrist joint.","Referring back to , the wrist rotator  is attached to the elbow flexion assembly  via the wrist interface , shown in . Referring to , when the elbow flexion assembly  is actuated, the radial mount  is rotated about the axis of motor rotor . The wrist rotator , wrist flexion assembly , and hand assembly  are thus also caused to rotate about the axis of motor rotor  because they are attached at the wrist interface to the radial mount . Therefore, the elbow flexion joint  allows the prosthetic arm apparatus  to move similar to flexion extension of a human elbow joint.","Referring back to , the elbow flexion assembly  is attached to the humeral rotator  via the humeral mount , shown in . Referring to , actuation of the humeral rotator  causes the humeral mount  to rotate in relation to the outer bearing carrier  of the humeral rotator . Since the elbow flexion assembly , wrist rotator , wrist flexion  assembly , and hand assembly  are attached to the humeral mount , they are also caused to rotate in relation to the outer bearing carrier . This allows the prosthetic arm apparatus  to rotate to perform an arm wrestling motion.","Referring back to , the humeral rotator  is attached to the shoulder flexion assembly  through the humeral interface , shown in . Referring to , actuation of the shoulder flexion assembly  causes the main shoulder housing  to pivot about the center of the abductor interface . Since the humeral rotator , elbow flexion assembly , wrist rotator , wrist flexion assembly , and hand assembly  are attached to the main housing , they are also caused to rotate in relation to the abductor interface . Therefore, the shoulder flexion assembly  allows the prosthetic arm apparatus  to move along the torso simulating running motion.","Referring to , the shoulder flexion joint  is attached to the shoulder abductor  through the shoulder flexion assembly mount , shown in . Referring to , the shoulder abductor  is attached to a harness that is worn by the user via harness mount . When the shoulder abductor  is actuated in a positive direction, the shoulder flexion assembly mount  pivots away from the harness mount , and the user. Similarly, by actuating the shoulder abductor in a negative direction, the shoulder flexion assembly mount  is pivoted toward the harness mount  and the user. Since the shoulder flexion assembly , humeral rotator , elbow flexion assembly , wrist rotator , wrist flexion assembly , and hand assembly  are attached to shoulder abductor  at the flexion assembly mount , they are also caused to pivot with the shoulder flexion assembly mount .","One characteristic of the prosthetic arm apparatus described herein is that it provides the user with substantially the same movement capabilities and degrees of freedom of a human arm, including two degrees of freedom in shoulder functionality. Additionally, the modularity of each segment of the prosthetic arm apparatus  provides a significant advantage over conventional prosthetic devices. In particular, since each segment of the plurality of segments operates independently of each other segment of the plurality of segments, fewer segments may be used for less severe amputees. For example, a transhumeral amputee may have full shoulder functionality in the residuum, in which case the shoulder abductor  and shoulder flexion assembly  segments would be omitted from the prosthetic arm apparatus . The resulting prosthetic arm apparatus  would include the humeral rotator , the elbow flexion assembly , the wrist rotator , the wrist flexion assembly , and the hand assembly , wherein the humeral rotator  would be attached to the prosthetic harness. In some cases, the residuum of the transhumeral amputee may even have humeral rotation, in which case the prosthetic arm apparatus  may be further simplified to include only the elbow flexion assembly , the wrist rotator , the wrist flexion assembly  and the hand assembly , with the elbow flexion assembly  being attached to the prosthetic support apparatus. Similarly, for a transradial amputee, the prosthetic arm apparatus  may include only the wrist rotator , wrist flexion assembly  and the hand assembly , with the wrist rotator  being attached to the prosthetic support apparatus. Additionally, in some embodiments, the prosthetic arm apparatus  may be further simplified to include only the wrist flexion assembly  and the hand assembly  when the transradial amputee has wrist rotation in their residuum. In these embodiments, the wrist flexion assembly  may be attached to the prosthetic support apparatus. Thus, the modularity of each segment of the prosthetic arm apparatus  advantageously allows for customization of different prosthetic arm configurations for various users based on the differing degrees of amputation of each user.","A further advantage of the present invention is the use of non-backdriving clutches to preclude movement of the segments due to forces exerted on the prosthetic arm apparatus  when not in motion. These non-backdriving clutches may be particularly beneficial when the segments of the prosthetic arm apparatus  have different strength capacities so that the clutches for specific segments of the prosthetic arm apparatus  may lock those segments while other stronger segments are actuated to lift heavy objects. For instance, the non-backdriving clutch in the shoulder flexion assembly  may be used to lock out shoulder movement while the elbow flexion assembly  is actuated to lift a heavy object. The non-backdriving clutches may also advantageously conserve power since the non-backdriving clutches prevent motion without using power. Thus, the power to specific segments of the prosthetic arm apparatus  may be shut off, on a segment-by-segment basis, when not in use, since the non-backdriving clutches in those segments are locking out motion. Additionally, the non-backdriving clutches may also save power by allowing power to the entire prosthetic arm apparatus  to turned off whenever the arm is not in motion while maintaining the prosthetic arm apparatus  in a locked position.","An additional characteristic of the apparatus is that the hand assembly includes independently moving fingers and is capable of completing fine tasks such as pinching, grasping non-uniform objects, and lifting small objects off flat surfaces. Also, the tactile feedback sensor provides the user with feedback, during use of the prosthetic arm apparatus, such as the force of a grip. The apparatus also includes a cosmesis covering on the finger structures, which will be discussed in greater detail below, providing, amongst other things, grip for grasping objects. The rigid fingernail , shown in , which may be included on any of the finger structures, provides a backstop for the finger cover to enhance gripping capability. The rigid fingernail  also enhances gripping capability by anchoring the finger cover to the finger and allows the user to lift small objects from a surface with the prosthetic arm apparatus .","Referring to , wherein like numerals represent like elements, in some embodiments, the shoulder abductor  and the shoulder flexion assembly  shown in , may be integrated as a single shoulder unit , providing both degrees of freedom provided by the shoulder abductor  and shoulder flexion assembly  of . The single shoulder unit  includes a shoulder housing  pivotally connected to the harness mount , which allows the shoulder unit  to be connected to a prosthetic harness (not shown) as discussed above. In some embodiments, the shoulder housing  has a smooth outer surface  to shape the shoulder unit  to be similar to a human arm. The shoulder housing  is divided into a flexor portion  and an abductor portion , which are movable relative to one another. The flexor portion  of the shoulder housing  includes the humeral interface  for connecting the humeral rotator , shown in , to the shoulder unit . The abductor portion  of the shoulder housing  is pivotally connected to the harness mount , which allows the shoulder unit  to interface with a prosthetic harness (not shown) as discussed above.","Referring to , within the housing  is a shoulder flexion drive  for causing flexion motion of the flexor portion  about a shoulder flexion axis  and an abduction drive  for causing abduction motion of the shoulder housing  about an abduction axis . Additionally, the housing also defines an electronics compartment  for housing control systems and circuits for the integrated shoulder unit .","The shoulder flexion drive , in one embodiment, includes a shoulder flexion motor  having motor shaft  for driving the shoulder flexion motor pulley . The shoulder flexion motor pulley  drives the shoulder flexion belt , which, in turn, drives the shoulder flexion belt-driven pulley . The shoulder flexion belt-driven pulley  drives the wave generator  of a shoulder flexion harmonic drive gearing system , the output of which is fixedly interfaced with the abductor portion . Thus, as power is transmitted through the shoulder flexion drive  from the shoulder flexion motor  to the output of the harmonic drive gearing system , the flexor portion  rotates relative to the abductor portion  about the shoulder flexion axis . In some embodiments, the motor shaft  and the wave generator  are both hollow shafts to allow passage of an abductor motor shaft  and an abductor screw shaft , respectively, as will be discussed in greater detail below.","In the exemplary embodiment, the abduction drive  includes the abductor motor  for driving the abductor motor shaft . The abductor motor shaft  is configured to drive the abductor belt  about its distal end. The abductor belt , in turn, drives the abductor screw shaft , which has an abductor nut  threadedly coupled thereto. The abductor nut  is connected to the harness mount  through a linkage , which is, in some embodiments, a four bar linkage. As power is transmitted through the abductor drive  from the abductor motor  to the abductor screw shaft , the screw shaft  rotates. The rotation of the screw shaft  causes the abductor nut  to displace axially along the screw shaft , which causes pivotal motion of the shoulder housing  through the linkage  about the abduction axis .","Referring to , the relative movement between the flexor portion  and the abductor portion  provides the shoulder unit  with a first degree of freedom similar to that of the shoulder flexion joint  of . The abductor portion  of the shoulder housing  is pivotally connected to the harness mount  at the abductor joint , providing the shoulder unit with the second degree of freedom by allowing the shoulder housing  to pivot relative to the harness mount  in a similar manner to that discussed above in connection with the shoulder abductor  of . Referring to , the integrated shoulder unit  locates the shoulder flexion axis  and the abduction axis  relatively close to one another as compared to separate shoulder flexion and shoulder abduction assemblies, which provides for more intuitive motion that more closely simulates the movement of a human shoulder.","The shoulder flexion drive  and the abduction drive  discussed above include coaxial motors and coaxial shafts to minimize the size of the single shoulder unit  and to reduce the weight thereof. Thus, these exemplary single shoulder unit  is beneficial because its weight relative to the separate shoulder abductor  and shoulder flexion assembly , shown in . Additionally, the single shoulder unit  provides more narrow housing , which allows a more natural anatomical position of the shoulder for a broader range of users and may reduce bumping with the user's residuum during use. This embodiment has an additional benefit of decreasing the weight of the prosthetic. Additionally, as seen in , both the abduction motor  and the shoulder flexion motor  may be located in the vicinity of the electronics compartment , so the electronics for both the shoulder flexion drive  and the abduction drive  may be located in the same place, which eliminates any need to route wiring through the shoulder unit . This is advantageous since running wires across joints is a failure mode in which the wires may crimp and break when moved. Thus, the shoulder unit  eliminates this failure mode by eliminating wires running across the joints that could cause failure of the prosthetic arm .","Although the shoulder flexion drive  and the abduction drive  have been shown in an exemplary configuration, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that other drive configurations may also be used to drive the single shoulder unit  about the shoulder flexion axis  and the abduction axis . For instance, referring to , the shoulder flexion motor  and the abduction motor  of the single shoulder unit  do not need to be coaxial and they may still each be located within the housing  in the vicinity of the electronics compartment . Additionally, rather than driving the linkage , shown in , the worm drive  may instead threadably engage an abduction gear  coupled to the harness mount  to generate pivotal movement about the abduction axis .","Additionally, referring now to , in various embodiments, the integrated shoulder unit  may shift the abduction output to change the location of the harness mount (not shown) to improve mounting location and\/or to allow for ninety degrees (90\u00b0) of abduction about the abduction axis  without bumping with the residuum (not shown). For example, the location of the abduction output may be changed by extending the abduction drive  with one or more additional shafts, gears, and\/or belts.","Referring to , the flexion assembly mount  may also be shifted away from the harness mount  in the non-integrated shoulder abductor . Referring to , the flexion assembly mount  may also include an accommodating slot  adapted to accommodate portions of the abductor joint , shown in . Referring back to , the shifted flexion assembly mount  allows the user to orient the shoulder abductor  on the prosthetic support apparatus (not shown) in different orientations while still allowing a range of motion of the shoulder abductor  of at least approximately ninety degrees (90\u00b0). This may be particularly advantageous since the mounting orientation of the shoulder abductor  may vary from user to user, which may limit the range of abduction motion with the non-shifted flexion assembly mount , shown in . Additionally, in some embodiments, the shifted flexion assembly mount  may house a flex sensor plunger for detecting flexion motion of the shoulder flexion assembly .","Referring to , in some embodiments of the present invention, the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , may include a shoulder free swing system  including a housing  having a harness mount  fixedly secured thereto for attaching to a prosthetic harness. The shoulder free swing system  also includes an arm interface  rotatably secured within the housing  inside a bearing . The arm interface  includes mounting holes  for connecting the shoulder free swing system  to the shoulder unit , shown in , through the abduction axis  and the linkage , each shown in .","Referring to , within the housing , the arm interface  includes a substantially circular portion  that, at its outer circumference, engages the bearing . The substantially circular portion  includes a plurality of locking ramps  formed therein about its inner circumference and may also include one or more magnets  disposed at the outer portion of the locking ramps . Within the substantially circular portion , the shoulder free swing system  includes a plurality of locking plates , each of which has a rotation pin  secured to the housing  about which the locking plate  may pivot. The locking plates  include locking teeth  configured to engage the locking ramps  of the arm interface . The locking plates  also include cam followers  for engaging a cam plate  through cam paths . The cam plate  is connected to a handle  through an actuation plate , shown in . The handle  extends out of the housing , thereby allowing for user actuation thereof.","In operation, when the locking teeth  of the locking plates  are disengaged from the locking ramps  of the arm interface , as shown in , the arm interface  is able to freely rotate with respect to the harness mount , with its substantially circular portion  rotating within the bearing . However, when the user moves the handle  from the position shown in  to the position shown in , the actuation plate  rotates, which in turn rotates the cam plate  and causes the locking plates  to rotate until the locking teeth  engage the locking ramps  of the arm interface . The one or more magnets  may advantageously aid in the engagement by drawing the locking teeth  into the locking ramps  and by eliminating backlash. Once the locking teeth  are engaged in the locking ramps , the arm interface  is no longer able to freely move with respect to the harness mount , unless the handle  is returned to the position shown in . Thus, when the locking teeth  are engaged, the user may operate the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , in substantially the same manner as discussed above.","The slopes of the locking teeth , the locking ramps  and the cam paths  may advantageously be designed such that the locking teeth  will automatically become disengaged the from the locking ramps  if a torque being transmitted through the shoulder free swing system  is exceeds a maximum release torque. For example, in some embodiments the locking teeth  may disengage the locking ramps  if the torque being transmitted through the free swing system  exceeds fifty Newton meters. Thus, the shoulder free swing system  advantageously prevents excessive loading from being transmitted through the prosthetic device without permanently damaging any components of the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in .","Referring to , another embodiment of a shoulder free swing system  is shown. The shoulder free swing system  includes a housing  having a harness mount  fixedly secured thereto for attaching to a prosthetic harness. The shoulder free swing system  also includes an arm interface  rotatably secured within the housing . The arm interface  includes mounting holes  for connecting the shoulder free swing system  to the shoulder unit , shown in , through the abduction axis  and the linkage , each shown in .","Referring to , a portion  of the arm interface  is rotatably secured in the housing  within bearing . The portion  has a tapered surface  at its inner circumference that contacts a corresponding tapered surface  of a friction plate , thereby forming a tapered frictional interface between the arm interface  and the friction plate . Two or more breakaway locks  are loaded between the arm interface  and the friction plate , each breakaway lock  having a spring (not shown) that tends to separate the friction plate  from the arm interface . The friction plate  includes ball bearings  located within grooves  at its circumference that allow linear motion along an axis , but resist rotation due to an applied torque. The breakaway locks  and the geometry of the tapered surfaces  and  are configured so that the friction plate  and the portion  of the arm interface  separate at a desired applied torque, for example, fifty Newton meters, thereby allowing the arm interface  to slowly rotate while engaging the friction plate  at the tapered surface  to lower the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , until it loses its potential energy. To manually engage and\/or disengage the free swing system  The handle  may be rotated to move a ramp  linearly inward or outward along axis , thereby reengaging or disengaging, respectively, the breakaway locks  and, therefore, the free swing system .","Referring now to , another embodiment of the wrist rotator  is shown for providing improved electronic wiring capability to the prosthetic device. Although shown as the wrist rotator , it should be understood by those skilled in the art that a similar configuration may be used for other rotating joints, such as the humeral rotator , shown in . In this embodiment of the wrist rotator , the wrist rotator motor , including the wrist rotator motor armature  and a driven portion  of the wrist rotator motor rotor  having wrist rotator magnets  disposed thereon, and the wrist harmonic drive gearing system , including the wrist rotator harmonic drive gearing system wave generator , the wrist rotator harmonic drive gearing system flexspline  and the wrist rotator harmonic drive gearing system circular spline , are separated into coaxial side-by-side units with the wrist rotator motor  being proximate to the elbow interface  and the harmonic drive gearing system  being proximate to the wrist flexion assembly interface . By arranging the wrist rotator motor  and the wrist harmonic drive gearing system  in the side-by-side configuration, the electronics channel  passing through the center of the wrist rotator rotor  may be formed large enough to allow electronic wiring to be run internally through the center of the wrist rotator . Referring to , the wiring through the prosthetic arm , shown in , in some embodiments, may run through one or more extension springs , in particular around the flexion joints, such as the elbow flexion assembly  and the wrist flexion assembly , shown in , where internal wiring is difficult or impractical.","Routing the wiring through the center of the wrist rotator  eliminates the need for external wiring, thereby minimizing any flexing movement experienced by the wiring, which can cause wire pinching, abrasions and failure. The internal wiring also eliminates the possibility that external wiring will become caught on something and break. Routing the wiring through the one or more extension springs  where internal wiring is not practical, possible or desired allows for controlled loading of the external wiring and protects the wiring from pinching to reduce wire failure.","Referring to , in another embodiment of the wrist flexion assembly , the output arm  is able to move in flexion relative to the input support structure  about a flexion axis  and to move in ulnar-radial deviation relative to the input support structure  about a deviation axis . Thus, when the hand assembly , shown in , is attached to the output arm  of the wrist flexion assembly , the hand assembly , shown in , is able to move in both flexion and ulnar-radial deviation.","Referring to , the wrist flexion assembly  includes two wrist motors , for controlling the flexion and ulnar-radial deviation of the output arm , shown in . Each wrist motor  drives an input geartrain , which, in turn, drives a wrist worm gear . Each worm gear  drives an input gear  of a wrist differential . The wrist differential  includes a first bevel gears  and a second bevel gear  that are rotatable about the flexion axis . The first bevel gear  and the second bevel gear  may be driven by one of the input gears . The wrist differential  also includes a differential body  rotatably attached about the flexion axis  between the first and second bevel gears  and . An ulnar-radial axle  extends from one side of the differential body  along the ulnar-radial axis  and a third bevel gear  extends from the differential body  on the opposite side thereof. The third bevel gear  is rotatable about the ulnar-radial axis  and meshes with and is driven by the first bevel gear  and the second bevel gear .","In operation, the user is able to actuate wrist flexion, wrist ulnar-radial deviation and combinations thereof by actuating the motors  in various ways. For example, referring to , if the motors  are driven at the same speed in opposite directions, i.e. one is driven clockwise and the other counterclockwise, the output arm , shown in  will move in flexion in one direction about the flexion axis . If the direction of each motor is reversed, i.e. from spinning clockwise to counterclockwise and vice versa, the output arm , shown in , will flex in the opposite direction. Similarly, referring to , if the motors  are driven at the same speed in the same direction, i.e. both are driven clockwise, the output arm , shown in , will move in ulnar-radial deviation in one direction about the deviation axis . If the direction of each motor is reversed, i.e. from spinning clockwise to counterclockwise, the output arm , shown in , will move in ulnar-radial deviation in the opposite direction about the deviation axis . In addition to varying the direction of rotation of the motors , varying the speed of one motor  relative to the other will result in a combination of flexion and ulnar-radial deviation. Accordingly, in this embodiment, wrist flexion and ulnar-radial deviation may both be controlled simply by varying the direction and speed of the motors .","Although the wrist flexion assembly  is described as having a differential drive  for imparting wrist flexion and wrist ulnar-radial deviation movement to the output arm , it should be understood by those skilled in the art that other drives may be used to achieve similar capabilities. For instance, referring to , the wrist flexion assembly  may include a separate wrist flexion geartrain  for imparting flexion motion to the output arm  about the flexion axis  and a separate ulnar-radial geartrain  for imparting ulnar-radial deviation to the output arm  about the deviation axis .","Referring to , in another embodiment of the present invention, a wrist flexion assembly  is provided for imparting a combination of both flexion about the flexion axis  and ulnar-radial deviation about the deviation axis  to the hand assembly  in a single movement. The wrist flexion assembly  includes the input support structure  adapted to be connected to the wrist rotator , shown in , in the same manner as discussed above. The wrist support structure  includes a hand interface  proximate to the hand assembly  for attaching the hand assembly  to the wrist support structure . The wrist support structure  houses a wrist motor , shown in , which drives the wrist pivot axle  in rotary motion about the wrist flexion axis  through an appropriate gear train (not shown). The wrist pivot axle includes flattened end portions  at each end thereof, extending outwardly from the wrist support structure  and into the hand interface . Each flattened end portion  has two substantially parallel planar surface  extending parallel to the wrist flexion axis . The hand interface  includes a first cam bearing  fixedly secured to the wrist support structure  about the flattened end portion  of the wrist pivot axle  proximate to the thumb structure  of the hand assembly . The hand interface also includes a second cam bearing  fixedly secured to the wrist support structure  about the flattened end portion  of the wrist pivot axle  proximate to the pinky finger  of the hand assembly . Referring to , the first cam bearing  includes a first cam profile  formed therein. Referring to , the second cam bearing  includes a second cam profile  formed therein. Referring back to , the hand interface  also includes first and second slider blocks  coupling the hand assembly  to the wrist flexion assembly . The first and second slider blocks  each have a proximate end  at the hand interface  and a distal end  near the hand assembly . Each of the first and second slider blocks  has a slot  formed therein that slidably receives one of the flattened end portions  of the wrist pivot axle . The first and second slider blocks  include cam followers  at their proximate ends  that are received within the first cam profile  of the first cam bearing  and the second cam profile , shown in , of the second cam bearing . The first and second slider blocks  are pivotally coupled to the hand assembly  at their distal ends  about pivot axes .","In this embodiment, the hand assembly  may be angled away from the flexion axis  about a wrist rotation axis  to reduce the motion that the first cam profile  and the second cam profile  need to produce to achieve the desired combined flexion and ulnar-radial deviation movement of the hand assembly . In some embodiments, the hand assembly  is angled approximately thirty degrees clockwise (30\u00b0 clockwise) assuming left hand user perspective from the flexion axis .","Referring to , in operation, the wrist motor , shown in , drives the wrist pivot axle  in rotation movement about the flexion axis , which provides the hand assembly  with flexion movement. Additionally, the sliding engagement between the flattened end portions  of the wrist pivot axle  and the first and second slider blocks  causes the first and second slider blocks  to pivot about the flexion axis  as the wrist pivot axle  rotates. As the first and second slider blocks  pivot, the cam followers , shown in , follow the first cam profile , shown in , and the second cam profile , shown in , which causes the first and second slider blocks  to slide relative to the wrist pivot axle . This sliding motion of each of the first and second slider blocks  causes the hand assembly  to pivot about the pivot axes , shown in , which results in the ulnar-radial deviation movement of the hand assembly . Thus, as the wrist motor drives the wrist pivot axle , the hand assembly  moves from a first position , shown in , in which the hand is fully flexed and deviated in the ulnar direction, to a second position , shown in , which is a neutral position with respect to flexion movement but includes some degree of ulnar deviation. Then, the hand assembly  continues to move until it reaches a third position , shown in , in which the hand assembly  is fully extended about the flexion axis  and is also fully deviated in the radial direction.","Referring to , the first cam profile , shown in , and the second cam profile , shown in , provide for movement of the hand assembly , shown in , along a constrained flexion-deviation movement path  that includes components of both flexion motion and ulnar-radial deviation motion. The constrained flexion-deviation movement path  is advantageous because the user only needs to think about controlling a single degree of freedom, unlike the embodiments discussed above that provide independent wrist flexion movement and ulnar-deviation movement. Additionally, the constrained flexion-deviation movement path  is beneficial because it provides for full flexion movement and also provides for nearly full ulnar deviation without requiring full wrist flexion. Thus, functionality is particularly beneficial when users use the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , to pick up an object (not shown) from overhead. The constrained flexion-deviation movement path  also advantageously allows for approximately twenty-four degrees (24\u00b0) of flexion movement without significant ulnar deviation, which allows the user to move an object, such as a spoon, in flexion motion without spilling its contents. This range of flexion movement with minimal ulnar deviation provided by the constrained flexion-deviation movement path  may also be beneficial to compensate for offset in situations where the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , is mounted at an offset, for example, to avoid the user's residuum. Additionally, since the hand assembly , shown in , is angled in the neutral second position , shown in , pinching of the thumb structure , shown in , and index finger structure , shown in , are more in line with the wrist rotation axis , which makes various tasks easier for the user, such as turning a door knob, turning a key or the like. Thus, the constrained flexion-deviation movement path , or other similar paths, provided by the wrist flexion assembly , shown in , provides a variety of advantages over conventional prosthetic devices.","Additionally, in some embodiments, the flexion axis , shown in , may be shifted from its neutral position to provide various benefits. For example, the flexion axis , shown in , is shifted approximately thirty degrees (30\u00b0) from its neutral position. This shift provides a prosthetic hand attached to the wrist flexion assembly , shown in , with a more natural appearance and may aid in positioning the hand for various tasks, such as turning a door knob, turning a key or the like.","Although described in terms of constrained flexion-deviation movement path , shown in , it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the first cam profile , shown in , and the second cam profile, shown in , may be formed in various configurations to achieve a variety of different constrained movement paths. Additionally, although the constrained flexion-deviation movement path  has been described in connection with the wrist flexion assembly , the constrained flexion-deviation movement path  may also be commanded using the flexion assembly , shown in , by programming the prosthetic controller to actuate the motors , shown in , to move the prosthetic hand assembly  along the same constrained flexion-deviation path .","Referring to , in some embodiments, a compound motion assembly  may be provided to impart two-axis motion to the various segments discussed herein. The compound motion assembly  includes an input member , an output member  and an intermediate member . The input member  is movably coupled to the intermediate member  through a first joint  and the output member  is movably coupled to the intermediate member  through a second joint  such that the first joint  and the second joint  are arranged in series between the input member  and the output member  with the intermediate member arranged therebetween.","The input member  includes an input interface  at one end thereof, two support posts  extending outwardly from the input interface to the first joint  and a path member  secured to the support posts  at the first joint . The input interface  has bolt holes  or similar connection means to allow the input member  to be secured to an adjacent segment of the prosthetic device , shown in , at the input interface . The support posts  are spaced apart from one another at a sufficient distance to accommodate the intermediate member  therebetween, as will be discussed in greater detail below. The path member  forms an arch extending over the intermediate member  and connecting one of the support posts  to the other support post .","Referring to , the path member  includes an outer surface  and an inner surface  that are both substantially spherically shaped to ensure clearance between the path member  and the output member  and the path member  and the intermediate member , respectively. The path member  also includes a base portion  at each end thereof for interfacing with the support posts , shown in . Each base portion  includes mounting holes  for fastening the path member  to the support posts , shown in . The path member  has a fixed path profile  formed therethrough and extending along at least a portion of the arch of the path member  between the two base portions . The fixed path profile  has a curvature that is selected to define the compound motion of the output member  relative to the input member , as will be discussed in greater detail below. The fixed path profile  may be asymmetrical, as shown, or may instead be symmetrical depending upon the desired compound motion.","Referring back to , as discussed above, the path member  is preferably a separate element fixedly secured to the support posts  so that the path member  may advantageously be removed and replaced as will be discussed below. However, those skilled in the art should understand that the path member  may instead be integrally formed as part of the input member .","Referring to , the intermediate member  of the compound motion assembly  is pivotally coupled to the input member  at the first joint , such that the intermediate member  pivots about a first axis  of the first joint . The intermediate member is suspended between the support posts  and between the input interface  and the path member  by the first joint  to ensure clearance as the intermediate member  pivots. The intermediate member  is coupled to the output member  at the second joint  such that the output member is able to pivot about a second axis  defined by the second joint . In some embodiments, the first joint  and the second joint  are arranged relative to one another such that the first axis  and the second axis  are substantially coplanar, while in other embodiments, the first axis  and the second axis  may not be substantially coplanar. The intermediate member  may have a spherical shape at the end proximate the path member  to ensure clearance between the intermediate member  and the path member .","Referring to , in some embodiments, the intermediate member  may include a housing  enclosing a drive arrangement  for actuating the compound motion assembly . The drive arrangement  includes a motor  coupled to an output shaft  through a gear train, which may include one or more reduction gears , a strain wave gearing system having a circular spline , a wave generator , a wave generator bearing  and a flex spline  or any other similar gearing system for transmitting torque from the motor  to the output shaft . The output shaft  extends outwardly through both sides of the housing  and is rotatable supported therein by bearings . Each end of the output shaft  is secured to the output member  to form the second joint , shown in , with the second axis  being the axis of rotation of the output shaft . Securing the output shaft  at each end to the output member  provides increased torque to the output member  when the drive arrangement  is actuated. However, in some embodiments, the output member  may only be secured to the output shaft  at one end thereof, thereby simplifying the drive arrangement . In these embodiments, the other end of the output shaft  may support the output member  rotatably thereon.","Referring to , power to the motor  is preferably supplied through a circuit board  secured within housing . The circuit board  may include a shaft position sensor  disposed thereon for monitoring movement of the output shaft . For instance, the shaft position sensor  may be an optical sensor having an infrared emitter and receiver that transmits infrared light at a reflective cam surface  fixed to the output shaft  and receives the reflected light signal, thereby enabling position detection. The circuit board  may also include a temperature sensor (not shown) for monitoring the temperature of the motor  to ensure safe operation. The circuit board  may be connected to an external controller (not shown) for supplying power and control to the motor  and for receiving and processing position signals from the shaft position sensor  and the temperature sensor (not shown). In some embodiments, a single cable (not shown) may be used to connect the circuit board  to the controller (not shown). This single cable (not shown) may reduce cable flex as the compound motion assembly  actuates, thereby reducing cable failure, which may result in possible damage to the compound motion assembly  or any components connected thereto. Preferably, the controller (not shown) shorts the motor  when the compound motion assembly  is not being actuated to prevent back-driving of the compound motion assembly , which may also result in possible damage to the compound motion assembly  or any components connected thereto.","Referring back to , the output member  includes two output arms , each secured to one end of the output shaft , shown in , and extending outwardly past the path member  to an output interface . The two output arms  are connected by a follower member  having an extension  that is accommodated within the fixed path profile  of the path member . The extension  may be, for example, a cam bearing for slidably engaging the fixed path profile , as will be discussed below. Preferably, the follower member  is removably coupled to the output arms  by bolts  or the like. The output interface  includes bolt holes  or similar connection means to allow the output member  to be secured to an adjacent segment of the prosthetic device , shown in , at the output interface . For example, referring to , the compound motion assembly  may be implemented as a prosthetic wrist having the hand assembly  mounted to the output interface . Preferably, when implemented as a prosthetic wrist, the cosmesis , shown in , would also extend over the compound motion assembly  to protect the moving components of the compound motion assembly  from contamination due to dirt of the like.","Referring to , in operation, as the motor , shown in , is actuated, the output shaft , shown in , turns causing pivotal movement of the output member  at the second joint  about the second axis . As the output member  pivots at the second joint , the extension  of the output member  slides within the fixed path profile . As the extension  slides within the fixed path profile , the curvature of the fixed path profile  moves the extension  laterally causing pivotal movement of the intermediate member  relative to the input member  at the first joint . This pivotal movement also results in pivotal movement of the output member  about the first axis  of the first joint  since the output member  is attached to the intermediate member . Thus, the compound motion assembly  provides compound motion of the output interface  relative to the input interface  about both the first axis  and the second axis  using a single motor , shown in . Therefore, the compound motion assembly  requires only a single degree of freedom as a control input, which reduces the cognitive burden on the user while still providing a complex output movement.","As discussed above, the fixed path profile  has a curvature that is selected to define the compound motion of the output member  relative to the input member . Referring to , the fixed path profile , shown in , produces compound motion path  having pivotal movement about both the first axis  and the second axis . It should be understood by those skilled in the art that the fixed path profile  may be changed to produce alternative motion paths , depending upon the desired movement of the output interface , shown in . Thus, when the compound motion assembly , shown in , is used with a prosthetic hand , shown in , the fixed path profile  may be formed to provide the flexion-deviation movement path , shown in , having all of the advantages discussed above in connection therewith. Alternatively, the fixed path profile  may instead be formed to provide the hand assembly , shown in , with an alternative movement path  having another advantageous path of movement for different user needs.","Referring back to , as discussed above, the path member  is preferably removably attached to the support posts . This advantageously allows the path member  to be easily removed from the compound motion assembly  and replaced if damaged or if an alternative motion path , shown in , is desired for the output interface . Thus, the compound motion assembly  may advantageously be reprogrammed for different uses or different users by the swapping of a single part. Additionally, when implemented as a prosthetic wrist, as shown in , the compound motion assembly  may be switched from a right handed to left handed prosthetic wrist, and vice versa, by changing only the path member  and the output arms , each of which is advantageously removably attached to the compound motion assembly for easy removal and installation.","Referring to , in some embodiments, the compound motion assembly  and any metal structure secured thereto, such as hand assembly , shown in , may be incorporated into a first antenna  for communication between the arm control module (ACM) stack  and an external device such as a control unit for the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in . The compound motion assembly  forms a radiating element  of the first antenna  and a first printed circuitboard  of the ACM stack  connected to the radiating element  provides the remainder of the antenna .","Referring to , the compound motion assembly  includes a grounding disc  at the interface with the ACM stack , shown in , that electrically isolates the radiating element  from the first printed circuitboard . A screw connection  passes through the grounding disc  to allow the printed circuitboard  to be secured thereto with a screw (not shown). The screw connection  advantageously facilitates both a mechanical connection between the printed circuitboard  and the radiating element  as well as an electrical connection between the radiating element  and the antenna matching network circuit on the printed circuitboard .","Thus, referring to , the compound motion assembly , as well as any metal structure secured thereto, provides the radiating element  for the first antenna , while the rest of the electrical components of the first antenna  may be housed on the printed circuitboard . In some embodiments, the impedance of the compound motion assembly , as well any metal structure secured thereto, is matched to that of the transceiver of the printed circuitboard  to provide for efficient energy transfer. By providing the entire compound motion assembly , and any metal structure attached thereto, as the radiating element , with its impedance matched to that of the transceiver, the first antenna  necessarily provides a better and more robust antenna than substantially any antenna that could be housed within the wrist structure itself. Therefore, the first antenna  may advantageously be implemented as the primary communication channel for the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , transferring critical commands, such as commands relating to prosthetic movement, to and from the ACM stack , shown in . Additionally, due to the size of the radiating element , the signaling to and from the first antenna  is less susceptible to multi-path interference, which often presents a significant problem for short-range communications within buildings due to signal reflections and the like.","Although multi-path interference is not a significant problem for the first antenna  due to the size of the radiating element , it may, in some embodiments, be a problem for short-range communications within buildings. In particular, typical short-range communication frequencies, for example, approximately 2.5 GHz, do not typically pass through human torsos. Additionally, signal reflection within a building may result in signals that are the same, except 180 degrees out of phase, being received by an antenna, which causes the signals randomly and periodically to completely cancel.","Accordingly, referring to , a second antenna  for overcoming the transmission issues associated with in-building interference may be formed entirely on a second printed circuitboard  of the ACM stack , shown in . The second antenna  includes a first chip antenna  and a second chip antenna  mounted on the printed circuitboard  at an angle of approximately 90 degrees relative to one another. The first chip antenna  and the second chip antenna  are connected to a transceiver , shown in , of the second antenna  through a combiner  that passively combines signals received by the first and second chip antennas  and  by taking only the stronger of the two signals. In some embodiments, the combiner  may be a 90 degree phase combiner, while in other embodiments the combiner may include some other phase angle. Additionally, although the first and second chip antennas  and  have been described as being offset approximately 90 degrees relative to one another, one skilled in the art should understand that the first and second chip antennas  and  may be offset at other angles to suit some other need while still achieving substantially the same benefit as that achieved with the 90 degree offset.","The offset angle between the first chip antenna  and the second chip antenna  advantageously allows the second antenna  to mitigate multi-path interference by capturing signals in different phase angles. Thus, the second antenna  may advantageously provide the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , with a secondary antenna for less critical signals where some interference is acceptable. For example, the second antenna  may be used for calibration of the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , via a personal computer or for downloading data logs from the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , to the personal computer. Thus, while some embodiments of the present invention may implement only the first antenna , shown in , or the second antenna , other embodiments may implement both the first and second antennas  and  to cooperate and provide a more robust communication system.","Although described herein in the context of a prosthetic arm and prosthetic hand, it should be understood that the antennas described herein may be used for communication in various other devices and are not necessarily limited to use in a prosthetic arm\/prosthetic hand.","Referring to , in some embodiments, compound motion assembly  may include a path member  having the fixed path profile  formed on each peripheral edge thereof. In this embodiment, the output member  includes two extensions , each extension  engaging one of the fixed path profiles . This embodiment operates in substantially the same manner as the embodiments discussed above. However, this embodiment may advantageously provide for a more compact compound motion assembly .","Referring back to , although described in connection with the detailed embodiments herein, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the compound motion assembly  may advantageously be implemented in various industrial and manufacturing environments, or the like. Thus, the compound motion assembly may provide equipment and\/or machinery having complex compound motion paths , shown in , controlled through simplified single degree of freedom inputs. In these embodiments, the compound motion assembly  may be scaled up or down in size to meet specific or desired requirements. Additionally, path members  may be swapped in and out to alter the compound motion path , shown in . The input interface  may advantageously be secured to a floor, a table or similar workstation to provide a fixed frame of reference from which the output interface  is actuated. Additionally, the output interface  may advantageously be adapted to accommodate various industrial or manufacturing tools thereon.","Still referring to , although the compound motion assembly  has been described as having a drive arrangement , shown in , for actuating the compound motion assembly , some embodiments of the present invention may not be powered, thereby simplifying the compound motion assembly  by eliminating the drive arrangement , shown in FIG. . For example,  shows an embodiment of a non-powered compound motion assembly . The compound motion assembly  may be moved by hand and locked in a desired position through the use of a brake , or the like. Additionally, some non-powered embodiments of the compound motion assembly  may include a handle  to provide for easier manual actuation of the compound motion assembly .","Referring to  and , in various embodiments, the non-backdriving clutch  may replace spacers of the input cage  with springs  between the rollers . The springs  push the rollers  apart and into contact with both the race  and the output polygon , which may be an output hex . Thus, when a backdriving torque (not shown) is applied to the output hex  to friction lock the rollers  between the output hex  and the bearing race , the rollers  are already contacting both the race  and the output hex , thereby substantially eliminating backlash, i.e. a slight rotation of the output polygon , when the backdriving torque (not shown) is applied. Thus, the non-backdrivable clutch  imparts a frictional lock, which additional backdriving torque (not shown) through the output hex  will not overcome. Additionally, as discussed above in connection with , in various embodiments, the non-backdriving clutch  may unlock itself through the application of an input load through the input cage . Variations of this embodiment may include, but are not limited to, additional or fewer springs , additional or fewer rollers  or a differently shaped race . For example, in various embodiments, the relative position of the output hex  and the race  may be shifted, i.e., rather than the hollow, circular race  with the output polygon  inside, in various embodiments, the clutch may include an outer hollow output polygon surrounding a circular race. Additionally, although shown as a coil spring, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the springs  may be formed in various configurations and\/or from a variety of metal or elastomeric materials to provide the force for separating the rollers .","Referring to , in some embodiments, the non-backdriving clutch  may be integrated in combination with a gearbox  within a single gearbox housing . In this embodiment, the gearbox  may include an input  for engaging and being driven by a motor (not shown) and an output  that transmits torque from the motor (not shown) to the associated prosthetic joint or segment. For example, the combination gearbox  may be used for the two thumb drives , the index drive  and the MRP drive , all shown in , so that these drives may be assembled and disassembled as a single unit. This advantageously allows sensitive clutch components to be isolated and protected within a single housing . Additionally, this allows the gearbox  to built separately with the clutch  and gearbox  therein and later assembled into the hand assembly , shown in , as will be discussed below.","Referring to , in some embodiments, the hand assembly  may include a plurality of self-contained subassemblies  to advantageously make assembly and\/or disassembly of the hand assembly  easier. The self-contained subassemblies  may be built in parallel and then quickly assembled into the full hand assembly . The self-contained subassemblies  may include, for example, the thumb drives , the index drive  and the MRP drive , each of which may include the integrated gearbox  and clutch , shown in . The self-contained subassemblies  may also include a first MRP differential  and a second MRP differential  that may be fully assembled as complete units and easily dropped into the hand assembly . The self-contained subassemblies  may also include the thumb assembly , the thumb differential  as well as each of the index finger , middle finger , ring finger  and pinky finger . This advantageously allows the four finger subassemblies to be assembled as complete units and then assembled into the hand assembly  and retained therein using a single pin . Thus, the plurality of self-contained subassemblies  may advantageously make assembly and\/or disassembly of the hand assembly  easier and may reduce build time, since each self-contained subassembly  may be completed separately and simultaneously.","Still referring to , in some embodiments, the index finger structure  may include a base portion  and a tip portion , which are connected in a pivotal connection at a knuckle joint . The base portion  connects to the hand assembly  through a pin hole  and includes a gear segment  fixedly connected at its lower end, which interfaces with the index drive  to allow for controlled movement of the base portion  about the pin .","Referring to , within the index finger structure  is disposed a two-part linkage element  that includes a non-circular pin hole  at its lower end and pivot bar  at its distal end. The pivot bar  connects to the tip portion  at an offset location from the knuckle joint . The non-circular pin hole  is disposed adjacent to the pin hole  and allows the pin  to pass therethough when the index finger structure  is assembled to the hand assembly , with a corresponding non-circular portion , shown in , of the pin  engaging the non-circular pin hole . In operation, when actuated, the index drive  drives the base portion  of the index finger structure  through the gear segment . As the base portion  moves, the two-part linkage  remains grounded due to contact between the non-circular pin hole  with the non-circular portion  of the pin . This, in turn, causes the pivot bar  to move the tip portion  relative to the base portion , thereby achieving the movement of the index structure  that is kinematically deterministic. Since the grounding of the two-part linkage  is achieved through insertion of the pin , it may advantageously be accomplished at essentially any point during assembly of the hand assembly . Additionally, it also advantageously allows the index structure  to be replaced without requiring disassembly of the hand assembly  or a substantial part thereof.","Referring to , an embodiment for output load sensing through a drive  having a worm gear , such as the shoulder abduction drive  of , is shown. Including one or more worm gears  in the drive  is beneficial because the worm gear  may itself prevent backdriving. The worm gear  may be arranged on a splined shaft  between a first spring  and a second spring . The splined shaft includes a plurality of splines  arranged axially around the surface of the splined shaft  and a shaft input  portion, which may be rotated directly by a motor (not shown) or through a gear train or the like. The worm gear  is tubular and has an interior surface  designed to slidably interface with the splines  of the splined shaft  such that the worm gear  may slide axially along the surface of the splined shaft . The worm gear  meshes with an output gear  such that when the splined shaft  is caused to rotate through its shaft input portion , the splined shaft  rotatably drives the worm gear  through the splines  which, in turn, drives the output gear . When a load (not shown) is applied to the drive through the output gear , for example, if the user is lifting an object, the load will generate a torque T at the output gear . Although the torque T will not cause the worm gear  to rotate, the torque T may cause the worm gear  to displace axially along the splined shaft  compressing one of the first spring  or the second spring , depending upon the direction of displacement. Thus, by designing the drive system  with the first spring  and the second spring  of known spring constants, the compliance, i.e. the displacement of the worm gear , may be measured to estimate the output load (not shown). This drive system  for output load sensing is particularly beneficial since the compliance is still present or active while the worm gear  is not being rotated, but is instead acting as a non-backdriving element.","The prevention of backdriving with the various systems discussed above is beneficial because it allows the user to maintain a position of the prosthetic arm , shown in , while under a load (not shown). However, referring to , in some embodiments, it may be desirable to provide the various arm segments with break-away mechanisms  that will separate the drive output from the drive input to prevent damage to the drive system if the load becomes too large. The break-away mechanism  may include an input shaft , an output shaft  and two break-away spacers  that are held in contact with the input shaft  and output shaft  by a compression member . The input shaft  and the output shaft  each include a shaft body  and a torque transmission tab  extending axially outward from the shaft body  between the break-away spacers . The compression element member  surrounds the break-away spacers  and sandwiches the torque transmission tabs  therebetween. The compression member  may be, for example, a snap ring, a round metal ring, an o-ring, multiple o-rings, a coil spring, or the like. The compression member  applies a preset compressive force to the breakaway spacers .","In operation, the input shaft  of the break-away mechanism  is rotated by a motor (not shown) or the like to generate a desired movement of the prosthetic arm , shown in . Thus, the torque transmission tab  of the input shaft  rotates and transmits the rotation through the break-away spacers  to the torque transmission tab  of the output shaft  as long as the torque required to cause rotation of the torque transmission tab  of the output shaft  is not large enough to overcome the preset compressive force provided by the compression member . If the torque is large enough to overcome the preset compressive force, the torque transmission tab  will push the break-away spacers  apart and the torque transmission tab  will rotate between the break-away spacers  without transmitting torque therethrough. Thus, the break-away mechanism  may prevent torque above a preset level from being transmitted through the drive system, where it can damage the drive system components. Accordingly, the break-away mechanism  may limit the amount of torque applied to sensitive parts of the various drive systems of the prosthetic arm , shown in , and may, therefore, impart a longer lifespan on the prosthetic arm.","Referring to , another embodiment of a breakaway mechanism  includes an input ring  and an output ring  connected by a detent ring . The breakaway mechanism  may be connected between two prosthetic arm segments, for example, the input ring  may be connected to the shoulder unit , shown in , and the output ring  may be connected to the humeral rotator , shown in . Referring to , in some embodiments, the input ring , output ring  and the detent ring  each includes an alignment marker  on its outer surface  to indicate proper positioning of the breakaway mechanism .","Referring to , the output ring  includes a central hub  having an outer surface  with a plurality of spring fingers  radiating therefrom. Each spring finger  has a first detent  and a second detent  along its length and a pin  at its distal end . The input ring  includes a plurality of detents  around the circumference of its inner surface , within which the pins  of the spring fingers  may engage, as will be discussed in greater detail below. The detent ring  includes a plurality of detent pins  located partway between the inner surface  of the input ring  and the outer surface  of the output ring . The detent pins  engage the first detents  of the spring fingers  during normal operation of the breakaway mechanism , i.e. when torque is being transmitted through the breakaway mechanism .","However, referring to , if an overtorque situation occurs, the pins  at the distal ends  of the spring fingers  will pop out of the ring detents  so that the torque will not be transmitted back to the input ring . Additionally, referring to , the overtorque situation will also cause the alignment markers  to move out of alignment. The user may then realign the alignment markers  to transmit torque through the breakaway mechanism .","Referring to , the user may also intentionally disengage the torque transmission by moving the alignment marker  on the detent ring  up to engage the breakaway mechanism  in freeswing. As seen in , this configuration entirely disengages the spring fingers  from the input ring , thereby allowing the output ring  to rotate freely without driving the upstream components through the input ring . Thus, this embodiment of the breakaway mechanism  is advantageous because it also allows for the user to engage freeswing of the prosthetic arm , shown in .","These break-away mechanisms discussed above are beneficial because they prevent damage to the prosthetic arm apparatus  and increase user safety under high loading situations. Additionally, the break-away mechanisms are advantageous in that once the break-away mechanisms break under high loading, they may be reset by the user without the need to see a prosthetic technician.","As discussed above, various embodiments of the prosthetic arm , shown in , include feedback mechanisms for compliance and position sensing, such as potentiometer , shown in . Referring now to , in some embodiments, the prosthetic arm , shown in , may include other feedback mechanisms, for example, a magnetic position sensor . In these embodiments, at least one magnetic strip  may be attached about the circumference of an inner surface  of a rotatable drive component . The magnetic strip  includes a plurality of magnets  of known length L arranged in series, each having a north pole N and a south pole S. Thus, the magnetic strip  generates a magnetic field having a repeating pattern of alternating north poles N and south poles S. The magnetic position sensor  is arranged to detect this magnetic field generated by the magnetic strip . In operation, the rotatable drive component  rotates, which causes the magnetic strip  to rotate, thereby moving the portion of the magnetic strip  being detected by the magnetic position sensor . The magnetic position sensor  detects this change in the magnetic field as the magnetic strip  rotates from each north pole N to each south pole S and vice versa. Since the length L of each magnet  is known, the detected changes in the magnetic field between each north pole N and\/or each south pole S may be converted into the distance of rotational movement of the rotatable drive component . Thus, the change in position of the rotatable drive component  may be detected. The magnetic position sensor  is also advantageous because it does not contact the rotating drive component  and, therefore, will not experience contact wear due to the rotation of the rotatable drive component .","Referring to , in some embodiments, two magnetic position sensors  may be used to detect the magnetic fields generated by the first magnetic strip  and a second magnetic strip  arranged next to each other around the circumference of the inner surface  of a rotatable drive component . A length L of each magnet  of the second magnetic strip  is, in some embodiments, different than the length L of the magnets of the first magnetic strip . This difference in length allows for the magnetic position sensors  to sense unique combinations of magnetic field values from the first magnetic strip  and the second magnetic strip  over the circumference of the inner surface . Each unique magnetic field value may correspond to a position of the drive component  and, therefore, absolute position of the drive component  may be detected by the two magnetic position sensors .","In practice, the hand assembly , shown in , and particularly, the fingers of the hand assembly , i.e. the thumb structure , index finger structure , middle finger , ring finger  and pinky finger , all shown in , come into contact with objects frequently and, therefore, may be susceptible to wear and damage. Thus, referring to , it may be desirable for the prosthetic hand assembly  to include removable fingers . In this embodiment of the prosthetic hand assembly , the removable fingers  may be removed to allow for easier replacement of damaged fingers  and also, to allow for easily customizable or tailored finger lengths for different user.","Each removable finger  is driven in substantially the same manner as the fingers of the previously discussed embodiments. However, the removable fingers  pivot about a common finger shaft , rather than the individual pivot axles discussed in connection with . In some embodiments, end caps  cover each end of the common finger shaft  to prevent dirt or other contaminants from getting into the gear trains of the hand assembly  and also to ensure that the common finger shaft  does not become axially displaced unintentionally. In operation, either end cap  may be removed from the hand assembly  and the common finger shaft  may be extracted to free the removable fingers . Each finger  may then be removed and replaced individually, as required.","As discussed above, the fingers  of the hand assembly  come into contact with objects frequently and are, therefore, susceptible to wear. Thus, referring to , some embodiments of the present invention may include a cosmesis  for covering the hand assembly  to reduce wear of the hand assembly  and the fingers , in particular. The cosmesis  may be formed from silicone or a similar material, such as a urethane, to improve the grip capabilities of the hand assembly  to assist with the various grasping and pinch functions of the hand, thereby, providing additional functionality.","In use, the cosmesis  may wear more quickly around the fingers  and the thumb structure . Therefore, in some embodiments the cosmesis  may separate into two or more sections to allow high wear areas to be replaced more frequently than low wear areas. For instance, referring to , in some embodiments, the cosmesis  includes a separate palm section  covering the hand support , finger sections  covering each finger  and a thumb section  covering the thumb structure . Thus, the finger sections  and thumb section  may each be replaced separately from the palm section . Although shown as having separate finger sections  and thumb section , in various embodiments, the cosmesis  may also include only two sections, for example, the finger sections  and the thumb section  may be combined into one section and the hand support  may be covered by the separate palm section .","Referring to , in some embodiments of the present invention, the fingers  may be provided with geometric features , such as slots, in their outer surfaces  that may accept corresponding geometric interlocks  provided on the inner surface  of the cosmesis . This interlocking geometry may resist shear loads on the cosmesis , thereby preventing the cosmesis  from slipping off of the fingers . Additionally, with respect to the hand cosmesis, fine pinch and other functions may require a structural backing at the tips of the fingers  and thumb structure . Therefore, in some embodiments, the geometric features  of the fingers  and thumb structure  may each include a fingernail apparatus , shown in . The fingernail apparatus , shown in , interacts with the finger and thumb structure cosmesis  to anchor the cosmesis  of the fingers  and thumb structure , thereby mitigating and\/or preventing the cosmesis  from rolling over on the tips of the fingers  and thumb structure .","Referring to , the palm section  of the cosmesis  may also be formed to resist slippage due to shear loads. For instance, a palm side  of the cosmesis  may be formed with a tacky inner surface . In some embodiments, the material of the cosmesis  itself will provide the tacky inner surface , for example, silicone or a urethane material may be naturally tacky. In other embodiments, a tacky surface coating may be applied to the cosmesis to form the tacky inner surface . Thus, as objects being held are pressed against the palm side  of the cosmesis , the tacky inner surface  is pressed against the hand support , shown in , thereby resisting slippage. In some embodiments, a back side  of the cosmesis  is formed with a slippery inner surface  to facilitate installation and removal of the cosmesis . For example, the slippery inner surface  may be formed by applying a surface modifying coating to the cosmesis, or applying a surface texture to the cosmesis . For example, to install the cosmesis  onto the hand support , shown in , the cosmesis  may be pulled down and away from the palm so that the slippery inner surface  of the back side  slides along the hand support , while the tacky inner surface  of the palm side  is pulled away from the hand support . Thus, the cosmesis  may be easily slid onto the hand support . To remove the cosmesis , the palm side  may again be pulled away from the hand support  while the cosmesis  is pulled toward the fingers , thereby allowing the cosmesis  to slide easily off the hand support .","Referring to , in some embodiments, the cosmesis  may include corrugations  having grooves  wherein a thickness of the material forming the cosmesis  is substantially less than the thickness of material of the rest of the cosmesis . The corrugations  and grooves  may advantageously be positioned in locations where the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , moves and flexes to allow the cosmesis  to flex along with the arm movement without bunching, wrinkling, tearing or the like. Additionally, although the corrugations  are shown only in a wrist area for simplicity, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the corrugations  may be positioned in other locations where substantial movement is anticipated such as the fingers. In some embodiments, the cosmesis  may also include raised ridges  having a material thickness that is greater than substantially the rest of the cosmesis  to provide improved grip in desired regions such as at the fingertips of the cosmesis .","Referring to , in some embodiments, the fingers  may include one or more additional functions. For example, one or more fingers  may include a thermal sensor  disposed thereon to determine the temperature of an object (not shown) brought into contact with the finger . The signal from the sensor  may be transmitted to a controller (not shown) for the prosthetic arm  and displayed to the user as will be discussed in greater detail below. In some embodiments, temperature detection may be provided by forming the cosmesis , or a portion thereof, from a temperature sensitive polymer, such as a polymer with a thermochromic color changing additive therein or thermochromic liquid crystal that allows a variety of colors to be shown as temperature changes, which will change color depending upon the temperature of the cosmesis . For example, the cosmesis  may change from one color to another if a present temperature is exceeded. This temperature sensing functionality may be used to determine the temperature of an object (not shown) in the hand  and to warn the user of a high temperature or low temperature condition to mitigate the threat of burns or other harm.","Referring to , another embodiment of the thumb structure  is shown for providing thumb compliance detection. The thumb structure includes a thumb base  and a thumb tip , which are each substantially rigid and are joined together by an elastomeric spring . In some embodiments, the interface between the thumb tip  and the elastomeric spring  includes one or more alignment features  to ensure proper alignment of the thumb tip  with the elastomeric spring . Similarly, the interface between the thumb base  and the elastomeric spring  also includes one or more alignment features  to ensure proper alignment of the thumb base  and the elastomeric spring .","Referring to , within the thumb structure , the thumb base  includes a pivotal interface tube  extending upward into a central bore  of the elastomeric spring . A pivot shaft , having a magnet  disposed at its lower end , is arranged with the pivotal interface tube  and extends upwardly therefrom into a central bore  in the thumb tip  of substantially the same diameter as the pivot shaft . Below the pivot shaft  within the thumb base  is arranged a Hall effect sensor  on a sensor bracket . The sensor bracket  includes a wire channel  to facilitate wiring the Hall effect sensor  to the prosthetic control circuits (not shown). Referring to , in operation, when a load L is applied to the thumb tip  the elastomeric spring  compresses on the side of the thumb structure  opposite the applied load L, allowing the thumb tip  to tilt. The tilt of the thumb tip  causes a corresponding tilt of the pivot shaft  within the pivotal interface tube , thereby displacing the magnet  disposed on the lower end  of the pivot shaft . The Hall effect sensor  detects this displacement of the magnet , which can be correlated to the applied load L on the thumb tip . By detecting the various loads on the thumb structure , the user may ensure that objects are not gripped so hard that they could break and that the thumb is not subjected to loads that could cause failure of the thumb structure .","Referring to , wherein like numerals represent like elements, another embodiment of the thumb structure  is shown for providing thumb compliance detection. In this embodiment, a helical spring  replaces the elastomeric spring , shown in , between the thumb base  and the thumb tip . Additionally, a collar  is disposed between the helical spring  and the pivot shaft  with a small clearance between a ball  of the pivot shaft and the collar . As with the previous embodiments, the pivot shaft  has magnet  disposed at its lower end  and extends upwardly therefrom into a central bore  in the thumb tip  and is secured therein. Below the pivot shaft  within the thumb base  is arranged sensor  for detecting movement of the magnet . In operation, when a load L is applied to the thumb tip , the ball  contacts the collar  and the helical spring  compresses on the side of the thumb structure  opposite the applied load L, allowing the thumb tip  to tilt about the center of the ball . The tilt of the thumb tip  causes a corresponding tilt of the pivot shaft , thereby displacing the magnet  disposed on the lower end  of the pivot shaft . The sensor  detects this displacement of the magnet , which can be correlated to the applied load L on the thumb tip . By detecting the various loads on the thumb structure , the user may advantageously ensure that objects are not gripped so hard that they could break and that the thumb is not subjected to loads that could cause failure of the thumb structure .","Referring to , in some embodiments, the humeral rotator  may include a yolk , rather than the cantilever mounting interface shown in , for interfacing with the elbow flexion assembly . The yolk , interfaces with a first side  and a second side  of the elbow flexion assembly  to provide increased strength to the interface when compared to the cantilever mounting interface shown in , which only interfaces with one side of the elbow flexion assembly .","Referring to , in some embodiments of the present invention, the prosthetic arm  may be provided with a status indicator . In some embodiments the status indicator  may include, but is not limited to, one or more LEDs  arranged on the hand assembly . However, in other embodiments, the one or more LEDs  may be located in various locations. The one or more LEDs  may be configured to communicate a variety of information to the user, including, but not limited to, one or more of the following, battery power level, an operational mode of the prosthetic device, faults, alarms, alerts, messages, and\/or the like. Additionally, although shown as one or more LEDs  the status indicator  may, in other embodiments, include a digital display and\/or user interface, which may be arranged on the prosthetic device , built into the prosthetic device  and\/or may be a separate display unit (for example, as shown in  as ), and in some embodiments, may be a unit worn similarly to a wrist watch or bracelet as shown in  as . However, in other embodiments, the unit  may be a portable unit that may be worn or carried near the user, for example, but not limited to, clipped on clothing, belt and\/or attached to the user, and\/or carried in a pocket either in the user's clothing and\/or in a separate bag and\/or pack. In some embodiments, the unit  may be a PDA (personal data assistant), smart phone or other electronic device configured to communicate with the prosthetic device  by way of a wireless communications protocol, including, but not limited to, RF and Bluetooth\u00ae.","Thus, in some embodiments, it may be desirable to include both a separate display unit and one or more LEDs , where, for example, but not limited to, the one or more LEDs  may be used to display one or more critical piece of information to the user, while the separate display unit,  may provide a greater variety of information in more detail.","Referring to , an embodiment of the wrist rotator  having the ACM stack  housed therein is shown. The wrist rotator  includes a housing  having an input interface , such as the elbow interface , shown in , and an output interface , such as the wrist flexion assembly interface , shown in , at either end thereof. The housing also includes a user interface  formed therein and in communication with the ACM stack . The ACM stack  controls operation of each segment of the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , including the wrist rotator  and, therefore, integrating the ACM stack  into the wrist rotator  may be advantageous since the wrist rotator  is likely to be present in prosthetic arms for essentially all types of amputees, whereas other segments may not be present, such as in a prosthetic arm apparatus for a transradial amputee.","The user interface  may include the status indicator  for communicating status information of the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , from the ACM stack  to the user. The user interface  may also include one or more user inputs , such as buttons, switches, dials or the like for changing and\/or customizing the status information that is conveyed from the ACM stack  through the status indicator .","The status indicator  may include one or more LEDs  configured to communicate the status information from the ACM stack  to the user through illumination of the LEDs . For instance, specific information may be communicated to the user through simple illumination, flashing patterns, color patterns and\/or various combinations thereof. The LEDs  may include a battery alert  for alerting the user of a low power condition. Similarly, the LEDs  may include a system alert  for alerting the user of a system fault condition. The LEDs may include a mode indicator , for example, to indicate whether the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , is in mode for controlling arm movement or a mode for controlling hand movement. Additionally, the LEDs  may include an array  of LEDs  for providing specific information to the user on the current operational mode of the prosthetic device. For instance, when in a hand control mode, each LED  in the array  may represent a different sub control mode of the prosthetic device , shown in , such as different grip movements. In some embodiments, LEDs  may be arranged at multiple locations around the circumference of the wrist rotator  so that at least some of the LEDs  remain visible to the user as the prosthetic arm , shown in , moves during operation.","Preferably, the user interface  is formed from a rubberized material to allow actuation of the one or more user inputs  therethrough and to prevent contaminants such as dirt, dust, water and the like from contacting and damaging the wrist rotator . Additionally, the rubberized material preferably includes one or more translucent portions  in the region of the status indicator  for allowing light from the LEDs  to pass therethrough and may also include one or more symbols printed on the translucent portions  for conveying status information to the user.","Referring to , as discussed above, the wrist rotator  having the ACM stack  and the user interface  is preferably a modular unit that may connect either to a transradial mount  for a transradial amputee or the elbow flexion assembly , shown in , for a transhumeral or shoulder disarticulated amputees. To facilitate the connection, the input interface  includes a captive spanner screw  having male threads, an alignment pin  and one or more torque transmission pins . The transradial mount  (or the elbow flexion assembly , shown in ) includes female threads for engaging the male threads of the captive spanner screw , a left hand alignment hole , a right hand alignment hole  and one or more torque transmission holes .","To assemble the wrist rotator  to the transradial mount  or the elbow flexion assembly , shown in , power and communication wiring connections are first made between the parts. Then, the alignment pin  of the wrist rotator  is registered in either the left hand alignment hole  or the right hand alignment hole  of the transradial mount  (or the elbow flexion assembly , shown in ), depending upon whether the prosthetic arm apparatus , shown in , is to be a left-handed or right-handed prosthesis, respectively. A spanner wrench may then be used to engage the spanner screw  and thread the male threads of the spanner screw  into the female threads of the transradial mount  (or the elbow flexion assembly , shown in ). As the male threads engage the female threads, the torque transmission pins  engage the torque transmission holes  until the spanner screw  is fully seated. This connection advantageously provides a universal interface between the wrist rotator  and either the transradial mount  or the elbow flexion assembly , shown in . The connection is also advantageously universal for both left-handed and right-handed prosthetic devices. For example, the using the right hand alignment hole  provides for a desired range of motion for a right-handed prosthetic device, such as two hundred seventy degrees (270\u00b0). Using the left hand alignment hole  provides a range of motion for a left-handed prosthetic device that is the mirror opposite of the range of motion for the right-handed prosthetic device, for example two hundred seventy degrees (270\u00b0) in the opposite direction of rotation. Additionally, when using either the left hand alignment hole  or the right hand alignment hole  in the connection, the user interface  is advantageously maintained in the view of the user.","Referring back to , in some embodiments of the present invention, the prosthetic arm  may be provided with an emergency switch  which may turn off power to the system and thus engage the various brakes and\/or clutches in the prosthetic arm . In some embodiments, the emergency switch  is a chin switch that the user may activate with their chin.","In some embodiments, another safety mechanism of the prosthetic arm  may include an auto release mechanism  for manually opening a grip of the prosthetic hand . The auto release mechanism  may be a button, switch or the like located on the back of the prosthetic hand , which, when actuated, causes the prosthetic hand  to open. Preferably, the auto release mechanism  is located under the cosmesis , shown in , and actuated therethrough, to prevent contaminants such as dirt, dust, water and the like from contacting and damaging the auto release mechanism . The auto release mechanism  is electrically coupled to a power source (not shown) of the prosthetic arm , such as a battery, and to motor control circuits, such as the hand control module circuit boards , shown in , that control actuation of the motors within the prosthetic hand , such as the two thumb drives , the index drive  and the MRP drive , all shown in . Preferably, the auto release mechanism  is connected to the motor control circuits for the two thumb drives , the index drive  and the MRP drive , all shown in , in parallel to provide redundancy to the auto release mechanism  so that even if one circuit fails, the others will still cause the associated prosthetic fingers to open. In some embodiments, additional redundancy may be provided to the auto release mechanism  by connecting the auto release mechanism  to the motor control circuit boards  through at least two switches, with only one switch being required to cause the prosthetic hand  to open.","In operation, the user may depress the auto release mechanism , which, in turn, actuates the switch or switches on the hand control module circuit boards . Actuation of the switch or switches causes power to be supplied from the power source (not shown) to the two thumb drives , the index drive  and the MRP drive , all shown in , through the hand control module circuit boards , which causes the prosthetic hand  to open. The speed at which the prosthetic hand  opens may be tuned within the hand control module circuit boards  and is preferably less than approximately five (5) seconds. In some embodiments, the speed at which the prosthetic hand  opens may even more preferably be set to less than approximately three (3) seconds. Thus, the user may advantageously actuate the auto release mechanism  to release the grip of the prosthetic hand  if it is closed and\/or becomes stuck in hazardous and\/or harmful situations; for example, if the grip becomes stuck around a car door handle, a bus handle, while shaking a child's hand or any other similar situation.","Although the auto release mechanism  has been described as being electrically coupled to the power source (not shown) of the prosthetic arm  and to the hand control module circuit boards , in other embodiments, the auto release mechanism  may include a separate power source (not shown) and\/or separate motor control circuits (not shown) located within the prosthetic hand  to provide additional redundancy. Additionally, in other embodiments, the auto release mechanism  may be a mechanical system rather than an electrical system, for example, the auto release mechanism  may be a crank or the like for manually opening the prosthetic hand .","The prosthetic arm apparatus of the present invention has a variety of benefits over conventional prosthetic devices, such as the modularity of each segment of the prosthetic arm apparatus as discussed above, which allows the formation of customized prosthetic devices for different users. In particular, each segment of the prosthetic arm apparatus  contains all of the actuators for that segment so that it may be removed as a separate unit. For instance, the hand assembly includes all of the finger actuators therein, allowing it to be connected and\/or removed as a separate unit. Additionally, various degrees of freedom of the hand assembly are particularly beneficial because they allow the formation of various grasps or grips.","Although the invention has been described in the context of a prosthetic arm, an apparatus according to the elements of this invention could be used in other robotic tools, such as those used in manufacturing and\/or teleoperations, where an operator is not connected directly to the controlled device. For example the prosthetic arm apparatus may be used for teleoperation in hazardous environments and\/or hazardous activities, for the detonation of explosive devices or the like. In these environments, the prosthetic arm apparatus may provide a more intuitive interface for the user since the user will already be familiar with the natural movements of the arm, which may make control translation of the prosthetic arm apparatus easier.","While the principles of the invention have been described herein, it is to be understood by those skilled in the art that this description is made only by way of example and not as a limitation as to the scope of the invention. Other embodiments are contemplated within the scope of the present invention in addition to the exemplary embodiments shown and described herein. Modifications and substitutions by one of ordinary skill in the art are considered to be within the scope of the present invention."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other features and
