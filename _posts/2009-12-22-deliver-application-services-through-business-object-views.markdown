{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The field of the invention relates generally to data processing and digital processing systems. More specifically, the invention is related to providing services to consumers within a computer systems environment.","According to the information technology (IT) industry terminology, a business object (BO) could be defined as a uniquely identifiable business entity. In the context of a private computing environment, the existing business objects represent the entities in a business domain supported by one or more business applications. Business applications deliver application services to consumers based on the business objects. The business applications are traditionally implemented on top of application platforms that provide software basis for the different application services. The application platforms also provide a variety of infrastructure services, e.g., user interfaces, report generation, business object repositories, software logistics and lifecycle management, persistency abstraction, etc. Generally, the application platforms are developed and marketed by different software vendors. Proprietary application platforms are implemented in many private computing environments as well.","Often, application platforms, including the proprietary application platforms, are developed to provide business functionality that is applicable for small, medium, and large-sized business environments. Therefore, the business objects that are presented within an application platform need to correspond to the most complex business domain target group. The BOs existing in such universal application platforms contain more functionality than small and medium-sized companies really need. Part of the unnecessary functionality could be \u201chidden\u201d behind adjustable business configuration or behind predefined user interfaces. However, the entire functionality of the application platform, including the whole complexity of the BOs, would be visible in various use-cases, especially in Flexibility and Extensibility scenarios, e.g., Ad hoc reporting, UI extensibility, etc. The task of limiting a consumer domain to access a narrower scope of the functionality presented by an application platform could require substantial resources, and could cause tradeoff in terms of performance and maintenance.","Systems and methods for providing application services through business object views are described. In one aspect, a definition of at least one business object (BO) is included in a metadata of an application platform. The definition includes descriptions of a number of entities of the BO, and an identification of a service provider of the BO. The service provider instantiates the business object in response to an application service request. In a further aspect, a definition of a business object view (BOV) is included in the metadata of the application platform. The definition includes description of a number of entities of the BOV, and an identification of the BO. The BO is a data source or originator of the BOV. The BOV definition could specify more than one BO as a data source of the BOV. In one other aspect, a transformation is stored in the metadata of the application platform to describe mapping of the BOV entities to the entities of the BOs specified as data sources of the BOV. In yet another aspect, the definition of the BOV is loaded in the runtime environment of the application platform in response to a consumer call for a core service of a BOV entity. A service corresponding to the core service of the BOV entity is called at the BO service provider based on the mapping.","In an additional aspect, BOVs can be nested at design time, e.g., the BOV is defined on top of another BOV. In such a case, the BOV includes an identification of the underlying BOV instead of the identification of the BO. Nevertheless, at runtime, nested or hierarchal core service calls are avoided by calling directly the service of the BO corresponding to the consumer core service call. The direct call at runtime is made possible via an optimized mapping calculated at compile time and described in the transformation.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for providing application services through business object views are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","Broadly defined, a business object (BO) represents a well defined and outlined business content that encapsulates an independent business concept, recognized by the business world. Business objects can be categorized according to their business-related nature among other things. Some business objects might describe organizational units or structures for conducting business. Other BOs correspond to business transaction documents representing business transactions. In either case, BOs are characterized by their structure elements or entities.

Services are delivered by corresponding computer application instances within a computing environment. A core service is a service performing operations of a business object node. The set of all core services of a BO node completely encapsulates and controls the state of all node instances. Typically, the BOs of an application platform are modeled and implemented in a strictly normalized way, focused on service provisioning for complex business solutions. The normalized structure of the business objects ensures integrity and consistency of the allocated data and services, and avoids the redundancy. However, the normalized structures are not convenient for consumer access. Therefore, a special category of business object views is presented. A business object view (BOV) is modeled as a specific business object based on a core business object. Additional data and actions can be joined in the BOV from other business objects to achieve structural simplifications and easier consumption.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","115","110","115","150","140","120","145","140","150","145","150","145","150","155","145","150","145","105"]},"Consumers  form a consumer domain that may include user interfaces, partner development tools or infrastructures, various third party analytic applications, forms, etc. Consumers  send method calls corresponding to different core services of the BOVs  through remote consumer proxy (RCP) . The RCP  maps the protocols used by the consumers  for the method calls, to the internal core service interfaces. The service calls received at RCP  are handled by service adaptation engine . The service adaptation engine  identifies the underlying BOs , and requests corresponding to the core services of the BOs  through service provider adapter  based on transformations .","The requested services are executed by the appropriate service providers . Service providers  could be different business applications. A service provider  may instantiate a service provider class corresponding to a business object  as defined in metadata . The instantiated service provider class creates an environment to perform the tasks associated with the requested service, e.g., extracts data, setup parameters, carries data persistency, etc. A service provider  may also act as a service consumer as data of different business objects  could be needed for executing the requested services. Such internal service calls from the service providers  are sent to application platform  through local consumer proxy (LCP) .","Both LCP  and RCP  implement metadata  to provide the service providers  and consumers , respectively, with access to the service interfaces of the BOVs . In general, BOVs  are developed to present a meta model of the required business functionality within computing environment , that is more convenient than the meta model presented by the normalized BOs . Database  could be used by application platform  to store metadata . In one embodiment of the invention, service adaptation engine  and service provider adapters  could create executable load based on the metadata , and store it database . Service providers  persist data associated with the respective BOs  in database .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","205"]},"Once the model of the new BOV is built, the correspondence between the entities of the existing BOs or BOVs and the entities of the new BOV is analyzed and described at . An entity of the new BOV could map directly to an entity of an underlying BO or BOV. In such a case, the entity of the underlying BO or BOV \u201cprojects\u201d all its properties into the entity of the new BOV. Alternatively, a transformation rule could be assigned to the mapping. The transformation rule could be described with a function having at least one parameter presenting an entity of an underlying BO or BOV. The function is calculated at runtime, and the result is mapped to the entity of the new BOV. For example, an entity of the new BOV could be mapped to a concatenation of an entity of an underlying BO and a substring of an entity of an underlying BOV. The direct or indirect mapping of an entity of the new BOV to an entity of an existing BO or BOV could be defined in the meta-model of the new BOV by a transformation including a mapping description, and a transformation rule when required.","In one embodiment of the invention, the nodes of a BOV can contain transformed elements which will be calculated at runtime. For such elements in the metadata repository a transformation (including transformation rule) shall be modeled to get a \u201cwhere-used\u201d index of the source BO elements which will be transformed by the calculation. For example, the \u201cwhere-used\u201d index is needed in an extensibility framework. The calculation itself is provided as a backend service adaptation function. The nodes of a business object view can contain associations, actions and queries that are directly or indirectly mapped to associations, actions and queries of underlying BOs. It is not possible to provide a service provider class to implement such associations, actions and queries.","Certain principles could be imposed regarding the mapping between different kinds of entities. For example, such principles may forbid associations from the new BOV to other BOs or BOVs. The navigation from a BOV to other BOs or BOVs must be based on real foreign key relationships. The reason for such limitation is to establish self-contained BOVs regarding the cross business object associations. Another rule regarding the association entities could ban generalized associations that are parameterized at runtime with specific filter, e.g., the scope of the generalized associations is defined at runtime. Further, it may not be allowed to use data objects directly in the BOVs, and the data objects have to be mapped through corresponding business objects that host the necessary data.","The mapping principles could impose a requirement that the properties of the BOV entities are restricted by the values of the properties of the corresponding entities of the underlying BOs or BOVs. For example, if an element of an underlying BO is \u201ceditable\u201d, then the mapped element in a derivative BOV can be \u201ceditable\u201d or \u201cread-only\u201d. Further, if an element of the underlying BO is \u201cread-only\u201d, then the mapped element in the derivative BOV can only be \u201cread-only\u201d.","The solution model built at the application platform includes complex and comprehensive business object structure. Some of the entities of this structure are for public use, and they could be accessed by consumers and integrated in, e.g., partner solutions. However, many of the entities of the business object structure are for internal use only, providing internal services. From consumer's perspective, these entities are not regarded as pertinent to the business solution model of the application platform. At , a status is assigned to the public entities of the new BOV to indicate that they could be accessed by the consumers. The entities of the underlying BOs or BOVs that correspond to the public entities of the new BOV could be marked with a status that indicates that they could no longer be accessed directly by the consumers.","In one embodiment of the invention, an important status associated to the public entities indicates the availability of a stability contract. The stability contract guarantees that an associated BOV entity is available, or will be available, in a particular software release of the application platform. The stability contract for an entity of the new BOV could be described by a release status code assigned to the entity. For example, the release status code could be set to \u201cnot released\u201d, \u201creleased with restrictions\u201d, \u201creleased\u201d, \u201cdeprecated\u201d and \u201crevoked\u201d. If an entity has release status code set to \u201creleased\u201d, it guarantees that the entity is included in the current software release, and will be included in at least the next software release of the application platform. The stability contracts guarantees the entities with release status code set to \u201creleased\u201d or \u201cdeprecated\u201d are fully supported by the current software release of the application platform, and respectively, all associated services are available to the consumers. Additionally, a label could be assigned to some or all of the entities of the new BOV. The labels could present descriptions of the corresponding entities that are aligned with the terminology of a specific business solution, and thus alleviate consumer's access to the relevant entities.","The new BOV derives directly or indirectly from one or more underlying BOs. The new BOV derives indirectly from a BO when it derives from a BOV which in turn derives directly or indirectly from the BO. For each BOV defined in an application platform, the underlying BO needs to be defined. BOVs reuse a number of infrastructure mechanisms that are provided by the underlying BOs. At , the new BOV is set to reuse infrastructure mechanisms provided by a main underlying BO. For example, the BOV needs to reuse a messaging mechanism of an underlying BO to provide error and information messages. Similarly, the authorization and the deployment mechanisms for the new BOV derives from the main underlying BO. Furthermore, the BOVs in an application platform may not be security relevant objects. Respectively, the access management services and BOV instances checks are delegated to corresponding frontend security objects and to the service providers of the underlying BOs, respectively.","The new BOV is generated at . According to one embodiment of the invention, the business object views are implemented within existing application platform architecture. For example, the definitions of the BOVs could be stored in a general metadata repository where the definitions of the BOs implemented within the application platform are kept. The service providers of the BOs could execute the core services associated with BOVs, respectively, no service providers for the BOVs are required. Consumer proxies and service adaptation engines could generate interfaces based on the BOVs' metadata to provide the consumers with access to the core services associated with the entities of the BOVs. The runtime environment of the BOVs could be presented by an existing service adaptation engine at the application platform. The metadata model of the new BOVs is compiled by a compiler, and a corresponding executable load is created and stored, e.g., in the metadata repository. The executable load is loaded by the service adaptation engine when a pertinent service call is received from a consumer.","Consumers, especially those including partner development tools and customer extensibility tools, display a solution business object layer during discovery. The solution business layer is provided by the application platform and includes the available business object view, that is, the BOVs containing public entities. If such business object views are not available, business objects will be used for discovery. All kind of partner and customer consumer domains, e.g., user interfaces, A2X services, reports, analytics, forms, etc., are based on the business object views if available. The comprehensive support for the business object views in the application platform, without any service provider and own-written coding, makes it possible to use a regular extensibility framework (EXF) for standard extensibility scenarios. A non-exhaustive exemplary list of use cases involving consumption of public BOVs could include:\n\n","The evaluation of how different consumer domains, e.g., user interface, analytics, etc., use normalized and complex business objects reveals similar simplification patterns that are used for building content in these domains. The simplification may affect the set of business object nodes or the structure elements of the business object nodes. Business object views could be modeled based on the assumptions related with simplification patterns applied by the consumers, and further based on the constraints imposed to the business object views compared to the business objects.  shows a process  for modeling optimized business object views based on different simplification approaches, according to one embodiment of the invention.","Process  starts at  with simplifying the associations between different business objects in a business object view. The normalized layout of the business objects in the application platform could produce a rather complex structure of associations between the nodes of the different BOs. One of the possible ways to simplify this association structure is to create a business object view based on a number of involved business objects. The node entities of the created BOV are mapped to nodes and node transformations from the different BOs, wherein the node transformations could be based on the existing associations between the BOs. The modeled BOV is self contained, e.g., no associations with other BOs or BOVs should be included. The de-normalized structure of the modeled BOV includes additional nodes or node elements that may contain duplicated information, but avoid complex associations between the nodes. For example, an association between two nodes in two BOs could be resolved in the BOV by adding the referred BO node as an element to a BOV node mapped to the referring BO node.","At , an optimization of the structure of the set of nodes of one or more BOs or BOVs that are included in a BOV is performed following a common simplification pattern. For example, the reduction of the number of nodes leads to structures which are easier to consume by most consumer tools. A cardinality property defines how often a node is to be instantiated at runtime, e.g., how many elements of this node are available at runtime. Typically, a node with a \u201c1:C\u201d cardinality (C=0 or 1\u2014up to one element for the node is instantiated) is handled like a deep table structure by the consuming tools, even though it does not behave as a deep structure. Therefore, having fewer nodes with more elements (fields) is better from a consumption perspective than more nodes with fewer elements. The nodes with \u201c1:C\u201d cardinality could be merged or joined to a parent node. Alternatively, in a BO node with a table of entries, each entry has an associated code value, and for each code value exactly one entry is allowed. In the modeled BO a flat structure is created by introducing an element per code value in a parent BO node.","At , an optimization of the node elements of the one or more BOs or BOVs that are included in the BOV is performed. The elements of a node define the node's structure. Consumers may not need to access to certain node elements of a BO or BOV. Respectively, the unnecessary node elements will not be included in the modeled BOV. In general, the modeled BOV should include only entities that are meaningful to the potential consumers. Another approach to optimize node elements in a BOV model is by reusable special transformations. For example, an element of a BOV node could result from an associated transformation function having elements from one or more corresponding nodes as parameters. Further, additional elements to alleviate the consumption of the modeled BOV could be presented, e.g., for each foreign key to a master data BO at least one human readable text field could be made available.","The modeled BOV could derive from one or more previously defined BOVs thus forming layers of BOVs on different levels of interdependency. At runtime, the layering could result in an inefficient service provisioning characterized by nested service calls and redundant load of executable BOV definitions. At , the load path for the modeled BOV is optimized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","402","404","406","408","402","401","408","402","410","412","414","410","412","410","412","412","414","412","414"]},"The root node  of sales order BO  is also associated with root node  of business partner BO .
