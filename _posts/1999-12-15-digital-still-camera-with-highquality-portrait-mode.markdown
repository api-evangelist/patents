title: Digital still camera with high-quality portrait mode
abstract: A digital still camera () receives and digitizes visible radiation () and sound waves () from a scene (). When an operator actuates a shutter release (), the camera detects and evaluates digitized information () from the scene in a continuing manner, until a point in time when information representative of a human facial characteristic satisfies a specified criteria set by the operator through use of switches () and a display (). The camera then records in a memory () a digital image of the scene, which corresponds to the point in time. The stored image is a high-quality image, which can avoid characteristics such as eyes that are closed or a mouth that is open.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 USC \u00a7119(e)(1) of Provisional Application No. 60\/116,624, filed Jan. 19, 1999.","This invention relates in general to a still camera and, more particularly, to a still camera which uses information from a scene to record a quality image of the scene.","There are commercially available still cameras which use information from a scene in order to improve the quality of the image of the scene which is selected and recorded. For example, there are existing still cameras which respond to light conditions from the scene by adjusting the exposure settings so as to optimize the quality of the color and contrast in the images which are recorded. As another example, there are existing still cameras which respond to light from a scene by selectively energizing a flash or other light in order to reduce the effect of \u201cred eye\u201d in recorded images of human subjects in the scene. These types of techniques may be used in either a traditional still camera, which records images on film, or in a digital still camera, which records a digital image in some form of electronic storage device.","While these prior techniques have been generally adequate for their intended purposes, they have not been satisfactory in all respects. In particular, even when these cameras are using these known techniques in an effective manner, they can still take images which are of poor quality in some respects, particularly when the recorded image includes one or more humans. For example, it is very common for a human to blink just as a picture is taken, causing the resulting image to be undesirable. As another example, a picture may be taken at a point in time when one of the human subjects is talking, and thus has his or her mouth in an unattractive open position. As a further example, at the point in time when an image is recorded, a person in the image may be turning his or her head, so that it is not facing substantially directly toward the camera.","Frequently, the person operating the camera does not become aware of problems of this type until much later, for example when the film is developed, or when a digital image is downloaded to a computer for viewing. When it is finally discovered that the image is of poor quality, for example because a human subject has blinked, the opportunity to take a further picture of improved quality has usually been lost.","From the foregoing, it may be appreciated that a need has arisen for a method and apparatus of taking still pictures which involve the automatic selection of an image of high quality, particularly where the image includes a human. This may, for example, include reduction or elimination of images in which a person's eyes are partially or fully closed, or in which a person's mouth is partially or fully open.","According to the present invention, a method and apparatus are provided to address this need, and involve operation of a camera by waiting for an operator action, and then responding to the operator action by: detecting and evaluating information from a scene in a continuing manner until a point in time at which it is determined that the information from the scene includes information which is representative of a human facial characteristic and which satisfies a specified criteria; and by recording an image of the scene corresponding substantially to the point in time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12"]},"The broken line  in  is a diagrammatic representation of a housing of the digital still camera . The camera  includes an optics section , which receives radiation  from the scene , the radiation  being in the visible spectrum, and being emitted or reflected by the scene . The optics section  processes the radiation , so as to output processed radiation  in the visible spectrum, in a manner forming a two-dimensional image on an image detector . In the disclosed embodiment, the image detector  may be a two-dimensional charge coupled device (CCD) of a commercially available type, which is commonly used in digital still cameras.","The image detector  converts the radiation  into a series of successive electronic digitized images, which are output in an electrical form at . The camera  includes a control circuit , which receives the digital images produced at , and which is discussed in more detail later. In the disclosed embodiment, the control circuit  provides control signals at  to the image detector , for example to facilitate timing and synchronization between the control circuit  and the image detector .","The control circuit , and other electrical components of the camera , receive power from a rechargeable battery . The control circuit  of the disclosed embodiment is designed to automatically turn itself off, or to enter a low power mode, if the camera  is not used for a predetermined time interval, such as five minutes.","The camera  further includes a microphone , which is responsive to sound waves  emanating from the scene . For example, the scene  may include a person who is speaking and\/or laughing, and any such sound travels to the microphone  in the form of sound waves . The output of the microphone  is amplified by an amplifier , and is then digitized by an analog-to-digital (A\/D) converter , which is of a commercially available type. The digital output signals from the analog-to-digital converter  are supplied at  to the control circuit . In the disclosed embodiment, the control circuit  provides control signals at  to the analog-to-digital converter , for example to facilitate timing and synchronization between the control circuit  and the analog-to-digital converter .","The camera  includes a shutter release switch , a mode select switch , and a setting select switch . Each of the switches \u2013 is a momentary single pole single throw (SPST) switch, having an output which is coupled to a respective input of the control circuit . The shutter release switch  can be manually actuated by an operator of the camera, in order to cause the camera  to take a picture. Since the disclosed camera  is a digital camera, it does not actually have a traditional mechanical shutter. However, the switch  is nevertheless referred to as a shutter release switch, for historical reasons. The mode select switch  and the setting select switch  are discussed in more detail later.","The camera  also includes a display , which is a liquid crystal display (LCD). The display  provides to the operator a visual display of pertinent information regarding the operational status of the camera . In the disclosed embodiment, this information includes an indication of a mode which has been selected using the mode select switch , and an indication of a corresponding setting which has been selected using the setting select switch , as discussed in more detail later.","The camera  further includes a not-illustrated connector, which permits the control circuit  to be electrically coupled to an external computer by a cable, for example as shown diagrammatically at  in . This permits pictures taken by the camera , which are in the form of digital images, to be downloaded from the control circuit  to the external computer.","The control circuit  includes a processor , a semiconductor read-only memory (ROM) , a semiconductor random access memory (RAM) , and a semiconductor flash memory . The processor  may be a commercially available microprocessor of a known type, or an equivalent device. The ROM  is used to store a program which is executed by the processor , and the RAM  is used by the processor  to store data associated with dynamic execution of the program in the ROM . The processor  uses the flash memory  to store one or more digital images, which each represent a respective picture taken by the camera . The digital images stored in the flash memory  may be in any one of a number of different digital image formats, all of which are well known to persons skilled in the art.","An explanation will now be given of how the mode select switch  and the setting select switch  are used to program the operation of the camera . The disclosed camera  has eight different modes which may be programmed by an operator, and which are shown in the left column of TABLE 1. The operator may step through these modes in a cyclic manner, by repeatedly pressing the mode select switch . In other words, each time the mode select switch  is pressed, the camera  advances from the current mode to the next successive mode shown in TABLE 1, which includes an automatic wrap from the last mode to the first mode in TABLE 1. The modes shown in TABLE 1 include a PORTRAIT mode, SIZE mode, NUMBER OF FACES mode, PRIORITY mode, EYES mode, MOUTH mode, HEAD mode, and SOUND mode. During operation of the camera , the name of the mode which is currently selected is always displayed to the operator on the LCD display .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"MODE","SETTING"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"PORTRAIT","OFF"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ON"]},{"entry":[{},"SIZE","OFF"]},{"entry":[{},{},"MINIMUM SIZE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{},"."]},{"entry":[{},{},"."]},{"entry":[{},{},"."]},{"entry":[{},{},"MINIMUM SIZE N"]},{"entry":[{},"NUMBER OF FACES","ALL"]},{"entry":[{},{},"1"]},{"entry":[{},{},"."]},{"entry":[{},{},"."]},{"entry":[{},{},"."]},{"entry":[{},{},"N"]},{"entry":[{},"PRIORITY","NEAREST IMAGE CENTER"]},{"entry":[{},{},"LARGEST"]},{"entry":[{},"EYES","OFF"]},{"entry":[{},{},"OPEN"]},{"entry":[{},"MOUTH","OFF"]},{"entry":[{},{},"CLOSED"]},{"entry":[{},"HEAD","OFF"]},{"entry":[{},{},"FACING CAMERA"]},{"entry":[{},"SOUND","OFF"]},{"entry":[{},{},"WORD (\u201cCheese\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},{},"LAUGHTER"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Each of the eight modes in TABLE 1 has associated with it two or more settings, which are shown in the right column of TABLE 1. The operator can cycle through the settings for the currently selected mode by repeatedly pressing the setting select switch . The current setting for the currently selected mode is displayed on the LCD display  at all times during operation of the camera . As will be apparent from the discussion which follows, several modes may active at the same time, but in the disclosed embodiment the display  displays only the currently selected mode, and the current setting for that mode. It would, of course, be possible to alternatively use a display which shows the current setting for all eight modes, although this would probably increase the complexity and cost of the display .","Referring now in more detail to TABLE 1, the PORTRAIT mode has two settings, which are OFF and ON. The PORTRAIT mode determines whether the camera  is operating in a special PORTRAIT mode of operation, which is discussed later.","The SIZE mode has a plurality of possible settings, which include OFF and MINIMUM SIZE 1 through MINIMUM SIZE N. With respect to one or more persons who may be present in the scene , the SIZE mode, if enabled, determines the minimum size of a person's face which the camera  will recognize in an image from the scene .","The NUMBER OF FACES mode has a plurality of settings, which include ALL and 1 through N. This mode puts an upper limit on the number of human faces which the camera  will select and analyze in an image from the scene , as discussed later.","The PRIORITY mode has two settings, which are NEAREST IMAGE CENTER and LARGEST. The setting for the PRIORITY mode is essentially ignored unless the camera  detects more faces than are specified by the NUMBER OF FACES mode setting, and in that case the PRIORITY mode specifies how to select a subset of the detected faces which is equal in number to the specified NUMBER OF FACES. In particular, if the setting for the PRIORITY mode is NEAREST IMAGE CENTER, then faces nearest to the center of the image are selected before faces in the periphery of the image, up to the number specified by the setting for the NUMBER OF FACES mode. On the other hand, if the setting for the PRIORITY mode is LARGEST, faces will be selected in terms of size, from largest to smallest, up to the number specified by the setting for the NUMBER OF FACES mode.","The EYES mode has two settings, which are OFF and OPEN. When set to OFF, the camera  ignores the eyes of each detected face. On the other hand, when set to OPEN, the camera  ensures that the eyes of each selected face are open at the time the camera  stores a digital image in order to take a picture. Stated differently, if the EYES mode is set to OPEN, a digital image will not be selected for storage as a picture unless the eyes in each detected and selected face are properly open, or in other words are not in the middle of a blink.","The MOUTH mode has two settings, which are OFF and CLOSED. When set to OFF, the mouths of detected and selected faces in the image are ignored. On the other hand, if set to CLOSED, then each detected and selected face must have a mouth which is substantially closed in order for a digital image to be selected and saved to effect the taking of a picture.","The HEAD mode has two settings, which are OFF and FACING CAMERA. If set to OFF, the camera  does not attempt to evaluate the orientation of the head for any face detected and selected by the camera . On the other hand, if set to FACING CAMERA, the camera  will attempt to ensure that each detected and selected face is oriented so as to be looking substantially directly at the camera  at the point in time when a digital image is selected and saved in order to effect the taking of a picture.","The SOUND mode has three settings, which are OFF, WORD, and LAUGHTER. If the SOUND mode is set to OFF, the camera  will ignore the output of the microphone . If set to WORD, the camera  will electronically analyze information received from microphone  through analog-to-digital converter , in order to determine whether that detected sound corresponds to the sound of a selected word, such as the word \u201ccheese\u201d. If set to LAUGHTER, the camera  will electronically analyze the sound information received from microphone  through analog-to-digital converter , in order to determine whether that detected sound corresponds to a predetermined laughter sound.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["56","10","71","72","56","58","21","31","37","72"]},"Control proceeds from block  to block , where the processor  checks to see whether the operator has just pressed either the mode select switch  or the setting select switch . If not, then control proceeds from block  to block . Otherwise, control proceeds from block  to block , where the processor  updates the information presented on display  so as to reflect the new mode and\/or setting. Further, if it is a setting which the operator has changed, the processor  saves the new setting in the RAM , in place of the prior setting for the currently selected mode. Control proceeds from block  to block .","In block , the processor  checks to see whether the shutter release switch  has just been pressed. If not, then control proceeds to block . However, if the switch  has just been pressed, then control proceeds to block , where the processor sets a logical flag located in the RAM . Control then proceeds from block  to block .","In block , the processor  checks to see whether the flag is currently set. If the flag is set, it is an indication that the operator has pressed the shutter release switch , but that the camera  has not yet taken a picture, because the camera  has not yet detected an image which satisfies criteria corresponding to settings specified by TABLE 1, as discussed later. If the processor  determines that the flag is not currently set, then control proceeds from block  back to block , because the camera is not presently in the process of taking a picture.","On the other hand, if it is determined at block  that the flag is set, then the camera  is in the process of taking a picture, and control proceeds to block . In block , the camera  selects for analysis the latest image which was saved at block . Control then proceeds from block  to block .","In block , the processor  checks to see whether the PORTRAIT mode is enabled, or in other words whether the current setting for the PORTRAIT mode is ON. If the PORTRAIT mode is set to OFF, then all of the other modes and settings in TABLE 1 are ignored. In particular, control will proceed directly from block  to block , where the processor  will store the selected image in the flash memory , in order to effectively take a picture. Then, at block , the processor resets the flag. Thereafter, control is returned to block . It will thus be noted that, if the PORTRAIT mode is disabled, the camera  will take a picture by saving a digital image almost instantaneously after the shutter release switch  is pressed by the operator, without doing any analysis of the image.","In contrast, if it is determined at block  that the PORTRAIT mode is enabled, control proceeds to block , where the processor  begins analysis of the image which was selected at block . First, in block , the processor  attempts to detect faces in the selected image, which includes searching the selected digital image for a pixel pattern that appears to be representative of a human face, and which includes the application of criteria corresponding to settings listed in TABLE 1, as discussed below. In the disclosed embodiment, the search for pixel patterns is carried out using techniques which are known to those skilled in the art, and which are therefore not illustrated and described here in detail. A suitable technique is disclosed in Rowley et al. \u201cNeural Network-Based Face Detection\u201d, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, IEEE, 1996.","These known search techniques can optionally be made even more efficient by searching for faces which are larger than a predetermined minimum face size, and\/or smaller than a predetermined maximum face size, and rejecting any detected face which does not satisfy these predetermined size criteria. It should be noted that, if use of a predetermined minimum size is implemented, the predetermined minimum size would have to be less than the smallest minimum size setting permissible for the SIZE mode (TABLE 1).","It is also possible to optionally make the known search techniques more efficient by using a known technique for detecting a moving object using a moving camera, since both the camera and a human in the scene will often be moving relative to the scene and\/or each other, rather than being stationary. Suitable techniques for identifying moving objects using a moving camera are known to those skilled in the art, and are therefore not discussed here in detail. For example, one known technique for detecting moving objects is disclosed in Burt et al., \u201cObject Tracking with a Moving Camera\u201d, Workshop on Visual Motion, IEEE Computer Society Order Number 1903, March, 1989.","After a set of qualifying faces in the selected image has been identified in this manner, including the application of any predetermined minimum\/maximum size criteria, the current setting for the SIZE mode is taken into account. If it is set to OFF, then no change is made to the set of faces which has already been identified. On the other hand, if it is set to one of the various MINIMUM SIZE settings, then every detected face which is smaller than this minimum size is rejected. The resulting set of detected faces is the set of detected faces which will be used for further processing.","Control proceeds from block  to block , where the processor  checks to see whether this resulting set of detected faces includes at least one face. If not, then control proceeds back to block , in order to wait for a subsequent image which includes at least one suitable face. This is because it was determined at block  that the PORTRAIT mode is set to ON, and camera  cannot properly save an image which is supposed to be a portrait if the image lacks any detectable human face.","Assuming that there is at least one human face in the image, control proceeds from block  to block , where the system carries out selection and analysis on the set of detected faces. More specifically, the system first selects one or more detected faces from the set, according to criteria corresponding to settings listed in TABLE 1. In particular, the selection of faces is carried out with reference to the current settings for the NUMBER OF FACES and PRIORITY modes.","More specifically, if the NUMBER OF FACES mode is set to ALL, then the processor  will select all of the faces which have been detected, and will ignore the current setting for the PRIORITY mode. Alternatively, if the NUMBER OF FACES mode is set to a number from 1 to N, the processor  will check to see whether the set of detected faces includes more faces than the specified number. If the number of detected faces is less than or equal to the number specified by the NUMBER OF FACES mode, then the processor  will select all of the detected faces, and will ignore the current setting for the PRIORITY mode. On the other hand, if the number of detected faces is greater than the number of faces specified by the setting for the NUMBER OF FACES mode, the processor will use the current setting of the PRIORITY mode to select a subset of the detected faces.","In more detail, if the current setting for the PRIORITY mode is NEAREST IMAGE CENTER, the processor  will select faces equal in number to the current setting of the NUMBER OF FACES mode, based on which faces in the selected image are closest to the center of the image. On the other hand, if the current setting of the PRIORITY mode is LARGEST, the processor  will select detected faces which are equal in number to the current setting of the NUMBER OF FACES mode, and which are the largest detected faces in the selected image.","After the processor  has selected faces in this manner, then the processor  (still in block ) proceeds to analyze the selected faces according to other criteria, which correspond to settings listed in TABLE 1 for the EYES, MOUTH, and HEAD modes. In more detail, if the current setting for the EYES mode is OFF, then the processor  does not attempt to make any analysis associated with eyes which may be present in the detected image. On the other hand, if the current setting of the EYES mode is OPEN, then the processor  uses a known technique to identify eyes in the detected image, and to verify that the eyelids are open. Stated differently, the processor  attempts to verify that no detected and selected face in the selected image has an eye which is currently blinking. Suitable techniques for this evaluation of eyes are known to those skilled in the art, and are therefore not discussed here in detail. For example, a suitable known technique is set forth in Crowley et al., \u201cMulti-Modal Tracking of Faces for Video Communications\u201d, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, IEEE, 1997.","In a similar manner, if the current setting of the MOUTH mode is OFF, the processor  will not make any attempt to analyze the mouth of each detected and selected face. However, if the current setting of the MOUTH mode is CLOSED, the processor  will use known image analysis techniques to identify a mouth in each detected and selected face, and to verify that the mouth is currently closed. This is intended to help the camera  avoid taking an image at a point in time when the mouth in one or more of the detected faces is open, for example because the associated person in the scene  is talking. Suitable techniques for this evaluation of mouths are known to those skilled in the art, and are therefore not discussed here in detail. For example, suitable known techniques are described in Black et al., \u201cLearning Parameterized Models of Image Motion\u201d, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, IEEE, 1997.","Then, still in block , the processor  checks the current setting for the HEAD mode. If the current setting is OFF, then the processor  carries out no analysis of the orientation of faces. On the other hand, if the current setting is FACING CAMERA, then the processor  uses known image analysis techniques to determine whether each detected and selected face is oriented so as to be facing substantially directly toward the camera . Suitable known techniques for evaluating the orientation of a face\/head are known to those skilled in the art, and are therefore not described here in detail. For example, one such known technique is set forth in Jebara et al., \u201cParametrized Structure from Motion for 3D Adaptive Feedback Tracking of Faces\u201d, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, IEEE, 1997.","Control then proceeds from block  to block , where the processor  checks to see whether the selected image failed to satisfy any active criteria used in block . For example, the selected image will be rejected if the current setting of the EYES mode is OPEN, and if the processor  found that any detected and selected face has an eyelid which is fully or partially closed. Similarly, if the current setting for the MOUTH mode is CLOSED, the selected image will be rejected if the processor  found that any detected and selected face had a mouth which was open to any significant extent. Likewise, if the current setting of the HEAD mode is FACING CAMERA, the selected image will be rejected if the processor  determined that one or more of the detected and selected faces are not oriented so as to substantially face the camera . If the processor  has determined that a selected image has failed to satisfy even a single criteria which is currently active, then the selected image is rejected and control proceeds from block  back to block , to obtain and analyze a new image from the scene .","On the other hand, if the processor  has not yet found any reason to reject the selected image, then control proceeds from block  to block , where the processor checks the current setting for the SOUND mode. If the current setting is OFF, then the processor  does not attempt to carry out any analysis of sounds which have been received through microphone . However, if the SOUND mode has any other setting, then the processor  analyzes a segment of sound which has just been received from the scene  through the microphone . In this regard, if the current setting of the SOUND mode is WORD, the processor  analyses the received sound pattern to determine whether it appears to correspond to the sound pattern for a known word, such as \u201ccheese\u201d. If the processor  does not find a match, because no person in the vicinity of the microphone  appears to be currently speaking the selected word, then the processor  rejects the selected image. Alternatively, if the current setting for the SOUND mode is LAUGHTER, the processor  analyzes a sound segment from the microphone  in order to determine whether it corresponds to one or more known sound patterns corresponding to human laughter. If the processor  determines that there is not a match, because no person in the vicinity of the microphone  appears to be currently laughing, then the processor  rejects the selected image.","The disclosed embodiment carries out sound analysis to detect either laughter or a particular word by using techniques which are known to those skilled in the art, and which are therefore not described here in detail. For example, suitable known techniques for analyzing sound are discussed in Rabiner, \u201cA Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and Selected Applications in Speech Recognition\u201d, Proceedings of the IEEE, Volume 77, Number 2, February, 1989.","Control proceeds from block  to block , where the processor  checks to see whether there was any active sound criteria which was not met in block , and which thus caused the processor  to reject the selected image. If an active sound criteria has not been met, then control proceeds from block  back to block , in order to effectively reject the selected image and to obtain and analyze a new image. On the other hand, if all active sound criteria have been met, then control proceeds from block  to block  where, as already discussed above, the selected image is stored in the flash memory  in order to effect the taking of a digital picture. Then, at block , the processor  clears the flag, in order to indicate that a digital picture has been taken. Control then returns from block  to block .","In a variation of the procedure shown in , in block  the system could also start a timer and save the first video image received after the shutter release  is released. Then, if the timer expires before any determination is made at block  that all active criteria have been met, the system could store in the flash memory  the video image saved at block , rather than any image saved at block , and then proceed to block . On the other hand, if the timer has not yet expired and it is determined at block  that all active criteria have been met, control could proceed from block  through blocks  and , with block  including the additional step of turning off the timer.","The present invention provides a number of technical advantages. As one example, when the portrait mode of the disclosed camera is enabled, the camera will not necessarily take a digital picture immediately after the shutter release is operated. Instead, the camera will automatically wait until various criteria specified by the operator have all been met, and then save a digital image in order to effect the taking of a picture. By appropriately setting the various criteria, the camera operator can improve the quality of the resulting picture or image, by increasing the likelihood that persons in the image will be facing the camera, have their eyes open, and\/or have their mouths closed. In this manner, the digital still camera according to the present invention can produce a much higher quality image than has previously been available from either film or digital still cameras. An example of a further technical advantage is that the disclosed camera can use analysis of sounds for purposes of selecting a digital image of a scene, so as to realize improved quality of the selected digital image.","Although one embodiment has been illustrated and described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made therein. For example, several specific settings or criteria have been disclosed for use in evaluating whether to select a given image, but it will be recognized that a larger or smaller number of criteria, or different criteria, could be utilized for this purpose. Also, the disclosed camera uses an LCD display, but it will be recognized that other techniques could be used to communicate to an operator the current operational status of the camera. In addition, the disclosed camera uses a mode select switch and a setting select switch to adjust the current operational status of the camera, but it will be recognized that there are other arrangements which could be provided to allow an operator to adjust the operational status of the camera.","Moreover, the disclosed camera includes a microphone, and has the capability to analyze sounds received through the microphone for purposes of selecting an optimum digital image of a scene. However, it will be recognized that the microphone and associated sound analysis could be omitted. Also, the disclosed camera uses a flash memory to store digital images which represent the pictures taken by the camera, but there are other known techniques which could be used for storing these digital images. There are still other modifications which could be made to the disclosed camera, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, as defined by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A better understanding of the present invention will be realized from the detailed description which follows, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
