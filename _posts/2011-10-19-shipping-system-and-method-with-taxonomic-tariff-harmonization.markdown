{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO EARLIER FILED APPLICATION","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/458,204 filed on Nov. 19, 2010 which is incorporated by reference herein.","This disclosure relates to the field of electronic commerce, and more particularly to the field of generating accurate information for shipping goods domestically and internationally upon completion of an electronic commerce transaction, and to a system and method for taxonomically learning and generating such information.","Electronic commerce including auctions, direct sales and offers for sale have become a fixture in online activity. Ecommerce combined with the increasing popularity of mobile computing, mobile blogging, micro blogging, tweeting, mobile web activity and similar mobile communication, offers buyers and sellers the possibility of finding and providing specialized goods and services, antiques, used items, and other items. Social platforms including social networking and social media sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, You Tube and other socially interactive sites have also become popular for conducting ecommerce and online ecommerce activity. The merging of ecommerce and social platforms allow users to take advantage of how they use the web and internet which is both connecting with each other through their social graph and accessing the web and internet whenever, wherever and however they want. Such an integrated environment provides both buyers and sellers with the need to achieve accurate and timely shipping information for quick and accurate shipment of goods domestically and internationally through such ecommerce transactions and social experiences.","Ecommerce transactions including auctions, direct sales and offers, provide sellers the benefit of price competition among buyers, creating markets for goods and services which are worldwide and which are becoming increasingly mobile. Various types of goods are offered for sale and purchased across thousands of different categories. Such variety requires a universal, updateable, modifiable and intuitive database. The increasing number of categories and sub-categories that are being created to accommodate online ecommerce transactions cause the standard harmonized tariff schedule (HTS) and harmonized tariff code (HTC) classification code databases to be out of date and inaccurate in many respects and instances. There is a need for a taxonomically updateable and intuitive database which can learn and update the HTS and HTC classification data in real time. Such a system and method would benefit from providing modules for adding specific words, phrases, codes or images to imported HTS and HTC classification databases. It would be beneficial to provide the option to selectively update individual and chosen categories based on user input.","In addition, collectors, hobbyists and other purchasers participate in social networking activity, are drawn to ecommerce environments, and are interested in consummating transactions seamlessly without leaving the purchasing platform. Hence a seamless ecommerce environment with mobile access and the ability to complete the ecommerce transaction timely, without interruption and with certainty and security to both the buyer and seller is important and central to the ecommerce, social networking, social ecommerce and social selling platforms. In addition, it is desirable to have a shipping module that can be integrated into any ecommerce platform for providing the benefits described herein.","Ecommerce sites including online auctions have typically experienced the inability to accurately provide shipping costs typically leading to unexpected shipping costs, particularly for international shipments. The inability to accurately quote shipping rates and associated costs taking into consideration specific product attributes are persistent problem for sellers and buyers alike. Thus, a need exists for the parties to such ecommerce transactions to have access to better information in advance about the classification of goods, their associated duties and real shipping costs for their items including both domestic and international shipping options. It is desirable to improve the accuracy of the shipping classification and hence the shipping quote, and provide competitive shipping costs through use of a system that can update shipping information including classification codes, key word descriptors and item classification information taxonomically and on a real time basis.","It is desirable to provide an online shipping system and method having taxonomic international tariff harmonization capabilities which provides for the ability to learn details of products including key words, attributes and the like as that information is keyed in by the buyer or seller. It is also desirable to provide an online shipping system that is easy for buyers and sellers to use, and allows a buyer to easily locate an item for immediate purchase, available to make an offer or place a bid and easily complete a purchase, obtain accurate shipping classification and costs then complete shipping in a secure, safe, seamless and customer friendly environment.","Preferred embodiments of systems are provided herein which may have a harmonized classification code for a good based on an input including a database adapted to store content with a harmonized tariff classification code module for storing a data structure representing a harmonized classification code tree, the harmonized classification code tree having one or more harmonized classification codes in which the good can be classified. The exemplary systems may also have a keywords module for associating and storing keyword data related to the good with one of the harmonized classification codes and a learning module for learning keywords from the input and associating the learned key words with the one harmonized classification code for the good.","An exemplary system may include a processor configured to receive a query over an application programming interface requesting the harmonized classification code for the good based on the input, the processor accessing the database to retrieve a corresponding group of harmonized classification codes associated with the good.

The Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) is the primary resource for determining tariff classifications for goods imported into the United States and foreign countries and is based on the international Harmonized Commodity Coding and Classification System (HS), which has been established by the World Customs Organization. Virtually all countries base their tariff schedules on the Harmonized System (HS), making it easier to conduct international trade. As used herein Harmonization Tariff System (HTS) includes the over 17,000 unique ten-digit HTS classification code numbers (HTC) which are arranged by product category name, use, and\/or the material used in its construction in harmonization tariff code trees. The HTS publication is available in various electronic formats, including electronic databases that can be downloaded and imported in systems utilizing the methods and computer-readable medium as disclosed herein.","As can be seen from the flow chart of an exemplary embodiment in , a harmonized classification system code database  is provided for storing harmonized tariff system (HTS) classification codes and harmonized tariff system (HTS) classification code trees. The database  also includes keywords which are associated with various classifications within the database . Such keywords may be added to one or more harmonized classification codes to improve the accuracy of the code and it description for a given good which has been purchased at the site and which is to be shipped domestically or internationally. Keywords may be added manually by the administrator of the database or may be added through use of the system as described herein. During use, the system accepts an item description at . The item description may be entered by a user, such as a seller of a good at . Alternatively, the item description may be parsed into the system from an electronic listing of the good or item on an ecommerce website. Such ecommerce websites may include an auction site, classified advertisement site, social networking site, social media site, store site or the like. The system of the present disclosure may be use in conjunction with any such ecommerce site to improve the accuracy and relevance of the harmonization tariff system codes available through the site to improve shipping of goods sold through the site.","An ignored word list may also be provided at  for comparison to the item description input at . The list of words to ignore  may include a group of words entered by the site administrator which are simply noise words that will be ignored upon parsing of the user item description input at . Such ignored words may include \u201cwith,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d \u201calso,\u201d known as,\u201d \u201ca,\u201d \u201cit,\u201d \u201cto,\u201d and similar words which do not add to the description of an item or a good being sold. It will be appreciated that the ignored word list may be different for various sites depending on their area of commerce and the goods that are sold, auctioned or otherwise listed for sale on the site. The item description at  is parsed. Then words are on the ignored word list at  are compared to the individual parsed words and the complete word phrase input at . If any of the words in the item description appear on the ignore word list, these words will not be considered when the HTS classification code database  is searched. In an alternative embodiment, the ignored word list may vary by HTS classification code. In such an embodiment, the ignored word list for one HTS classification code may be different than the ignored word list for other HTS classification codes.","After eliminating the ignored words from the ignored words list , each parsed word is searched in the HTS classification code database at . One or more HTS classification codes are returned from the search that match the keywords in the HTS classification code database . More than one HTS classification code may be presented at  based on the HTS classification database search and matches therein. If multiple HTS classification codes are presented by the search at , the HTS classification codes returned will be placed in a priority order based on rank at  which may include the number of counts from high to low of keyword matches. If a single preferred HTS classification code can not be derived by the system, root classifications may be presented for drill down by user. The user, seller or shipper may then choose the HTS classification code from a list returned through the search of the HTS classification code database at . The list returned may be prioritized by rank such that the most relevant HTS classification codes are at the top of the list. Relevance may be determined by the number of keywords that match the search of the HTS classification code database . It is contemplated that the user may make the choice of the appropriate database based on the choices presented by the method and system disclosed.","In the preferred embodiment of , the system, method and computer-readable medium includes the ability to taxonomically learn keywords entered through the input of the item description at  by parsing the item description into individual keywords at  and maintaining the complete item description at , eliminating the \u201cnoise\u201d or irrelevant words from the parsed words at  and searching each keyword  and the complete item description  in the HTS classification code database . Each of the parsed keywords  from the item description, after elimination of the ignored words from the ignored word list at , and the complete item description itself  are searched in the HTS classification database  and a list of HTS classification codes are returned that match each keyword and the complete item description searched at . Each such retrieved HTS classification code includes a count at  of each keyword  and the complete item description  included with each returned or retrieved HTS classification code. Each time the word or complete item description is searched in the database, the count is incremented by one and stored in the HTS classification code database as the new count for that HTS classification code at .","The system, method and computer-readable medium in the illustrated preferred embodiment of  also includes comparing the count returned for each keyword at  with a set count at . The set count may be determined by the site administrator to be the threshold at which the keyword or phrase returned or retrieved at ,  is considered valid and relevant to the item being searched. If the set count is equal to or greater than the current count for each keyword  or item description , then the keyword or item description is appended to the HTS classification code selected by the user at . If a keyword or item description phrase is appended to the selected HTS classification code at , then the HTS classification code with the appended words or phrase is returned and updated in the HTS classification manual database at . If the set count at  is less than the current count , then the keyword or phrase is not relevant to the HTS classification code selected at  and the keyword or item description is not appended to the selected HTS classification code.","As noted above, the HTS classification code database may be available electronically and can be imported into the system as illustrated at  in . In this preferred embodiment, after the HTS classification code database  is imported into the system described herein, keywords can be manually appended at  to enhance the relevance to each HTS classification code for given items or goods. The site administrator may initially append known relevant keywords to specific HTS classification codes to improve the relevance of the search functionality of the HTS classification code database with manual keywords . This will improve the ease of search and present more relevant and accurate classification code choices to the user of the system for particular goods and items as the taxonomic features of the system are developed and matured through use.","It will be appreciated that as additional keyword information is developed over the internet or through other website activity, the site administrator can retrieve such additional information and update the HTS classification code database with keywords at . In addition, it is contemplated that such updates, as illustrated in a preferred embodiment in , can occur through various databases that report information regarding HTS classification codes. Such databases may include, but are not limited to, governmental databases and other databases that store relevant United States International Trade Commission decisions reporting updates and findings related to various hearings on HTS classification code issues.","It will also be appreciated that update information for various goods and items may be available at various websites and through other online resources. Accordingly, it is contemplated that searching these sites and resources for updated information may include the use of a wide variety of tools to capture information that may automate such searches. Such tools may include smartphones, cameras, bar code scanners, QR code scanners, and other capture devices to create the data, links or other identifiers necessary to search the internet. All of such tools are contemplated for use by the system, method and computer-readable medium for delivering a harmonized classification code for a good based on an input as disclosed herein.","As may be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the system, method and computer-readable medium for delivering a harmonized classification code for a good based on an input includes a group of interrelated databases and database tables. Such tables provide for the storage and retrieval of data regarding system operation, system activities including routines and sub-routines to be performed on data dynamically as the site is updated by users, including creating, updating and modifying HTS classification codes, item descriptions, keyword lists, ignored word lists, counts on the site and other site activity.
