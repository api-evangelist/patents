A profile may contain preferences for specific actions that wireless device  should perform to obtain connectivity. For example, a profile may identify preferences for certain radios over other radios, preferences for a particular radio under certain conditions, etc. Different profiles may be defined by different entities such as a user, a network operator, an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or wireless device manufacturer, etc. The profiles may allow for conformance to the requirements of different entities.","A number of profiles may be defined. In one design, one or more of the following profiles may be defined:\n\n","A user profile may store preferences for connectivity defined by the user based on various considerations such as cost, privacy, battery usage, etc. An operator profile may store preferences for connectivity defined by a network operator, e.g., preferences for some radios over other radios when several radios are available. An OEM profile may store preferences for connectivity defined by an OEM, e.g., based on capabilities of wireless device , the available resources on wireless device , etc. An applications profile may store preferences for connectivity for applications on wireless device . An application may have certain requirements (e.g., for QoS), and each radio may have certain capabilities. The preferences may be based on the requirements of the applications, the capabilities of the radios, and\/or other factors. The preferences may be used to select the proper radios to provide connectivity for the applications. A learned profile may store preferences for connectivity determined based on past activities or behavior of wireless device . Five types of profiles have been described above. Fewer, different, and\/or additional profiles may also be defined and used to provide connectivity.","A radio may have one or more configurable parameters that may be adjusted to mitigate interference from the radio and\/or to improve the performance of the radio. A configurable parameter may be for a physical component within the radio, such as an amplifier, a filter, an antenna, an antenna array, etc. A configurable parameter may also be for an operational parameter such as a transmit power level, a frequency channel, a traffic channel, a scheduled period, etc. A received power level may also be a configurable parameter if it can be varied, e.g., by selecting different antennas and\/or more antennas. Each configurable parameter may be set to one of multiple possible settings\/values applicable for that parameter. The radio may have an operating state, which may be defined by a particular setting for each configurable parameter. A configurable parameter may also be referred to as a \u201cknob\u201d, a configurable parameter setting may also be referred to as a \u201cknob setting\u201d, and an operating state may also be referred to as a \u201cknob state\u201d.","In one design, an interference database may be defined for a given multi-radio platform, which may include all radios supported by wireless device . The interference database may be used to select radios for active applications and to reduce interference between active radios operating concurrently. The interference database may be provided in various formats.","In one design, the interference database may comprise a color chart having a number of cells for a number of operating states for different transmitter radios and receiver radios. The color chart may include a set of columns for each frequency channel on which a transmitter radio can operate. Each column set may include a number of columns for different operating states of the transmitter radio. The color chart may also include a set of rows for each frequency channel on which a receiver radio can operate. Each row set may include a number of rows for different operating states of the receiver radio. A cell may be defined for each unique combination of operating states of the transmitter and receiver radios. Cell (i, j) may correspond to operating state i for the transmitter radio and operating state j for the receiver radio. Cell (i, j) may be filled with the performance level (e.g., acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable) for the receiver radio with the transmitter radio in operating state i and the receiver radio in operating state j. The operating state of the transmitter radio and\/or the operating state of the receiver radio may be varied, as needed, to obtain the desired performance.","Information regarding interference between radios may also be captured and stored in an interference database in other manners. For example, the interference information may be quantized in other ways, presented using other formats or structures, etc. Interference between radios may also be (i) measured in real time, (ii) computed a priori, stored, and retrieved as needed, and\/or (iii) determined in other manners.","Wireless device  may perform system selection to select radios to provide connectivity for active applications. System selection refers to selection of one or more systems or radios to serve one or more applications. System selection may also include mapping of active applications to selected radios. System selection may also be referred to as radio selection, radio bearer selection, etc.","Wireless device  may support full system selection for active applications. Full system selection refers to selection of a single radio for an entire application for each direction, e.g., selection of a single transmitter radio for the transmit direction and a single receiver radio for the receive direction. All data for the application may be exchanged (e.g., sent or received) via the selected radio for each direction.","In an aspect, wireless device  may support fractional system selection for applications. For fractional system selection, an application may be partitioned into different fractions (i.e., parts or portions) that may be mapped to different radios for a given direction, one fraction of the application per radio. Fractional system selection may be used to improve performance for the application and\/or obtain other benefits.","An application may be partitioned into fractions in various manners. In one design, the application may have a number of flows, and each flow may correspond to a fraction of the application. A flow may correspond to a logical entity, a logical channel, a physical channel, a traffic channel, a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) flow, an Internet Protocol (IP) flow, a TCP\/IP socket, etc. In general, a flow may comprise a stream of continuous or non-continuous data having certain characteristics. Data belonging to a flow may be identified based on the type of the data (e.g., traffic data or control data), requirements of the data, a source of the data, a destination of the data, etc. For example, an application for voice-over-IP (VoIP) may have one or more flows for traffic data and one or more flows for control data. In one design, a logical switch may receive data for an application at an input and may provide different portions of the data for the application to different flows at multiple outputs of the logical switch. A flow may be further partitioned into a number of subflows. An application may be partitioned into fractions in other manners.","Different fractions of an application may be mapped to different radios in various manners. In one design, different fractions of the application may be mapped to different radios based on requirements of the application, the capabilities of the radios, etc. For example, some radios may be able to provide certain QoS guarantees while other radios may not be able to provide QoS guarantees. The QoS guarantees may relate to a particular maximum delay, a particular minimum data rate or throughput, a particular average data rate, a particular peak data rate, etc. Some flows may have QoS requirements and may be mapped to radios with QoS guarantees that can satisfy the QoS requirements of the flows. Other flows may not have any QoS requirements and may be mapped to any radios including those with no QoS guarantees. Applications may also be mapped to radios based on other factors, as described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["110","1","4","1","3","1","1","2","3","1","4","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["2","1","2","110","1","1","4","1","2","1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 3C","FIG. 3C"],"b":["3","2","3","110","2","4","2","3","1","3","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 3D","FIG. 3D"],"b":["4","3","1","110","2","3","1","1","1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 3D"},"Flow mobility in  and  and\/or fractional flow mobility in  may be supported (i) by wireless device  using one or more protocols such as Dual Stack Mobile IP version 6 (DSMIPv6) and (ii) by one or more network entities such as, e.g., a Home Agent (HA).","In general, a fraction f of an application may refer to any percentage of the application less than 100% and may be within a range of 0 to 1, so that 0\u2266f<1.

The interconnection between a given application APPm and a given radio Rn may be associated with a particular percentage, which may be referred to as a trellis percentage. This percentage may be within the range of 0 and 100 and may be indicative of the fraction of application APPm being mapped to radio Rn. In a fully connected trellis, there may be M*N interconnections between the M applications and the N radios, as shown in . However, some interconnections may be associated with a percentage of 0 and may be removed from the trellis.","In general, M active applications may be mapped to N available radios based on full and\/or fractional system selection. For example, some applications may be mapped to radios based on fractional system selection, and remaining applications may be mapped to radios based on full system selection. An application may be mapped to multiple radios with fractional system selection or to a single radio with full system selection.","For fractional system selection, fractions of each application may be mapped to different radios based on a mapping function, which may be referred to as a gamma function or algorithm. In one design, the mapping function may perform both (i) radio selection to determine which radios to select for use and (ii) fractional flow assignment to determine which fraction of each application to map to each selected radio. In another design, the mapping function may only perform fractional flow assignment to determine which fraction of each application to map to each selected radio. For both designs, the mapping function may be defined in various manners and based on any set of inputs. In one design, the mapping function may be defined based on one or more of the following:\n\n","The requirements of applications may be quantified by various parameters such as minimum throughput (e.g., 100 Kbps), maximum latency (e.g., 1 millisecond (ms)), maximum jitter, maximum connection time (e.g., 250 ms), maximum call drop rate (e.g., 10), etc. Different applications may have different requirements. For example, applications such as video streaming may have minimum throughput and maximum latency requirements. These applications may stall or fail if these requirements are not met in real time. Other applications such as FTP may have no fundamental minimum throughput or maximum latency requirements. Hence, a user\/desired throughput and no minimum latency may be specified for these applications, and the traffic for these applications may be regarded as best effort.","In general, an application may or may not provide its requirements to connection manager  and\/or other modules within wireless device . If an application does not explicitly provide its requirements, then one or more requirements of the application may be determined based on any information available for the application. For example, a data rate requirement for an application may be determined from an application data stream format, which may contain source coding overhead to ensure error free reception at a receiver.","In one design, application requirements and\/or network impact in terms of traffic and\/or signaling loading may be exchanged between wireless device  and a network. Wireless device  may use the information on traffic and\/or signaling loading at the network to select radios, to map applications to radios, and\/or to perform other functions.","The preferences of applications may be provided by the profile database. For example, an application may prefer a particular radio over other radios when several radios are available.","The status of wireless device  may include battery state of the wireless device, currently active applications in the wireless device, applications that are in a queue awaiting execution based on conditions such as sufficient battery power or sufficient network capabilities, actual or estimated impact of applications on the radio technologies supported by wireless device , etc. The constraints of wireless device  may include battery life, channel conditions for active radios in wireless device , known or determined interference or other impacts among active radios in wireless device , known or determined impacts of multiple concurrent applications on processing capability of wireless device  and\/or on network traffic and\/or signaling congestion, etc.","The capabilities of radios may be quantified by the performance of the radios, the features or functions supported by the radios, etc. The performance of the radios may be quantified by various performance metrics, which may include interference-related metrics. The interference-related metrics may be dependent on interference between radios and may include (i) the amount of desense on a receiver radio due to transmit power from a transmitter radio on wireless device , (ii) the percentage of time overlap of two or more radios in time division multiplex (TDM) operation, (iii) the amount of frequency overlap in frequency division multiplex (FDM) or concurrent operation, and\/or (iv) other metrics related to interference. The performance metrics may be indicative of performance of radios and may include (i) the percentage level of congestion of a link from a maximum rate, (ii) the percentage level of delay in a link from nominal, etc.","The performance metrics may be a function of time and may be dependent on various factors such as which radios are available and selected, the operating state of each radio, the requirements of active applications, channel conditions, etc. The operating state of a radio may be a function of the particular settings of different configurable parameters of the radio. The performance metrics may be represented in various forms such as with a scalar, a vector, a matrix, etc. For example, a performance metric may be given by a \u201ccolor\u201d of a cell in a color chart and may take on one of a limited number of colors (e.g., green, yellow, and red). A performance metric may be given in a form that may be dependent on the techniques used to mitigate interference.","Some performance metrics may be measured directly by wireless device  whereas other performance metrics may be computed from measurements. Some examples of measurable performance metrics may include metrics related to throughput, latency, jitter, etc. Computable performance metrics may be obtained by measuring certain quantities (e.g., interference levels between transmitter and receiver radios, receiver desense, etc.) and converting the measured quantities to performance metrics (e.g., throughput).","Performance metrics may be used to consider the impact of interference environment with coexisting radios on wireless device . In general, application requirements are typically harder to meet with increased interference. The amount of degradation due to interference (e.g., throughput versus interference) may be quantified by computer simulation, modeling, empirical measurement, etc., and may be used to compute performance metrics. Different application requirements may have different dependencies on interference level. Some application requirements such as throughput and latency may be more immune to interference level than connection time and call drop rate. These different levels of immunity may be taken into account by the mapping function to gauge acceptable interference levels or trigger points for different applications.","The mapping function may be implemented in various manners. An exemplary implementation of the mapping function for one application is described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","612","614","616","618","620"]},"Otherwise, if the first candidate radio by itself cannot serve the application, then a next candidate radio may be selected to potentially serve the application (block ).
