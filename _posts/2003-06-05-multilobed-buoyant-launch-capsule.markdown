{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an assembly that will launch a missile or other unmanned aerial vehicles and more specifically to a multi-part launch capsule with projecting lobes along the length of the capsule in which the lobes are capable of encompassing the fixed wings of a missile or the fixed wings of other unmanned aerial vehicles.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","It is generally known in the art that launch capsules are cylindrically shaped with the length of the cylinder being longer than the length of the payload of a missile or unmanned aerial vehicle. As such, known launch capsule construction requires very long capsules with an inside diameter that is larger than the tip-to-tip wingspan of the payload. Although launch capsules that are slightly longer than the vertical payload length can be made buoyant, the length over the diameter ratio is often too low to allow a stable ascent when the capsule is launched from an underwater structure.","Adding fins to the outside of the launch capsule compensates the length to diameter ratio and thereby enhances a stable ascent of the capsule. However, by adding fins to the capsule or by increasing the overall length of the capsule, the ability to stack multiple capsules either side-by-side or vertically is limited.","An improvement to the structure of existing launch capsules would be the ability to increase the storing or stacking numbers of multiple launch capsules while maintaining or enhancing the stability of the capsules during a buoyant ascent. The stability of the launch capsule should not require the addition of fins to the capsule and should not require an increase in the length of the capsule.","An additional improvement to the formation of launch capsules would be the use of materials that are more cost-effective and are more environmentally conscious than those materials presently used in the formation of launch capsules.","Accordingly, the present invention comprises a launch capsule assembly with a main body for housing the payload, a top cap positioned on a top end of the main body and a bottom cap positioned on a bottom end of the main body. The main body includes a plurality of lobes as contributing to the interior of the body. The lobes project perpendicularly away from the longitudinal axis of the body with the interior of each projecting lobe sized to accommodate at least one projecting fin of the payload. The projecting lobes which extend the length of the main body increase the stability of the launch capsule assembly while it travels to the surface under its buoyant force.","The top cap removably attaches to the top of the main body wherein the top cap projects hydrodynamically from an open end of the main body. The top cap is jettisoned prior to launch. The bottom cap removably attaches to the bottom of the main body. The bottom cap is used for the launch of the missile when the capsule broaches the water surface and can be removable for access to the interior of main body during assembly. In addition, the bottom cap can have a matching cross-section to the main body of the capsule.","The main body is formed to be a buoyant elongated structure capable of storing the payload of a missile or other unmanned vehicle. Preferably, the main body is formed by infusing a fiberglass cloth resin over a male mandrel. By infusing the fiberglass cloth, the launch capsule assembly is formed to be buoyant in a cost-effective and more environmentally conscious manner than by known methods of forming launch capsules such as by filament wound mandrels.","Additionally, the fiberglass cloth may be infused with epoxy or vinyl ester in circumstances that require additional strengthening of the main body. Alternatively, a graphite\/epoxy composite may be infused on the mandrel in lieu of fiberglass cloth resin.","Referring now to  there is shown a launch capsule assembly  that will launch by buoyancy a missile or an unmanned aerial vehicle. The launch capsule assembly  comprises an elongated main body , a top cap  and a bottom cap .","The main body  can be formed by infusing a fiberglass cloth resin over a male mandrel. Additionally, the fiberglass cloth may be infused with epoxy or vinyl ester in circumstances that require additional strengthening of the main body . Alternatively, a graphite\/epoxy composite may be infused on the mandrel in lieu of fiberglass cloth resin.","As shown in the cross-sectional view of , the interior of the main body  is sized to accommodate a payload  such as a missile or an unmanned aerial vehicle. The main body  includes one or more lobes  as part of the interior of the body. The lobes  project perpendicularly away from the center axis  of the main body  with the interior of each projecting lobe  sized to accommodate at least one projecting wing or fin  of the payload .","Depending on the type of payload  being used and\/or the stowage requirements of the launch capsule assembly , the size of the lobe  may vary to accommodate an extended fin or the folded fin  shown in the figure. Additionally, the number of lobes  may vary depending on the type of payload  and\/or the stowage requirements of the launch capsule assembly . As shown in , the projecting lobes  cover the length of the main body  to allow travel of the payload  in movement direction A during launch. The lobes  also increase the stability of the launch capsule assembly  while the launch capsule travels by its buoyant force to the surface in the movement direction \u201cA\u201d.","The top cap  removably attaches to the main body  as shown in detail in FIG. . The top cap  has a hydrodynamic shape such as a hemisphere or a paraboloid allowing fluid flow thereover. Similar to the main body , the top cap  can be formed by infusing a fiberglass cloth resin over a male mandrel. In the figure, explosive bolts  attach the top cap  to the main body , with each explosive bolt attached in a recessed pocket  of the top cap . The explosive bolts  are secured to the main body  by nuts (not shown) that fit into a threaded aperture  in an undercut of the main body. When the launch capsule assembly  broaches the water surface, the top cap  is removed by the explosive bolts . The explosive bolts  can be substituted by any other attachment means known to those ordinarily skilled in the art.","In the case of more than one projecting lobe , the recessed pockets  of the top cap  may align with the spacing between the lobes of the main body . This alignment of the recessed pockets  further enhances the stability of the launch is capsule assembly . Additionally, the recessed pockets  in conjunction with the hydrodynamically shaped top cap  allow ease of travel in movement direction \u201cA\u201d during launch.","The bottom cap  also removably attaches to the main body  as shown in FIG. . The bottom cap  is preferably made from steel and is machined to have a matching cross-section to the main body . The bottom cap  is attached by bolts (not shown) to undercut of the main body  similar to that used for the attachment of the main body to the top cap . Explosive bolts  or other attachment means known to those ordinarily skilled in the art can also be used for the bottom cap , if removal of the bottom cap  is required during launch. In a variant of the present invention shown in FIG.  and shown in the enlarged view of , the main body  further includes stiffening ribs . Based upon the strengthening or weight requirements of the launch capsule , the stiffening rib  may be a built-up area of fiberglass resin cloth as shown in detail in  or a separate section adhering to the main body . To provide shock and vibration isolation of the payload  and to further stabilize the payload , the stiffening rib  can additionally comprise a steel shock mount  in which the shock mount  is coated with an elastomeric material .","Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above teachings. In light of the above, it is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00018","num":"00018"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00019","num":"00019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
