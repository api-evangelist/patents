title: Unified messaging system configured for management of short message service-type messages
abstract: A unified communications system is configured for receiving, storing, and/or sending SMS messages based on management of the SMS messages according to a prescribed open standards-based protocol. The unified communications system includes an SMS module configured for receiving SMS messages according to SMPP protocol. The SMS module obtains source and destination information from the received SMS message, and accesses a subscriber profile directory for subscriber profile information based on at least one of the source and destination information. The SMS module generates a common format message that includes the SMS message, and selectively supplies the common format message to selected destinations based on the accessed subscriber profile information. The common format message may be stored in a prescribed message store, for example an IMAP directory, or output as an e-mail message to a prescribed destination. The SMS module also is configured for selectively supplying stored messages to a unified messaging subscriber as an SMS message based on the profile information on the unified messaging subscriber. Hence, the unified communications system enables SMS messaging users to send SMS messages to non SMS-type devices (e.g., telephones, e-mail clients, etc.) and retrieve stored common format messages (e.g., fax, e-mail, voice messages) using the SMS message system.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to unified messaging systems configured for receiving, storing, and supplying messages to a subscriber, independent of message format or the type of device used by the sender of the message or the subscriber accessing the messages.","2. Description of the Related Art","The evolution of the public switched telephone network has resulted in a variety of voice applications and services that can be provided to individual subscribers and business subscribers. Such services include voice messaging systems that enable landline or wireless subscribers to record, playback, and forward voice mail messages. However, the ability to provide enhanced services to subscribers of the public switched telephone network is directly affected by the limitations of the public switched telephone network. In particular, the public switched telephone network operates according to a protocol that is specifically designed for the transport of voice signals; hence any modifications necessary to provide enhanced services can only be done by switch vendors that have sufficient know-how of the existing public switched telephone network infrastructure.","Short Message Services (SMS) have been implemented in wireless telephone communications systems as a way to send a message to a subscriber's wireless phone. SMS messages have become quite popular recently, due in part from wireless telephone service providers offering SMS as a free service in conjunction with wireless telephony services; hence, many wireless subscribers have developed a preference to communicating using SMS as opposed to more costly wireless voice services. A messaging server, also referred to as a Short Message Service Center (SMSC), is configured for receiving an SMS message from a messaging source according to Short Message Peer to Peer Protocol (SMPP). The messaging source may be, for example, a cellphone supplying a user-input message, or an e-mail interface resident within the wireless telephone communications system. The SMSC, in response to receiving the SMS message from the messaging source, transmits a short message to the cellular phone based on the destination telephone number specified within the notification message. However, this arrangement still provides only limited flexibility in enabling different sources to send an SMS message to a cellular phone. In addition, existing cellphones are limited by memory to storing up to ten SMS messages. Moreover, this arrangement limits the ability of an SMS subscriber having a cellphone to send messages to a destination that does not have an SMS-capable cellphone.","Unified communications systems are under development as a way of enhancing messaging services for users such as wireless telephone subscribers. A disadvantage of unified communications systems implemented as enhanced versions of the voice mail system, paging system, or e-mail interface resident within the wireless telephone communications system is that such implementation requires detailed knowledge of the proprietary protocols associated with the voice mail systems. Hence, such implementations are available only from switch vendors having knowledge of the proprietary protocols.","Use of a unified communications system implemented independent of the existing proprietary voice mail systems enables service providers to use scalable and distributed systems using recognized communication protocols. Hence, the service providers may use such unified communications systems across multiple platforms, independent of protocol, for storage of various types of messages, for example voice messages, facsimile, and e-mail stored in a centralized messaging store. However, existing unified communications systems still have not address the need for integrating SMS messaging within the unified messaging scheme; hence, unified messaging subscribers have not been able to fully utilize the beneficial features of sending and receiving SMS messages.","There is a need for an arrangement that enables open standards-based unified messaging systems to receive, store, and\/or send unified messages for a SMS messaging subscriber.","There also is a need for an arrangement that enables an open standards-based unified messaging system to store SMS messages for a unified messaging subscriber for retrieval by a user access device independent of device protocol.","There also is a need for an arrangement that enables an SMS subscriber to send an SMS message to multiple destinations based on a prescribed distribution list.","There also is a need for an arrangement that enables a unified messaging subscriber to retrieve stored messages based on transfer of the stored messages to the unified messaging subscriber according to SMS message protocol.","These and other needs are attained by the present invention, where a unified communications system is configured for receiving, storing, and\/or sending SMS messages based on management of the SMS messages according to a prescribed open standards-based protocol. The unified communications system includes an SMS module configured for receiving SMS messages according to SMPP protocol. The SMS module obtains source and destination information from the received SMS message, and accesses a subscriber profile directory for subscriber profile information based on at least one of the source and destination information. The SMS module generates a common format message that includes the SMS message, and selectively supplies the common format message to selected destinations based on the accessed subscriber profile information. The common format message may be stored in a prescribed message store, for example an IMAP directory, or output as an e-mail message to a prescribed destination. The SMS module also is configured for selectively supplying stored messages to a unified messaging subscriber as an SMS message based on the profile information on the unified messaging subscriber. Hence, the unified communications system enables SMS messaging users to send SMS messages to non SMS-type devices (e.g., telephones, e-mail clients, etc.) and retrieve stored common format messages (e.g., fax, e-mail, voice messages) using the SMS message system.","One aspect of the present invention provides a method in a server. The method includes receiving a short message service (SMS) message according to short message peer-to-peer (SMPP) protocol. The method also includes accessing a subscriber directory, according to an open network protocol, for subscriber attribute information based on the received SMS message. The server generates, based on the subscriber attribute information, at least one common format message that includes the SMS message, and supplies the common format message to a selected destination according to a selected access protocol based on the subscriber attribute information. The generation of a common format message that includes the SMS message enables storage of the SMS message in unified message stores configured for storing unified messages for subscribers, for example according to IMAP protocol. Moreover, the generation of a common format message enables the SMS message to be sent to a destination according to any subscriber-selected protocol, for example as an e-mail message, a fax message, a voice message using text to speech resources, etc.","Another aspect of the present invention provides a server comprising a short message service (SMS) module, a first interface resource, and a second interface resource. The SMS module is configured for receiving SMS messages according to short message peer to peer (SMPP) protocol, and also is configured for generating a query for subscriber attribute information based on the received SMS message, and generating at least one common format message based on the subscriber attribute information and that includes the SMS message. The first interface resource is configured for accessing the subscriber attribute information based on the query from a subscriber directory according to a prescribed open network protocol, and the second interface resource is configured for outputting the at least one common format message according to at least one of SMTP protocol and IMAP protocol.","Additional advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned by practice of the invention. The advantages of the present invention may be realized and attained by means of instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","20","22","20"]},"The inventors have realized that SMS messages can be managed as true message types that can be received, stored, and retrieved from the unified messaging system . In particular, the disclosed embodiment contemplates enhancing the existing Cisco uOne system by addition within the unified messaging system  of an SMS module  configured for sending and receiving SMS messages via SMPP protocol.","In addition, the SMS module  is configured for accessing standardized application programming interfaces (APIs)  executable within the unified messaging system . Hence, the SMS module  is able to access an LDAP API for subscriber profile information from a subscriber directory  according to LDAP protocol: such subscriber profile information may include subscriber notification preferences, as well as distribution lists established by the subscribers. Hence, the SMS module  can generate multiple SMS messages for respective destinations based on reception of an SMS message that specifies a subscriber distribution list. In addition, the SMS module  is able to access the IMAP message store  via an IMAP API for storage of SMS messages in a common format recognizable by the IMAP message store , enabling the SMS message to the stored and retrieved as part of the unified messages managed by the unified messaging system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["40","42","24","24","42","50","52","52","46","48","50"]},"The SMS module  is configured for inserting the SMS message  into the body , and specifying within the type field  a designation that identifies the unicode text within the body  as an SMS message type. The MIME wrapper  is then attached to a common format, e-mail message  having source and destination address fields selected based on subscriber profile information within the LDAP directory  accessed by the SMS module . For example, the e-mail message  may be output by the SMS module  for storage in the IMAP message store , either in the sending party's \u201csent\u201d folder, or within at least one destination party's \u201cinbox\u201d folder, and possibly within a subdirectory for SMS messages. Alternatively, the e-mail message  may be output via an SMTP API according to SMTP protocol to another remote messaging server (e.g., another unified messaging system ), enabling the SMS message to be sent to a destination SMSC in a manner that bypasses existing SMPP links.","Hence, the generation of the common format message  for storage of the SMS message  in an IMAP message store  enables the unified messaging system  to receive and send SMS messages, as needed. Hence, the SMS module  enables the SMS messages  to be handled as any other unified message, such as a voice message, an e-mail message, a fax, etc. For example, text to speech (TTS) services  can be used by the SMS module  to convert the unicode text within the SMS message  into a stored voice message for a subscriber.","In addition, the SMS module  can generate a new SMS message based on retrieval of a unified message from the IMAP message store  of a selected subscriber. For example, stored voice messages can be converted to unicode text format for generation of a new SMS message  using available speech to text (STT) resources . Alternatively, the new SMS message  may be generated based on recovery of the unicode text obtained from another SMS message  received by the SMS module .","The SMS module  may also generate the SMS message  as part of a notification service for a subscriber, enabling a subscriber to obtain a daily status of stored messages within the IMAP message store , illustrated in further detail below. Hence, the SMS module  provides two-way conversion for SMS messages, where a received SMS message  is stored in a common format e-mail message , and where a common format e-mail message having a stored message in a prescribed format (e.g., voice) is converted to unicode text for generation of a new SMS message  to be supplied to the subscriber.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A","FIGS. 3A"],"b":["3","3","24","3","3"]},"The method of  begins in step , where a sending party using a mobile phone or other SMS capable device (e.g., a wireless personal digital assistant)  sends a short message to the SMSC . The SMSC  accesses SMS subscriber information in step  from an SMS subscriber directory  based on the source address (SA) or destination address (DA) specified within the SMS message. If neither source address nor destination address specify auto forwarding to the unified messaging system , the SMSC sends the short message in step  to the wireless device specified by the destination address; however if the SMS subscriber information in the SMS subscriber directory  specifies that either the source address or destination address wants a copy of the SMS message forwarded to the unified messaging system , the SMSC  also sends a copy of the short message in step  to the unified messaging server  via SMPP protocol.","The SMS module , upon receiving the SMS message  via SMPP protocol, generates a query in step  for subscriber profile information from the subscriber registry  using the LDAP API . The SMS module  obtains any distribution list based on the sending party address information in step , and obtains destination party address information in step , specifying the preferred destination device (e.g., Web client, telephone, wireless PDA, cellphone, etc.) or IMAP directory location. The SMS module  encloses in step  the received SMS message  into a common format message such as an e-mail message , as illustrated in , specifying a destination address based on the destination party address information. The SMS module  then stores in step  the e-mail messages  in the appropriate destination subscriber inbox folders of the IMAP directory .","Hence, the received SMS message , upon specifying a prescribed distribution list in its destination field, enables the SMS module  to generate multiple e-mail messages for respective destination subscribers having respective messaging folders in the IMAP directory .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["24","54","22","78","24","28","24","80","24","54","82","54","84"]},"Hence, the SMS module  can be used to generate a new SMS message  that provides a message list to be sent to a unified messaging subscriber. The unified messaging subscriber, upon receipt of the SMS message  on his for her SMS enabled device, can then select messages specified within the SMS message for retrieval or deletion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["24","22","86","20"]},"The SMS module  accesses the selected message from the subscriber's IMAP directory  in step , and determines in step  whether the MIME type  specifies that the body  includes an SMS message. If the MIME type  specifies an SMS message type, the SMS module  extracts in step  the SMS message from the body  of the MIME wrapper  attached to the e-mail message  for generation of the new SMS message . However if in step  the MIME type specifies another type of message, the SMS module  converts in step  the message to unicode text format, for example using speech to text (STT) resources . The SMS module  outputs the new SMS message  in step  via SMPP for delivery to the subscriber's SMS enabled device.","According to the disclosed embodiment, a unified messaging system includes an SMS module that enables the unified messaging system to receive and store SMS messages as unified messages in a standardized message store. Moreover, the unified messaging system can generate SMS messages, based on subscriber preferences, enabling users to receive any type of stored message (e.g., voice, fax, e-mail, etc.) using an SMS enabled device.","While this invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the attached drawings, wherein elements having the same reference numeral designations represent like elements throughout and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A","FIG. 1"],"b":["3","3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
