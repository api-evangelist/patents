{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","I. Overview","II. Example Environment","III. Example Playback Device","IV. Example Controller","V. Example Ad-Hoc Network","VI. Example Hidden Network Access and Network Switching"],"p":["The disclosure is related to consumer electronics and, more particularly, to connect one or more devices to a playback data network.","Technological advancements have increased the accessibility of music content, as well as other types of media, such as television content, movies, and interactive content. For example, a user can access audio, video, or both audio and video content over the Internet through an online store, an Internet radio station, an online music service, an online movie service, and the like, in addition to the more traditional avenues of accessing audio and video content. Demand for such audio and video content continues to surge. Given the high demand, technology used to access and play such content has likewise improved.","In addition, the drawings are for the purpose of illustrating example embodiments, but it is understood that the present disclosure is not limited to the arrangements and instrumentality shown in the drawings.","Wired or wireless networks can be used to connect one or more multimedia playback devices for a home or other location playback network (e.g., a home music system). Certain examples provide automatic configuration of parameters of a playback device to be coupled to a network with reduced or minimum human intervention. For example, a wired and\/or wireless ad-hoc network is established to facilitate communications among a group of devices. When a new device is added to the network, a rudimentary communication path is initially established between one of the devices (\u201cfirst device\u201d) in the network and the new device (\u201csecond device\u201d) such that parameters (e.g., service set identifier (SSID), Basic Service Set Identification (BSSID), Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) security, channel frequency, and so on) can be exchanged for the new device to function properly in the network. To help ensure the parameters are exchanged in a secure fashion, an additional public security procedure can be used between the two devices, for example. To help ensure a good connection, a device can be configured to switch between available networks based on observed network characteristics.","Although the following discloses example systems, methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture including, among other components, firmware and\/or software executed on hardware, it should be noted that such systems, methods, apparatus, and\/or articles of manufacture are merely illustrative and should not be considered as limiting. For example, it is contemplated that any or all of these firmware, hardware, and\/or software components could be embodied exclusively in hardware, exclusively in software, exclusively in firmware, or in any combination of hardware, software, and\/or firmware. Accordingly, while the following describes example systems, methods, apparatus, and\/or articles of manufacture, the examples provided are not the only way(s) to implement such systems, methods, apparatus, and\/or articles of manufacture.","When any of the appended claims are read to cover a purely software and\/or firmware implementation, at least one of the elements in at least one example is hereby expressly defined to include a tangible medium such as a memory, DVD, CD, Blu-ray, and so on, storing the software and\/or firmware.","These embodiments and many additional embodiments are described more below. Further, the detailed description is presented largely in terms of illustrative environments, systems, procedures, steps, logic blocks, processing, and other symbolic representations that directly or indirectly resemble the operations of data processing devices coupled to networks. These process descriptions and representations are typically used by those skilled in the art to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. Numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However, it is understood to those skilled in the art that certain embodiments of the present disclosure can be practiced without certain, specific details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and circuitry have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the embodiments.","Reference herein to \u201cembodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment can be included in at least one example embodiment of the invention. The appearances of this phrase in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. As such, the embodiments described herein, explicitly and implicitly understood by one skilled in the art, can be combined with other embodiments.","Certain examples provide a network, such as a wireless network (e.g., a wireless mesh network) used to connect multimedia playback devices, also referred to herein as zone players. A controller, such as a controller running on a smart phone (e.g., an Android\u2122 smartphone, and Apple iPhone\u2122, and Apple iPad\u2122, and so on), a controller running on a personal computer, a dedicated controller (e.g., a Sonos CR 200\u2122), and so on, can be used to control music playback and\/or other activity on the one or more zone players connected to the network.","Certain embodiments provide a multi-room music system designed to play music throughout a house, vehicle, or other location via a wireless network. Unlike most other wireless networks, to simplify setup, encryption keys and SSIDs are automatically generated so a user does not have to manually generate them. Reliable playback of music or other multimedia content can be facilitated.","A traditional wireless access point system with a central hub relaying all the traffic typically does not provide a large enough range of coverage for an entire home or a desired level of performance for synchronized digital music playback (e.g., no dead spots or low signal strength). As long as each zone player is in range of another zone player, the wireless network can determine how to route music or other content from the Internet and a user's computer to the rooms where the user wants to enjoy it. Controllers are handed off transparently from one zone player to the next so that a user can control the system from the location.","In certain embodiments, a controller can connect to the network for playback via a variety of connections including via a local (e.g., home) wireless (e.g., WiFi) access point, such as a wireless router, and a local node formed by a zone player on the network. Thus, the controller can connect to the network and control multimedia playback or other zone player function via either a wireless access point or a zone player connected to the network. In certain embodiments, a controller can execute on a wireless device that can roam between a WiFi access point and a local zone player node. In certain embodiments, each network is associated with a different SSID, so the controller device is roaming between two different networks rather than roaming and connecting to the same network when in range, for example.","In certain embodiments one or more zone players connected to the wireless network utilize radio technology in conjunction with a multiple antenna configuration designed to accommodate a user's hands holding the device to select music or other content. For example, a three antenna configuration allows a zone player to operate at maximum efficiency to send and receive with an expected signal strength to provide a best possible wireless range and performance.","Certain embodiments provide an ability to connect a wireless device to a hidden network without the device or person knowing the network name or having to type in the network name (e.g., discovery and connection). For example, if a WiFi access point is not available, a controller (e.g., a smartphone controller) can connect to the hidden network without requiring the user to type in the network name and without the smartphone knowing the network exists.","In certain embodiments, setup technology searches for a wireless channel with the least interference and sets up a wireless network that is secure by default. A mesh networking stack is provided to automatically optimize the path on which data travels within a house or other location, so playback is heard without interruption. In certain embodiments, multi-casting support is incorporated to facilitate delivery of the same data (e.g., the same song) to multiple rooms efficiently.","In certain embodiments, with a wireless (e.g., WiFi) connection, the wireless mesh network (e.g., SonosNet\u2122 network) is placed second on a list of available networks, such that if a smartphone controller is out of range of a WiFi access point, then the smartphone will use the mesh network as the access point. Thus, since data can pass through a zone player as if the zone player was a WiFi access point, a local node zone player can be used as a connection point for multimedia playback, Web surfing, and so on. In certain embodiments, a wireless device (e.g., a smartphone) can select between a WiFi access point and a local zone player node as a network access point based on one or more criteria (e.g., which offers the best signal, least interference, and so on).","Embodiments of the systems, methods, apparatus, and\/or articles of manufacture disclosed herein provide for network detection, control and management in connection with multimedia playback devices. As described in greater detail below, the systems, methods, apparatus, and\/or articles of manufacture disclosed herein provide users of a wireless device, such as a phone or tablet computer, with an ability to connect to a hidden network. Systems, methods, apparatus, and\/or articles of manufacture disclosed herein provide users of a wireless device, such as a phone or tablet computer, with an ability to monitor and switch among a plurality of available connections to maintain access to control and playback multimedia content.","Certain embodiments provide a method to connect a wireless device to a hidden network without the device or user network knowing or typing in the network name. The example method includes detecting, via a multimedia playback device, a network connection request to an audio network, the audio network unspecified in the request and available but hidden at a location. The example method includes triggering, via the multimedia playback device, a connection phase to connect the wireless device to the hidden audio network. The example method includes revealing a network access point with a preset identifier to the wireless device to which the wireless device can connect using a predefined password valid during the connection phase. The example method includes authenticating the wireless device with the audio network using the predefined password via the network access point and associating the wireless device with the audio network with limited connectivity to the audio network during the connection phase. The example method includes disconnecting the wireless device from the audio network. The example method includes accepting a connection of the wireless to the audio network in an operational phase, the connection enabled using information provided to the wireless device during the connection phase and without the limited connectivity provided in the connection phase.","Certain embodiments provide an example multimedia playback device connected to a local multimedia playback network that is configured to not provide an indicator of existence absent a command from the multimedia playback device, the multimedia playback device is to initiate a connection phase for a device to connect to the hidden network based on a user action at the multimedia playback device. The multimedia playback device is to: reveal a network access point with a preset identifier to the wireless device to which the wireless device can connect using a predefined password valid during the connection phase; authenticate the wireless device with the audio network using the predefined password via the network access point and associating the wireless device with the audio network with limited connectivity to the audio network during the connection phase; disconnect the wireless device from the audio network; and accept a connection of the wireless to the audio network in an operational phase, the connection enabled using information provided to the wireless device during the connection phase and without the limited connectivity provided in the connection phase.","Certain embodiments provide a computer readable storage medium including instructions for execution by a processor. The instructions, when executed, cause the processor to implement a method to connect a device to a playback network.","Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals can refer to like parts throughout the figures,  shows an example system configuration  in which one or more of the method and\/or apparatus disclosed herein can be practiced or implemented. By way of illustration, the system configuration  represents a home with multiple zones. Each zone, for example, represents a different room or space, such as an office, bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, dining room, family room, home theater room, utility or laundry room, and patio. While not shown here, a single zone can cover more than one room or space. One or more of zone players - are shown in each respective zone. A zone player -, also referred to as a playback device, multimedia unit, speaker, and so on, provides audio, video, and\/or audiovisual output. A controller  (e.g., shown in the kitchen for purposes of illustration) provides control to the system configuration . The system configuration  illustrates an example whole house audio system, though it is understood that the technology described herein is not limited to its particular place of application or to an expansive system like a whole house audio system  of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A","FIGS. 2A","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["2","2","200","204","200","204","2","2","102","124","200","208","208","200","200","200","200"]},"The example zone player  of  includes a built-in amplifier (not shown in this illustration) to power a set of detached speakers . The speakers  of  can include, for example, any type of loudspeaker. The zone player  of  can communicate a signal corresponding to audio content to the detached speakers  via wired and\/or wireless channels. Instead of receiving and generating audio content as in , the zone player  of  receives the audio content and transmits the same (e.g., after processing the received signal) to the detached speakers . Similar to the example zone player  of , in some embodiments the zone player  can transmit a second signal to, for example, other zone player(s) in the same or different zone(s), speaker(s), receiver(s), and so on.","The example zone player  of  does not include an amplifier, but allows a receiver , or another audio and\/or video type device with built-in amplification, to connect to a data network  of  and to play audio received over the data network  via the receiver  and a set of detached speakers . In addition to the wired couplings shown in , the detached speakers  can receive audio content via a wireless communication channel between the detached speakers  and, for example, the zone player  and\/or the receiver . In some embodiments the zone player  can transmit a second signal to, for example, other zone player(s) in the same or different zone(s), speaker(s), receiver(s), and so on.","Example zone players include a \u201cSonos\u00ae S5,\u201d \u201cSonos Play:5,\u201d \u201cSonos Play:3,\u201d \u201cZonePlayer 120,\u201d and \u201cZonePlayer 90,\u201d which are offered by Sonos, Inc. of Santa Barbara, Calif. Any other past, present, and\/or future zone players can additionally or alternatively be used to implement the zone players of example embodiments disclosed herein. A zone player can also be referred to herein as a playback device, and a zone player is not limited to the particular examples illustrated in , B, and C. For example, a zone player can include a wired or wireless headphone. In other examples, a zone player might include a subwoofer. In yet other examples, a zone player can include a sound bar. In an example, a zone player can include or interact with a docking station for an Apple iPod\u2122 or similar device. In some embodiments, a zone player can relay one or more signals received from, for example, a first zone player to another playback device. In some embodiments, a zone player can receive a first signal and generate an output corresponding to the first signal and, simultaneously or separately, can receive a second signal and transmit or relay the second signal to another zone player(s), speaker(s), receiver(s), and so on. Thus, an example zone player described herein can act as a playback device and, at the same time, operate as a hub in a network of zone players. In such instances, media content corresponding to the first signal can be different from the media content corresponding to the second signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","302","300","130","300","304","300","100","100","100","300","128","128","200"]},"Referring back to the system configuration  of , a particular zone can contain one or more zone players. For example, the family room of  contains two zone players  and , while the kitchen is shown with one zone player . Zones can be dynamically configured by positioning a zone player in a room or space and assigning via the controller  the zone player to a new or existing zone. As such, zones can be created, combined with another zone, removed, and given a specific name (e.g., \u201cKitchen\u201d), if so programmed. The zone players  to  are coupled directly or indirectly to a data network, such as the data network  shown in . The data network  is represented by an octagon in the figure to stand out from other components shown in the figure. While the data network  is shown in a single location, it is understood that such a network can be distributed in and around the system configuration .","Particularly, the data network  can be a wired network, a wireless network, or a combination of both. In some embodiments, one or more of the zone players - are wirelessly coupled to the data network  based on a proprietary mesh network. In some embodiments, one or more of the zone players - are wirelessly coupled to the data network  using a non-mesh topology. In some embodiments, one or more of the zone players - are coupled via a wire to the data network  using Ethernet or similar technology. In addition to the one or more zone players - connecting to the data network , the data network  can further allow access to a wide area network, such as the Internet.","In certain embodiments, the data network  can be created by connecting any of the zone players -, or some other connecting device, to a broadband router. Other zone players - can then be added wired or wirelessly to the data network . For example, a zone player (e.g., any of zone players -) can be added to the system configuration  by simply pressing a button on the zone player itself, which enables a connection to be made to the data network . The broadband router can be connected to an Internet Service Provider (ISP), for example. The broadband router can be used to form another data network within the system configuration , which can be used in other applications (e.g., web surfing). The data network  can also be used in other applications, if so programmed. Further, in certain embodiments, the data network  is the same network used for other applications in the household.","In certain embodiments, each zone can play from the same audio source as another zone or each zone can play from a different audio source. For example, someone can be grilling on the patio and listening to jazz music via zone player , while someone is preparing food in the kitchen and listening to classical music via zone player . Further, someone can be in the office listening to the same jazz music via zone player  that is playing on the patio via zone player . In some embodiments, the jazz music played via zone players  and  is played in synchrony. Synchronizing playback amongst zones allows for someone to pass through zones while seamlessly listening to the audio. Further, zones can be put into a \u201cparty mode\u201d such that all associated zones will play audio in synchrony.","In certain embodiments, a zone contains two or more zone players. For example, the family room contains two zone players  and , and the home theater room contains at least zone players , , and . A zone can be configured to contain as many zone players as desired, and for example, the home theater room might contain additional zone players to play audio from a 5.1 channel or greater audio source (e.g., a movie encoded with 5.1 or greater audio channels). If a zone contains two or more zone players, such as the two zone players  and  in the family room, then the two zone players  and  can be configured to play the same audio source in synchrony, or the two zone players  and  can be paired to play two separate sounds in left and right channels, for example. In other words, the stereo effects of a sound can be reproduced or enhanced through the two zone players  and , one for the left sound and the other for the right sound. In certain embodiments, paired zone players can play audio in synchrony with other zone players.","In certain embodiments, three or more zone players can be configured to play various channels of audio that is encoded with three channels or more sound. For example, the home theater room shows zone players , , and . If the sound is encoded as 2.1 channel audio, then the zone player  can be configured to play left channel audio, the zone player  can be configured to play right channel audio, and the zone player  can be configured to play bass frequencies. Other configurations are possible and depend on the number of zone players and the type of audio. Further, a particular zone can be configured to play a 5.1 channel audio in one instance, such as when playing audio from a movie, and then dynamically switch to play stereo, such as when playing audio from a two channel source.","In certain embodiments, two or more zone players can be sonically consolidated to form a single, consolidated zone player. A consolidated zone player (though made up of multiple, separate devices) can be configured to process and reproduce sound differently than an unconsolidated zone player or zone players that are paired, because a consolidated zone player will have additional speaker drivers from which sound can be passed. The consolidated zone player can further be paired with a single zone player or yet another consolidated zone player. Each playback device of a consolidated playback device is preferably set in a consolidated mode.","According to some embodiments, one can continue to do any of: group, consolidate, and pair zone players, for example, until a desired configuration is complete. The actions of grouping, consolidation, and pairing are preferably performed through a control interface, such as using controller , and not by physically connecting and re-connecting speaker wire, for example, to individual, discrete speakers to create different configurations. As such, certain embodiments described herein provide a more flexible and dynamic platform through which sound reproduction can be offered to the end-user.","Sources of audio content to be played by zone players - are numerous. Music from a personal library stored on a computer or networked-attached storage (NAS) can be accessed via the data network  and played. Internet radio stations, shows, and podcasts can be accessed via the data network . Music services that let a user stream and download music and audio content can be accessed via the data network . Further, music can be obtained from traditional sources, such as a turntable or CD player, via a line-in connection to a zone player, for example. Audio content can also be accessed through AirPlay\u2122 wireless technology by Apple, Inc., for example. Audio content received from one or more sources can be shared amongst the zone players  to  via the data network  and\/or the controller . The above-disclosed sources of audio content are referred to herein as network-based audio information sources. However, network-based audio information sources are not limited thereto.","The example home theater zone players , ,  are coupled to an audio information source such as a television . In some examples, the television  is used as a source of audio for the home theater zone players , , , while in other examples audio information from the television  can be shared with any of the zone players - in the audio system .","Referring now to , there is shown an example functional block diagram of a zone player  in accordance with an embodiment. The zone player  of  includes a network interface , a processor , a memory , an audio processing component , a module , an audio amplifier , and a speaker unit  coupled to the audio amplifier .  shows an example illustration of such a zone player. Other types of zone players can not include the speaker unit  (e.g., such as shown in ) or the audio amplifier  (e.g., such as shown in ). Further, it is contemplated that the zone player  can be integrated into another component. For example, the zone player  could be constructed as part of a lamp for indoor or outdoor use.","Referring back to , the network interface  facilitates a data flow between zone players and other devices on a data network (e.g., the data network  of ) and the zone player . In some embodiments, the network interface  can manage the assembling of an audio source or file into smaller packets that are to be transmitted over the data network or reassembles received packets into the original source or file. In some embodiments, the network interface  can further handle the address part of each packet so that it gets to the right destination or intercepts packets destined for the zone player . Accordingly, in certain embodiments, each of the packets includes an Internet Protocol (IP)-based source address as well as an IP-based destination address.","In some embodiments, the network interface  can include one or both of a wireless interface  and a wired interface . The wireless interface , also referred to as an RF interface, provides network interface functions for the zone player  to wirelessly communicate with other devices (e.g., other zone player(s), speaker(s), receiver(s), component(s) associated with the data network , and so on) in accordance with a communication protocol (e.g., any of the wireless standards IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, or 802.15). To receive wireless signals and to provide the wireless signals to the wireless interface  and to transmit wireless signals, the zone player  of  includes one or more antennas . The wired interface  provides network interface functions for the zone player  to communicate over a wire with other devices in accordance with a communication protocol (e.g., IEEE 802.3). In some embodiments, a zone player includes both of the interfaces  and . In some embodiments, a zone player  includes only the wireless interface  or the wired interface .","In some embodiments, the processor  is a clock-driven electronic device that is configured to process input data according to instructions stored in memory . The memory  is data storage that can be loaded with one or more software modules , which can be executed by the processor  to achieve certain tasks. In the illustrated embodiment, the memory  is a tangible machine readable medium storing instructions that can be executed by the processor . In some embodiments, a task might be for the zone player  to retrieve audio data from another zone player or a device on a network. In some embodiments, a task might be for the zone player  to send audio data to another zone player or device on a network. In some embodiments, a task might be for the zone player  to synchronize playback of audio with one or more additional zone players. In some embodiments, a task might be to pair the zone player  with one or more zone players to create a multi-channel audio environment. Additional or alternative tasks can be achieved via the one or more software modules  and the processor .","The audio processing component  can include one or more digital-to-analog converters (DAC), an audio preprocessing component, an audio enhancement component or a digital signal processor, and so on. In certain embodiments, the audio that is retrieved via the network interface  is processed and\/or intentionally altered by the audio processing component . Further, the audio processing component  can produce analog audio signals. The processed analog audio signals are then provided to the audio amplifier  for play back through speakers . In addition, the audio processing component  can include necessary circuitry to process analog or digital signals as inputs to play from zone player , send to another zone player on a network, or both play and send to another zone player on the network. An example input includes a line-in connection (e.g., an auto-detecting 3.5 mm audio line-in connection).","The audio amplifier  is a device that amplifies audio signals to a level for driving one or more speakers . The one or more speakers  can include an individual transducer (e.g., a \u201cdriver\u201d) or a complete speaker system that includes an enclosure including one or more drivers. A particular driver can be a subwoofer (for low frequencies), a mid-range driver (middle frequencies), and a tweeter (high frequencies), for example. An enclosure can be sealed or ported, for example.","A zone player  can also be referred to herein as a playback device. An example playback device includes a Sonos\u00ae Play:5, which is manufactured by Sonos, Inc. of Santa Barbara, Calif. The Play:5 is an example zone player with a built-in amplifier and speakers. In particular, the Play:5 is a five-driver speaker system that includes two tweeters, two mid-range drivers, and one subwoofer. When playing audio content via the Play:5, the left audio data of a track is sent out of the left tweeter and left mid-range driver, the right audio data of a track is sent out of the right tweeter and the right mid-range driver, and mono bass is sent out of the subwoofer. Further, both mid-range drivers and both tweeters have the same equalization (or substantially the same equalization). That is, they are both sent the same frequencies, just from different channels of audio. Audio from Internet radio stations, online music and video services, downloaded music, analog audio inputs, television, DVD, and so on, can be played from a Sonos\u00ae Play:5. While the Play:5 is an example of a zone player with speakers, it is understood that a zone player with speakers is not limited to one with a certain number of speakers (e.g., five speakers as in the Play:5), but rather can contain one or more speakers. Further, a zone player can be part of another device, which might even serve a purpose different than audio (e.g., a lamp).","Referring now to , there is shown an example controller , which can correspond to the controlling device  in . The controller  can be used to facilitate the control of multi-media applications, automation and others in a system. In particular, the controller  is configured to facilitate a selection of a plurality of audio sources available on the network and enable control of one or more zone players (e.g., the zone players - in ) through a wireless network interface . According to one embodiment, the wireless communications is based on an industry standard (e.g., infrared, radio, wireless standards IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b 802.11g, 802.11n, or 802.15). Further, when a particular audio is being accessed via the controller  or being played via a zone player, a picture (e.g., album art) or any other data, associated with the audio source can be transmitted from a zone player or other electronic device to the controller  for display.","The controller  is provided with a screen  and an input interface  that allows a user to interact with the controller , for example, to navigate a playlist of many multimedia items and to control operations of one or more zone players. The screen  on the controller  can be an LCD screen, for example. The screen  communicates with and is commanded by a screen driver  that is controlled by a microcontroller (e.g., a processor) . The memory  can be loaded with one or more application modules  that can be executed by the microcontroller  with or without a user input via the user interface  to achieve certain tasks. In some embodiments, an application module  is configured to facilitate grouping a number of selected zone players into a zone group and synchronizing the zone players for audio play back. In some embodiments, an application module  is configured to control the audio sounds (e.g., volume) of the zone players in a zone group. In operation, when the microcontroller  executes one or more of the application modules , the screen driver  generates control signals to drive the screen  to display an application specific user interface accordingly.","The controller  includes a network interface  that facilitates wireless communication with a zone player. In some embodiments, the commands such as volume control and audio playback synchronization are sent via the network interface . In some embodiments, a saved zone group configuration is transmitted between a zone player and a controller via the network interface . The controller  can control one or more zone players, such as - of . There can be more than one controller for a particular system. Further, a controller can be integrated into a zone player.","It should be noted that other network-enabled devices such as an iPhone\u00ae, iPad\u00ae or any other smart phone or network-enabled device (e.g., a networked computer such as a PC or Mac\u00ae) can also be used as a controller to interact or control zone players in a particular environment. In some embodiments, a software application or upgrade can be downloaded onto a network enabled device to perform the functions described herein.","In certain embodiments, a user can create a zone group including at least two zone players from the controller . The zone players in the zone group can play audio in a synchronized fashion, such that all of the zone players in the zone group play back an identical audio source or a list of identical audio sources in a synchronized manner such that no (or substantially no) audible delays or hiccups could be heard. Similarly, in some embodiments, when a user increases the audio volume of the group from the controller , the signals or data of increasing the audio volume for the group are sent to one of the zone players and causes other zone players in the group to be increased together in volume.","A user via the controller  can group zone players into a zone group by activating a \u201cLink Zones\u201d or \u201cAdd Zone\u201d soft button, or de-grouping a zone group by activating an \u201cUnlink Zones\u201d or \u201cDrop Zone\u201d button. For example, one mechanism for \u2018joining\u2019 zone players together for audio play back is to link a number of zone players together to form a group. To link a number of zone players together, a user can manually link each zone player or room one after the other. For example, assume that there is a multi-zone system that includes the following zones: Bathroom, Bedroom, Den, Dining Room, Family Room, and Foyer.","In certain embodiments, a user can link any number of the six zone players, for example, by starting with a single zone and then manually linking each zone to that zone.","In certain embodiments, a set of zones can be dynamically linked together using a command to create a zone scene or theme (subsequent to first creating the zone scene). For instance, a \u201cMorning\u201d zone scene command can link the Bedroom, Office, and Kitchen zones together in one action. Without this single command, the user would need to manually and individually link each zone. The single command might include a mouse click, a double mouse click, a button press, a gesture, or some other programmed action. Other kinds of zone scenes can be programmed.","In certain embodiments, a zone scene can be triggered based on time (e.g., an alarm clock function). For instance, a zone scene can be set to apply at 8:00 am. The system can link appropriate zones automatically, set specific music to play, and then stop the music after a defined duration. Although any particular zone can be triggered to an \u201cOn\u201d or \u201cOff\u201d state based on time, for example, a zone scene enables any zone(s) linked to the scene to play a predefined audio (e.g., a favorable song, a predefined playlist) at a specific time and\/or for a specific duration. If, for any reason, the scheduled music failed to be played (e.g., an empty playlist, no connection to a share, failed Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), no Internet connection for an Internet Radio station, and so on), a backup buzzer can be programmed to sound. The buzzer can include a sound file that is stored in a zone player, for example.","Certain particular examples will now be provided in connection with  to describe, for purposes of illustration only, certain base systems and methods to provide and facilitate connection to a playback network.  shows that there are three zone players ,  and  and a controller  that form a network branch that is also referred to as an Ad-Hoc network . The network  may be wireless, wired, or a combination of wired and wireless. In general, an Ad-Hoc (or \u201cspontaneous\u201d) network is a local area network or other small network in which there is no one access point for all traffic. With an established Ad-Hoc network , the devices , ,  and  can all communicate with each other in a \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d style of communication, for example. Furthermore, devices may come\/and go from the network , and the network  will automatically reconfigure itself without needing the user to reconfigure the network .","Using the Ad-Hoc network , the devices , , , and  can share or exchange one or more audio sources and be grouped to play the same or different audio sources. For example, the devices  and  are grouped to playback one piece of music, and at the same time, the device  plays back another piece of music. In other words, the devices , ,  and , as shown in , form a HOUSEHOLD that distributes audio and\/or reproduces sound. As used herein, the term HOUSEHOLD (provided in uppercase letters to disambiguate from the user's domicile) is used to represent a collection of networked devices that are cooperating to provide an application or service. An instance of a HOUSEHOLD is identified with a household  (or household identifier).","In certain embodiments, a household identifier (HHID) is a short string or an identifier that is computer-generated to help ensure that it is unique. Accordingly, the network  can be characterized by a unique HHID and a unique set of configuration variables or parameters, such as channels (e.g., respective frequency bands), SSID (a sequence of alphanumeric characters as a name of a wireless network), and WEP keys (wired equivalent privacy or other security keys). In certain embodiments, SSID is set to be the same as HHID.","In certain embodiments, each HOUSEHOLD includes two types of network nodes: a control point (CP) and a zone player (ZP). The control point controls an overall network setup process and sequencing, including an automatic generation of required network parameters (e.g., WEP keys). In an embodiment, the CP also provides the user with a HOUSEHOLD configuration user interface. The CP function can be provided by a computer running a CP application module, or by a handheld controller (e.g., the controller ) also running a CP application module, for example. The zone player is any other device on the network that is placed to participate in the automatic configuration process. The ZP, as a notation used herein, includes the controller  or a computing device, for example.","In certain embodiments, configuration of a HOUSEHOLD involves multiple CPs and ZPs that rendezvous and establish a known configuration such that they can use a standard networking protocol (e.g., IP over Wired or Wireless Ethernet) for communication. In an embodiment, two types of networks\/protocols are employed: Ethernet 802.3 and Wireless 802.11g. Interconnections between a CP and a ZP can use either of the networks\/protocols. A device in the system as a member of a HOUSEHOLD can connect to both networks simultaneously. In an environment that has both networks in use, it is assumed that at least one device in a system is connected to both as a bridging device, thus providing bridging services between wired\/wireless networks for others. The zone player  in  is shown to be connected to both networks, for example. The connectivity to the network  is based on Ethernet while the connectivity to other devices ,  and  is based on Wireless. It is understood, however, that in some embodiments each zone player , ,  may access the Internet when retrieving media from the cloud (e.g., Internet) via the bridging device. For example, zone player  may contain a uniform resource locator (URL) that specifies an address to a particular audio track in the cloud. Using the URL, the zone player  may retrieve the audio track from the cloud, and ultimately play the audio out of one or more zone players.","In certain embodiments, a rudimentary communication path is established to connect a zone player to a household or other location network. In reference to , a zone player is not yet a member of a HOUSEHOLD. It is assumed that the zone player is to be added to become a member of the HOUSEHOLD by a cable or wireless. When the zone player is initially turned on, it executes an embedded module that is configured to establish a rudimentary communication path with another device (e.g., network-enabled). The rudimentary communication path facilitates the automatic configuration of the zone player via another device. This communication path may operate over wireless and\/or Ethernet protocols, as the zone player may be connected to one or both. In operation, the communication path does not negatively affect other devices in the vicinity and can reach all other members of the HOUSEHOLD (both CPs and ZPs), if any are available. In certain embodiments, the communication path does not have to be direct between two devices and may be bridged by one or more other devices. Because the communication path is only used for initial device configuration, it does not require significant performance or sophisticated functionality. There are at least two elements to establish the communication path: channel selection and packet exchange.","In certain embodiments, selection of an appropriate transmission channel (e.g., a radio frequency (RF) channel) is primarily an exercise in two constraints: finding a channel that is quiet from a protocol (e.g., 802.11) viewpoint (e.g., minimal conflicting wireless traffic) and finding a channel that is quiet from an RF viewpoint (e.g., minimal noise from other signals). Both of these tests may be applied because a home environment can have other RF (e.g., 2.4 GHz) traffic or potentially other wireless access points.","Channel selection can be accomplished, for example, with a scanning technique, namely the device listens on each channel for a period of time, looking for the presence of wireless beacons and other RF signals. In an embodiment, devices that are configured have a preferred channel for the HOUSEHOLD, and devices that are not configured have a pre-defined (default) channel or channels on which they rendezvous. For example, 802.11b\/g channel 1 can be pre-configured as the default channel. Alternatively, multiple channels, with a well-known frequency hopping sequence, can be used by the devices (e.g., using an aperiodic frequency change interval).","In certain embodiments, many hardware configurations only support reception\/transmission on a single channel at a given time. Also there are configured and unconfigured devices that may use different channels for the bootstrap configuration and standard network operations (post-configuration communications). In certain embodiments, devices are placed in a \u201cconfiguration\u201d mode, whereby they use the appropriate channels for communication.","To enable communication between devices that are not part of the same HOUSEHOLD, a packet exchange network infrastructure is developed. Probing messages are sent in such a way that they traverse both the Ethernet and wireless networks, reaching any connected devices. Devices that are already in a HOUSEHOLD constitute a network infrastructure that can be used to exchange unicast and multicast\/broadcast network frames between the devices. A device that is not yet in the HOUSEHOLD has a much more limited networking capability and can only receive data from devices to which it is directly wired, and unencrypted messages broadcast to all wireless networks operating in a particular channel of the RF spectrum, for example.","In certain embodiments, an IP address of a new device is not known to any members of the HOUSEHOLD. If the device is purely wireless, it may not have an IP address at all, or it may have an automatically assigned IP address that is inaccessible to other devices with IP addresses respectively assigned by a DHCP server. To allow devices that are not members of the HOUSEHOLD to join the HOUSEHOLD, a transport may be constructed that can get data one \u201chop\u201d beyond the HOUSEHOLD network infrastructure.","In certain embodiments, packets of data are broadcasted among the members of the HOUSEHOLD. The packets of data comprise a mixture of \u201cprobe\u201d datagrams and IP broadcast. For example, the 802.11 \u201cprobe\u201d datagrams are used to cross wireless network boundaries. In other words, the \u201cprobe\u201d datagrams can be received by all listeners (e.g., other devices) on the channel, even those that are not configured with an SSID, because they are sent to the broadcasting satellite service (BSS) (e.g., FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) to which all devices may be configured to listen. An IP broadcast is used on the wired network segments and the HOUSEHOLD network infrastructure to enable a PC-based controller to participate while running with standard user privileges (which allow access only to IP-based network services), for example. Used together, the combination of \u201cprobe\u201d datagrams and IP broadcast provides for a broadcast datagram transport that allows even devices that have not had any networking parameters configured to communicate.","In certain embodiments, probe datagrams include a number of elements to facilitate the configuration of other devices to join the HOUSEHOLD. In an embodiment, each of the elements carries up to 255 bytes of data. An element contains data payload for each message used by the bootstrap procedure to invite others to join the HOUSEHOLD. This element is repeated as many times as necessary to carry the complete message. In an embodiment, the IP broadcast datagrams contain the same data payload as the normal IP data payload.","Messages relating to the bootstrap procedure can be forwarded beyond the boundaries of an existing HOUSEHOLD network infrastructure (e.g., including properly configured wireless devices and the wired network). Similarly, messages originating outside of the HOUSEHOLD network infrastructure can be forwarded into the infrastructure. Forwarding can be accomplished in a mixed wireless\/wired network environment without introducing a broadcast storm. A broadcast storm is a state in which a message that has been broadcast across a network results in more responses than necessary, and each response results in even more responses in a snowball effect, subsequently resulting in a network meltdown or lockup. In certain embodiments, the network is configured to help prevent such a broadcast storm or illegal broadcast messages. To accomplish this, two flags are included in the message body, for example, \u201cSENT_AS_PROBE\u201d and \u201cSENT_AS_IP_BROADCAST.\u201d When a device receives a \u201cprobe\u201d message, assumed using a \u201cSonos Netstart\u201d SSID (or broadcast BSS), the device forwards the message as an IP broadcast message (e.g., after setting a \u201cSENT_AS_IP_BROADCAST: flag) if the SENT_AS_IP_BROADCAST flag is not already set. Similarly, when the device receives an IP broadcast with a user datagram protocol (UDP) payload address to an appropriate port (e.g., port number ), the device forwards the message as a \u201cprobe\u201d datagram (e.g., after setting a \u201cSENT_AS_PROBE\u201d flag) if the SENT_AS_PROBE flag is not already set. This allows messages related to the packet exchange both to enter and to exit the HOUSEHOLD network infrastructure without causing a broadcast storm.","Using this method of broadcast communication, packets can be sent between a member of the HOUSEHOLD and a device to join the HOUSEHOLD on both Ethernet and wireless networks. The device to join the HOUSEHOLD may be a new device or a device previously configured with a different network (e.g., a device with a stale configuration in a different household), for example. In addition, if used sparingly, these broadcast messages do not interfere with the normal operation of the network or attached devices. As a result, a communication path on an agreed channel has been established between two devices.","In certain embodiments, to reduce or minimize impact on existing networks and to improve configuration security, a user can manually activate the auto-configuration process. Manual user activation may be accomplished by a specific action on each device that is being added to the network. For example, if the user is installing a new HOUSEHOLD, containing one CP and two ZPs, the activation process can be manually activated on each by, for example, powering off and on, pushing a reset button or pushing two or more specific buttons simultaneously on the ZP or CP. In an embodiment, the CP or ZP is powered up by the user, which activates the pre-installed module to start the bootstrap procedure.","For a ZP, if the device is unconfigured (e.g., factory default settings), the device goes into a \u201csleep\u201d mode where the device is awaiting an activation command. If the ZP has been previously configured, the ZP attempts to contact other members of its HOUSEHOLD network. If the ZP is orphaned, namely the ZP was previously configured (e.g., perhaps, with another Ad-hoc network) and now is to be added to the HOUSEHOLD (e.g., the ZP is obtained from a previous owner), the ZP can attempt to contact its original network. It can be perceived that this operation will be unsuccessful but otherwise harmless, for example. Even in this configured state, the device can participate in the rudimentary broadcast communication processes described above.","For a CP, if the device is unconfigured (e.g., factory default settings), the CP presents the user with a description of how to start the configuration process. If the CP device is configured, the CP attempts to contact other members of its HOUSEHOLD network. The CP may also be an orphaned device, in which case it performs similarly to that of the ZP, for example.","In both cases, correctly configured devices establish network communications and make themselves available for normal operation. All devices, including those previously configured, enter an \u201cactivation state\u201d when the user indicates that this is desired. At this point, the configuration process can begin.","In certain embodiments, device configuration is facilitated by exchanging data between two devices that are not necessarily directly connected. The exchange procedure is carried over a rudimentary communication path such as described previously. The sequence of exchanging the data is initiated by the user or some other process, for example, activating a reset button, to trigger the \u201cactivation\u201d or configuration mode on the involved devices. Each device executes this sequence, and then exits the activation mode.  shows an embodiment that involves a process of five exchanges of data.","Each of the data exchanges is referred to as a type of message: Alive, QueryNetParams, RespondNetParams, SetNetParams, and AckNetParams, each of which is explained as follows.","An Alive message is a message indicating that a named ZP is available for configuration. The message includes at least a zpUUID (a zone player \u201cuniversally\u201d unique identifier) which is a globally unique identifier that identifies the ZP sending the message.","A QueryNetParams message is a request from the CP to the ZP to respond with the ZP's current network configuration information. The request includes at least a zpUUID, cpPK (e.g., an RSA public key of the CP) and a tid (a unique transaction identifier).","A RespondNetParams message is a response to the QueryNetParams message. The message includes the ZP's network configuration information (e.g., HHID, WEP key and RSA public key). For security reasons, the WEP key is encrypted using the CP's public key that is only readable by the CP. The response includes at least a zpUUID, netConfig (the ZP's current network configuration parameters), zpPK (e.g., a public key for the ZP), and a tid. In certain embodiments, a new ZP, set to factory defaults, can have well-known parameter values, allowing the CP to determine that the ZP is unconfigured.","A SetNetParams message is a command message from the CP to the ZP indicating that the ZP should reconfigure its network parameters. The WEP key is encrypted using the ZP's public key, and, therefore, only readable by the ZP. The command includes at least a zpUUID, netConfig and tid. In certain embodiments, netConfig includes new configuration parameters for the ZP, as determined by the CP. The ZP saves this value in its network configuration. In some cases, these parameters may match the ZP's existing configuration.","An AckNetParams message is a response to the SetNetParams messaging. The response indicates that the SetNetParams message was received and that the network configuration contained therein has been successfully applied. The response includes at least a zpUUID and a tid.","In operation, after a user activates the configuration process (on both ZP and CP) at  in , the CP enters a state where it is willing to accept an Alive message. The CP remains in this state for a certain (e.g., specified or finite) period of time. The ZP enters an activation state where it attempts rendezvous with a CP. The ZP remains in this state for a certain limited period of time. The ZP periodically transmits an Alive message until it either receives a QueryNetParams message or exits the activation state.","At , the CP receives an Alive message. If the CP is in the configuration mode, it generates a new tid, and sends a QueryNetParams message to the ZP. The CP may or may not have been configured at this point. In either case, the CP sends the QueryNetParams message. At , if the ZP is already in the activation state, the ZP responds to a QueryNetParams with its current network configuration. If the ZP is unconfigured (e.g., factory default settings), the ZP returns an empty HHID and WEP key. If the ZP is previously configured, the ZP returns its current configuration. The ZP also returns its public key such that the WEP key can be encrypted using the CP's public key, for example.","At , upon receiving the ZP's current configuration information, the CP decides on a course of action. In certain embodiments, most, but not all, of these options result in a SetNetParams message being sent to the ZP. An example matrix of possible situations is as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"CP already configured","CP not configured"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ZP already ","The CP sends a SetNetParams","The CP sets its own"]},{"entry":["configured","message to the ZP containing ","configuration to match the ZP"]},{"entry":[{},"the CP's current net","configuration, and the"]},{"entry":[{},"configuration.

Accordingly, the CP determines that it generates new configuration parameters in accordance with the following. For example, an HHID is provided by the user via the CP user interface or automatically generated by the CP. An SSID is automatically generated by the CP (e.g., set to the same value as the HHID). A WEP Key is automatically generated (e.g., using a pseudo-random number generator, seeded with entropy collected by the CP). The CP probes the network looking for an acceptable channel (e.g., based on a variety of criteria, which may include traffic and interference from other sources).","Following the activation process, devices that have been reconfigured attempt to establish normal network communications using their new network configuration parameters. In certain embodiments, if the CP or ZP is not already in the activation state, receipt of messages is ignored.","In certain embodiments, if there are multiple ZPs activated simultaneously (or substantially simultaneously), the devices can execute this same sequence, independently of each other (e.g., the CP is capable of multiple independent sessions). If multiple CPs are activated, each can respond to a ZP's Alive message and execute the sequence. The first CP to deliver the SetNetParams to the ZP will configure it. In this case, the second CP may never get an AckNetParams message because the ZP has exited the activate state. In certain embodiments, a transaction timeout may occur in the second CP, at which point the CP may inform the user of the error or retry the entire sequence. If the CP retries the entire sequence, it will not reprogram the ZP, for example.","Certain embodiments provide security in network communications. For example, to help ensure that wireless communication among the members in a HOUSEHOLD is secure, multiple issues in auto-configuration are resolved. For example, while packet exchange broadcasts may be unencrypted, public key cryptography is used to help ensure that WEP keys are securely distributed. Because the network configuration process is automated and the data is transmitted over the network, in certain embodiments the auto-configuration process is started manually by a user. When one of the connected devices is removed from the HOUSEHOLD, the device is reset to a factory default configuration (e.g., erases WEP keys and other private information) so that the device can no longer access to the network. In certain embodiments, a user can validate that he or she has correctly configured one or more devices using a validation\/status user interface on the Control Point.","In certain embodiments, the configuration process uses public key cryptography to exchange WEP keys and other information that should not be visible to any party sniffing the network. In an embodiment, an exchange is facilitated by designating a certificate authority (CA) to issue signed public key certificates. Each CP and ZP is factory configured with a unique certificate, public and private key, in a format that supports the RSA algorithm. The certificate is signed and issued by the designated CA, and includes a hash of the MAC address of a device, for example. The CP and ZP exchange public keys, and WEP keys are encrypted using the public key. In certain circumstances, the devices compare the MAC in received packets with that in the certificate to add an additional layer of security.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":["FIG. 8A","FIG. 6"],"b":["800","800","800","800","608"]},"In certain embodiments, a handheld controller is equipped with a mechanism to allow a user to reset itself.

The channels can be cycled through several times, for example. When the zone player receives a QueryNetParams request addressed to the zone player, it stops the channel cycling. The zone player remains locked on the channel on which it received the request until a successful sequence ending in the configuration of the zone player is completed (at which point it uses the specified channel), or a timeout expires (at which point it returns to its original channel or resumes cycling through channels and sending alive messages if the overall timeout for the activation process has not expired).","In certain embodiments, although the zone player performs the channel cycling, the controller may also be configured to perform the channel cycling.

For example, using a join-household button on a zone player (an example playback device), the user can configure his or her smartphone to operate as a controller for the playback network.","Certain embodiments provide a service to run continuously in the background on the wireless controller to actively manage the decision of whether to connect to the playback network or another available wireless network in order to improve or maintain user experience as the user moves from location to location.","For example,  depicts an example wireless device  (e.g., the same as or similar to the wireless device ) including a signal strength monitor , a memory  including a registry of networks , a processor , a communication interface , and a multimedia content output . The device  can connect to an available network using the communication interface  and facilitate playback and\/or other communication of content via the output  in conjunction with the processor . Using the signal strength monitor , the device  can continuously (or periodically, etc.) monitor available networks identified in the registry of networks  and use the processor  to determine whether another available network is preferable for connection than the currently connected network (e.g., stronger signal, better security, and so on).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"1100"},"At block , a network connection request is initiated for a wireless device to connect to an unspecified audio network available but hidden at a location. For example, a connection request can be initiated via a controller device (e.g., a smartphone, dedicated controller, tablet computer, laptop computer, etc.) within range of the audio network at the location (e.g., a household, building, or other location). As another example, a connection request can be initiated via a button press on a multimedia playback device connected to the audio network.","At block , a network connection request to the audio network is detected. The request can be detect via a multimedia playback device (e.g., a zone player, speaker, output, etc.) already connected to the hidden audio network, for example. The audio network is unspecified in the request and is available but hidden at the location.","At block , a connection phase is triggered to connect the wireless device to the hidden audio network. The connection phase can be triggered via the multimedia playback device, for example. In certain examples, the connection phase is triggered without sending a response to the request from the multimedia playback device. In certain embodiments, no response is provided to broadcast probes unless an action has recently been taken (e.g., one or more buttons recently pressed) on the multimedia playback device and\/or other network component.","At block , a network access point is revealed with a preset identifier to the wireless device to which the wireless device can connect using a predefined password valid during the connection phase. In certain embodiments, the network access point is subsequently hidden once the identifier and password are provided to the connecting device.","At block , the wireless device is authenticated with the audio network using the predefined password via the network access point. The wireless device is associated with the audio network with limited connectivity to the audio network during the connection phase.","At block , the wireless device is disconnected from the audio network. At block , a connection of the wireless device to the audio network is accepted in an operational phase. The connection is enabled using information provided to the wireless device during the connection phase and without the limited connectivity provided in the connection phase, for example.","At block , network access is configured for the wireless device using information provided to the wireless device during the connection phase. At block , playback of content is facilitated via the multimedia playback device on the audio network. For example, playback can be facilitated using the wireless device.","Thus, in certain embodiments, a multimedia playback device is connected to a local multimedia playback network that is configured to hide (e.g., not provide an indicator of its existence) absent a command from the multimedia playback device. The multimedia playback device initiates a connection phase for a device to connect to the hidden network based on a user action at the multimedia playback device (e.g., a button press). The multimedia playback device then reveals a network access point with a preset identifier to the wireless device to which the wireless device can connect using a predefined password valid only during the connection phase. The wireless device is authenticated with the audio network using the predefined password via the network access point and associated with the audio network with limited connectivity to the audio network during the connection phase. The wireless device is then disconnected from the audio network and can be reconnected to the audio network in an operational phase. The connection in the operational phase is enabled using information provided to the wireless device during the connection phase and offers greater connectivity and access than the limited connectivity provided to the wireless device in the connection phase.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0130"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":"1200"},"At block , connection of a wireless device to a multimedia playback network is facilitated. For example, connection can be facilitated to a visible and\/or hidden wireless network for communication, control, playback, and so on. Connection of the device to the network can be facilitated via an exchange of identifier and password information, for example.","At block , the wireless device is enabled to add the multimedia playback network to a list of available networks for connection. For example, the wireless device can maintain a list of one or more networks\/systems to which the device is authorized and\/or otherwise configured to connect.","At block , one or more available networks within range of the wireless device are identified. For example, if the user has no WiFi access point or is not within range of a local access point when a controller is first set up on a third-party device (e.g., an Android\u2122 smartphone, tablet, or other device), the device can securely establish a network connection directly if it is within range of a playback system on one of the available networks.","At block , a network characteristic, such as signal strength, of identified network(s) is monitored. For example, the wireless device can include a sensor to monitor and evaluate a received signal strength from each available wireless network.","At block , an active wireless connection is actively switched between identified networks based on the at least one monitored network characteristics (e.g., signal strength, user-activity on the device, etc.) to optimize or improve user experience, playback quality, system responsiveness, and so on. In certain embodiments, if the connection transitions between networks, the wireless device transitions between the two connections and maintains control of music playback on any available networked device.","In certain embodiments, network roaming is facilitated using an application running on a wireless device that can roam between a wireless (e.g., WiFi) access point and a local zone player or other playback device node. In certain embodiments, each network has its own SSID, so the wireless device is roaming between two different networks, not just roaming and connecting to the same network when in range.","By using a controller application (e.g., a Sonos\u2122 Controller application) on a third-party wireless device (e.g., an Android device), a user can use either 1) his or her own WiFi connection or 2) the audio playback network (e.g., SonosNet\u2122 mesh network) to control the playback system. In certain embodiments, the phone or other wireless device can transition between the two connections and (relatively) seamlessly maintain control of music playback on any of the connected, available devices.","In certain embodiments, with a wireless (e.g., WiFi) connection, the controller application software can intentionally place the playback (e.g., SonosNet\u2122 mesh) network second or subsequent to one or more other network connection options on a connectivity list, such that if a WiFi access point is listed first and the SonosNet\u2122 network is second, and the user's phone is out of range of the WiFi access point, then the phone will use the SonosNet as the access point to connect for playback. Thus, a local node one player can be put on a preferred list of networks and can be used as a connection point for web surfing, etc. (e.g., data will pass through the zone player as if it is a WiFi access point).","In certain embodiments, if a user has no WiFi access point or is not within range of an access point when first setting up the controller on a third-party device (e.g., Android-based device), the phone or other device can securely establish a playback network connection directly if the user is within range of a network-connected device (e.g., using a join-household button-press with respect to a bridge, zone player, or other playback device).","In certain embodiments, a service that runs continuously in the background on the third-party device to actively managing the decision on whether to connect to the playback device (e.g., SonosNet\u2122) or another available wireless (e.g., WiFi) network in order to improve the experience for the user as the user moves among multiple locations.","Thus, a third-party device can serve as a controller to set up and control the playback system anywhere within range of the user's playback system, making the user's wireless network, such as a home WiFi network, optional. Certain embodiments extend the WiFi range of a user's device to become a superset of the user's home WiFi coverage plus the playback mesh network. Certain embodiments extend effective wireless range automatically based on one or more criteria or parameters.","Certain embodiments provide a network for wireless playback of multimedia content at a location, such as a home. To support flexibility in connecting to and controlling the playback network, security, such as WPA2 security, is provided with the one or more playback devices, such as Sonos\u2122 zone players, included in the network so that each playback device in a mesh network can act as a wireless access point to a third-party device, such as a smartphone, being used as a controller. Once the controller on the third-party device has joined the playback network (e.g., using a customer's WiFi network), the controller is to securely obtain a WPA2 passphrase so that the controller can automatically add the wireless playback network to the list of available networks on the controller device. The controller will then be able to use the user wireless connection or the playback network wireless network. If the control device has no existing wireless connection but is within range of a playback device, bridge, dock, and so on, a wireless device can securely join the local (e.g., household) network using the playback network directly without a separate wireless connection.","For example, in certain embodiments, the controller attempts to connect to a fictitious network with a specific SSID. This alerts the zone player and the playback network that a controller is attempting to join the household. If the user has pressed the join household button or buttons on a zone player and the zone player detects a device searching for the fictitious SSID, then the zone player makes itself visible so that the zone player shows up in the controller device's wireless (e.g., WiFi) scan. The controller now recognizes the visible playback network and attempts to connect using a special fixed password, for example. The zone player grants the connection but restricts communication to the traffic to perform the network start protocol. The network start (netstart) protocol is the protocol that the controllers use to join a household and to privately exchange network encryption keys. The controller then disconnects, and the zone player returns to its normal hidden operation. The controller reconnects to the playback device network using the obtained network key.","In certain embodiments, a background service is used to determine which wireless networks used on a controller device are on the same subnet as the playback network. In certain embodiments, the service can monitor the signal strength of the playback network and the networks identified above. The service can actively switch the wireless connection of the controller device between the playback network and the other identified networks based on signal strength and user activity on the device to improve and optimize the user experience, for example. In certain embodiments, a controller application running on a device, such as a smartphone or tablet (e.g., an Android\u2122 smartphone or tablet), uses a device application programming interface (API) to modify (e.g., add, remove, edit, and so on) network (e.g., WiFi network) information.","Certain embodiments provide a packet transport the can be used to communicate short messages between wireless playback products. Certain embodiments provide a simplified packet transport which is used to communicate short messages between playback devices prior to the main set up of a playback device network. For example, hardware and software controllers running on third-party hardware, such as a smartphone, can use this simple packet transport to connect prior to the primary set up with the playback device network. In certain embodiments, two basic transport transports are defined: an IP broadcast base transport and an 802.11 probe request base transport, for example. In an example IP broadcast-based transport, an IP packet with the source address equal to the sender source address is provided along with a destination address equal to the IP broadcast address. A real destination address (e.g., a Sonos\u2122 UUID) is embedded inside the message. In an example 802.11 probe request-base transport, a source MAC (Media Access Control) address is equal to the sender's own wireless MAC address, a destination MAC or destination BSSID is equal to a MAC broadcast address, and a real destination address (e.g., Sonos\u2122 UUID) is embedded inside information elements within the probe. In an embodiment, the probe request is an identifier such as \u201cSonosNet\u2122 start 1.0\u201d. In certain embodiments, each transport packet has two bits indicating the transports on which the packet has already been sent. For example, bits can indicate packet has already been sent as an IP broadcast or sent as an 802.11 probe. When the zone player initiates the transmission of the packet, the zone player sends the packet twice, once using each transport (e.g., with an appropriate set syndicate the transport being used). When the controller initiates the transmission of the packet, the controller sends the packet one using IP broadcast (e.g., with appropriate bit set). In certain embodiments, however, the controller sends the packet twice. When the net start application on the zone player receives a net start packet, it retransmits the packet on any transports that have not previously been used, setting the appropriate bits to indicate the transport. Thus, each zone player receiving a net start packet as a probe request forwards it once as an IP broadcast on the playback mesh network, and each zone player receiving a packet as an IP broadcast submits it once as a probe request.","In certain embodiments, a plurality of netstart protocol messages can be used to facilitate the netstart protocol for a new device, such as a controller (CR), connecting to the network. For example, messages can include:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0147"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Message Name","Direction","Purpose"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["R_NS_ALIVE_UNICAST_REQUEST","CR to \u201cworld\u201d","(optional) A broken CR that is"]},{"entry":[{},{},"unable to receive IP broadcasts"]},{"entry":[{},{},"tells all ZPs to send their"]},{"entry":[{},{},"R_NS_ALIVE messages as"]},{"entry":[{},{},"unicasts to its IP address"]},{"entry":["R_NS_ALIVE","ZP to \u201cworld\u201d ","Announces a ZP's presence"]},{"entry":[{},"(or unicast-","when the user pushes"]},{"entry":[{},"see above)","mute + volume up"]},{"entry":["R_NS_QUERY","CR to ZP","A CR tells the ZP its RSA public"]},{"entry":[{},{},"key, and asks the ZP for its own"]},{"entry":[{},{},"RSA public key, home channel,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"HouseholdID (\u2248SSID), and AES"]},{"entry":[{},{},"key"]},{"entry":["R_NS_RESPONSE","ZP to CR","A ZP responds with its own"]},{"entry":[{},{},"RSA public key, home channel,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"HouseholdID, and AES key (the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"latter three will be \u201cblank\u201d in a"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u201cfactory reset\u201d state, and will be"]},{"entry":[{},{},"encrypted using the CR's RSA"]},{"entry":[{},{},"public key)"]},{"entry":["R_NS_ASSESS_CHANS","CR to ZP","A CR asks a ZP to examine each"]},{"entry":[{},{},"of its possible channels and"]},{"entry":[{},{},"report the best one"]},{"entry":["R_NS_RESPOND_CHANS","ZP to CR","A ZP responds with its"]},{"entry":[{},{},"assessment of which channel is"]},{"entry":[{},{},"best"]},{"entry":["R_NS_SET","CR to ZP","A CR tells a ZP what channel,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"HouseholdID, and AES key to"]},{"entry":[{},{},"use (encrypted with ZP's RSA"]},{"entry":[{},{},"public key)"]},{"entry":["R_NS_ACK","ZP to CR","A ZP responds, acknowledging"]},{"entry":[{},{},"that it obeyed the instructions"]},{"entry":[{},{},"specified in the R_NS_SET"]},{"entry":["R_NS_REVERTCHAN","CR to ZP","A CR tells a ZP that the NetStart"]},{"entry":[{},{},"protocol is complete and the ZP"]},{"entry":[{},{},"should revert to its \u201chome\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},{},"channel"]},{"entry":["R_NS_GETCHAN","CR to ZP","A CR asks a ZP what channel"]},{"entry":[{},{},"the household is using (used by"]},{"entry":[{},{},"the UI for setting the channel;"]},{"entry":[{},{},"NOT used at all during setup)"]},{"entry":["R_NS_RESP_GETCHAN","ZP to CR","A ZP responds to the CR telling"]},{"entry":[{},{},"it the channel number (used by"]},{"entry":[{},{},"the UI for setting the channel;"]},{"entry":[{},{},"NOT used at all during setup)"]},{"entry":["R_NS_SETCHAN","CR to ZPA","CR tells all ZPs in a"]},{"entry":[{},{},"household what channel to use"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(used by the UI for setting the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"channel; NOT used at all during"]},{"entry":[{},{},"setup)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In certain embodiments, an example sequence between a factory reset CR and a factory reset ZP can be illustrated according to the messages above as:\n\n","In certain embodiments, an example sequence between a factory reset CR and a non-factory reset ZP can be illustrated according to the messages above as:\n\n","In certain embodiments, an example sequence when using a CR to add a ZP to an existing household can be illustrated according to the messages above as:\n\n","In certain embodiments, the user presses one or more buttons on a zone player to connect to a wireless playback network. The zone player cycles between each of a number of possible channels (e.g., three possible channels). The zone player sends alive messages on each of the possible channels and then waits a short time for a response. The controller sits on one channel listing for the alive messages. When the controller hears an alive message, the controller sends the originating zone player a query. Upon receipt of the query, the zone player halts its cycling between channels. The remaining netstart handshake takes place on the channel on which the zone player landed when contacted by the controller. At the end of the sequence, when the zone player receives a network set message, the zone player switches to a specified channel. Alternatively, when the zone player receives a revert channel message, the zone player returns to its \u201chome\u201d channel.","In certain embodiments, when the user presses one or buttons on the zone player, the zone player cycles between each of a number of possible channels (e.g., three possible channels) sending alive messages and then waiting a short time for a response. The controller sends and receives IP broadcasts. A new wireless zone player communicates with the controller by relying on the net start behavior of forwarding receive net start 802.11 probe requests onto the playback network as IP broadcasts and of forwarding received IP broadcast from the playback network as 802.11 probe requests. When zone player receives a netstart set message, the zone player switches to the specified channel. Alternatively, when zone player receives a revert channel message, the zone player returns to its home channel.","In certain embodiments, the controller uses a wireless chip, such as an AR6002 wireless chip, which has a hardcoded firmware implementation of an 802.11g client. This firmware can, for example, probe for access points on a specified list of channels and report back content of information elements from their beacons and probe responses. The firmware can also, for example, associate with the specified access point, such as an SSID, a BSSID, an advanced encryption standard (AES) key, and so on. Netstart can be built on top of this firmware capability such that when the user presses buttons on the zone player to connect to the network, the zone player still cycles between each of the available channels sending and allied message and then waiting a short time for response. While the zone player is cycling between the available channels, the zone player also includes a special information element in its probe responses indicating that the zone player is in net start mode. The controller continuously scans for access points, cycling between the possible channels at a rate faster than the zone player and sending probes which include a special information element indicating that the controller is searching for zone player. If a zone player in net start mode receives a broadcast probe from a controller searching for a zone player, as identified by the special information element, the zone player aborts channel scanning and respond to the broadcast probe. The controller looks at the scan results for an access point with the special information element. If it finds such an access point, the zone player associates with the access point without security. The special \u201cno security\u201d association currently allows a controller and the playback network to exchange MAC broadcast frames. In certain embodiments, the security is tightened to allow the controller and the zone player to exchange net start broadcasts only. That is, only MAC broadcasts that are also IP broadcasts including, for example, a UDP datagram with destination port  can be exchanged. The stricter filter makes the \u201cno security\u201d association more limited and, hence, less of a security risk. In certain embodiments, if the zone player is factory reset and does not have a household ID, the zone player uses an SSID of a generic form for the temporary association. In certain embodiments, there is a special \u201csafe association\u201d mode for manufacturing test used with zone player that includes an extra MAC address of the one and only controller committed to associate in its beacons and probe responses.","Once an association relationship is established between the controller and the zone player, the net start handshake occurs via IP broadcast. Once the controller identifies the network AES key, the controller drops is insecure Association with the zone player and re-creates the association securely using the AES key with full permission access the playback network.","In certain embodiments, a more constrained version of controller implementation is provided. For example, the controller cannot set or detect arbitrary information elements in probe requests or probe responses. Some controller devices, such as smartphones, cannot see an access point that is not sending beacons these phones are able to associate to zone players that are not sending beacons, for example. In order to do this, the zone players made to look like a standard out access point during household discovery by the controller device. When the user hits the buttons on the zone player connected to a network, the zone player tells the wireless driver to drop all probes and association requests from third-party devices in addition to doing channel scanning and waiting for the life message. The controller, such as a smart phone, attends to connect to a network with SSID set to net start which causes the device to send targeted probes for that SSID in addition to broadcast all probes. When the wireless driver on the zone player sees the targeted probes for net start, the zone player signals a net start via a net link. In certain embodiments, the zone player does not respond to the probe. Net start then switches to the quote home quote channel to help ensure that there is a path for DHCP traffic and enables a wireless driver to respond to broadcast and targeted probes to the normal SSID. Additionally, net start starts sending beacons with the SSID in them. The wireless device sees an IP with that SSID starting with a household ID number and assumes that the device is a zone player. The wireless device then attempts WPA2 authentication with a password that is only valid during net start mode on the zone player. The zone player allows the controller device to associate with the network and provides limited network, tip conductivity privacy (e.g., enough for DHCP and net start). The controller device does it conducts the IP-based net start protocol described above to join the household. The wireless controller device uses information obtained from the zone player to set up a correct network configuration (e.g., SSID and permanent WPA2 passphrase).","Various inventions have been described in sufficient detail with a certain degree of particularity.
