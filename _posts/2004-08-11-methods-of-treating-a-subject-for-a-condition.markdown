{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["There are a variety of conditions that can affect an individual's health and well-being. The treatment of various conditions that affect the health and well-being of an individual has been around for centuries and in general, the armament of treatment options available to a physician to treat such conditions has increased tremendously, especially in the last century.","However, because of the increase in available treatment options, often times an individual suffering from a variety of different conditions must be administered multiple, different drugs, each intended to treat one of the conditions. For example, many individuals suffering from cardiovascular conditions may be required to adhere to a tedious and exacting schedule of consuming multiple pills throughout a day, where the number of pills may be as much 20 pills a day or more. These types of treatment regimes not only impact an individual's quality of life, but also contribute to rising health care costs. For example, it is estimated that in 2000 health care spending rose to $1.3 trillion in the United States. A large part of this expense is due to the costs of drugs.","As such, there continues to be an interest in the development of new protocols for treating medical conditions.","Methods are provided for treating a subject for at least one condition. Embodiments include treating a subject for an inflammatory condition, blood clotting condition and autonomic dysfunction simultaneously and include identifying the inflammatory condition, blood clotting condition and autonomic dysfunction in the subject. Embodiments of the subject methods may include one more of the following: administering an effective amount of a single pharmacological agent to a subject chosen from: an anti-inflammatory agent, an anti-blood clotting agent and an autonomic nervous system modulator such as an anti-adrenergic to treat the subject for the identified condition(s); electrically and\/or pharmacologically modulating either an inflammatory or blood clotting or autonomic receptor to increase parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio; and modulating one or more enzymes to increase or decrease enzyme activity to increase the parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio.","Embodiments also include treating a subject for an inflammatory condition by identifying the inflammatory condition in the subject and administering an effective amount of at least one of an anti-blood clotting agent and an autonomic nervous system modulator such as an anti-adrenergic agent to the subject, and\/or electrically and\/or pharmacologically modulating a blood clotting and\/or autonomic receptor to increase the parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio; and\/or modulating one or more blood clotting pathway enzymes to increase or decrease enzyme activity to increase the parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio.","Embodiments also include treating a subject for a blood clotting condition by identifying the blood clotting condition in the subject and administering an effective amount of at least one of an anti-inflammatory agent and an autonomic nervous system modulator such as an anti-adrenergic agent to the subject, and\/or electrically and\/or pharmacologically modulating an inflammatory and\/or autonomic receptor to increase the parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio, and\/or modulating one or more an inflammatory cascade enzyme to increase the parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio, and\/or modulating one or more inflammatory pathway enzymes to increase or decrease enzyme activity to increase the parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio.","Embodiments also include treating a subject for autonomic dysfunction by identifying the autonomic dysfunction in the subject and administering an effective amount of at least one of an anti-inflammatory agent and an anti-blood clotting agent, and\/or targeting an inflammatory and\/or blood clotting receptor to increase the parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio, and\/or electrically and\/or pharmacologically modulating an inflammatory cascade enzyme to increase the parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio, and\/or modulating one or more inflammatory pathway enzymes to increase or decrease enzyme activity to increase the parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio.","Also provided are kits for use in practicing the subject methods.","Methods are provided for treating a subject for at least one condition. Embodiments include treating a subject for an inflammatory condition, blood clotting condition and autonomic dysfunction simultaneously and include identifying the inflammation, blood clotting and autonomic dysfunction in the subject.

In further describing the subject invention, representative embodiments of the subject methods are described first in greater detail, followed by a review of various representative applications in which the subject methods may find use. Next, a review of kits for use in the subject methods is provided.","Methods","Embodiments of the subject methods are directed to treating a subject for at least one condition and in many embodiments for two or more conditions, e.g., at the same time. More specifically, methods are provided for treating a subject for inflammation and\/or blood clotting and\/or autonomic dysfunction (e.g., a low parasympathetic function\/sympathetic function ratio in at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system). \u201cInflammatory condition\u201d broadly refers to conditions caused by proinflammatory cytokines or an inflammatory cytokine cascade.

Autonomic dysfunction may be characterized by an abnormally high parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio or an abnormally low parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio. In certain embodiments, inflammation, blood clotting and autonomic dysfunction may be treated at the same time with the same pharmacological agent, i.e., with a single pharmacological agent, such that separate agents are not needed to treat a subject for these three conditions.

Any suitable technique may be employed to identify conditions and include qualitative and quantitative methods. A variety of different methods for detecting inflammation and\/or blood clotting and\/or adrenergia are known to those of skill in the art.","For example, methods for identifying an inflammatory condition (e.g., for assessing the site(s) and extent of the inflammatory process) are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, conventional x-ray techniques, computerized axial tomographic scanning (CAT scanning), a variety of radionuclide scans (Sutton, A Textbook of Radiology and Imaging, 3rd Ed., Churchill Livingston, 1980; Clinical Nuclear Medicine, Maysey et al., ed., W. B. Sanders, 1983.) and the like. Examples of radionuclide scans which have been utilized include: Gallium, which when injected into an animal or a human binds to the plasma protein transferring and tends to localize at sites of chronic inflammation; Indium labeled endogenous granulocytes, which when re-injected into the host will tend to accumulate at the site of inflammation; radiolabeled chelates which pass into the extracellular fluid and can possibly then accumulate at such sites of fluid accumulation as those associated with inflammation; and thallium scans or so-called first pass radionuclide angiograms employed to assess areas of increased blood flow. Techniques analogous to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,363,846, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, may also be used to identify inflammation. Other tests known in the art include Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) tests and C Reactive Protein (\u201cCRP\u201d) tests.","Methods for identifying a blood clotting condition (e.g., thrombosis and\/or coagulation) are also well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,849,507; 5,525,477; and 3,486,981, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. In certain embodiments, automated, computer-controlled instruments such as coagulometers and the like may be employed. Various imaging apparatuses may also be employed, e.g., ultrasounds and the like, for example, to diagnose deep vein thrombosis.","Various methods for identifying autonomic activity and autonomic dysfunction are also known. For example, measurements of heart rate variability (\u201cHRV\u201d) may be used as an indicator of autonomic dysfunction, as well as levels of T helper cells (Th1 and\/or Th2), and the like, e.g., as an indicator of the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio.","Treating the Subject for the Identified Condition(s)","Once it is determined that a subject is in need of treatment for at least one condition such as at least one of inflammation, blood clotting and autonomic dysfunction, the subject may then be treated for the identified condition(s) in accordance with the subject invention. Embodiments of the subject invention include treating a subject for any one of, inflammation, blood clotting and autonomic dysfunction by electrically and\/or pharmacologically modulating an inflammatory or blood clotting or autonomic receptor (e.g., stimulate or inhibit a receptor, e.g., block a receptor) to increase parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio (e.g., to effect binding affinity and\/or signal transduction), and\/or by targeting or modulating one or more enzymes, such as inflammatory pathway enzymes, to increase or decrease enzyme activity to increase the parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio.","Embodiments of the subject invention include treating a subject for any one of, inflammation, blood clotting and autonomic dysfunction by administering an effective amount of one of: an anti-inflammatory agent, anti-blood clotting agent and an autonomic system modulator such as an anti-adrenergic agent to treat one of, two of, or all three of the inflammation, blood clotting an autonomic dysfunction. By \u201canti-inflammatory agent\u201d and analogous terms is meant an agent that counteracts or suppresses the inflammatory process. By \u201canti-blood clotting agent\u201d and analogous terms is meant broadly to include anti-thrombotics and anti-coagulants where such agents act to prevent or interfere with the coagulation pathways and\/or the formation of thrombi, but in any event prevent or interfere with a body's ability to promote or form blood clots. By \u201cautonomic nervous system modulator\u201d and analogous terms (e.g., anti-adrenergic, anti-sympathetic, and the like) is meant an agent that is capable of modulating at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system. An autonomic nervous system modulator may modulate at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system in a number of ways, e.g., may increase parasympathetic activity, may decrease parasympathetic activity, may increase sympathetic activity, may decrease sympathetic activity. An example of an autonomic nervous system modulator is an anti-adrenergic agent. By \u201canti-adrenergic\u201d and analogous terms is meant an agent that blocks the effects of the sympathetic nervous system, e.g., by blocking receptors or decreasing the release of NE\/EPI.","Accordingly, embodiments of the subject invention provide a manner whereby one, two or all three conditions may be treated by using a single pharmacological agent. For example, if it is determined that a subject has one or more of an inflammatory condition, a blood clotting condition, and\/or an autonomic dysfunction condition such as adrenergia and it is determined that the subject requires treatment for the identified condition(s), an effective amount of an anti-inflammatory agent may be administered to treat the subject for the inflammatory condition, blood clotting condition and\/or autonomic dysfunction condition such as adrenergia. In certain embodiments, if it is determined that a subject has one or more of an inflammatory condition, a blood clotting condition, and an autonomic dysfunction condition such as adrenergia and requires treatment thereof, an effective amount of an anti-blood clotting agent may be administered to treat the subject for the inflammatory condition, blood clotting condition and\/or autonomic dysfunction condition such as adrenergia. In certain embodiments, if it is determined that a subject has one or more of an inflammatory condition, a blood clotting condition, and an autonomic dysfunction condition such as adrenergia and requires treatment thereof, an effective amount of an autonomic nervous system modulator such as an anti-adrenergic agent or the like may be administered to treat the subject for the inflammatory condition, blood clotting condition and\/or autonomic dysfunction condition such as adrenergia. In this manner, the number of different medications required to treat a subject for more than one type of condition is reduced.","In certain embodiments, if it is determined that a subject has one or more of an inflammatory condition, a blood clotting condition, and an autonomic dysfunction condition such as adrenergia and requires treatment thereof, receptors may be modulated in a manner that modulated at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system, e.g., increases the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio to treat the subject for the inflammatory condition, blood clotting condition and\/or autonomic dysfunction condition such as adrenergia. As will be known to those of skill in the art, receptors may be modulated in a manner that, for example, effects signal transduction and\/or ligand binding affinity.","In certain embodiments, if it is determined that a subject has one or more of an inflammatory condition, a blood clotting condition, and an autonomic dysfunction condition such as adrenergia and requires treatment thereof, inflammatory pathway enzymes may be targeted or modulated to increase or decrease enzyme activity to increase the parasympathetic\/sympathetic ratio.","In certain embodiments, it may be determined that a subject is only experiencing one or two of the conditions. In such embodiments, any one of the conditions may be treated with any one of an anti-inflammatory; anti-blood clotting and autonomic nervous system modulator such as an anti-adrenergic agent. Such may be advantageous for a variety of reasons, e.g., drug availability, drug cost, etc.","Accordingly, embodiments include treating a subject for an inflammatory condition without administering an anti-inflammatory agent to the subject. Such embodiments may include identifying a subject suffering from an inflammatory condition and administering an effective amount of at least one of an anti-blood clotting agent and an autonomic nervous system modulator such as an anti-adrenergic agent to the subject to treat the subject for the inflammatory condition. In certain embodiments, a subject may be treated for an inflammatory condition by modulating at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system to increase the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio in a manner effective to treat the subject for the inflammation.","Embodiments of the subject invention also include treating a subject for an undesirable blood clotting condition (e.g., coagulation and\/or thrombosis) without administering an anti-blood clotting agent to the subject. Such embodiments may include identifying a subject suffering from a blood clotting condition and administering an effective amount of at least one of an anti-inflammatory agent and an autonomic nervous system modulator such as an anti-adrenergic agent to the subject to treat the subject for the blood clotting condition. In certain embodiments, a subject may be treated for a blood clotting condition by modulating at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system to increase the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio in a manner effective to treat the subject for the blood clotting condition.","Embodiments of the subject invention also include treating a subject for an autonomic dysfunction condition such as adrenergia without administering an autonomic nervous system modulator such as an anti-adrenergic agent to the subject. Such embodiments may include identifying a subject suffering from an autonomic dysfunction condition such as suffering from adrenergia and administering an effective amount of at least one of an autonomic nervous system modulator such as an anti-inflammatory agent and an anti-blood clotting agent to the subject to treat the subject for the autonomic dysfunction condition such as adrenergia.","As described above, embodiments include treating a subject for a condition such as an inflammatory condition and\/or a blood clotting condition and\/or autonomic dysfunction condition such as an adrenergic condition by administering an effective amount of a pharmacological agent to treat the subject for the identified conditions or for the conditions at least suspected of being present. In further describing autonomic dysfunction, an adrenergic condition is described as an exemplary condition, where such description is in no way intended to limit the scope of the invention. An anti-adrenergic is described as an exemplary autonomic nervous system modulator where such description is in no way intended to limit the scope of the invention. Accordingly, one or more pharmacological agents may be employed to treat a subject for inflammation, blood clotting and adrenergia where in many embodiments all three conditions are treated at the same time with a single pharmacological agent. As noted above, pharmacological agents of interest include, but are not limited to, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-blood clotting agents and anti-adrenergic agents.","According to embodiments of the subject invention, pharmacological modulation may be accomplished by at least administering an effective amount of at least one pharmacological agent to a subject to treat the subject for at least one condition and in many embodiments a plurality of different conditions. That is, embodiments of the subject methods include administering an effective amount, i.e., a therapeutically effective amount, of one or more pharmacological agents to a subject to treat the subject for an identified (or suspected) condition or plurality of conditions such as inflammation and\/or thrombosis and\/or adrenergia. By \u201ceffective amount\u201d and analogous terms is meant an amount effective to facilitate a desired therapeutic effect, e.g., a desired reduction in severity and\/or frequency of one or more identified (or suspected) conditions such as inflammation and\/or blood clotting and\/or adrenergia, for a given period of time. The effective amount will vary with the age and physical condition of the subject, type and severity of the condition being treated, the duration of the treatment, the nature of any concurrent treatment, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier used if any, and analogous factors within the knowledge and expertise of those skilled in the art.","The effective amount of a given pharmacological agent may vary somewhat from subject to subject, and may depend upon factors such as, but not limited to, the age and condition of the subject, the form of the pharmacological agent, the route and method of delivery, etc., as noted above. Such dosages may be determined in accordance with routine pharmacological procedures known to those skilled in the art. For example, a pharmacological agent and\/or adjuvants may be administered to a subject in a single oral dose, one time a day or more for days, weeks, months, years, even as long as a subject's lifetime. For example, embodiments may include administering a given pharmacological agent one time a day over a prolonged period of time, e.g., over about 1 week, e.g., over about 1-3 months, e.g., about 3 months to about 3 years or more, e.g., orally or with a medical infusion pump or similar device designed for delivery of a substance over a prolonged period. The frequency of administration of a pharmacological agent may vary depending, e.g., on one or more of the factors described above. For example, the frequency of administration may range from about 1 time per day to multiple times per day, e.g., about 2 times or more per day or as necessary to treat or otherwise control or manage a condition, e.g., to treat a subject for inflammation and blood clotting and adrenergia. The duration of therapy depends on the type of condition being treated and may range from as short as about 24 hours to as long as the life of the subject. By \u201cadjuvants\u201d is meant a compound that, when used in combination with the one or more pharmacological agent compounds and\/or compositions, augments or otherwise alters or modifies the resultant pharmacological and\/or physiological responses.","Embodiments may include daily discrete or continuous unit doses wherein the total number of daily units may be equal to the total number of days of a given week, month, or the like, e.g., in the form of a pack. For example, embodiments may include daily discrete or continuous unit doses wherein the total number of daily units may be equal to the total number of days of a week or month, e.g., in the form of a monthly pack.","Embodiments also include pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage forms that are useful in treating conditions by modulating at least a portion of a subject's autonomic nervous system and which contain at least two different pharmacological agents. In certain embodiments, a single unit dosage form may include pharmacological agents of different classes or types. For example, a single drug administration entity may include two or more different classes of pharmacological agents such as an anti-inflammatory agent and an anti-adrenergic agent or an anti-inflammatory agent and an anti-blood clotting agent or an anti-blood clotting agent and an anti-adrenergic agent. For example, a single tablet, capsule, dragee, trocheem suppository, syringe, and the like, combining two or more pharmacological agents of different classes, e.g., a single drug administration entity may include an anti-inflammatory agent and an anti-adrenergic agent or an anti-inflammatory agent and an anti-blood clotting agent or an anti-blood clotting agent and an anti-adrenergic agent, would be a unit dosage form. Such compositions may be included as part of a therapeutic package in which one or more unit doses are placed in a finished pharmaceutical container. The actual amounts of each anti-inflammatory agent and\/or anti-adrenergic agent and\/or anti-blood clotting agent will vary according to the specific compositions being utilized, the particular compositions formulated, the mode of application, the particular route of administration, and the like. Dosages for a given subject can be determined using conventional considerations, e.g., by customary comparison of the differential activities of the subject compositions and of a known agent, or by means of an appropriate, conventional pharmacological protocol.","Depending on the particular pharmacological agent administered to a subject, whether an anti-inflammatory agent, anti-blood clotting agent or anti-adrenergic agent, the pharmacological agent may be administered to a subject using any convenient means capable of resulting in the treatment of at least the condition(s) identified. Thus, the at least one pharmacological agent may be incorporated into a variety of formulations for therapeutic administration. More particularly, the active agent may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by combination with appropriate, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. By \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d is meant a component such as a carrier, diluent, excipient, and the like of a composition that is compatible with the particular pharmacological agent and other optional ingredients of the subject pharmacological agent compositions in that a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be combined with the pharmacological agent without eliminating the biological or therapeutically effective activity of the pharmacological agent, and is suitable for use in subjects as provided herein without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and death). Side effects are \u201cundue\u201d when their risk outweighs the benefit provided by the pharmacological agent. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable components include, but are not limited to, any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers such as phosphate buffered saline solutions, water, emulsions such as oil\/water emulsions or water\/oil emulsions, microemulsions, and various types of wetting agents. Accordingly, the pharmacological agent employed in the subject methods may be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid (e.g., gel and the like), liquid or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granules, ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants and aerosols. As such, administration of a pharmacological agent may be achieved in various ways, including, but not limited to, oral, buccal (e.g. sub-lingual), rectal, topical (including both skin and mucosal surfaces, including airway surfaces), parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, intravenous and intrathecal), intraperiactivityal, transdermal, intracheal, intravaginal, endocervical, intrathecal, intranasal, intravesicular, in or on the eye, in the ear canal, etc., administration. In certain embodiments, a given pharmacological agent may be administered via a transdermal patch or film system such as or analogous to that described, e.g., in U.S. Pat.

Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical formulations to be formulated in unit dosage forms as tablets, pills, powder, dragees, capsules, liquids, lozenges, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, etc., suitable for ingestion by the patient. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use may be obtained through combination of at least one pharmacological agent with a solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable additional compounds, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable solid excipients include, but are not limited to, carbohydrate or protein fillers and include, but are not limited to sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; starch from corn, wheat, rice, potato, or other plants; cellulose such as methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; and gums including arabic and tragacanth; as well as proteins such as gelatin and collagen. If desired, disintegrating or solubilizing agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, alginic acid, or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate; with optional lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate; and if desired, with diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives and flavoring agents.","Accordingly, pharmacological formulations suitable for oral administration in accordance with the subject invention may be present in discrete units, such as capsules, cachets, lozenges, tablets, and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of the active pharmacological agent, as a powder or granules, as a solution or a suspension in a pharmacological formulation, and the like, and may be prepared by any suitable method of pharmacy which includes, but is not limited to, bringing into association the active pharmacological agent and a suitable carrier (which may contain one or more optional ingredients as noted above). For example, pharmacological formulations for use with the subject invention may be prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active pharmacological agent with a liquid or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the resulting mixture. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compressing or molding a powder or granules containing the active pharmacological agent, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the pharmacological agent in a free-flowing form, such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, and\/or surface active\/dispersing agent(s). Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a suitable machine, the powdered pharmacological agent moistened with an inert liquid binder.","A pharmacological anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting or anti-adrenergic agent of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These formulations may be prepared by mixing a pharmacological agent with a suitable non-irritating vehicle or excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperatures and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter, carbowaxes and polyethylene glycols. Embodiments include a pharmacological agent made into suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases.","A pharmacological anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting or anti-adrenergic agent used in the practice of the subject methods may also be administered by intranasal, intraocular, intravaginal, and intrarectal routes including suppositories, insufflation, powders and aerosol formulations (for examples of steroid inhalants, see Rohatagi, 35:1187-1193, 1995; Tjwa, 75:107-111, 1995).","For example, embodiments may also include a pharmacological anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting or anti-adrenergic agent in an aerosolized, atomized or nebulized vapor form, e.g., administrable via a metered dose device or nebulizer, and the like such that embodiments also include aerosolizing, vaporing or nebulizing one or more pharmacological agents for administration to a subject. Accordingly, a pharmacological anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic or anti-adrenergic agent may be utilized in aerosol formulation or an analogous formulation to be administered via inhalation or analogous means. The pharmacological agent employed in the practice of the present invention may be formulated into pressurized acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen and the like.","A pharmacological anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting or anti-adrenergic agent employed in the subject methods may be delivered transdermally, by a topical route, formulated as applicator sticks, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, gels, creams, ointments, pastes, jellies, paints, powders, and aerosols. For example, embodiments may include a pharmacological agent in the form of a discrete patch or film or plaster or the like adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a period of time. For example, such transdermal patches may include a base or matrix layer, e.g., polymeric layer, in which one or more pharmacological agents are retained. The base or matrix layer may be operatively associated with a support or backing. Pharmacological formulations suitable for transdermal administration may also be delivered by iontophoresis and may take the form of an optionally buffered aqueous solution of the pharmacological compound. Suitable formulations may include citrate or bis\/tris buffer (pH 6) or ethanol\/water and contain a suitable amount of active ingredient.","A pharmacological anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting or anti-adrenergic agent of the invention may also be delivered as microspheres for slow release in the body. For example, microspheres may be administered via intradermal injection of drug-containing microspheres, which slowly release subcutaneously (see Rao, 7:623-645, 1995); as biodegradable and injectable gel formulations (see, e.g., Gao 12:857-863, 1995); or, as microspheres for oral administration (see, e.g., Eyles, 49:669-674, 1997). Both transdermal and intradermal routes afford constant delivery for weeks or months.","A pharmaceutical formulation employed in the subject methods may be provided as a salt and may be formed with many acids, including but not limited to hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, malic, succinic, etc. Salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous or other protonic solvents that are the corresponding free base forms. In other cases, a preparation may be a lyophilized powder that is combined with buffer prior to use.","Pharmacological formulations employed in the subject invention may be useful for parenteral administration, such as intravenous (\u201cIV\u201d) administration, intramuscular (\u201cIM\u201d), subcutaneous (\u201cSC\u201d or \u201cSQ\u201d), mucosal. The formulations for administration may include a solution of the pharmacological agent dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed, include, but are not limited to, water and Ringer's solution, an isotonic sodium chloride, etc. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid can likewise be used in the preparation of injectables. Accordingly, a pharmacological agent may be formulated into preparations for injection by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol; and if desired, with conventional additives such as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives. These solutions are sterile and generally free of undesirable matter. These formulations may be sterilized by conventional, well known sterilization techniques. The formulations may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, toxicity adjusting agents, e.g., sodium acetate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium lactate and the like. The concentration of pharmacological agent in these formulations may vary widely, and will be selected based on fluid volumes, viscosities, body weight, and the like, in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected and the patient's needs. For IV administration, the formulation may be a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution of 1,3-butanediol, and the like. Accordingly, pharmacological formulations suitable for parenteral administration may include sterile aqueous and non-aqueous injection solutions of one or more active pharmacological agents, which preparations may be isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations may contain, buffers and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in single- or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or water-for-injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind described above.","In certain embodiments, a pharmacological anti-inflammatory, anti-blood-clotting or anti-adrenergic agent employed in the subject methods may be delivered by the use of liposomes which fuse with the cellular membrane or are endocytosed, i.e., by employing ligands attached to the liposome, or attached directly to the oligonucleotide, that bind to surface membrane protein receptors of the cell resulting in endocytosis. By using liposomes, particularly where the liposome surface carries ligands specific for target cells, or are otherwise preferentially directed to a specific organ, one can focus the delivery of the pharmacological agent into the target cells in vivo. (See, e.g., A1-Muhammed, 13:293-306, 1996; Chonn, 6:698-708, 1995; Ostro, 46:1576-1587, 1989). Accordingly, embodiments may include a pharmacological agent administered as liposomal formulations of the pharmacological agent. Methods for preparing liposomal suspensions are known in the art and thus will not be described herein in great detail. Briefly, in those embodiments where the pharmacological agent is an aqueous-soluble pharmacological agent, the pharmacological agent may be incorporated into lipid vesicles using conventional liposome technology. In such instances, due to the water solubility of the pharmacological agent, the pharmacological agent may be substantially entrained within the hydrophilic center or core of the liposomes. The lipid layer employed may be of any conventional composition and may either contain cholesterol or may be cholesterol-free. When the pharmacological agent of interest is water-insoluble, the pharmacological agent may be substantially entrained within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer which forms the structure of the liposome employing conventional liposome formation technology. In either instance, the liposomes which may be produced may be reduced in size, as through the use of standard sonication and homogenization techniques. Embodiments of liposomal formulations containing the pharmacological agent of interest may be lyophilized to produce a lyophilizate which may be reconstituted with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as water, to regenerate a liposomal suspension.","Embodiments of the pharmacological anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting or anti-adrenergic agent employed in the practice of the subject invention may include pharmaceutical compositions that may be prepared from water-insoluble compounds, or salts thereof, such as aqueous base emulsions. In such embodiments, the pharmacological composition will typically contain a sufficient amount of pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifying agent to emulsify the desired amount of the pharmacological agent. Useful emulsifying agents include, but are not limited to, phosphatidyl cholines, lecithin, and the like.","As noted above, in addition to active pharmacological anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting or anti-adrenergic agents, other additives such as pH-adjusting additives may be added to provide a pharmacological composition. In particular, useful pH-adjusting agents that may be used include acids, such as hydrochloric acid, bases or buffers, such as sodium lactate, sodium acetate, sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium borate, or sodium gluconate. Furthermore, pharmacological compositions may, though not always, contain microbial preservatives. Microbial preservatives that may be employed include, but are not limited to, methylparaben, propylparaben, and benzyl alcohol. The microbial preservative may be employed when the pharmacological formulation is placed in a vial designed for multidose use. Pharmaceutical compositions for use in practicing the subject methods may be lyophilized using techniques well known in the art.","Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as vehicles, adjuvants, carriers or diluents, that may be employed in the subject invention are readily available to the public. Moreover, pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, stabilizers, wetting agents and the like, are readily available to the public.","Embodiments may also include administration of a pharmacological agent such as an anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting, anti-adrenergic, or the like, using a pharmacological delivery device such as, but not limited to, pumps (implantable or external devices and combinations of both (e.g., certain components are implantable and others may be external to the body such as controls for the implantable components), epidural injectors, syringes or other injection apparatus, catheter and\/or reservoir operatively associated with a catheter, etc. For example, in certain embodiments a delivery device employed to deliver an anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting, anti-adrenergic, or the like to a subject may be a pump, syringe, catheter or reservoir operably associated with a connecting device such as a catheter, tubing, or the like. Containers suitable for delivery of a pharmacological agent to a pharmacological agent administration device include instruments of containment that may be used to deliver, place, attach, and\/or insert the pharmacological agent into the delivery device for administration of the pharmacological agent to a subject and include, but are not limited to, vials, ampules, tubes, capsules, bottles, syringes and bags. Embodiments may also include administration of a pharmacological agent via a biodegradable implant drug delivery device. Such may be accomplished by employing syringes to deposit such a biodegradable delivery device under the skin of a subject. The implants degrade completely, so that removal is not necessary.","Embodiments may include employing an electrode to deliver a pharmacological anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting or anti-adrenergic agent to a subject. For example, an electrode may be used that has a small port at its tip which is connected to a reservoir or pump containing a pharmacological agent. The pharmacological agent delivery electrode may be implanted using any suitable technique such as surgical cut down, laproscopy, endoscopy, percutaneous procedure, and the like. In certain embodiments a reservoir or pump may also be implanted in the subject's body. The pharmacological agent delivery electrode, or other analogous device, may be controllable such that the amount of pharmacological agent delivered, the rate at which the pharmacological agent may be delivered, and the time period over which the pharmacological agent may be delivered, etc., may be controllable and may be adjusted.","In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be preservative free. By \u201cpreservative free\u201d is meant the substantial absence of chemical, antibacterial, antimicrobial, or antioxidative additives, or the like, from the pharmaceutically acceptable carriers of the present invention. \u201cSubstantial absence\u201d may mean that no preservative is present in the compositions or that trace amounts may be present that impart no detectable effect otherwise attributable to a preservative. For example, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be characterized by the substantial absence of chemical, antibacterial, antimicrobial, or antioxidative additives or the like (e.g., contain less than about 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, or even about 0.00 percent by weight of a preservative). Further, such formulations may be substantially or essentially free of alcohols such as ethanol (e.g., contain less than about 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, or even about 0.00 percent by weight of alcohols such as ethanol). Examples of suitable pharmacological formulations include, but are not limited to, formulations that include one or more active pharmacological agents and physiological saline solution (optionally including other typical ingredients such as other active agents and buffers).","As noted above, in pharmaceutical dosage forms, a given anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting or anti-adrenergic agent may be administered alone or with or in appropriate association, as well as in combination, with other pharmaceutically active compounds. As used herein, \u201cadministered with\u201d means that a given pharmacological agent and at least one other adjuvant (including one or more other different pharmacological agents) are administered at times sufficiently close that the results observed are indistinguishable from those achieved when the pharmacological agent and at least one other adjuvant are administered at the same point in time. The pharmacological agent and at least one other adjuvant (including one or more other different pharmacological agents) may be administered simultaneously (i.e., concurrently) or sequentially. Simultaneous administration may be carried out by mixing a given pharmacological agent and at least one other adjuvant (including one or more other different pharmacological agents) prior to administration, or by administering a given pharmacological agent and at least one other adjuvant (including one or more other different pharmacological agents) at the same point in time. Such administration may be at different anatomic sites or using different routes of administration. The phrases \u201cconcurrent administration,\u201d \u201cadministration in combination,\u201d \u201csimultaneous administration\u201d or \u201cadministered simultaneously\u201d may also be used interchangeably and mean that a given pharmacological agent and at least one other adjuvant a (including one or more other different pharmacological agents) are administered at the same point in time or immediately following one another. In the latter case, the pharmacological agent and at least one other adjuvant (including one or more other different pharmacological agents) are administered at times sufficiently close that the results produced are synergistic and\/or are indistinguishable from those achieved when the at least one pharmacological agent and at least one other adjuvant are administered at the same point in time. Alternatively, a pharmacological agent may be administered separately from the administration of an adjuvant (including one or more other different pharmacological agents), which may result in a synergistic effect or a separate effect. The methods and excipients described herein are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.","For example, a subject identified as having thrombosis may be treated for the identified thrombosis with the simultaneous administration of an anti-inflammatory agent and an anti-adrenergic agent; a subject identified as having inflammation may be treated for the inflammation with the simultaneous administration of an anti-blood clotting agent and an anti-adrenergic; a subject identified as having adrenergia may be treated for the adrenergia with the simultaneous administration of an anti-blood clotting agent and an anti-inflammatory agent. Embodiments may include treating a subject for two or more identified conditions such as two or more of an inflammatory condition, a blood clotting condition and an adrenergic condition by the simultaneous administration any combination of two or more of an anti-blood clotting agent, anti-inflammatory agent and anti-adrenergic agent. A subject identified as having an inflammatory condition, a blood clotting condition and an adrenergic condition may be treated for the three identified conditions with the simultaneous administration of an anti-thrombotic agent and an anti-inflammatory agent, or an anti-blood clotting agent and an anti-adrenergic, or an anti-inflammatory agent and anti-adrenergic agent.","Unit dosage forms for oral or rectal administration such as syrups, elixirs, and suspensions may be provided wherein each dosage unit, for example, teaspoonful, tablespoonful, tablet or suppository, contains a predetermined amount of a pharmacological agent such as a predetermined amount of an anti-inflammatory agent, anti-blood clotting agent, anti-adrenergic agent, or the like. Similarly, unit dosage forms for injection or intravenous or other suitable administration route may include a pharmacological agent in a composition as a solution in sterile water, normal saline or another pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","The term \u201cunit dosage form,\u201d as used herein, refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of pharmacological agent(s) calculated in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specifications for the unit dosage forms of a given pharmacological agent employed in the practice of the present invention depend on, for example, the particular pharmacological agent employed and the effect to be achieved, the pharmacodynamics associated with the particular pharmacological agent in the subject, etc.","As noted above, those of skill in the art will readily appreciate that dose levels may vary as a function of the specific pharmacological agent, the nature of the delivery vehicle, and the like. Dosages for a given pharmacological agent are readily determinable by those of skill in the art by a variety of means. Exemplary dosage levels are provided herein and are not to be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.","A wide variety of different anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting and anti-adrenergic agents may be employed in the practice of the subject methods, where the particular anti-inflammatory, anti-blood clotting or anti-adrenergic agent or combination of agents employed will depend on, e.g., the subject being treated, the condition(s) being treated, duration of treatment, whether it is desired to increase activity in the parasympathetic system and\/or increase activity in the sympathetic system and\/or decrease activity in the sympathetic system and\/or decrease activity in the parasympathetic system, etc. Representative pharmacological agents (and analogs, derivatives and salts thereof) include, but are not limited to, one of more of the following exemplary agents. It is to be understood that the subject invention includes analogues, derivatives and salts of the described agents that are now known or to be discovered.","Anti-blood clotting agents including anti-coagulants, anti-platelet agents, and anti-thrombotics may be employed in the practice of the subject invention, including, but not limited to one or more of: triclopidone, clopidogrel, GP IIb\/IIIa receptor antagonists, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN);

Accordingly, certain embodiments may include identifying the condition causing or which has the potential to cause, including exacerbating, an inflammatory condition and\/or blood clotting condition and\/or adrenergic condition.","Modulating at Least a Portion of a Subject's Autonomic Nervous System","As noted above, certain embodiments may include treating a subject for at least one of an inflammatory condition, a blood clotting condition and an autonomic nervous system dysfunction condition such as an adrenergic condition, and in many embodiment all three-simultaneously, by modulating at least a portion of the subject's autonomic nervous system to increase the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio in a manner effective to treat the subject for the condition(s). Such modulation may be accomplished using any suitable method, including pharmacological modulation and electrical energy modulation; As noted above, in certain embodiments modulation of the autonomic nervous system may be accomplished at least in part by modulating receptors, e.g., beta adrenergic receptors, immunomodulatory receptors, and the like. Methods and devices for treating a subject for a condition by modulating at least a portion of the subject's autonomic nervous system have been described in copending, commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/661,368, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.","As methods and devices for treating a subject for a condition by modulating at least a portion of the subject's autonomic nervous system have been described in detail the above-noted copending, commonly assigned U.S. patent application, they will not be described in great detail herein. Briefly, in accordance with the subject invention to treat a subject for at least one of, and in many embodiment two or all three of: an inflammatory condition, blood clotting condition and adrenergic condition such as adrenergia, at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system may be modulated using any suitable technique, including, but not limited to, surgical methods (e.g., surgical isolation of an effector structure from sympathetic and\/or parasympathetic innervation, i.e., surgically isolating an effector structure from one or more sympathetic and\/or parasympathetic nerve fibers associated with it); ablation (permanently or reversibly ablating a nerve by employing energy delivery devices or cryotherapy); cryoablation; thermoablation; microwave energy; focus ultrasound; magnetic fields including internal and external magnetic fields; laser energy; optical energy; radiofrequency energy; pacing mechanisms (e.g., implantable electrode-based pacing systems, external magnetic-based pacing system, and the like); transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (\u201cTENS\u201d) or transmagentic stimulation (\u201cTMS\u201d) (see for example George, M. Stimulating the Brain. Sci Amer 2003 Sept.); pharmacological modulation and electrical modulation. Certain embodiments may include employing an electric energy supplying device to modulate at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system wherein the device may incorporate an immunomodulator such as a steroid or the like on a subject contacting surface. A device may be permanently or temporarily implanted.","Accordingly, embodiments of the subject invention includes modulating at least a portion of a subject's autonomic nervous system to increase the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio, i.e., increase parasympathetic activity relative to sympathetic activity to treat a subject for at least one of, and in many embodiment simultaneously two or even all three of: an inflammatory condition and\/or blood clotting condition and\/or adrenergic condition. Increasing the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio may be achieved by stimulating the parasympathetic system to increase activity in at least a portion of the parasympathetic system, e.g., stimulating at least one parasympathetic nerve fiber. Alternatively or in addition to stimulating at least one parasympathetic nerve fiber to increase activity, increasing the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio may be achieved by inhibiting activity in the sympathetic system, e.g., inhibiting activity in at least one sympathetic nerve fiber. As noted above, increasing the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio may also be accomplished by modulating receptors, e.g., to stimulate or inhibit signal transduction and\/or increase or decrease binding affinity. While the subject methods are described primarily with respect to embodiments that result in increasing the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio, it is to be understood that the subject invention is not limited to embodiments wherein the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio is increased and as such it is to be understood that the subject invention includes embodiments for modulating at least a portion of a subject's autonomic nervous system to decrease the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio, i.e., decrease parasympathetic activity relative to sympathetic activity, and the like.","In embodiments that include modulating at least a portion of a subject's autonomic nervous system to treat the subject for a condition such as an inflammatory condition and\/or thrombotic condition and\/or adrenergic condition, a sympathetic bias may be the normal or desired state, but the ratio of the two systems may be abnormal or otherwise contributing to a condition (e.g., inflammation, blood clotting, adrenergia, and the like) such that the ratio is adjusted but still provides a sympathetic bias (or may be adjusted to provide a parasympathetic bias). Increasing parasympathetic activity may also be desired in instances where, prior to the application of autonomic nervous system-modulating electrical energy and\/or the administration of an effective amount of at least one pharmacological agent, parasympathetic activity is higher than the sympathetic activity, but the differential between the two systems needs to be modulated such as increased further, e.g., the sympathetic activity is normal or above normal (i.e., abnormally high) and\/or the parasympathetic activity is normal or below normal (i.e., abnormally low) or above normal (i.e., abnormally low). For example, such instances may occur where a subject has normal or above normal parasympathetic function, but also has elevated sympathetic function. Other instances may include below normal parasympathetic function, but normal or elevated sympathetic function, etc. It may also be desirable to increase parasympathetic function in instances where the respective activities of the two system are analogous or approximately equal, including equal, prior to increasing activity in the parasympathetic system, but the level of one or both is abnormally high or abnormally low. The above-described examples of instances where increasing parasympathetic activity may be desired is exemplary only and is in no way intended to limit the scope of the invention and other instances where increasing parasympathetic activity may be desired will be apparent to those of skill in the art.","While the subject methods are described primarily with respect to increasing activity in the parasympathetic system, it is to be understood that this is for exemplary purposes only and is in no way intended to limit the scope of the invention as activity may also, or in addition, be increased in at least a portion of the sympathetic nervous system.","To accomplish the modulation of at least a portion of a subject's autonomic nervous system electrical energy (electrical modulation) may be applied to at least a portion of a subject's autonomic nervous system, where such electrical energy may be excitatory or inhibitory and in certain embodiments may include both excitatory and inhibitory stimulation. Embodiments of the subject methods may also, in addition to or instead of electrical energy, include administering at least one pharmacological agent (pharmacological modulation) to said subject to modulate at least a portion of a subject's autonomic nervous system, where the pharmacological agent may be employed to increase activity in at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system and\/or decrease activity in at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system. Pharmacological agents of interest include, but are not limited to, agents described herein.","Embodiments of the subject invention may include electrically modulating (i.e., applying electrical energy to) at least a portion of a subject's autonomic nervous system and\/or pharmacologically modulate at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system to achieve a desired parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio, i.e., a desired level of parasympathetic activity relative to sympathetic activity. As described above, in certain embodiments the desired ratio is analogous to a parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio observed in a healthy (e.g., a subject not experiencing the condition for which the subject is being treated such as not experiencing inflammation and\/or thrombosis and\/or adrenergia), \u201clike\u201d or rather analogous subject, e.g., a healthy human subject ranging in age from about 20 years old to about 25 years old (subjects other than humans will have analogous age ranges). For example, if the subject being treated is a human subject, the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio provided by the practice of the subject methods to treat the subject for thrombosis and\/or inflammation and\/or adrenergia may be analogous to the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio observed in a healthy human ranging in age from about 20 years old to about 25 years old.","As noted above, embodiments of the subject invention may include treating a subject for a condition such as an inflammatory condition and\/or thrombotic condition and\/or adrenergic condition by pharmacologically modulating at least a portion of the subject's autonomic nervous system, e.g., to increase the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio or increase parasympathetic activity relative to sympathetic activity. By \u201cpharmacologically modulating at least a portion of a subject's autonomic nervous system\u201d is meant altering or changing at least a portion of an autonomic nervous system by pharmacological means to provide a change, alteration or shift in at least one component or aspect of the autonomic nervous system, as will be described in greater detail below. The modulation of the autonomic nervous system may affect central motor output and\/or nerve conduction and\/or transmitter release and\/or synaptic transmission and\/or receptor activation, and in many embodiments is a change that provides an increase in the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio (as used herein, \u201cactivity\u201d and \u201cfunction\u201d are used interchangeably). For example, at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system may be pharmacologically modulated to alter, shift or change parasympathetic activity and\/or sympathetic activity from a first state to a second state, where the second state is characterized by an increase in the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio relative to the first state. In certain embodiments, the subject invention provides methods of increasing activity in at least one parasympathetic nerve fiber to achieve an increase in the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio. In certain embodiments the subject invention provides methods of inhibiting activity in at least one sympathetic nerve fiber to achieve an increased parasympathetic activity relative to sympathetic activity. Still further, in certain embodiments the subject invention provides methods of both increasing activity in at least one parasympathetic nerve fiber and inhibiting activity in at least one sympathetic nerve fiber to achieve the desired result.","Accordingly, in certain embodiments of the subject methods the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio is increased. By \u201cincreased ratio of parasympathetic activity to sympathetic activity\u201d and analogous terms is meant that this ratio is increased in at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system, where the increase is at least great enough to treat a given condition. While the ratio of sympathetic function\/parasympathetic function may be increased according to embodiments of the subject invention to treat a subject for, e.g., inflammation and\/or blood clotting and\/or adrenergia, the net result may be a sympathetic bias (i.e., sympathetic dominance), parasympathetic bias (i.e., parasympathetic dominance) or the activities of the sympathetic system and parasympathetic system may be substantially equal (i.e., neither is dominant). By \u201cbias\u201d is meant that the particular \u201cbiased\u201d component of the autonomic nervous system has a higher activity level than the other component. For example, a sympathetic bias refers to a higher level of sympathetic activity than parasympathetic activity, and vice versa, where such bias may be systemic or localized. The net result of the subject methods to treat a condition may be higher or greater sympathetic activity relative to parasympathetic activity in at least the area of the autonomic system targeted or rather in need of modulation, higher or greater parasympathetic activity relative to sympathetic activity in at least the area of the autonomic system targeted or rather in need of modulation, or substantially equal activity levels of sympathetic activity and parasympathetic activity. For example, embodiments of the subject methods may include treating a subject for sympathetic bias and\/or inflammation and\/or blood clotting by administering an effective amount of an anti-adrenergic agent to the subject, where the administered agent may result in a sympathetic bias, parasympathetic bias or substantially equivalent activity levels of parasympathetic activity and sympathetic activity. Accordingly, embodiments include treating a subject for sympathetic bias and an inflammatory condition and a blood clotting condition at the same time by administering an effective amount of a single pharmacological agent, e.g., an anti-adrenergic agent, to the subject.","In practicing the subject methods, at least a portion of a subject's autonomic nervous system is modulated, e.g., electrically and\/or pharmacologically. Modulation according to the embodiments of the subject methods may result in an increase in parasympathetic activity relative to sympathetic activity (i.e., increase parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio). As noted above, the electrical and\/or pharmacological modulation may provide an increase in function of at least a portion of the autonomic system, e.g., increase function in at least one parasympathetic nerve fiber, and\/or provide a decrease in function or dampening of a portion of the autonomic system, e.g., may inhibit activity in at least one sympathetic nerve fiber or inhibit nerve pulse transmission.","Exemplary pharmacological agents that may be employed to modulate a portion of a subject's autonomic nervous system to treat the subject for inflammatory condition and\/or blood clotting condition and\/or adrenergic condition include, but are not limited to, those described herein and elsewhere.","As mentioned above, embodiments also include targeting a receptor to modulate it in a manner to increase parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio in at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system to treat a subject for at least one of an inflammatory condition, a blood clotting condition and an autonomic nervous system dysfunction condition. The activity of a receptor may be increased or decreased (e.g., a receptor may be blocked), depending on the desired result, e.g., whether it is desirable to increase parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio or decrease the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio. For example, the particulars as to receptor modulation may depend on, e.g., whether it is desirable to increase ligand binding affinity to the receptor, decrease ligand binding affinity, increase signal transmission, decrease signal transmission, etc. Receptors that may be targeted include sympathetic receptors and parasympathetic receptors.","For example, pro-sympathetic receptors, the activation of which may promote inflammation (and which may be referred to as sympathetic inflammatory receptors), and which may be targeted to treat a subject for at least one of an adrenergic condition and a blood clotting condition include, but are not limited to the following receptors: catecholamine, noradrenaline, interferon alpha, interferon beta, interferon gamma, CD 20, CD 3, Interleukin 1-13 and 18, estrogen, testosterone, gonadotropin releasing Hormone, oxytocin, alcohol, adrenaline, dehydroepiandrostonedione, glucagons-like peptide 1, leptin, and histamine, etc.","Pro-sympathetic receptors, the activation of which may promote blood-clotting (and which may be referred to as sympathetic or pro-sympathetic blood clotting receptors), and which may be targeted to treat a subject for at least one of an inflammatory condition and an adrenergic condition include, but are not limited to the following receptors: prothrombin, thrombin, fibrinogen, etc.","Pro-sympathetic receptors, the activation of which may promote adrenergia, and which may be targeted to treat a subject for at least one of a blood clotting condition and an adrenergic condition (and which may be referred to as adrenergic receptors), include, but are not limited to the following receptors: beta receptor, alpha receptor, aldosterone, anti-diuretic hormone, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, renal distal tubule transporters, loop of henle transporters, renal proximal tubule transporters, cholinergic, sodium channel, calcium channel, etc.","Pro-parasympathetic receptors, the activation of which may promote inflammation, and which may be targeted to treat a subject for at least one of a blood clotting and an adrenergic condition (and which may be referred to as parasympathetic or pro-parasympathetic inflammatory receptors), include, but are not limited to the following receptors: relaxin, nicotoine, muscarinic, phosphodiesterase, cholinergic, magnesium channel, alchohol, progesterone, etc.","Embodiments also include modulating (e.g., activating or de-activating) one or more enzymes in a manner to increase parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio or decrease parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity in at least a portion of the autonomic nervous system to treat a subject for at least one of an inflammatory condition, a blood clotting condition and an autonomic nervous system dysfunction condition.","For example, pro sympathetic enzymes that promote inflammation that may be modulated to treat a subject for at least one of an adrenergic condition and a blood clotting condition include, but are not limited to the following enzymes: HMG CoA reductase, acetylcholinesterase, vesicular monoamine transporter, dipeptidyl peptidase IV etc.","Pro sympathetic enzymes that promote blood-clotting that may be targeted to treat a subject for at least one of an inflammatory condition and an adrenergic condition include, but are not limited to the following enzymes: Factor Va, Factor VII, Factor VIIa, Factor VIIIa, Factor IX, Factor IXa, Factor X, Factor Xa, Factor XI, Factor XIa, Factor XII, Factor XIIa, Factor XIIIa, etc.","Pro sympathetic enzymes that promote adrenergia that may be targeted to treat a subject for at least one of a blood clotting condition and an adrenergic condition include, but are not limited to the following enzymes: angiotensin converting enzyme, rennin, etc.","Pro parasympathetic enzymes that are inflammatory that may be targeted to treat a subject for at least one of a blood clotting and an adrenergic condition include, but are not limited to the following enzymes: nitric oxide, phosphodiesterase, etc.","Feeback Loops","Embodiments of the subject invention may include observing (including measuring) one or more physiological or biologic aspects of a subject and employing the observed one or more aspects as an indicator of the state of the autonomic nervous system modulation according to the subject inventions. Stated otherwise, embodiments include a closed-loop system in which a variable is used as an indicator of state of the autonomic nervous system and may be employed as a trigger to initiate, terminate or adjust modulation of the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio in a manner to treat a subject for a condition. In some aspects, a processor for controlling interface functions executes instructions based on measurements obtained by a detector or other measurement componentry. For example, a processor for controlling interface functions may initiate, adjust or terminate a given treatment protocol, including direct movement of a device for administering a treatment protocol according to the subject invention (e.g., an electrical energy delivering device, pharmaceutical agent delivery device (implantable or otherwise), etc., in response to a measurement obtained. In some aspects, aspects of the subject methods respond to feedback from a monitoring system which monitors one or more biological or physiological functions of a subject being treated. A variable may be measured and the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio may be modulated in a manner to alter the variable. Once a predetermined target variable measurement is achieved, modulation may be terminated or adjusted to maintain the achieved state.","Embodiments may include, prior to and\/or during and\/or after modulation of the ANS to treat a subject for an inflammatory condition and\/or blood clotting condition and\/or adrenergia, determining and\/or monitoring-continuously or periodically, any of such conditions, including determining the state of the ANS, e.g., the parasympathetic activity\/sympathetic activity ratio. For example, embodiments may include determining whether an inflammatory condition and\/or blood clotting condition and\/or adrenergia is present. As described above, monitoring of one or more physiological or biologic functions of a subject may be employed in a feedback system whereby modulation of at least a portion of the ANS may be performed according to (i.e., tailored to or based upon) an observed physiological or biologic function.","For example, in the case where pulmonary gas is monitored before and\/or during and\/or after ANS modulation, the particulars of a pharmacological modulation and\/or electrical modulation may be based on the determined pulmonary gas levels such that the amount of pharmacological agent or electrical stimulation may be continually or periodically adjusted until a predetermined, e.g., normal, pulmonary gas level is obtained, at which time ANS modulation may be terminated. For example, the dosage of a given agent may be based on a determined pulmonary gas level. This monitoring and modulation of ANS may be performed automatically, e.g., by way of suitable componentry such that a physiological aspect of a subject may be repeatedly monitored a given ANS modulation protocol and may be adjusted one or more times based on the results of the monitoring. In many embodiments, an ANS modulation protocol may be continued until a particular level or quality of one or more physiological or biologic aspects are obtained, i.e., a predetermined parameter may be targeted and the ANS may be modulated until that predetermined parameter is achieved. In certain embodiments, a targeted level or quality of a physiological and\/or biologic aspect is analogous to the level or quality of a normal subject, as described above. In the below-described exemplary physiological aspects that may be employed in such a feedback loop system, reference values are indicated in parenthesis such that in certain embodiment a reference value may be a target value and once observed, modulation of the ANS may be terminated. Accordingly, in certain embodiments a given ANS modulation protocol may be performed until a time at which a predetermined level or quality of a physiological aspect or biologic aspect of a subject is observed, such as a reference value. Any suitable method may be employed for such observing, determining and monitoring where such methods are known in the art and include methods described herein. In certain embodiments, the determination of pulmonary gases may be employed (reference: alveolar oxygen 600-713 mm Hg).","In certain embodiments, the determination of serum blood gases may be employed (reference: ph range 7.1 to 7.7; arterial pCOrange 10 mm Hg to 80 mm Hg; arterial pOrange from 50 mmHg to 110 mmHg; arterial bicarbonate range 10 meq to 40 meq\/L; alveolar\/oxygen ratio of 1.0 to 0.6; alveolar to arterial gradient of 5 to 120 mHg; venous oxygen saturation 30% to 80%).","In certain embodiments aspects measured during an overnight sleep study may be employed.
