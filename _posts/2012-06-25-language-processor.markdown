Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a referring expression processor for processing referring expressions, a language processor including the referring expression processor and a referring expression processing method.","2. Background Art","Assume that a robot communicates with a person using a speech dialogue system or the like. Assume that there exit a plurality of desks and a plurality of chairs in a room and a person specifies a desk by a referring expression \u201cthe white desk with red legs\u201d. Referring expressions are language expressions intended by speakers to pointing at specific entities of interest to hearers. Operation of a language processor of a robot for identifying the desk specified by a person based on the referring expression is referred to as understanding of referring expressions. Operation of the language processor of the robot for generating referring expressions which represent the desk specified by the robot and which is easily understandable by persons in order to make a person identify the desk is referred to as generation of referring expressions. Referring expressions made by persons as a matter of course depend on knowledge of the persons. Accordingly, the language processor has to utilize data on knowledge of persons when carrying out understanding and generation of referring expressions.","A probabilistic model can be used by the language processor to utilize data on knowledge of persons when carrying out understanding and generation of referring expressions.","JP2010-224536A filed by Honda Motor discloses a language processor which handles referring expressions for referring to portions of an object and a probability calculating method used in language processing by the language processor.","However, JP2010-224536A does not disclose a mechanism by which referring expressions including descriptive, anaphoric and deictic expressions are understood and generated in the course of dialogue.","Accordingly, there is a need for a referring expression processor for processing referring expressions, a language processor including the referring expression processor and a referring expression processing method which use a probabilistic model and in which referring expressions including descriptive, anaphoric and deictic expressions are understood and generated in the course of dialogue.","A referring expression processor according to the first aspect of the invention includes: a referring expression processing section which performs at least one of understanding and generation of referring expressions using a probabilistic model constructed with a referring expression Bayesian network, each referring expression Bayesian network representing relationships between a reference domain (D) which is a set of possible referents, a referent (X) in the reference domain, a concept (C) concerning the referent and a word (W) which represents the concept; and a memory which stores data necessary for constructing the referring expression Bayesian network.","The referring expression processor according to the present aspect uses a probabilistic model constructed with a referring expression Bayesian network, each referring expression Bayesian network representing relationships between a reference domain (D) which is a set of possible referents, a referent (X) in the reference domain, a concept (C) concerning the referent and a word (W) which represents the concept. Accordingly, referring expressions including descriptive, deictic or anaphoric expressions can be understood and generated by the referring expression processor. Further, each referring expression Bayesian network includes a reference domain (D) which is a set of possible referents, and therefore referring expressions can be processed according to the circumstances by the referring expression processor.","In a referring expression processor according to one embodiment of the present invention, each referring expression Bayesian network is constructed in the course of dialogue each time a referring expression is processed.","By the referring expression processor according to the present embodiment, a referring expression can be processed according to development of the dialogue.","In a referring expression processor according to another embodiment of the present invention, a way of determining the reference domain is changed depending on types of referring expressions.","By the referring expression processor according to the present embodiment, a referring expression can be processed with a higher accuracy by taking types of referring expressions into consideration.","In a referring expression processor according to another embodiment of the present invention, the reference domain is determined to include all elements (possible referents) when a referring expression contains a demonstrative.","By the referring expression processor according to the present embodiment, a referring expression can be processed with a higher accuracy by considering a single reference domain which includes all elements when the referring expression contains a demonstrative.","In a referring expression processor according to another embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of prediction models for reference domains which have saliency as a parameter are constructed and one of the plurality of prediction models is selected for use depending on whether a referring expression refers to a single entity or a set of entities.","By the referring expression processor according to the present embodiment, a referring expression can be processed with a higher accuracy by selecting one of the plurality of prediction models for use depending on whether a referring expression refers to a single entity or a set of entities.","A language processor according to the second aspect of the present invention includes a referring expression processor according to the present invention.","The language processor according to the resent aspect includes a referring expression processor according to the present invention and therefore it can process a referring expression with a higher accuracy as described above.","A method for processing a referring expression according to the third aspect of the present invention, includes the steps of constructing, by a referring expression processing section of a language processor, a referring expression Bayesian network representing relationships between a reference domain (D) which is a set of possible referents, a referent (X) in the reference domain, a concept (C) concerning the referent and a word (W) which represents the concept using data stored in a memory; obtaining, by the referring expression processing section, a probability\n\nP(X|D)\n\nby marginaliazing the referring expression Bayesian network; and obtaining, by the referring expression processing section, x\u2032 which maximizes\n\nP(X|D)\n\nto select x\u2032 as the referent of the referring expression.\n","The method for processing a referring expression according to the present aspect uses a referring expression Bayesian network representing relationships between a reference domain (D) which is a set of possible referents, a referent (X) in the reference domain, a concept (C) concerning the referent and a word (W) which represents the concept. Accordingly, referring expressions including descriptive, deictic or anaphoric expressions can be understood and generated by the method.

The memory  stores data used by the probabilistic model. The referring expression processing section  updates the probabilistic model in the course of dialogue. When understanding a reference expression, that is, when identifying the referent indicated by the reference expression, the referring expression processing section  calculates probabilities that the reference expression represents candidate referents and regards the referent which shows the maximum probability as the referent indicated by the reference expression. Further, when generating a reference expression, that is, when selecting a referring expression that represents a referent, the referring expression processing section  calculates probabilities that candidate reference expressions represent the referent and selects the referring expression which shows the maximum probability as the reference expression which represents the referent. The referring expression processing section  and the memory  constitute a referring expression processor. The components of the referring expression processor will be described in detail later.","A speech recognition section  recognizes human speech, divides the speech into morphemes which are the smallest elements of the language and determines parts of speech of the morphemes using a dictionary, for example. A structure analyzing section  analyzes a sentence structure based on information of morphemes obtained by the speech recognition section .","A surface expression realizing section  generates an expression of natural language including a referring expression which has been generated by the referring expression processing section . A speech synthesizing and displaying section  performs speech synthesis of the expression of natural language or displays the expression of natural language.","The language processor further includes a language understanding section , a language generating section  and a dialogue managing section . The language understanding section  receives the results of structure analysis from the structure analyzing section , performs processing for understanding language except processing of referring expressions performed by the referring expression processing section  and sends the results to the dialogue managing section . The language generating section  performs processing for generating language except generation of referring expressions performed by the referring expression processing section  and sends the results to the surface expression realizing section . The dialogue managing section  receives from the referring expression processing section  referents which referring expressions indicate, receives from the language understanding section  the results of processing for understanding language except processing of referring expressions performed by the referring expression processing section  and performs processing of the received inputs. The dialogue managing section  generates outputs based on the inputs and other conditions and sends the outputs to the referring expression processing section  and the language generating section . The referring expression processing section  receives the outputs of the dialogue managing section  and generates a proper referring expression. The language generating section  receives the outputs of the dialogue managing section  and performs processing for generating language except generation of referring expressions performed by the referring expression processing section .","Here, the probabilistic model used by the referring expression processing section  will be described.
