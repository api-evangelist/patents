title: System and method for managing data sharing over a hotspot network
abstract: There is presented a system and method for managing data sharing over a hotspot network. The system comprises a mobile broadband hotspot with a processor configured to receive a selection of a mobile device to receive a data file, notify the mobile device of the data file to share, and transmit the data file to the mobile device in response to receiving a download request from the mobile device. By saving the data file into the memory of the mobile broadband hotspot, the mobile broadband hotspot may be directed to share the data file with other devices connected to the mobile broadband hotspot through a hotspot network without requiring the other devices to download the data file again through a wide area network.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to a hotspot network. More particularly, the present invention relates to managing data sharing over a hotspot network.","2. Background Art","The use of mobile broadband hotspots has further increased the ubiquity and convenience of wireless broadband access. Data transferring speeds to the mobile broadband hotspots are constantly improving and is presently conforming to the fourth-generation wireless telephone technology (4G) standard. A mobile broadband hotspot may allow a plurality of devices to connect to the mobile broadband hotspot through Wi-Fi signals, Bluetooth signals, or other types of local area connection signals. As a result, many mobile devices can share an Internet access by simply connecting to a nearby mobile broadband hotspot. Since wireless mobile devices such as smartphones, for example, may be used as mobile broadband hotspots, hotspot availability may further expand in the future.","However, when many devices are downloading large files through a mobile broadband hotspot, the aggregate downloading may negatively affect the available bandwidth for each device. For example, there may be four devices connected to a mobile broadband hotspot and each device may attempt to download the same large video file. Consequently, the same video file may be downloaded through a single mobile broadband hotspot four separate times. Such unnecessary duplicate downloading of a large video file or any other file may result in bandwidth congestion, thereby reducing the quality of service for all devices.","Furthermore, the mobile broadband subscriber may also be negatively affected from such duplicate device download activity. Service providers typically enforce relatively modest data transfer quotas for mobile broadband data plans per billing cycle, such as two gigabytes per month, for example. These data transfer quotas may be easily exceeded when bandwidth intensive services such as online video services are accessed, particularly with multiple devices. Exceeding the data transfer quota may result in degraded or zero connectivity for the mobile broadband hotspot, and may also incur costly overage charges for the data plan subscriber.","Accordingly, there is a need to overcome the drawbacks and deficiencies in the art by presenting a solution for managing data sharing over a hotspot network so that a plurality of mobile devices may acquire a data file without duplicate downloading from a mobile broadband connection having a limited data transfer quota.","There is provided systems and methods for managing data sharing over a hotspot network, substantially as shown in and\/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.","The present application is directed to a system and method for managing data sharing over a hotspot network. The following description contains specific information pertaining to the implementation of the present invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention may be implemented in a manner different from that specifically discussed in the present application.
