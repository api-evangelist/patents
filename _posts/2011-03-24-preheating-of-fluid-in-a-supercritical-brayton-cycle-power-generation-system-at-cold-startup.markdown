{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was developed under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","Due to environmental concerns as well as increasing population, environmentally friendly and efficient power generation systems are desired. While there have recently been advances in systems that utilize renewable resources, such as solar power, wind, geothermal energy, and the like efficiencies of such systems trails conventional turbine-based power generation systems, and costs of building such systems is relatively high. Moreover, generally, systems that utilize renewable resources output variable amounts of electrical power (e.g., depending upon cloud cover, wind speeds, . . . ).","Supercritical Brayton cycle power generation systems have been proposed and theorized as efficient power generation systems. Advantages of Brayton cycle power generation systems include the utilization of environmentally friendly, naturally occurring elements compounds such as air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium, etc. Additional advantages of supercritical Brayton cycle power generation systems include a relatively small footprint when compared to conventional turbine-based power generation systems. Moreover, supercritical Brayton cycle power generation systems have been theorized to have efficiencies that meet or exceed efficiencies of conventional power generation systems.","Supercritical Brayton cycle power generation systems offer a promising approach to achieving higher efficiency and more cost-effective power conversion when compared against existing steam-driven power plants, and also perhaps gas turbine power plants. A supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system is a power conversion system that utilizes a single-phase fluid operating near the critical temperature and pressure of such fluid. Generally, two types of power conversion cycles have been proposed: a recuperated Brayton cycle and a recompression Brayton cycle. Other types of power cycles, such as a power take off cycle, cycles with reheat or intercooling, and split-flow compressor discharge cycles that heat a fraction flow rather than recuperate it, can also be utilized, wherein such cycles employ a Brayton cycle. Issues caused by densities of fluids that can be employed in a Brayton cycle power generation system can render designing such a system problematic, particularly at cold start up of such a system.","The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.","In general, various technologies pertaining to supercritical Brayton cycle power generation systems are described herein. More particularly, various technologies pertaining to controlling flow direction of fluid at cold startup start up in a supercritical Brayton cycle power generation are described herein. A supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system includes a generator and a turbine that is configured to drive a generator by way of a shaft that couples the turbine to the generator. When operating at design temperatures\/pressures, a compressor is configured to compress supercritical fluid and transmit such compressed fluid to a heater. The heater is operative to heat the fluid, which causes the fluid to expand towards the turbine, which in turn causes the turbine to rotate the shaft and generate electrical power at the generator. At start up of such a supercritical Brayton cycle power system, however, the temperature of the fluid may be at room temperature, which causes the density of the fluid to be up to ten times greater than the density of the fluid at designed operating conditions of the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system. This can effectively cause the turbine to act as a compressor (for radial turbomachinery), which therefore causes the fluid to flow in a reverse direction through the heater, the turbine, and\/or the compressor in the power generation system. Since the fluid will not flow to the inlet of the heater, the fluid cannot be heated to the designed operating temperature. Moreover, since the fluid may flow backwards through various components of the power generation system, extensive damage to such system may be caused.","Numerous approaches to designing a supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system to overcome the aforementioned reverse flow difficulties are contemplated and described herein. With more particularly, a sensor configured to sense the temperature of the fluid can be positioned at an inlet port of the turbine. Based at least in part upon the temperature that output by the sensor, at least one operating parameter of the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system can be controlled. In an example, bypass piping line may be positioned in the supercritical Brayton cycle power system between the inlet port and the outlet port of the turbine. Furthermore, a valve can be positioned on such bypass piping. In such a design, the at least one operating parameter of the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system that is controlled based at least in part upon the sensed temperature of the fluid at the inlet port of the turbine may pertain to the valve on the bypass piping (e.g. opened, partially opened, rate of closing, closed, . . . ).","In another example, a pump or recirculator can be placed in the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system that causes the fluid to flow to the inlet of the heater. Accordingly, the at least one operating parameter that is control based at least in part upon the temperature at the inlet port of the turbine can operate such pump or recirculator. For example, when the temperature sensed by the sensor at the inlet port of the turbine is above a threshold temperature, the pump can be slowed or shut down. In still yet another example, the at least one operating parameter that can be controlled based at least in part upon the sensed fluid temperature at the inlet of the turbine can be the speed of a motor that is configured to drive the compressor. For instance, prior to the temperature of the fluid at the inlet port of the turbine reaching a threshold temperature, the motor can operate at a first speed. Subsequent to the temperature of the fluid at the inlet port of the turbine reaching the threshold temperature, power provided to the motor can increase to cause the motor to operate at a second speed. These and other designs that act to effectively preheat the fluid in the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system and allow the fluid to flow in a desired direction will be described in greater detail herein","Other aspects will be appreciated upon reading and understanding the attached figures and description.","Various technologies pertaining to supercritical Brayton cycle power generation systems will now be described with reference to the drawings, where like reference numerals represent like elements throughout. It is to be understood that the term \u201cexemplary\u201d, as used herein, is defined as serving as an illustration or example, and is not intended to indicate a preference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100","100","100"]},"Referring to , the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  comprises a motor\/generator . In this exemplary power generation system , the motor\/generator  may be a single unit. It is to be understood, however, that in some embodiments, it may be desirable to include a separate motor and generator. The power generation system  further comprises a turbine , wherein the turbine  includes an inlet port A and an outlet port B. When operating as designed, the inlet port A of the turbine  receives supercritical fluid, which causes the turbine  to rotate. The fluid exits the turbine  through outlet port B. The power generation system  further comprises a shaft  that operatively couples the turbine  to the motor\/generator , wherein rotation of the turbine  in a first radial direction is operative to cause the motor\/generator  to output electric power. That is, as the turbine  is driven by fluid passing therethrough, the turbine  causes the shaft  to rotate, which in turn causes the motor\/generator  to generate electric power.","The supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  further comprises a compressor , wherein the compressor  comprises an inlet port A and an outlet port B. The inlet port A of the compressor  is configured to receive fluid from the turbine  (subsequent to such fluid being cooled by a cooling mechanism), and compress such fluid. Fluid exits the compressor  by way of the outlet port B, and is directed towards the inlet port A of the turbine  (subsequent to being heated by a heating mechanism). The motor portion of the motor\/generator  is configured to drive the compressor . Pursuant to an example, the compressor  can be a radial compressor, an axial compressor, a shaft-driven piston mechanism, or the like.","The power generation system  further comprises first piping  that is operative to transport fluid that exits the outlet port B of the compressor  to the inlet port A of the turbine . As used herein, the term \u201cfirst piping\u201d is intended to encompass all portions of piping in a supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system that are utilized to transport fluid from the outlet port B of the compressor  to the inlet port B of the turbine . The supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  additionally comprises second piping  that is configured to transport fluid from the outlet port B of the turbine  to the inlet port A of the compressor . As used herein, the term \u201csecond piping\u201d is intended to encompass all portions of piping in a supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system that are utilized to transport fluid from the outlet port B of the turbine  to the inlet port A of the compressor . Piping in the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  may be stainless steel, copper or some other suitable metal that can be utilized to transport for instance, carbon dioxide that is at or near its critical temperature\/pressure. A heater  is placed along the first piping , wherein the heater  is operative to increase the heat of the fluid received by way of the first piping . For instance, the heater  may be configured to increase the heat of fluid received by way of the first piping  by 75\u00b0, 100\u00b0, 125\u00b0, 150\u00b0, or 200\u00b0 Celsius. The heater  can be or include any suitable heat source or heating apparatus, including a nuclear heat source, a solar powered heat source, a fossil fuel heat source, or the like.","A sensor  is placed in or along the first piping  proximate to the inlet port A of the turbine , and is operative to sense a temperature of the fluid at the inlet port A of the turbine . A computer processor  can receive temperature values output by the sensor  and can control at least one operating parameter of the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  based at least in part upon these receiver temperature values. More specifically, the processor  may have access to a memory  that retains a threshold temperature and computer readable instructions that facilitate comparing a sensed temperature output by the sensor  with the threshold temperature retained in memory . The memory  may further comprise instructions that facilitate controlling at least one operating parameter of the power generation system  based at least in part upon the comparison between the threshold temperature and the sensed temperature.","As will be shown and described in greater detail herein, a supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  may optionally include bypass piping and a valve thereon, wherein the valve can be operated (e.g., fully opened, slowly closed, fully closed) based at least in part upon the temperature at the inlet of the turbine  output by the sensor . In another example, the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  may include a recirculator (pump), and the processor  can be configured to control operation of the recirculator based at least in part upon the temperature at the inlet of the turbine  output by the sensor . In still yet another example, the heater  can be operated based at least in part upon a sensed temperature of the fluid at the inlet port A of the turbine . For instance, an amount of heat that is output by the heater  can be based at least in part upon such sensed temperature. Moreover, more than one operating condition of the power generation system  can be controlled based at least in part upon the temperature at the inlet port A of the turbine  as output by the sensor .","Referring again to , a schematic diagram of an exemplary recuperated supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  is illustrated. The power generation system  comprises the turbine , the shaft , the compressor , the motor\/generator , the first piping , the second piping , and the heater . The supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  further comprises a recuperator  that acts to transfer heat in the fluid in the second piping  to fluid in the first piping . The power generation system  further comprises a cooler  is operative to cool fluid that has exited the turbine  by way of the outlet port B of the turbine  prior to being received at the inlet port A of the compressor . The compressor  compresses such cooled fluid, which exits the compressor  by way of the outlet port B and passes through the recuperator , where the fluid picks up heat from fluid exiting the turbine  in the second piping . The heater  receives such fluid in the first piping , provides additional heat to the fluid, and transfers the fluid to the inlet port A of the turbine . It is to be understood that the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  may further include a heat exchanger and recirculator that are operative coupled to the heater  to ensure that fluid provided to the turbine  is at a desired temperature. For purposes of illustration, however, these additional components have been omitted.","The supercritical fluid that has been heated by the heater  can drive the turbine , which can in turn drive the motor\/generator  to generate electrical power. The fluid  that exits the turbine will be at high temperature and low pressure (compared to temperature and pressure of fluid exiting the compressor ). The fluid through recuperator , where heat from such fluid is relayed to the fluid in the first piping  that is to be provided to the heater . This fluid is then provided to the cooler  along the second piping , wherein the process can continually repeat.","In this exemplary recuperated supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system , one or more startup fluid flow issues may exist. The arrows on the first piping  and the second piping  show the as-designed (desired) flow direction of fluid in the power generation system . At startup of such system , however, the fluid may flow backwards through the first piping  and the second piping one 111, and therefore may flow backwards through the turbine , the compressor , and the heater . This backward flow of fluid is caused by high density of the fluid at lower temperatures (room temperatures) when compared to density of the fluid at as-designed temperatures. For instance, at cold startup of the power generation system , the density of the fluid in the turbine  can be several times larger than the density of the fluid at designed operating conditions. In other words, at cold startup, the tip of the turbine  is spinning faster than the flow velocity of the fluid through the inlet nozzles of the turbine . Therefore, the fluid cannot push against the blades of the turbine , but rather the blades of the turbine  push the fluid. When this happens, the turbine  can act as a compressor and can produce a back pressure that is proportional to (\u03c1u)\/2, where \u03c1 is the density of the fluid and u is the tip speed of the turbine . For the power generation system , if the back pressure generated by the turbine  is greater than the pressure generated by the compressor , the fluid will flow backwards through the loop.","As mentioned previously, and as will be described in greater detail below, the sensor  can be placed at the inlet port A of the turbine  and can output sensed temperatures of the fluid at such inlet port A. Based at least in part upon this sensed temperature, at least one operating parameter of the power generation system  can be controlled. In other words, the at least one operating condition can be controlled in a manner that allows the heater  to preheat the fluid in the power generation system , thereby decreasing the density of the fluid and allowing the turbine  to act as a turbine rather than as a compressor.","Turning now to , an exemplary re-compressor supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  is illustrated. The power generation system  comprises the motor\/generator , the turbine , the shaft , the compressor , the first piping lines  the second piping lines , the heater , the recuperator , and the cooler , which act as described above. The power generation system  further comprises a re-compressor , which is included to further increase efficiency of the power generation system . The re-compressor  comprises an inlet port A and an outlet port B. Third piping  transfers fluid from the second piping  to the inlet port A of the re-compressor , which compresses such fluid and outputs the compressed fluid by way of fourth piping . The fourth piping  is operative to transport fluid to the first piping , where the fluid is transmitted by way of the first piping  through the recuperated  and the heater , and into the inlet port A of the turbine . Fluid exiting the turbine  is transported to the recuperator , where heat is transferred to fluid in the first piping . A low-temperature recuperator  transfers additional heat from the fluid in the second piping  to fluid exiting the main compressor  along the first piping . The fluid output from the low-temperature recuperator  is then provided to the inlet ports of the main compressor  and the recompressor , respectively. Arrows along the first piping , the second piping , the third piping , and the fourth piping  illustrate desired flow direction of the fluid during operation of the power generation system .","At cold startup of the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system , however, the turbine  can act as a compressor as described above with respect to the power generation system . Additionally, at cold startup, it is also possible for the re-compressor  to generate higher outlet pressures than the main compressor . Again, this can occur because the density of the fluid provided to the re-compressor  at cold startup can be several times larger than the density of the fluid when at an as-designed temperature. Additionally, a wheel of the re-compressor  will be larger than a wheel of the main compressor , thereby causing the re-compressor to  creates larger pressure than the main compressor . Moreover, the re-compressor  can create larger pressures at startup regardless of whether the re-compressor uses radial or axial turbines.","Accordingly, at cold startup of the power generation system , the fluid can travel backwards through the turbine  and the main compressor , and can further travel backwards through the heater . Thus, the fluid will not be appropriately heated to cause the fluid to flow in the as-designed directions as indicated by the arrows shown in . Mechanisms are described herein that allow the heater  to preheat the fluid in the power generation system  to a temperature that causes the fluid to flow in the as-designed direction. The sensor  can be placed at the inlet port A of the turbine  to sense the temperature of the fluid at the inlet port A of the turbine . As mentioned previously, at least one operating condition of the power generation system  can be controlled based at least in part upon the sensed temperature at the inlet port A of the turbine . For instance, one or more of the heater  or the motor\/generator  can be controlled based at least in part upon the sensed temperature at the inlet port A of the turbine . Furthermore, one or more valves on any of the piping (or bypass piping) can be selectively opened or closed based at least in part upon the sensed temperature at the inlet port A of the turbine . Still further, a pump can be controlled based at least in part upon the temperature sensed at the inlet port A of the turbine .","Referring now to , another exemplary recuperated supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  is illustrated. The power generation system  comprises the motor\/generator , the turbine , the shaft , the compressor , the first piping , the second piping. , the heater , the recuperator , and the cooler , which act as described above. The power generation system  further comprises the sensor , which is configured to sense the temperature of the fluid at the inlet port A of the turbine .","The power generation system  further comprises fifth piping  that is operative to act as bypass piping for the turbine . A first valve  is positioned on the fifth piping , such that when the first valve  is open, the fifth piping  causes fluid to be transferred from the inlet port A of the turbine  to the outlet port B of the turbine . In other words, the fifth piping , when the first valve  is in the open position, is operative to transfer fluid from the first piping at the inlet of the turbine  to the second piping  at the outlet of the turbine .","The arrows on the first piping  and the second piping  illustrate the desired direction of fluid flow. The dashed lines shown with respect to the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  illustrate the flow of the fluid in the power generation system  prior to the temperature of the fluid being above a threshold at the inlet port of the turbine . Once the motor\/generator  is turned on to drive the compressor , low pressure in the fifth piping  allows fluid exiting the compressor  to flow in the proper direction through the heater , and then bypass the turbine  by way of the fifth piping . Heat is then transferred from the fluid in the fifth piping  as the fluid transfers to the second piping , wherein heat is transferred in the recuperator  to fluid in the first piping . This is again provided to the heater  by way of the compressor , which further heats the fluid. As shown by way of the dashed arrows, flow of the fluid may still be reversed through the turbine . However, such fluid is directed through the low pressure leg (the fifth piping ) when the valve  is open and not backwards through the heater . Once the sensor  outputs a sensed temperature that is above a predefined threshold temperature, the valve  may be relatively slowly closed (e.g. over five minutes, over 10 minutes, over one half an hour, over an hour, . . . ). As the first valve  is closed, the power provided by the motor\/generator  to the compressor  and the turbine  will decrease as less power is used by the turbine  while it is acting as a compressor. The rate of closure of the first valve  can be selected to avoid flow reversal in the compressor . Pursuant to example, the first valve  can be closed when the temperature sensed by the sensor  is between 200\u00b0 F. and 300\u00b0 F.","The temperature sensed at the inlet port A of the turbine  can be utilized to control the opening and closing of the first valve  due to its pertinence to a u\/cratio. At cold startup, fluid density in the turbine  may be relatively high when compared to density of the fluid when the system  is operating at as-designed temperatures. This means that the flow rate of the fluid through nozzles of the turbine  is low. At high enough shaft speeds, the tip of the turbine  may spin faster than is possible for the fluid to flow through the turbine inlet nozzles. When this occurs, the turbine  may act like a compressor and produce a back pressure that is proportional to (\u03c1u)\/2, where \u03c1 is a fluid entity and u is the tip speed of the turbine .","For the turbine , the ability to function as a compressor can be measured by the ratio u\/c. This is the ratio of the tip speed of the turbine  at the spouting velocity (c) across the turbine . Particularly, u\/c=2\u03c0Nr\/\u221a{square root over (2H)}, where c=\u221a{square root over (2H)}. The property cis called the spouting velocity, which is a measure of the maximum velocity that the fluid can move after expanding through the nozzles of the turbine . Clearly this velocity must be greater than the tip speed of the turbine  for the turbine  to act as a turbine rather than as a compressor. In these equations, N is a shaft speed in revolutions per second, r is the tip radius of the turbine , His the adiabatic enthalpy change across the turbine , which can depend on the temperature of the fluid at the inlet port A of the turbine  and pressure at the outlet port B of the turbine .","At cold startup of the power generation system , the high density of the fluid causes u to be greater than c. Accordingly, when u\/cis greater than 1, the turbine  may act as a compressor. Once the u\/cratio decreases to below 1, the turbine  acts as a turbine and not a compressor. Accordingly, when the aforementioned ratio drops below 1, the first valve  may be closed. This particular startup condition of u\/cwhile being less thanl is equivalent to the inlet temperature at the turbine  exceeded a predefined temperature at fixed pressure and shaft speed. Thus, startup pressure and shaft speed utilized in the power generation system  (and other power generation systems described herein) are repeated, the temperature at the inlet of the turbine  can be monitored to determine when the fluid will flow correctly through the power generation system . For at least this reason, the temperature of the fluid at the inlet port A of the turbine  can be utilized to control at least one operating parameter of supercritical Brayton cycle power generation systems described herein.","Now referring to  another exemplary re-compressor supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  is illustrated, wherein such system includes bypass piping around the turbine . The power generation system  comprises the motor\/generator , the turbine . the shaft , the main compressor , the re-compressor , the heater  the sensor  at the inlet port A of the turbine , the cooler , the first piping , the second piping , the third piping , and the fourth piping , with act as described previously with respect to the power generation system  shown and described in . Additionally, the power generation system  comprises the low-temperature recuperator  and the recuperator . The power generation system  further comprises a second valve  placed on the second piping , and a third valve  placed on the third piping .","The arrows on the first piping , the second piping , the third piping , and the fourth piping  illustrate desired flow of fluid in the power generation system  when such system is in operation (e.g., operating at as-designed temperatures and pressures). At cold startup of the power generation system , the third valve  can be closed, thereby preventing fluid to be provided to the inlet port A of the re-compressor . The second valve , however, may remain open. Additionally, the first valve , at cold startup, can be placed in the open position. Thus, the third valve  is closed or sufficiently closed to allow fluid exiting the main compressor  to be provided in the appropriate direction to the heater  in the first piping . This additionally causes avoidance of reverse flow of fluid through the main compressor . By closing the third valve , the power generation system  effectively becomes the recuperated or Brayton cycle power generation system  described in . That is, the compressor  can force fluid in the appropriate direction through the heater , and fluid traveling in the reverse direction through the turbine  can be directed over the fifth piping  (the bypass piping) when the first valve  is opened. This allows the heater  to preheat the fluid in order to drive the aforementioned u\/cratio below 1. The sensor  can output a temperature at the inlet port A of the turbine , and based at least in part upon such temperature, the first valve  can be slowly closed, while the third valve  can be slowly opened. Additionally, the position of the second valve  can be altered to appropriately adjust pressures existent at the output ports of the main compressor  and the re-compressor .","In an example, the first valve  can be fully closed prior to the third valve  being opened. The third valve  can be opened at a rate that allows adjusting of the fraction of flow of fluid through the re-compressor  to the desired fraction of total fluid flow. Because the heater  has been operating, the fluid at the inlet port A to the re-compressor  has a density near the design point density, and therefore the tendency for the re-compressor  to cause the flow of fluid to be reversed through the main compressor  has been removed.","Moreover, in recompression Brayton cycle power generation systems (including the power generation system  and other recompression Brayton cycle power generation systems described herein), a union  is used to join the fluid flow between the fourth piping  and the first piping  (e.g., fluid exiting the main compressor  and the re-compressor ). Ideally, these two flow streams have the same temperature and pressure; however, momentum effects and deviations caused by off-design operation can cause pressure in one of the streams (e.g., the fluid flow exiting the re-compressor ) to exceed the pressure in the other one of the streams (e.g., the fluid flow exiting the main compressor ). During cold startup, when the re-compressor  is operating at the same shaft speed as the main compressor , the fluid density received at the inlet port A of the re-compressor  may be several times higher than a desired density, as the fluid has yet to be heated. This can cause the flow of fluid to occur in a reverse direction from a desired direction. A particular type of union can be employed to increase stability of flow in a desired direction by utilizing momentum from one fluid flow stream to pump fluid in the lower velocity or lower pressure stream (even when velocity of fluid exiting the re-compressor  exceeds the velocity of fluid exiting the main compressor ). For instance, a nozzle can be selectively positioned in the union  to assure a higher velocity of fluid in one of the flow streams. This can be referred to as an ejector pump union. Additionally, a lateral \u201cT\u201d union can be the union . Moreover, some other suitable \u201cY\u201d configuration can also be utilized at the union .","Additionally, a particular type of union can be placed at an intersection  between the fourth piping  and the first piping . For instance, at such intersection  an ejector pump type union, a lateral union, or \u201cY\u201d union can be utilized to facilitate proper fluid flow direction in the power generation system .","Now referring to , another exemplary recuperator supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  is illustrated. The power generation system  comprises a motor  that drives the compressor  by way of the shaft . The power generation systems  further comprises a separate generator  that is driven by the turbine  by way of a separate shaft . In other words, the compressor  is on a separate shaft from the turbine . At cold startup, the motor  is utilized to drive the compressor , which then forces fluid through the heater  by way of the first piping . It can be ascertained that the flow of the fluid is in the as-designed direction, as there is no mechanism that can cause reverse flow. The heater  may then be operated to preheat the fluid. The sensor  can monitor the temperature of the fluid at the inlet port A of the turbine , and such temperature can be utilized to ascertain the speed of the shaft  that causes the u\/cratio to be below 1. When the estimate of the speed of the shaft  exceeds the idle speed of the turbine , the generator  can be motored or allowed to spin on its own. Once the turbine  begins spinning, the heater  can be controlled to cause the temperature of the fluid output from the heater  to be increased (e.g., additional power may be provided to the heater to increase the temperature of the fluid). Additionally, the motor  can be controlled to cause the compressor speed to increase, thereby increasing power production by the turbine . For instance, the generator  may be variable speed or synchronous. Pursuant to an example, a power generation system such as the one shown in  may be particularly useful in relatively small to intermediate power systems (utilized to generate between five and 10 MW of electric power). Accordingly, the temperature sensed by the sensor  at the inlet port A of the turbine  can be utilized, for instance, to control operation of the motor , the heater , and\/or the generator .","With reference now to , yet another exemplary supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  is illustrated. In this exemplary power generation system , the re-compressor  and the turbine  are coupled by the shaft  while the main compressor  is driven by the motor  through a separate shaft (the shaft A). A motor\/generator  is configured to drive the re-compressor  and be driven by the turbine . In the exemplary power generation system , the third valve  is initially closed at cold startup. Meanwhile, the second valve  on the second piping  can be opened, thereby allowing fluid to be provided to the main compressor . The main compressor  then forces fluid through the low-temperature recuperator  and the recuperator  to the heater , which can heat fluid that is provided to the turbine . It can be noted that the flow of the fluid is in the desired direction. Because the third valve  is closed at cold startup, there will be no reverse flow of fluid through the re-compressor . Once the flow of the fluid in the power generation system  is established, the heater  can be configured to preheat the fluid. The temperature of the fluid sensed by the sensor  at the inlet port A of the turbine  can be analyzed to monitor the u\/cratio to determine the speed of the shaft  coupled to the turbine  that keeps u\/cratio below 1. When the shaft speed estimate exceeds the idle speed of the turbine , the motor\/generator  can be motored or allowed to stand on its own.","Once the turbine  is spinning, either by motoring or by expansion of fluid in the turbine , the third valve  can be slowly opened to allow fluid to be provided to the re-compressor . Pursuant to an example, the third valve  can be opened when the temperature of the fluid at the inlet of the turbine  as sensed by the sensor  is at or above a predefined threshold. Furthermore, speed of the re-compressor , the main compressor , and power provided to the heater  can be controlled or altered based at least in part upon temperature of the fluid at the inlet port A of the turbine  output by the sensor . Subsequent to the third valve  being fully opened, power provided to the heater  can be increased as can the speed of the main compressor  to increase power production created by way of the turbine . Additionally, as noted above, the motor\/generator  connected to the turbine  can be operated at either variable speed or synchronous speeds. In an exemplary embodiment, at cold startup the motor\/generator  can be operated at variable speed.","With reference now to , another exemplary recuperator supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  is illustrated. The exemplary power generation system  comprises the motor\/generator , the turbine , the shaft , the compressor , the first piping , the second piping, , the heater , the sensor , the bypass (fifth) piping , the first valve , and the cooler , which can operate as described above. The power generation system  can further comprise sixth piping  that acts as a bypass of the compressor . The power generation system  further comprises the second valve  that can be utilized to control fluid provide to the inlet port A of the compressor . Moreover, the sixth piping  has a recirculator or pump  thereon that is configured to pump fluid to the first piping  for receipt at the inlet of the heater . A fourth valve  can be opened to allow the recirculator  to pump fluid to the first piping  in the desire direction.","At cold startup, the compressor  can be isolated by closing the second valve  and opening the fourth of . Thereafter, the recirculator  can be initiated, which causes fluid to flow towards the first piping . The fifth piping  and the first valve  are optionally included to increase the speed at which the fluid is preheated. It is the understood that the fifth piping  and the first valve , in some embodiments, may not be included in the power generation system . The sensor  can output sensed temperature values at the inlet port A of the turbine , and such temperatures can be monitored to ascertain when the aforementioned u\/cratio is below one. For predefined operational pressure and startup speed, such temperature can be known a priori.","Thereafter, the second valve  can be opened while the first valve  and the fourth valve  are closed. The rate of opening and closing of the valves , , and  can be undertaken to substantially optimize efficiency of the power generation system . The motor\/generator  may then be configured to begin driving the compressor . This can be done, for instant, at approximately 30 to 40% of the design speed. Flow direction in the desired direction may then be confirmed, and additional power can be provided to heater  to further heat the fluid that is provided to the inlet port A of the turbine . The speed of the motor  may then be further increased, and heating can be continued until power generation begins. Thereafter, speed of the shaft  can be increased and heater power can be increased until a desired amount of electoral power is produced.","In this exemplary power production system , it is to be understood that one or more of the first valve , the second valve , and the fourth valve  can be controlled based at least in part upon the temperature of the fluid at the inlet port A of the turbine  as sensed by the sensor . Additionally, the motor\/generator  can be controlled based at least in part upon the temperature sensed by the sensor  at the inlet port A of the turbine . Still further, power provided to the heater  can be controlled based at least in part upon the temperature sensed by the sensor  at the input port A of the turbine .","With reference now to , still yet another exemplary re-compressor supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system  is illustrated. The power generation system  is similar to the power generation system  described above with respect to , and details pertaining to some aspects of operation of the power generation system  are omitted for the sake of brevity. A difference between the power generation system  shown in  and the power generation system  shown in  is the inclusion of the sixth piping , the pump , and the fourth valve . At cold startup of the power generation system , the first valve  may be opened, the second valve  may be closed to prevent fluid from being provided to the compressor , the third valve  may be closed to prevent fluid from being provided the re-compressor , and the fourth valve  may be opened to allow the pump  to pump fluid to the heater . To reduce the power requirements of the motor\/generator , the third valve  can remain closed until the temperature of the fluid output by the sensor  reaches a predefined temperature, where at such temperature the turbine  is generating as much power as being consumed by the main compressor .","Furthermore, the third valve  can remain closed while the speed of the shaft  is increased from a starting shaft speed to an idle shaft speed, which may be, for instance, 40 to 50% of the full as-designed speed of the shaft . It can be noted, however, that in such a power generation system , the thrust load generated on the shaft  may be different when the third valve  is closed when compared to when the third valve  open. Therefore, the thrust load capacity of a thrust bearing must be able to not only operate at the design point, but also at the thrust load conditions from startup shaft speeds to break even shaft speeds with the third valve  being closed and opened. Since the pressure ratio in the compressor  and re-compressor  at the break even conditions are relatively small (approximately 1.2), the thrust load changes in the shaft can be easily tolerated for oil lubricated bearings that may be used in larger power systems.","With reference now to , an exemplary methodology is illustrated and described. While the methodology is described as being a series of acts that are performed in a sequence, it is to be understood that the methodology is not limited by the order of the sequence. For instance, some acts may occur in a different order than what is described herein. In addition, an act may occur concurrently with another act. Furthermore, in some instances, not all acts may be required to implement a methodology described herein.","Moreover, one or more of the acts in the methodology may be undertaken through execution of computer-readable instructions by one or more processors, wherein the computer-readable instructions are stored on a computer-readable medium or media. The computer-readable instructions may include a routine, a sub-routine, programs, a thread of execution, and\/or the like. Still further, results of acts of the methodologies may be stored in a computer-readable medium, displayed on a display device, and\/or the like. The computer-readable medium may be a non-transitory medium, such as memory, hard drive, CD, DVD, flash drive, or the like.","Turning now to , an exemplary methodology  that facilitates changing at least one operating condition of a supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system is illustrated. The methodology  starts at , and at , at cold startup of a supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system, a heater is employed to increase temperature of fluid in the power generation system. For instant such fluid may be, in an exemplary embodiment, carbon dioxide.","At , a temperature of the fluid (T) at an inlet port of a turbine in the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system is monitored. At , the monitored temperature of the fluid at the inlet port of the turbine is compared with a predefined temperature (T). Such temperature can be selected to analyze a u\/cratio as described above.","At , a determination is made regarding whether the monitored temperature is greater than the predefined temperature. If the monitored temperature is less than the predefined temperature, then the methodology  returns to act , where the temperature at the inlet port of the turbine is continued to be monitored. If, however, the temperature at the inlet port of the turbine is greater than the predefined temperature, then at  at least one operating condition of the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system is altered. For instance, the at least one operating condition may be an amount of power provided to the heater, a speed of the motor, power provided to a pump, a position of a valve in the supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system, etc. The methodology  completes .","It is noted that several example designs of supercritical Brayton cycle power generation systems have been provided for purposes of explanation. It is to be understood that various features across designs can be combined to create a different supercritical Brayton cycle power generation system. Further, the exemplary designs are not to be construed as limiting the hereto-appended claims. Additionally, it may be recognized that some examples provided herein may be permutated while still falling under the scope of the claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
