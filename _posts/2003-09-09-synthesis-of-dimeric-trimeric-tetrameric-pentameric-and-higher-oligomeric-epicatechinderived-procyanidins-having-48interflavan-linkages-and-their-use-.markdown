title: Synthesis of dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric pentameric, and higher oligomeric epicatechin-derived procyanidins having 4,8-interflavan linkages and their use to inhibit cancer cell growth through cell cycle arrest
abstract: Various processes are disclosed for preparing protected epicatechin oligomers having (4β,8)-interflavan linkages. In one process, a tetra-O-protected epicatechin monomer or oligomer is coupled with a protected, C-4 activated epicatechin monomer in the presence of an acidic clay such as a mortmorillonite clay. In another process, a 5,7,3′,4′-benzyl protected or a 3-acetyl-, 5,7,3′,4′-benzyl protected epicatechin or catechin monomer or oligomer is reacted with 3-O-acetyl-4-[(2-benzothiazolyl)thio]-5,7,3′,4′-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin in the presence of silver tetrafluoroborate. In another process, two 5,7,3′,4′-benzyl protected epicatechin monomers activated with 2-(benzothiazolyl)thio groups at the C-4 positions are cross-coupled in the presence of silver tetrofluoroborate. A process is also disclosed for reacting an unprotected epicatechin or catechin monomer with 4-(benzylthio)epicatechin or catechin. The use of naturally-derived and synthetically-prepared procyanidin (4β,8)-pentamers to treat cancer is also disclosed.

No. 60\/415,616 entitled SYNTHESIS OF TRIMERIC, TETRMERIC, PENTAMERIC, AND HIGHER OLIGOMERIC EPICATECHIN-DERIVED PROCYANIDINS HAVING 4\u03b2,8-INTERFLAVAN LINKAGES AND THEIR USE TO INHIBIT CANCER CELL GROWTH THROUGH CELL CYCLE ARREST which was filed on Oct. 2, 2002.","Condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins) are widespread in the plant kingdom, form part of the human diet, and display multiple biological activities that render them significant to health. Procyanidins have attracted a great deal of recent attention in the fields of nutrition, medicine and health due to their wide range of potentially significant biological activities. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that these compounds act as potent antioxidants in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo and may thus alter the pathophysiology of imbalances or perturbations of free radical and\/or oxidatively driven processes in many diseases or directly interfere with many cellular processes. See Nijveldt, R. J. et al., . 2001, 74, 418. Initial observations also have shown that procyanidin-rich fractions extracted from defatted cocoa beans elicited in vitro growth inhibition in several human cancer cell lines. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,554,645 issued Sep. 10, 1996 to L. J. Romanczyk, Jr. et al.","Isolation, separation, purification, and identification methods have been established for the recovery of a range of procyanidin oligomers for comparative in vitro and in vivo assessment of biological activates and currently some oligomers can be synthesized using time-consuming method. For instance, previous attempts to couple monomeric units in free phenolic form using mineral acid as the catalyst in aqueous media have met with limited success. The yields were low, the reactions proceeded with poor selectivity, and the oligomers were difficult to isolate. See Steynberg, P. J., et al., , 1998, 54, 8153\u20138158. An overview of the shortcomings is set out below.","Benzylated monomers were prepared using benzyl bromide in combination with potassium carbonate (KCO) and dimethyl formamide (DMF). See Kawamoto, H. et al., , 1991, 37, 741\u2013747. The yield, however, was only about 40%. In addition, competing C-benzylation leads to a mixture of products, which make isolation of the benzyl-protected target monomer more difficult. Also, partial racemization of (+)-catechin at both the C-2 and C-3 positions was observed (see Pierre, M.-C. et al., , 1997, 38, 32, 5639\u20135642).","Two primary methods for oxidative functionalization are taught in the literature. See Bells, M. J. et al, , 1969, 1178 and Steenkamp, J. A., et al., ., 1985, 3045\u20133048. In the older method, protected (+)-catechin was treated with lead tetraacetate (LTA) in benzene to produce the 4\u03b2-acetoxy derivative which was then successfully hydrolyzed to the 3,4-diol. Flavan-3,4-diols are incipient electrophiles in the biomimetric synthesis of procyanidins. However, flavan-3,4-diols, which have an oxygen functionality at the C-4 position are not available from natural sources and have to be synthesized. Oxidative functionalization of the prochiral benzylic position was used in the synthesis of procyanidins. The major drawback of this reaction was a low yield (30\u201336%) of the acetate during the LTA oxidation. The more recent method of oxidatively functionalizing the C-4 position relies on the use of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ). In this method, the protected monomer was treated with DDQ in methanol. This allows introduction of a methoxy group at the C-4 position in a stereospecific manner. The yield is was about 40\u201350%.","There are a number of reports on the coupling reaction between monomers and their 3,4-diols in aqueous acid. These methods are unsatisfactory because the low yields, lack of specificity, and difficulty in the purification from aqueous media. See Kawamoto, H. et al., ., 1989, 9, 35\u201352 who report the titanium tetrachloride (TiCl) mediated coupling between 4-hydroxyl tetra-O-benzyl (+)-catechin and 5 equivalents (eq.) of tetra-O-benzyl(+)-catechin to produce a 3:2 mixture of 4\u03b1,8 and 4\u03b2,8 catechin dimers. This coupling leads to the 4\u03b2,8-dimer together with higher oligomers in yields that decrease with the increasing molecular mass of the oligomer.","Using a 2,3-cis-3,4-trans-flavan-3,4-diol, Band Bderivatives were synthesized. The diol was prepared by the acyloxylation of the C-4 benzylic function of an (\u2212)-epicatechin tetramethyl ether with lead tetraacetate in a benzene solution. This oxidative functionalization of the C-4 position of the methyl protected epicatechin monomer was improved by using 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benoquinone (DDQ) in methanol to introduce a methoxy group at the C-4 position. The protected monomer with C-4 methoxy group was used in the synthesis of (4,8) linear procyanidin oligomers up to the trimers. See Steenkamp et al., . 1985 26, 25, 3045\u20133048.","Procyanidin oligomers were prepared using a protected epicatechin or catechin monomer having, as a C-4 acyloxy group, a C\u2013Calkoxy group having a terminal hydroxy group such as a 2-hydroxyethoxy group. The protecting groups used are those that do not deactivate the A ring of the monomer, e.g., benzyl protecting groups. See Kozikowski, A. P. et al. . 2000, 65, 5371\u20135381 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,842 (issued Mar. 27, 2001 to Romanczyk, L. J. et al.). The C-4 derivatized, protected monomer was coupled with a protected catechin monomer or protected epicatechin monomer to form a protected 4,8 dimer which was then deprotected or used for further coupling with another protected, C-4 derivatized epicatechin monomer to form protected higher 4,8 oligomers. If a 4,6 linkage was desired, the C-8 position of the protected catechin or epicatechin monomer was blocked with a halogen group prior to coupling with the C-4 derivatized, protected epicatechin monomer or oligomer. Higher oligomers having both 4,8 and 4,6 linkages were also be prepared. The protected dimers or oligomers were deblocked, and if necessary, deprotected, e.g., by hydrogenolysis. The coupling was carried out in the presence of a protic acid or a Lewis acid such as titanium tetrachloride (TiCl). The stereochemical nature of the interflavan bond was confirmed by the synthesis of a specifically protected derivative and its subsequent degradation. Furthermore, titanium tetrachloride-mediated chain extension of epicatechin leads to the formation of regioisomers. This is a serious drawback, not only in terms of yield, but also purity. Even though the 4\u03b2,8-trimers and 4\u03b2,8-tetramers were isolated in pure form, the same can not automatically be expected for the larger oligomers, for which the number of possible isomers, and thus contaminants, grows rapidly.","One potential way of dealing with this problem is to carefully purify the chain-extended oligomer after each step in order to ensure that all chain-extended oligomers are at least derived from a single isomer of the starting oligomer. However, upon the titanium tetrachloride-mediated chain extension of the C-4 derivatized, protected monomer with two equivalents of the protected trimer, not only were the protected tetramer, pentamer, and small amounts of higher oligomers formed, but the protected trimer was degraded to the monomer and dimer, which then participated in the chain-extension reaction, giving rise to regioisomeric oligomers such as small amounts of the protected 4\u03b2,6:4\u03b2,8-trimer. While the reaction conditions (methylene chloride\/tetrahydrofuran (9:11), 0\u00b0 C., 15 min., then room temperature, 140 min.) were not optimized, chain degradation warranted a search for a better synthetic approach.","Thus, there is a need for improved methods for synthesizing epicatechin oligomers, particularly the higher oligomers, and a process for using protected larger epicatechin oligomers as building blocks for chain extension to even larger oligomers.","In one embodiment, bis(5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-protected)epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-dimer and higher (4\u03b2,8)-oligomers are prepared by coupling a (5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-protected)epicatechin monomer with a 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-protected-4-(acyloxy)epicatechin monomer in the presence of an acidic clay. The benzyl-protected (4\u03b2,8)-dimer is produced in significantly increased yields. Under the same conditions, the benzyl-protected (4\u03b2,8)-trimer, -tetramer, and -pentamer are obtained regioselectively from the 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-protected (4\u03b2,8)-oligomer. The preferred acidic clay is a mortmorillonite clay. The protecting groups used should not deactivate the A ring of the protected monomers or the A ring of the upper mer of the protected oligomers. The preferred protecting groups are benzyl groups. A suitable 4-acyloxy group is a C\u2013Calkoxy group having a terminal hydroxyl group, preferably 2-hydroxyethoxy. The protected monomer and protected dimer, as well as the protected oligomers, are separated by column chromatography and then the protecting groups are replaced with hydrogen.","In another embodiment, a mixture of benzyl-protected (4\u03b2,8)-oligomers of epicatechin or catechin, such as the trimer through pentamer, are prepared in improved yields by reacting a benzyl-protected (4\u03b2,8)-dimer (e.g., bis(5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl)epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-dimer or bis(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032, 4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl)epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-dimer with a 3,5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-protected epicatechin monomer having, as a C-4 activating group, a (2-benzothiazolyl)thio group. To avoid the undesired intervention of the 3-hydroxyl group, this group is protected in both the electrophilic and nucleophilic reaction partners by acetylation. The reaction is carried out in the presence of silver tetrafluoroborate (AgBF). Preferably, the silver tetrafluoroborate is dried before the reaction. More preferably the drying is vacuum drying carried out immediately before the reaction. The resulting mixture comprises protected trimers through protected octamers. The protected oligomers are isolated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The acetyl protecting group(s) are removed, preferably with aqueous tetra-n-butyl ammonium hydroxide. The benzyl protecting groups are removed by hydrogenolysis, preferably after removal of the acetyl protecting group(s). The yields are near-quantitative. The oligomers are characterized as their peracetates. The synthetic procyanidin oligomers are identical to the procyanidin oligomers isolated from cocoa bean extracts by normal-phase HPLC.","In another embodiment, chain extension by cross-coupling of two benzyl-protected epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-oligomers each having a C-4-(2-benzylthiazolyl)thio group is carried out in the presence of silver tetrafluoroborate.","A process is provided for preparing the 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin or -catechin monomer having a C-4 (2-benzothiazoly)-thio group. The process involves reacting 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl-4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)epicatechin or 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl-4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)catechin with an organoaluminum thiolate generated from 2-mercaptobenzothiazole. A process is also provided for preparing 3-O-acetyl-4[(2-benzyothiazolyl)thio]5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin or 3-O-acetyl-4-[(2-benzothiazolyl)thio]5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylcatechin by reacting 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl-4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)epicatechin or 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl-4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)catechin with an organoaluminum thiolate generated from 2-mercaptobenzothiazole followed by acetylation of the C-3 hydroxyl group.","A process is also provided for exclusively preparing a procyanidin (4\u03b2,8)-dimer by reacting an unprotected epicatechin or catechin monomer with 4-(benzythio)catechin or 4-(benzylthio)epicatechin in the presence of dimethyl(methylthio)sulfonium tetrafluoroborate or preferably silver tetrafluoroborate.","When tested in several breast cancer cell lines, both the synthetic and natural procyanidin pentamer, and to a lesser extent the tetramer, inhibited cell growth. Using the MDA MB-231 cell line, it was established that this outcome is based on the induction of cell cycle arrest in the G\/Gphase. Subsequent cell death is more likely necrotic rather than apoptotic. Control experiments demonstrate that the procyanidin itself, rather than hydrogen peroxide, is the causative agent.","The regio- and stereochemistry of the interflavan linkages has been established by partial thiolysis (see H\u00f6r, M. et al., 1996, 42, 109). For the tetramer the upper interflavan linkage is 4\u03b2,8 and the lower portion of the molecule is identical to the trimer which has also been subjected to partial thiolysis with both linkages being identified as 4\u03b2,8 (see H\u00f6r et al.). Since in the course of the present chain extension process the first three interflavan linkages formed are exclusively 4\u03b2,8 linkages, the same must be true for the additional interflavan linkages present in the higher oligomers.","A. Chain Extension of Protected Epicatechin Monomer and Dimer Mediated by Acidic Clay.","Chain extension of 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin mediated by an acidic clay such as Montmorillomite clay (e.g., Bentonite K-10) results in the almost exclusive formation of the protected 4\u03b2,8)-dimer in a 90% isolated yield together with small amounts of the protected (4\u03b2,8)-trimer. No 4,6-linked oligomers are observed. The surprisingly high reactivity differential under these conditions between the monomer and the dimer allows most of the dimer to survive without entering into further chain extension. Reaction of bis(5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl)epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-dimer with 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin activated at the C-4 position with a 2-hydroxyethoxy group yields 40% of the (4\u03b2,8)-trimer together with 13% of the (4\u03b2,8)-tetramer by this chain extension protocol.","The cleanness of this reaction permits, for the first time, at least a partial separation of the monomer from the dimer, and even of the dimer from the trimer, by column chromatography. This significantly reduces the amount of material that needs to be put through HPLC purification.","A simplified procedure for isolating the electrophilic monomeric building block having the C-4 2-hydroxyethoxy group is provided.","B. Chain Extension of 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032 Protected or 3,5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-Protected Epicatechin or Catechin Monomers Having C-4 [2-(Benzothiazolyl)thio] Group","In an alternative chain extension, a 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-protected epicatechin or catechin activated at the C-4 position with mercaptobenzothoiazolyl is used for the chain extension. The chain extension is mediated by silver tetrafluoroborate. The reagent used to introduce a 2-(benzothiazolyl)thio group at the C-4 position of an epicatechin or a catechin monomer is 2-mercaptobenzothiazole which is a non-volatile odorless heterocyclic thiol. For this coupling, the C-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-benzyl-protected monomers, rather than the unprotected monomers, are preferred because they are easier to handle, more stable, and more reactive due to the poor accessibility of the unprotected, C-4 derivatized monomers.","The C-4 activated monomer is prepared by reacting a protected epicatechin or catechin having a 2-hydroxyethoxy group at the C-4 position with an organoaluminum thiolate prepared in situ from 2-mercaptobenzothiazole and trimethylaluminum. See Dzhemilev U. M. et al., ., 1988, 2645. The resulting 4-thioether is as a mixture of two stereoisomers which are isolated by fractional crystallization and column chromatography. Only the major stereoisomer is used for the subsequent coupling.","The chain extension is effected by adding silver tetrafluoride borate (AgBF) to a solution of 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin or 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylcatechin and the major stereoisomer. This results in the formation of a protected epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-dimer and an epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-trimer. After reverse-phase HPLC separation, the protected dimer, trimer, and monomer are recovered. Further, separation by reverse-phase HPLC yields, as a by-product, a protected 3-O-4 dimer. To avoid the undesired reaction of the 3-hydroxyl group in this chain extension process, the 3-hydroxyl group is protected by acetylation of both the benzyl-protected monomer and the benzyl-protected dimer. The yields are near-quantitative. When a solution of silver tetrafluoroborate is added to solution of the acetyl-and benzyl-protected dimer and acetyl- and benzyl protected monomer, the expected benzyl-protected, acetyl-protected trimer and tetramer are formed, but only in low yields. However, the chain extension proceeds so slowly that adventitious water successfully competes with the flavanoid nucleophile with the major product of the coupling being the 4-hydroxy monomer 3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl-4-hydroxyepicatechin. In addition, small amounts of the 4-hydroxy dimer (3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl-4\u03b2,8-(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl-4-hydroxyepicatechin) are also isolated, indicating to self-condensation of the thioether followed by either chain extension or hydrolysis.","In an attempt to improve the yield, the protected dimer and protected monomer are dried by stirring with powdered molecular sieves prior to the addition of the silver tetrafluoroborate. The reactants, however, are recovered unchanged. Vacuum drying the silver tetrafluoroborate immediately before the coupling reduces the hydrolysis of 3-O-acetyl-4-[(2-benzothiazolyl)thio]-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin to an acceptable level.","Using dry silver tetrafluoroborate with a protected monomer to protected dimer molar ratio of 1:2.5, a series of protected oligomers spanning from the trimer tris(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl)epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-trimer to the octamer octakis(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl)epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-octamer can be isolated in a combined yield of 91%. The reaction is exceptionally clean and no 4,6-oligomers are observed.","Similar results are obtained in the coupling of the C-4 derivatized, benzyl- and acetyl-protected monomer with the benzyl-and acetyl-protected trimer and tetramer. From this reaction, oligomers up to the protected undecamer can be isolated by reverse-phase HPLC if ethyl acetate (a nonpolar solvent) is admixed with the acetonitrile in the final step of the gradient. The use of the ethyl acetate permits recovery of the highly retained higher oligomers; however, it also elutes significant amounts of aliphatic impurities which subsequently have to be removed by additional HPLC steps, thus reducing the total product recovery.","All of the protected oligomers (i.e., the benzyl ether-acetates) up to the nonamer were deacetylated in near-quantitative yield with 40% aqueous tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide in tetrahydrofuran. This base is used because of its good solubility in the relatively nonpolar reaction medium that is required by the lipophilicity of the starting materials. The H NMR spectra of the resulting benzyl-ethers displayed signals of two major rotamers together with trace amounts of additional rotamers that increase as the oligomeric chain grows. It is believed that these minor components are rotamers rather than regioisomers because similar signals are absent from the spectra of the precursor acetates. Samples of the benzyl-ethers prepared in CDClexhibit well-resolved, characteristic signals for the hydroxyl (OH) protons in the \u03b4 1.8\u20131.1 region.","The benzyl-ethers (trimer through the octamers) are deprotected by hydrogenolysis over Pearlman's catalyst to form the unprotected oligomers. Preferably, this deprotection is carried out in bicarbonate-washed glassware, as partial fragmentation to lower oligomers is occasionally observed without this precaution, quite probably as a consequence of an acidic reaction with the glass surface of the reaction flask. To obtain a readily soluble procyanidin, it is necessary, as similarly reported by others, to dilute the filtered solution of the crude product with water, evaporate only partially so as to remove most of the organic solvents, and lyophilize the residual solution. If the crude solutions are directly evaporated to dryness, partially insoluble materials result, indicating that some decomposition has occurred. Combustion analyses shows that the lyophilized products contain 1.3\u20132 equivalents of water per epicatechin moiety.","Comparison normal phase HPLC analysis of epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-trimer, epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-tetramer, and epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-pentamer was made against the natural trimer, tetramer, and pentamer purified from . Purities ranging from 94% to 96% were observed for the synthetic procyanidins which were 2\u20134% higher than those for the naturally-derived oligomeric procyanidins. The t'S of the synthetic procyanidins match those observed for the natural oligomers, thus confirming the epicatechin 4\u03b2,8 regio- and stereo-chemistry in the natural cocoa procyanidins. All of the natural procyanidins purified from cocoa show impurity peaks preceding and following the main peak, with the tetramer and pentamer showing more impurity peaks. Scanning these regions by HPLC\/MS reveals no change in the [M] or [M+Na] ions indicating that these minor impurities are isomers of the major oligomers. These minor impurities may contribute to in vitro and in vivo activities reported in the literature and potentially confound structure-activity relationships based only on natural oligomers. Hence, as a precaution, both natural and synthetic procyanidins are therefore used in the biological assays reported in the following examples.","The nature of the impurities and of the side reaction(s) leading to them has not been established but several trace impurities are present rather than a single major one. This is less than ideal; however, comparison of reported optical rotations, for example, of the free (4\u03b2,8)-dimer or the -tetramer reveals large variations that cannot merely be the consequence of differential degrees of hydration, but appear to indicate the presence of unknown impurities in some of these samples as well.","Since free polyphenols are inherently poorly amenable to purification because of their oxygen and acid sensitivity (acid being required as a solvent additive to reduce peak tailing during HPLC), and their NMR spectra are anyway uncharacteristic because of severe line broadening, these compounds are characterized as their peracetates. In an attempt to avoid acid-induced interflavan bond cleavage during the acetylation, the amount of pyridine in the acetic anhydride\/pyridine reagent can be increased from 1 (the usual amount) to 2 volumes relative to acetic anhydride, but as a result impurities emerge that elute immediately before the peracetates and cannot be removed on a preparative scale. The H NMR spectra of the peracetates exhibit sharp signals for two rotamers (in a 2;1 ratio for the trimer and in a 3:2 ratio for all higher homologs) and are, up to the heptamer or octamer, quite suitable for compound identification, since the acetate region serves as a useful \u201cfingerprint\u201d. As the oligomeric chain grows, the chemical shift differences between analogous protons of epicatechin units in the inner position of the chain become eventually insufficient at 300 MHz, resulting in the growth of uncharacteristic signal clusters without the appearance of well-separated new signals. These spectra can be useful for future reference. NMR spectra are available for oligomers up to the hexamer, beyond which insufficient amounts of material are available. The trimer and the tetramer H NMR spectra are in good agreement with published spectra. See H\u00f6r, M. et al., , 1996, 42, for the trimer and tetramer and Sticher, O. J., , 1999, 835, 59 for the trimer. In the case of the tetramer, partial thiolysis (see H\u00f6r et al.) establishes (4\u03b2,8)-regio- and -stereochemistry for the \u201cupper\u201d interflavan linkage, whereas the \u201clower\u201d portion of the molecule is identical with the trimer. This compound, in turn, has also been subjected to partial thiolysis, and both interflavan linkages have been identified as (4\u03b2,8) (see H\u00f6r et al.). Since, therefore, in the chain extension process the first three interflavan linkages formed are exclusively of the 4\u03b2,8 type, the same must be true for the additional interflavan linkages present in the larger oligomers.","C. Cross Coupling of 3,5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-Protected Monomers Having C-4-(2-Benzothiazolyl)thio Groups and of A 3,5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-Protected Oligomer Having A C-4-(2-Benzothiazolyl)thio Group and A 3,5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-Protected Oligomer.","5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-Tetra-O-benzylepicatechin monomers having 2-(benzothiazolyl)thio groups at the C-4 position self-condensed in the presence of silver tetrafluoraborate to yield a fairly complex mixture from which small amounts of the benzyl-protected, C 4-[(2-benzothiazolyl)thio]-dimer, -trimer, and presumably-tetramer can be isolated. Also isolated is the rearranged benzyl-protected monomer and dimer where the group at the C-4 position is connected to the nitrogen rather than the sulfur of the thiazoyl ring. The migration of this moiety from sulfur to nitrogen is confirmed for the monomer by the observation of a C NMR signal at \u03b4 190.3 assignable to the thiocarbonyl carbon atom. The complexity of the above reaction mixture is in part due to the formation of 4-O-3-linked oligomers similar to 4-O-3-(5,7,3,4-tetra-O-benzyl)epicatechin. An attempt to avoid the reaction at the C-3 position by acetylating that position was unsuccessful, resulting in low yields of the 4-[(2-benzothiazolyl)thio]-substituted, protected oligomers (dimer through tetramer) and the formation hydroxylated oligomers. AgBF-induced self-condensation of 3-O-acetyl-4-[(2-benzothiazolyl)thio]-5,7,3\u20324\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin results in low yields of the 4-[(2-benzothiazolyl)thio]-substituted oligomers, i.e., dimers, trimer and tetramer. Together with these products, and in considerable quantities because of the small reaction scale, the 4-hydroxy by-products also formed. The by-products are 3-O-acetyl, 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin-(4\u03b2,8)-(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl-4-hydroxyepicatechin, 3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin-(4\u03b2,8)-(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin)-(4\u03b2,8)-(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl-4-hydroxyepicatechin, and 3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin-bis[(4\u03b2,8)-(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin)]-(4\u03b2,8)-(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl-4-hydroxyepicatechin) are formed.","Reaction of bis(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl)epicatechin-(4\u03b2,8)-[3-O-acetyl-4-[(2-benzothiozolyl)thio]-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyepicatechin with tetrakis(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl)epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-tetramer in the presence of silver tetrafluoroborate resulted in the formation of the expected hexamer, i.e., hexakis(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl)epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-hexamer in 12% yield together with the by-products octakis(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl)epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-octamer, 3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin-4\u03b2,8-(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl-4-hydroxyepicatechin, and 3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin-bis[4\u03b2,8-(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzylepicatechin)]-4\u03b2,8-(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-benzylepicatechin)]-4\u03b2,8-(3-O-acetyl-5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-benzyl-4-hydroxyepicatechin).","Thus, chain elongation can be performed in increments of two flavanol units. This procedure should be of used for the chain-extension of the larger protected epicatechin oligomers as these compounds far exceed the monomeric 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-protected, C-4 derivatized building blocks in value.","D. Chain Extension of Unprotected Monomers","The chain extension is carried out by reacting an unprotected epicatechin or catechin monomer with 4-(benzylthio)epicatechin or 4-(benzylthio)catechin monomer in the presence of dimethyl(methylthio)sulfonium tetrafluoroborate or preferably silver tetrafluoroborate. The particular virtue of this protocol resides in the exclusive formation of (4\u03b2,8)-interflavan linkages even for the unprotected substrates, which would otherwise yield mixtures of (4,6) and 4,8-linked products. On the other hand, the noxious nature of the benzyl mercaptan involved in the preparation of the 4-(benzylthio) monomers is a considerable drawback.","Reagents, Test Procedures, and Analytical Procedures","Reagents","Pearlman's catalyst (20% Pd(OH)\/C) was obtained from Aldrich and contained up to 50% HO.

Stirring at 0\u00b0 C. was continued for 40 minutes, during which time period the reaction mixture turned into a milky, whitish suspension. Triethylamine (1.1 mL, 8 mmol) was added, the mixture was evaporated to near dryness, and the residue was filtered over a short silica column with ethyl acetate\/hexane 1:1.

Initial elution with 25 L of ethyl acetate\/chloroform\/hexane (1:10:9) did not result in product recovery (this stage was, however, essential for achieving separation). Another 25 L of ethyl acetate\/chloroform\/hexane (1:11:8) eluted 4.01 g of the dimer (71% recovery; pure by HPLC). A fraction (1.72 g) consisting of trimer, tetramer, and some pentamer was eluted with 20 L of ethyl acetate\/chloroform\/hexane 1:12:7. Finally, the column was stripped with ethyl acetate\/chloroform\/hexane (2:12:7) to give 0.87 g of a fraction consisting mostly of the larger oligomers. The latter two fractions were taken up in methyl cyanide (CHCN), and separated into several portions by preparative HPLC (column D; 0\u201330 minutes, 80 to 100% (CHCN) in water, then (CHCN), and the appropriate fractions were pooled and dried in vacuo to obtain the oligomers as colorless films or foams.

All products from the pentamer on required additional purification because of peak tailing, which led to a contamination with lower oligomers that increased with the degree of oligomerization, and because of increasing contamination with unidentified aliphatic material from the nonpolar solvent and\/or column. For sample preparation, a small percentage of tetrahydrofuran had to be added to the CHCN from the heptamer on because of limited solubility in CHCN alone. For the pentamer through nonamer, the additional purification was performed on column D (0\u201330 minutes, 80 to 100% CHCN in water, then CHCN. For the decamer and undecamer, column B was used in combination with the same gradient. The nonamer, decamer, and undecamer still contained excessive amounts of aliphatic impurities after this treatment and were subjected to a third HPLC purification on column A using the same gradient. The following yields of pure products (97% or better by HPLC) were obtained: pentamer, 987 mg (41%); hexamer, 226 mg (16%); heptamer, 68 mg (6.1%); octamer, 26 mg (2.7%); nonamer, 11.5 mg (1.3%); decamer, 6.5 mg (0.8%); undecamer, 2.5 mg (0.3%).

See Long, L. H. et al., ., 2000, 273, 50. The results in Table 3 show that if hydrogen peroxide was present at the levels reported in the literature, it would produce a shift in the cell cycle to G\/M with a decrease in G\/G. The addition of catalase abrogated these effects, causing a shift in the cell cycle back to control values. The addition of catalase alone to pentamer-treated cells produced no conclusive change in the cell cycle attributable to hydrogen peroxide, i.e., the typical G\/Garrest caused by the pentamer remained essentially unchanged.","To eliminate the possibility that the epicatechin (4\u03b2,8)-pentamer might inhibit catalase activity, hydrogen peroxide was added to pentamer-treated cells in the presence and absence of catalase. The addition of hydrogen peroxide to pentamer-treated cells led to an increase in G\/Gand G\/M arrest at the expense of cells in the S phase. Catalase addition caused a shift back to the G\/Garrest typical of pentamer-treated cells, and heat-inactivated catalase had no effect. Thus, the G\/Garrest was directly caused by the pentamer, not by the hydrogen peroxide.
