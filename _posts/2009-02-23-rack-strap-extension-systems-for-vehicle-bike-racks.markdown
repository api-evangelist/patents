{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/066,689, filed Feb. 21, 2008 which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates to rack strap extension systems including vehicle-body-accessory spanning members for vehicle racks and methods for using the same.","Vehicle bike racks, or carriers, come in various configurations. For example, a common type of vehicle bike rack is described as a trunk rack and may be configured for installation at the rear of a vehicle, such as on, near, or adjacent the trunk of a sedan-type vehicle, or on, near, or adjacent the rear door of a hatchback- or minivan-type vehicle. Though generally described as trunk racks, they are not limited to being installed on vehicles with trunks. Often, a trunk rack is adjustable so that it can be configured to fit various vehicle types including both sedan- and hatchback-type vehicles. Trunk racks are generally installed using a series of straps, or webbing, that is secured to various points on the vehicle, such as one or more seams between a trunk or rear door and an adjacent portion of the vehicle's body, between a hinged window and an adjacent portion of a vehicle's body, or on another part of a vehicle body, such as an edge of a bumper. These straps are generally provided with a mechanism to tension the straps to secure the rack to the vehicle. The addition of one or more bikes or other equipment to the rack adds further tension to one or more of the straps. For example, Yakima sells a line of trunk racks under the YAKIMA JOE brand. Non-exclusive examples of trunk racks are also found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,997,116; 6,286,738; 6,386,407; and 6,422,443, which are incorporated herein by reference.","It is increasingly common for modern vehicles to include various aesthetic and\/or functional body accessories or protrusions, such as (but not limited to) spoilers, fins, wings, ground effects, and the like. Such body accessories or protrusions may be designed, manufactured, and installed by the original vehicle manufacturer (i.e., the original equipment manufacturer or OEM), or they may be after-market products installed by the vehicle owner or a technician. Often, such body accessories or protrusions are non-structural, for example being constructed of nonstructural plastic. That is, they are often not designed to bear weight or to withstand forces other than typical wind forces created by normal driving conditions. Non-exclusive examples of vehicles that include OEM body accessories or protrusions on or adjacent the hatchback door of the vehicle include the 2008 MINI COOPER S manufactured by BMW and the 2005 SUBARU FORESTER 2.5 XT, both of which include what may be described as spoilers or fins.","Vehicles having non-structural body accessories or protrusions on, near, or adjacent the rear of a vehicle often interfere or prevent the use of a typical trunk rack because the straps used to secure the rack to the vehicle, when tensioned, would impart excessive forces to the body accessory or protrusion. For example, a vehicle-body accessory or protrusion in the form of a spoiler adjacent the top portion of the vehicle's rear door would be subjected to forces from a tensioned strap that secures the trunk rack to the vehicle, and that force imparted from the strap may damage the vehicle-body accessory or protrusion.","Vehicle-body-accessory spanning members of a rack strap extension system that provide an extension mechanism for vehicle bike racks and vehicle bike racks incorporating the same according to the present disclosure include one or more members configured to span a body accessory or protrusion such as (but not limited to) a spoiler, fin, or wing that is installed proximate a strap securing point of a vehicle. The spanning members may be described as providing a mechanism for routing the straps of a vehicle bike rack around a vehicle-body accessory or protrusion. Additionally or alternatively, the spanning members may be described as preventing excessive forces from being applied to a vehicle-body accessory by a strap, or webbing, of a vehicle bike rack.","Vehicle-body-accessory spanning members of a rack strap extension system according to the present disclosure for use with trunk racks are schematically illustrated in  and generally indicated at . As illustrated, spanning members  may include a body  and two end portions , . Body  may (but is not required to) include, or be constructed of, a material that allows body  to maintain a substantially rigid shape, including in an arcuate shape, such as a rectangular or circular shape, or any shape desired. Such materials may include a metal, a substantially rigid foam or rubber, or any material so desired. It will be appreciated that spanning members  can either be a fixed shape or can be adjustable. For example, body  may be configured so that the distance between end portions  and  can be lengthened or shortened as desired. Such a configuration can be achieved using a sliding pair of members as body  that can be latched, stopped, or locked at the desired distance between end portions  and .","End portions ,  may take a variety of forms and may be configured to engage a surface or other portion of a corresponding vehicle. For example, an end portion of a spanning member may be configured to engage the outer surface of a window, door, roof, or other vehicle body portion. In such embodiments, the end portion may (but is not required to) include, or be constructed of, a material that generally prevents the spanning member from slipping on the vehicle body portion, such as a frictional material (e.g., rubber, plastic). Additionally or alternatively, an end portion of a spanning member may be configured to engage a crevice, seam, or other generally three-dimensional aspect of a vehicle body. For example, an end portion may be configured to engage a seam between a vehicle door or window and an adjacent portion of the vehicle's body. A non-exclusive example of such an end portion may take the form of a hook. Spanning members according to the present disclosure may include end portions that are configured differently. For example, a spanning member may include a first end portion  configured to engage a seam of a vehicle body and a second end portion  configured to engage the outer surface of a rear window of a vehicle. Other configurations are equally within the scope of the present disclosure.","Spanning members according to the present disclosure may be described as having an outward-facing or routing surface  and an inward-facing surface . When a spanning member is installed on a corresponding vehicle, the outward-facing surface will generally face away from the vehicle's body while the inward-facing surface will generally face toward the vehicle's body. The contour of the spanning member creates a cavity , which conforms to the shape of inward-facing surface . As an illustrative non-exclusive example, the contour of cavity  may have an arcuate shape, such as a rectangular or circular shape, or any shape desired. The shape or contour of cavity  may be configured to create space for insertion of a vehicle body accessory or protrusion into the cavity, in such a manner that ends portions ,  can still be engaged to the vehicle.","As mentioned above, trunk racks are generally secured to a corresponding vehicle using straps, or webbing, that are tensioned. Spanning members  are therefore provided to engage the straps of a corresponding trunk rack and route the straps around a vehicle-body accessory that otherwise may be damaged due to excessive forces, as discussed above. The tension to secure the rack, strap, and\/or spanning member to the vehicle can be achieved in a variety of ways using a variety of securement structures or connector mechanisms. For example, a first connector piece, such as a male member, that is proximate the strap and spanning member, and mated to a second connector piece, such as a receiver or female piece, of the vehicle, can be used to secure the spanning member, strap, and\/or rack to the vehicle as desired. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of connector mechanisms and securement structures include a hook or latch and catch mechanism, a buckle, a ladder-lock mechanism, and\/or a glass hatch mechanism, any or a combination of which can be used as desired. It is appreciated that the male connector may be connected to either the strap or spanning member and mated to a female receiver of the vehicle, or vice-versa.","In some embodiments, surface  may directly engage a corresponding strap. Additionally or alternatively, as illustrated in dashed lines, spanning members may (but are not required to) include one or more channels  for receiving and engaging a corresponding strap. For example, a spanning member may include a channel  extending along at least a portion of surface . Additionally or alternatively, a spanning member may include a channel  extending through a portion of the spanning member and having openings ,  provided on surface  of the spanning member. Additionally or alternatively, a spanning member may include a channel  extending through a portion of the spanning member and having an opening  on outward-facing surface  and an opening  on inward-facing surface . Other configurations are equally within the scope of the present disclosure.","Additionally or alternatively, as schematically illustrated at , spanning members according to the present disclosure may include a strap securement mechanism configured to engage a strap or webbing, which may be the same as, or different from, the connector mechanism described above. For example, a spanning member may have a ladder-lock mechanism or other structure configured to secure an end, or a portion of, a length of strap or webbing. Such structure may include the ability to adjust the strap or webbing, for example, to tension the strap or webbing after the spanning member and corresponding rack have been appropriately positioned on a vehicle. Additionally or alternatively, the spanning member may include a coupling mechanism configured to cooperate with a corresponding mechanism attached to a length of strap or webbing. For example, a side-release buckle may be used. Other configurations of securing a length of strap or webbing to a spanning member are equally within the scope of the present disclosure. It is also appreciated that any of these mechanisms could also be used as the connector mechanism or securement structure, as described above, and vice-versa.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","10","50","52","50","54","56","54","56","50"]},"In the non-exclusive embodiment of spanning member , two lengths of straps ,  are illustrated, although additional straps or other securing mechanisms may additionally be used. It is understood that the term \u201cstrap\u201d is intended to include straps, bungee cords, rope, tweed, webbing or any other material that can secure a rack and\/or spanning member to a vehicle. As illustrated, spanning member  is configured to span or otherwise extend over or around a vehicle-body accessory or protrusion . A first length of strap  is shown extending from the bike rack  around and engaging the spanning member  and secured to first securement structure or connector mechanism  of vehicle . A second length of strap  is shown extending from the bike rack  to second securement structure or connector mechanism  of vehicle .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","10","50","200","62","200","12","54","50","58","200","58"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","10","50","300","62","300","54","12","300","58","28","54"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 5-7","FIGS. 2-4"],"b":["100","200","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["100","200","300","50","62","54","83","85"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["10","70","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"],"b":["200","12","54"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 12","FIG. 11","FIG. 13"],"b":["300","70","300","300","80","80","82","84"]},"Referring to , the embodiment of hook  may be installed by opening the rear door or hatch  of the vehicle, and positioning cylindrical members  and bar  within an inside cavity  of the vehicle and positioning a portion of strap  through the crack or seam  of the vehicle between the rear door or hatch  and inside cavity . Once rear door or hatch  is closed, the strap (or pair of straps) can be pulled from the outside of the vehicle to seat and secure cylindrical members  and bar  within inside cavity . The strap can then be coupled to a rack and a spanning member, as described above, such that cylindrical members  and bar  may anchor and secure the spanning member (or pair of spanning members), strap, and\/or trunk rack to the vehicle. For example, a buckle, a ladder lock, or other securement structure or connector mechanism, such as the ones herein described, may be employed with the strap to maintain the desired tension of the strap to so secure the spanning member, strap, and\/or trunk rack to the vehicle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIGS. 14A-F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIGS. 14E and 14F","b":"34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIGS. 15A and 15B"},"It is further appreciated that the spanning members of the present disclosure can be adopted for other uses beyond securing a trunk rack to the rear end of a vehicle. The spanning members can generally be used in association with straps to avoid damage to any structure that is desired to be protected against damage by tensioned straps, on a vehicle or otherwise. For example, the spanning members of the present disclosure could be used in association with straps securing objects to the roof of the vehicle to avoid damaging a rear spoiler or fin, such as the ones described herein. The spanning members could be positioned along or near the roof area adjacent either the passenger or driver side of the vehicle to protect non-structural accessories or protrusions (perhaps a rain shield located over the windows) from damage when using straps to secure objects to the roof of the vehicle. The spanning members could also be positioned in association with securing a strap to the bottom of a vehicle (such as strap  in ) to avoid damaging a vehicle accessory or protrusion located near the bottom of a vehicle (perhaps ground effects).","The disclosure set forth above encompasses multiple distinct inventions with independent utility.
