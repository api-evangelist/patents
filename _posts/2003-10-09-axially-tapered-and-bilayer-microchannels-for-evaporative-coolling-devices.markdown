title: Axially tapered and bilayer microchannels for evaporative coolling devices
abstract: The invention consists of an evaporative cooling device comprising one or more microchannels whose cross section is axially reduced to control the maximum capillary pressure differential between liquid and vapor phases. In one embodiment, the evaporation channels have a rectangular cross section that is reduced in width along a flow path. In another embodiment, channels of fixed width are patterned with an array of microfabricated post-like features such that the feature size and spacing are gradually reduced along the flow path. Other embodiments incorporate bilayer channels consisting of an upper cover plate having a pattern of slots or holes of axially decreasing size and a lower fluid flow layer having channel widths substantially greater than the characteristic microscale dimensions of the patterned cover plate. The small dimensions of the cover plate holes afford large capillary pressure differentials while the larger dimensions of the lower region reduce viscous flow resistance.

DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention, including a paid-up license and the right, in limited circumstances, to require the owner of any patent issuing in this invention to license others on reasonable terms.","Evaporative cooling devices such as heat pipes and capillary pumped loops utilize capillary suction to draw liquid into the evaporation region. This capillary suction results from the pressure differential across the phase interface between a liquid and vapor. According to the Laplace-Young relation, the interfacial pressure difference is proportional to the surface tension and is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature of the interface. Further, since the pressure within the liquid is generally less than that in the adjacent gas, the liquid pressure decreases as the radius of curvature becomes smaller. Thus, liquid is drawn toward regions where the radius of curvature is small and the liquid pressure is low.","In the typical heat pipe configuration of  heat is applied at one end causing evaporation of liquid from the wick. The vapor generated raises the gas phase pressure at the hot end causing transport of vapor along the open center toward the cold end. Heat extraction at the cold end condenses the vapor. The condensate is absorbed by the wick and then transported through the wick by capillary suction back to the hot region where the liquid pressure is lower.","The capillary pumped loop of  is similar in concept except that the evaporator and the condenser units are connected by a pair of tubes or channels that facilitate greater separation between the heat source and sink, particularly in cases where space is limited. In this device the capillary suction of the wick must overcome the viscous friction in the connector tubes as well as the friction within the wick itself. However, it is also true that the capillary suction of a heat pipe must overcome the frictional pressure drops in both phases, and in that configuration the counterflow of the vapor and liquid adds to the overall flow resistance.","In traditional evaporative cooling devices the wick is constructed of a porous material such as a sintered metal, a felt metal, or a layered screen (see A. Faghri \u201c\u201d Taylor and Francis Publishers, 1995). Metals are used because high thermal conductivity is needed to transfer heat through the wick to the liquid\/vapor interface where evaporation is intended to occur, thus avoiding bubble formation within the wick. The performance of a wick material is strongly dependent upon its microstructure. It is generally beneficial to have relatively small pores or interstices within the material since this reduces the minimum radius of curvature of the phase interface, increasing the capillary pressure difference available to draw liquid into the wick. However, smaller pores result in greater frictional resistance and, hence, slower rates of liquid transport through the wick. Thus, the optimum pore size must strike a balance between these opposing requirements.","Engineered wick structures are now being produced by modem microfabrication techniques. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) of metals and chemical etching of silicon have been used to create microgrooves having triangular, trapezoidal, sinusoidal, and nearly rectangular cross sections (Stores, et al., 28, Aug. 9-12, San Diego, v. 200, 1992, pp. 1-7; and , v. 119, 1997, pp. 851-853 and Sivaraman, et al., , v.45,2002, pp.1535-1543). Of these alternative shapes, triangular grooves have received by far the most attention (Xu, et al., , v. 4, no.4, 1990, pp. 512-520; Ha, et al., , v. 118, 1996, pp. 747-755; Peles, et al., , v. 26, 2000, pp. 1095-1115; and Catton, et al., , v. 124, 2002, pp. 162-168). The focus on this geometry may be largely because it provides a monotonic decrease in meniscus radius and capillary pressure as the depth of the fluid decreases and the meniscus recedes into the wedge-shaped channel, as illustrated in FIG. A. However, the triangular shape provides only half the cross-sectional area of a rectangular channel, the viscous friction is greater and, in addition, deep triangular cross sections cannot be readily produced using lithographic processes that have been so successful in mass production of semiconductor devices.","Lithographic processes are well suited to the fabrication of devices having a great multiplicity of highly detailed microscale features. In particular, the LIGA process can be used to produce a multiplicity of metal channels having widths down to a few microns and depths as large as a millimeter or more (see Becker, et al., , v. 4, 1986, pp. 35-56; and Ehrfeld, et al., (), v. 16, no.6, 1998, pp. 3526-3534). In LIGA, a high-energy x-ray source is used to expose a thick photoresist, typically PMMA, through a patterned absorber mask. The exposed material is then removed by chemical dissolution in a development bath. This development process yields a nonconducting mold having a conducting substrate beneath deep cavities that are subsequently filled by electrodeposition. The resulting metal parts may be the final product or may be used as injection or embossing molds for mass production. However, since the exposure beam is generally aligned perpendicular to the patterned mask, LIGA and other lithographic processes are best suited for fabrication of channels having parallel sidewalls and hence a rectangular cross section. Multiple x-ray exposures at different angles to the mask could be used to produce triangular channels, but not without added complexity and loss of precision.","Although amenable to LIGA fabrication, straight rectangular microchannels have one notable disadvantage. As illustrated in , the capillary pressure varies with the liquid height (depth) in the channel only so long as the meniscus remains attached to the top comers of the channel. The radius of curvature of the interface may then range anywhere between infinity for a flat meniscus to a minimum radius that corresponds to the minimum wetting angle. However, once the meniscus recedes into the channel and leaves the singular corner point, the wetting angle is fixed at a particular minimum value determined by liquid and solid interaction energies. Thus there is a large range of liquid heights (depths) in the channel for which the radius of curvature and the corresponding capillary pressure are invariant. Within this \u201cdead zone\u201d (see Stores, et al.; , v. 119, 1997, pp. 851-853) there will be no capillary pressure variation to draw fluid toward the drier end of the channel. It is only when the meniscus reaches the channel bottom and begins to recede into the corners that a capillary pressure gradient can again be established. But in this regime the fluid depth can be no greater than half the channel width.","The present invention describes microscale channels that are engineered to have an axial variation in the minimum radius of meniscus curvature along the primary flow direction substantially independent of the depth of the working fluid in the channel.","It is an object of the invention to provide an evaporative cooling device comprising one or more channels whose cross section is axially reduced to control the maximum capillary pressure differential between liquid and vapor phases of a liquid contained within the channel.","It is also an object of the invention to provide an evaporative cooling device comprising one or more channels whose cross section is tapered from wide to narrow in the direction of flow.","It is yet another object of the invention to provide channels of fixed width that are patterned with an array of microfabricated post-like features such that the spacing between these features gradually decreases in the direction of the flow path.","It is again another object of the invention to provide bilayer channels comprising an upper cover plate having a pattern of slots or holes of axially decreasing size and a lower fluid flow layer having channel widths substantially greater than the characteristic microscale dimensions of the patterned cover plate.","Still other objects and advantages of the present invention will be ascertained from a reading of the following detailed description and the appended claims.","The simplest embodiment of this invention is an axially tapered microchannel formed into the body of a thermally conductive substrate member and having a flow cross-section that narrows in width along the intended flow path, as illustrated in . Such channels have no dead zone; they can be fabricated by lithographic processes such as LIGA, and they generally perform much better than prior art triangular grooves or straight rectangular channels. Through mathematical modeling it is shown here that the maximum sustainable heat flux for a tapered channel may exceed that of a comparable triangular groove by a factor of three to six. Tapered channels, such as those shown in , also provide much more robust performance than straight rectangular channels by a three to four fold increase in their ability to overcome opposing gravitational forces.  illustrate cross-sectional views of a representative channel at opposite ends of its length. When applied to capillary pumped loops, tapered channels provide a desirable insensitivity to the magnitude of external pressure drops within auxiliary connector tubes. In particular, all prior art methods disclose structures having a constant cross-sectional width. In these cases the driving potential for liquid flow relies upon changes in depth along the length of the channel. The present methods, however, establish the potential gradient for liquid flow by providing channels whose cross-sectional width changes (either continuously or in a step-wise manner) along the length of the channel. This simple feature, therefore, avoids difficulties with flow stagnation due to liquid evaporation and channel \u201cdry-out\u201d at the \u201chot end\u201d of the channel.","A second embodiment of the present invention is illustrated schematically in  which show the top and side views of a channel divided by dividing walls. Here the reduction in channel width is implemented in a step-wise fashion through repetitively dividing the channels with axial partitions that divide the channels along a portion of their length. Two or three dividers provide substantial benefits particularly when the fabrication technology permits fabrication of narrow dividing partitions. Calculations reported here describe optimal partition lengths and expected device performance.","The embodiments illustrated in  utilize arrays of cylindrical posts to reduce the effective width of the channels along the flow path. The post pattern shown in  is found to perform better then the embodiment shown in  since it maintains the same cross-sectional flow area along the flow path. The individual post cross-sections may be circular, square or any other shape. The post patterns are arbitrary. It is, however, necessary that the spacing between the posts be reduced along the flow path to approximate the characteristics of a tapered channel.  show end views of these two embodiments through a representative row of posts.","The embodiments illustrated in , , and  utilize bi-layer channels. The upper layer consists of a cover plate having an open pattern of tapered slits or holes that grow progressively smaller in scale in the flow direction (see , A, and A). The lower layer consists of a channel structure of the present invention (more clearly seen in , B and B) having wider lateral dimensions that help to reduce fluid friction. The upper layer incorporates the small dimensions and the axial variations needed to provide large capillary pressure gradients as well as providing open features in which a meniscus can form; the lower layer carries the bulk of the flow. Details of the upper cutout pattern structure are unimportant except that they provide a surface along the interior wall of the opening on which the meniscus can form. The lower structure may alternatively consist of a post array having a relatively wide post spacing. The improvement in maximum sustainable heat flux, compared to a one layer device, is proportional to the square of the ratio of the lateral length scales of the two layers. Thus, a threefold increase in the length scale of the lower layer relative to the upper layer can provide a nine-fold increase in maximum sustainable heat flux.","All of the embodiments illustrated here are shown schematically to convey basic concepts. These schematics are not drawn to scale. In reality, channel lengths are on the order of at least about 1 to 3 centimeters for cooling of electronic devices. In contrast, optimal channel widths are typically less than 100 microns. So the channels are typically more than 100 times longer than their width.","Because of the limitations of traditional fabrication technologies, traditional channel depths have typically been no greater than two or three channel widths. However, the LIGA technology is capable of producing high aspect ratio channels having a depth tenfold or more greater than the channel width as well as depth. Channel depth dimensions ranging up to 1 mm or more, therefore, are not only possible but also very advantageous since the maximum sustainable heat fluxes of evaporative cooling devices are proportional to the channel depth. Channel depth, however, is limited. Dimensions greater than about a centimeter are thought to be impractical and\/or nonfunctional due to the limitations of thermal conduction through the liquid and the potential for initiating boiling at the channel\/liquid interface. Practical microchannel width-to-depth aspect ratios, therefore, while greater than that illustrated in the FIGURES, are about ten to thirty.","Any of the microchannel designs described above can be utilized in a variety of devices including heat pipes, capillary pumped loops, and heat spreaders. We have designed the particular capillary pumped loop system shown in  so that it can be readily fabricated by LIGA. The evaporator and condenser units shown in  each consist of an upper plate and a lower plate. The outlet of each unit is connected to the inlet of the other unit by tubes. Details of the evaporator unit are shown in . Top view (see ) schematically illustrates the channel structure of the lower \u201cwick\u201d plate of the evaporator (the overlying vapor flow plate has been removed for clarity). The microchannels taper down in the direction of flow from the entry manifold (open region) toward the end wall. Cross section A\u2014A (see ) again shows the closely spaced tapered wick channels that typically have optimal width dimensions of less than 100 microns. Section A\u2014A further shows that the upper plate of the evaporator unit (shown above the close-packed channel array in section A\u2014A) has widely spaced partitions but no microchannels since the presence of small passages would unnecessarily impede the vapor flow. Similarly, the condenser unit does not generally require microchannels so it is conveniently constructed using a pair of identical plates having widely spaced partitions but no microchannels, the same as the vapor flow plate of the evaporator. Thus, only two types of plates need to be fabricated, reducing production costs.  shows a side view cartoon of the flow direction and operation of the evaporator and condenser unit as viewed through one microchannel length.","Mathematical Model:","A mathematical model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of tapered channels and to optimize system parameters. In this analysis we focus on cases where the channel depth is much greater than the channel width partly for simplicity and partly because maximum sustainable heat fluxes increase with fluid depth.","The one-dimensional mass conservation equation describing steady evaporating flow along the tapered microchannels of  may be written as \n\n\nHere his the heat of evaporation, x is the axial position, \u03c1 is the liquid density, u is the mean axial speed, A=HW is the cross-sectional area of a channel of width W and height H, and s is the liquid saturation describing the fraction of the channel containing liquid. It is assumed here that all of the heat flux q\u2033 applied to the channel bottom is carried away by local fluid evaporation. This flux is applied to a base width, W, somewhat greater then the corresponding channel width, W, owing to the presence of webs between neighboring channels.\n","The fluid speed, u, is determined by the balance between viscous friction, the gravity force along the channel, \u03c1g, and the gradient of the liquid pressure, P, \n\n\nThe factor of twelve appearing in the denominator strictly applies only in the limit of deep channels where the flow resembles that between closely spaced parallel plates, but as shown by Schneider, et al., (AIAA Paper No. 80-0214; 1980) this constant can be adjusted to better approximate the friction in shallower channels. The viscosity \u03bc is presumed uniform and the sign of the gravitational term implies that a positive gravity force opposes the pressure driven flow. The Young-Laplace equation relates the pressure difference across the phase liquid vapor interface, P\u2212P, to the surface tension, \u03c3, and the interfacial radius of curvature, R. \n\n\nThe radius of curvature will be based on only the component in the cross-sectional plane of the channel since the axial radius of curvature is usually much greater. Also for simplicity we will assume that the external vapor pressure is uniform.\n","Combination of Eqs. (1) and (2) yields a single ordinary differential equation describing axial variations of the normalized liquid pressure and saturation, \n\n\nwhere the lower case variables, and the parameter G* have been normalized in the following manner: \n\n\nThe variables L, W, and \u0394P, are respectively defined as the channel length, the channel width at the entrance, and the maximum attainable capillary pressure in a channel of width Wassociated with a radius of curvature Rcorresponding to the minimum wetting angle. As indicated above, \u0394P\u02dc2\u03c3\/Wfor a wetting angle of zero degrees. The channel width is assumed to vary linearly along the channel from Wto Wsuch that \n\n\nUnder the above scaling of liquid pressure, the minimum liquid pressure (corresponding to the minimum wetting angle) at any axial location is given by \n\n\nAlthough we have investigated other power-law variations of the channel width, linear tapers appear to provide the best overall performance under a range of operating conditions.\n","The governing differential equation, (4), is integrated analytically to determine the variation of liquid pressure and fluid saturation along a typical channel. The details of this have been reported in a companion technical paper.  illustrates pressure profiles for a normalized inlet pressure of zero corresponding to the flat meniscus of a fully saturated inlet region. For the chosen value of \u0394w=0.5, the width of the channel at its end (\u03be=1) is half that at the inlet and so the minimum attainable value of the normalized liquid pressure is \u22122.0. Evaporation within the channel causes depression of the downward bowing meniscus, reducing the local pressure and drawing fluid into the channel. For a given heat flux, the meniscus (and liquid pressure) at the channel end are drawn down to an equilibrium level sufficient to maintain the flow rate needed to offset evaporative losses. With increasing Q*, the pressure at the channel end decreases and the radius of curvature becomes progressively smaller. Note that the pressure gradient at the channel end is always zero, consistent with the requirement that there be no flow through the end wall.","The dotted line in  corresponds to a normalized pressure of p=\u22121\/w. In accordance with Eq. (7) this line indicates the minimum attainable liquid pressure at any location along the channel, corresponding to the minimum wetting angle at that location. Since the actual liquid pressure must always be greater, the solution shown for Q*=2 must be rejected. At a somewhat smaller value of Q* the end of the channel will begin to dry out causing the meniscus to recede into the channel, as illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIGS. 14 and 15","FIG. 13"],"sub":["o","o"]},"Two distinct flow domains are apparent in . In the entry or pinned-meniscus region, the meniscus curvature increases and the liquid pressure decreases with distance owing to changes in the contact angle, but the channel remains liquid full as indicated by a saturation of unity in the entry region of FIG. . For simplicity we have ignored the slight reduction in fluid saturation that occurs as the meniscus bows down into the channel because the corresponding fractional reduction in saturation is negligible for channels of high aspect ratio. In the recession domain, the meniscus is detached from the top corners of the channel, and the saturation decreases strongly along the flow path.","As seen in the inset of , smaller values of the inlet pressure, p, correspond to a greater meniscus curvature at the inlet. This reduction of the liquid pressure at the inlet is generally needed to draw liquid and vapor through the transport tubes of a capillary pumped loop. When the frictional pressure drop in these connector tubes increases, the inlet pressure must decrease so that less of the overall capillary pressure drop is available to draw the liquid into the evaporation channels. As a consequence, the associated dry out heat fluxes also decrease with p. It is also seen in  that the transition point from a pinned meniscus to a receding meniscus moves backward with increasing p, reaching the entrance just as pgoes to zero.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 3"],"sub":"o","b":"16"},"The variation of the dry out heat flux with the normalized inlet pressure is illustrated in  for G*=0 and for several values of the normalized taper, \u0394w. For \u0394w=0, the maximum flux is found to increase linearly with p, in accordance with the equality of the following analytical expression.\n\n\u22662[1+(1 \u2212\u0394)(0)]\u2003\u2003(8)\n\nHowever, as seen in  this relationship clearly does not hold as an equality in the opposite extreme of a very strong taper, \u0394w=1. In this instance the maximum flux is simply unity, Q*=1, regardless of the inlet pressure. This behavior for large \u0394w is very robust in the sense that the maximum flux is not sensitive to inlet conditions that are sometimes influenced by other components within the system such as the pressure drops in the connector tubes of a capillary pumped loop.\n","For intermediate values of \u0394w the maximum flux profiles illustrated in  transition between these limiting straight lines that apply in the limits of \u0394w=0 and 1. Note that as p\u2192\u22121, the maximum flux is accurately given by Q*=\u0394w. In his limit, the transition point between pinned and receding meniscus domains approaches the channel entrance, leaving only the receding meniscus domain. At the opposite end of the pressure range where P\u21920, the maximum sustainable heat flux decreases with \u0394w, but the reduction from the global maximum of Q*=2.0 is only about 15% for \u0394w=0.7, increasing to a maximum possible reduction of 50% for \u0394w=1. So on the whole, it appears that taper is desirable in dealing with inlet conditions that are less than ideal (i.e., p<0) and that tapers of about 70% are the best practice.","The benefit of channel taper is greatest when an opposing gravitational force is present. This is because the stronger taper produces a smaller channel width at the exit, reducing the minimum liquid pressure available to draw fluid upward against gravity. Large values of G* correspond to relatively long channels having a gravity force component along the channels. G*=0 for horizontal operation in the absence of horizontal acceleration.","As seen in , a stronger taper extends the operating range of an evaporative cooling device to larger values of G*. In the absence of taper, the maximum heat flux, Q*, decreases linearly with G*, falling to Q*=0 at G*=1. A 50% taper (\u0394w=0.5) doubles the operating range to G*=2.0 while only slightly reducing the maximum sustainable heat flux for G*=0. With increasing taper, the maximum flux for G*=0 gradually decreases to Q*=1.0 while the operating range extends to G*=4.0 in the limit as \u0394w\u21921. However, a 70% taper can provide nearly a factor of three increase in the operating range while only reducing the maximum attainable flux at G*=0 by 15%. This amount of taper also provided well-balanced performance under variations in the channel inlet pressure, as seen earlier in FIG. .","Because of the popularity of evaporative cooling channels having a triangular cross section, we now compare their performance with that of tapered channels. We again consider the case of high aspect ratios partly for simplicity and partly because the maximum heat flux increases linearly with the channel depth, as explained earlier. In this limit, the axial fluid speed at any elevation may be taken as proportional to the width at that depth. Area weighted integration of this speed over the height of the groove indicates that the mean axial speed in the channel is given by Eq. (2) with the divisor in the denominator increased from 12 to 24, in good agreement with numerical results ranging from about 24.2 to about 27.6 for apex angles from 5 to 60 degrees as shown by Ayyaswamy, et al., (Journal of Applied Mechanics, 1974, pp. 332-336). This factor of two is combined with an additional factor of two reduction in the cross-sectional area of the channel to provide a reduction in heat fluxes by a factor of four. If we leave our scaling of Q* unchanged, this factor of four can be inserted as a divisor on the left sides of Eq. (4).","Assuming that the triangular groove is not tapered along its axis, it follows from our analysis of straight rectangular channels that a heat flux of Q*=(2.\/4.)=0.5 can be carried without any recession of the pinned meniscus into a triangular groove. Recall from  that a tapered channel with a 50% reduction in width can carry a flux of about Q*=1.8 without recession of the meniscus. A 70% taper can carry a flux of about Q*=1.5 without recession. So by this measure of performance, the tapered channel is about a factor of three better than a triangular groove.","An important benefit of triangular grooves is that they continue to draw fluid by capillarity even when the meniscus falls below the pinning points at the top corners. This benefit is shared by axially tapered channels. To assess the relative performance under these conditions, suppose that the saturation at the channel inlet is near unity and that the entry meniscus is at its maximum curvature, so that any evaporation will cause recession of the meniscus into the channel. The governing equation for the triangular groove is obtained by inserting a factor of 4 into Eq. (4). \n\n\nHere, one of the w's is subscripted with a zero to indicate that it should be taken at the inlet value of unity; this factor of w arose from the cross-sectional area of the channel which is constant. The remaining factor of waccounts for frictional resistance and is correctly taken as the width of the groove at the top of the meniscus which decreases along the channel. The fractional saturation, s, is simply the product of the normalized fluid depth and width, again based on the local meniscus location. Further, since the normalized fluid depth (h=(H\/H)=(W\/W)=w) and the radius of meniscus curvature are both proportional to the meniscus width, \n\n\nInserting these results into Eq. (9) and performing the integration yields a maximum heat flux of Q*=\u2159 for G*=0. \n\n\nThe corresponding maximum heat flux for a tapered channel is Q*=\u0394w as noted earlier in discussing FIG. . Thus, a channel taper of 20% (\u0394w=0.2) provides similar performance while a strongly tapered channel (\u0394w=1.0) can sustain a heat flux that is 6 times greater. Thus, even if the inlet meniscus should recede below the channel top, a tapered channel can easily outperform a triangular groove. In addition, the tapered channel can be readily produced lithographically while a triangular groove cannot.\n\nSummarized Advantages of Tapered Channels:\n","Tapered channels expand the operating range of cooling devices by permitting operation under opposing gravitational forces of greater strength. As an example, a linear taper of 70% provides a 300% increase in the maximum allowable gravity force while only reducing the maximum flux under zero gravity (horizontal operation) by 15%. To obtain the same lifting capability in a straight channel would necessitate a factor of three reduction in channel width and, hence, a 300% reduction in the maximum heat flux for horizontal operation.","Another benefit of channel taper is improved performance under variations in the inlet liquid pressure. In a straight channel of high aspect ratio, the maximum sustainable heat flux becomes negligible as the inlet pressure approaches its minimum value corresponding to the minimum wetting angle. However, under this same inlet condition a channel with a 70% taper can still sustain a heat flux that is 40% of the maximum attainable for a flat meniscus at the inlet of a straight channel (see FIG. ). A channel with a 100% taper (\u0394w=1) is entirely insensitive to the inlet pressure and is always able to sustain a heat flux that is 50% of that possible for a straight channel with a flat inlet meniscus.","Tapered channels continue to provide strong cooling performance even when the inlet meniscus falls below the top corners of channel. Under these conditions the maximum heat flux is simply proportional to the product of the inlet saturation and the channel taper. A straight channel cannot perform well at all under these conditions because the fixed wetting angle and fixed channel width imply that there can be no capillary driven flow except in the bottom corners of the channel and this flow becomes negligible at the high aspect ratios considered here.","Although channels of triangular cross section are frequently used in evaporative cooling applications (partly because they offer many of the robust performance features discussed above), a comparable tapered channel can sustain a heat flux that is 300% greater in the pinned meniscus regime and 600% greater in the receding meniscus regime. This comparison is made between tapered channels and triangular grooves having the same inlet width and the same high aspect ratio. Another advantage of tapered channels is that they can be readily fabricated lithographically whereas triangular grooves cannot.","A multiplicity of tapered channels can be fabricated together with peripheral manifolds and reservoirs using lithography-based technologies. The LIGA fabrication technique is specifically aimed at producing detailed metals parts of high aspect ratio having depth dimensions ranging up to millimeters and lateral dimensions ranging down to a few microns.","Cascade of Progressively Narrower Channels:","The benefit of channel taper can be realized in a discrete, step-like manner by serial connection of a sequence of successively narrower straight channel segments. As an example, we consider a sequence constructed by insertion of partitions that progressively divide each of the channels over a portion of their length, as illustrated in . The resulting flow path consists of N axial stages, with 1 channel in the first stage, 2 identical parallel channels in the second stage, 4 channels in the third stage, and so on. This configuration makes full use of the available plan-form area and is relatively easy to analyze by applying Eq. (4) to each successive stage. Since the istage consists of nidentical parallel segments, the width of each channel segment is computed by subtracting out the total width of (n\u22121) dividers each having a normalized thickness, t, and dividing the remainder by n.","To optimize the device performance, we determined the lengths of the dividing partitions by requiring that all the available pressure drop be utilized in each successive stage. The meniscus curvature at the outlet of each segment must then be equal to the minimum possible value, and so p=1\/W. Since the pressure must be continuous, the inlet pressure of the isegment must be the same as the outlet pressure of the (i\u22121), p=(1\/W). This requires that the radius of curvature be the same on both sides of the transition between stages, as illustrated in the cross-sectional view of FIG. . The adjustment between the two meniscus profiles shown in  will take place over about one channel width on each side, a distance far smaller than typical axial dimensions. In the example calculations that follow the prescribed inlet pressure of the first stage, p, is taken as zero, corresponding to a flat inlet meniscus. Application of Eq. (4) to each of the N stages yields a system of equations that are solved for the N\u22121 unknown optimal partition lengths and the unknown heat flux Q* which is the same for all stages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 19","maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00011","num":"00011"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["Q","max"],"mo":"*"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"+","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]}},{"mi":"i","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"12"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Our example calculations are for an idealized situation where the partition thickness is negligible compared to the inlet channel width. A uniform divider thickness that is 10% of the inlet width (t=0.1) will only permit a maximum of nine channels, so two or three stages are all that can be used for that case. Thus, a fabrication technology capable of producing very narrow partitions would certainly be beneficial. Although the divider thickness must be large enough to effectively conduct heat from the substrate to the evaporation interface, the width of the dividers can be cut in half at each stage while still maintaining the same total cross-sectional area for heat conduction, because the number of dividers doubles at each stage.","The benefit of split channels is greatest when the opposing gravity force is large, as clearly seen in FIG. . In the absence of any dividers (N=0), the maximum heat flux is zero for normalized gravitational forces greater than G*=1. In contrast, the use of two stages extends the range of operation to G*=4, while also increasing the maximum flux to Q*=2.75, for G*=0. To obtain the same gravitational lift using continuous straight channels would necessitate a factor of four reduction in channel width, reducing the sustainable heat fluxes by that same factor as apparent from the scaling relations given by Eqs. (4) and (5). However, it is important to point out that the results presented in  indicate maximum possible fluxes for configurations that are optimized for the indicated gravitational force. Thus, if we desire a system that operates well in a range from G*=0 to 4, we might chose to optimize the geometry based on a gravitational force of G*=2. Note that the maximum permissible G* (where Q* goes to zero) depends only on the number of stages.","The channel width profiles of the optimized multistage channel configurations are illustrated in FIG. . The stair-step plots indicate the channel width as a function of axial position for the case of very narrow partitions. Channel shapes optimized for G*=0 are shown for N=2, 4, and 8 stages. It is interesting to note that for G=0 the taper of the channel might be judged as nearly linear based on a construction of lines connecting the centers of the channel segments. It is also seen that the lengths of the first partitions are not greatly altered by insertion of additional partitions, since the locations of the first steps are relatively insensitive to the number of stages, N. This observation also holds true for shapes that are optimized for G*=4 and 5. In these latter cases the results for N=2 are omitted to reduce the confusion of additional overlapping lines. It is seen that the optimum shapes for large G* have a convex profile that restricts the channel width at a greater than linear rate. However, as noted earlier, the linear shapes (here optimized for G*=0) generally provide better performance under a broad range of conditions.","To summarize, a stepwise tapered channel system with optimally designed divisions generally provides better performance than a comparable linear taper, partly because the bisected or divided channels cover a greater portion of the total heated area. A stepwise taper can be fabricated using LIGA or any other technique capable of producing serially connected straight channels that are discretely stepped down in width along the flow path.","Axially Varied Micropatterning:","The main benefit of axial reduction in the channel width is the associated increase in the maximum available capillary pressure. Such taper also assures continued operation at low fluid depths. The detriments of taper are two-fold, a narrowing of the channel reduces the cross-sectional flow area and it also increases the fluid friction. The channel division scheme of the preceding section provides the full benefit while minimizing the reduction in cross-sectional flow area, particularly in cases where dividing partitions are few and their thickness can be made small compared to the channel width.","Another way to axially reduce the capillary pressure while maintaining the cross-sectional flow area is illustrated in . In these designs there are no continuous channel walls. Instead, the evaporating coolant flows between an array of post-like features that are attached to the heated substrate. Lithography-based fabrication techniques can be used to produce any desired pattern of posts having circular, square, rectangular, elliptical, or any other cross-sectional shape. Most importantly, the spacing between the post surfaces can be reduced along the flow path to achieve a reduction in the minimum radius of meniscus curvature in a manner analogous to the previous designs having straight walls. In , this narrowing of the flow passages is realized by simply increasing the size of the posts such that the flow passages between them become progressively smaller. In this example, however, the flow area still decreases along the flow path.","The post pattern shown in  has a uniform porosity and hence a uniform flow area since the layout is produced by simply reducing the scale of the pattern in the axial direction. The patterned arrays have two other advantages over conventional channels with straight walls, tapered or not. First, the capillary pressure depends on the radius of curvature of a two-dimensional meniscus which has both axial and transverse components of similar magnitude that reinforce one another. When both components are of comparable magnitude, the minimum capillary pressure is reduced by a factor of two compared to a straight or tapered channel. In addition, the frictional forces in a post array having a given spacing are less than those in conventional channels having a comparable wall spacing. In the post array it is as though the wall is discontinuous so that the mean spacing between the \u201cwalls\u201d is expanded, reducing the friction.","Multilayer Channels:","In each of the preceding channel designs the lateral length scale controlling viscous friction has been the same as that controlling the capillary pressure. The spacing between the channel walls or, equivalently, the distance between individual elements of the post pattern has been the determinant of both the minimum capillary pressure and the frictional resistance. Reduction of this length scale, l, is desirable because it reduces the minimum meniscus curvature and so increases the available capillary pressure differential (\u0394p\u02dc1\/l ). However, such a reduction also increases the frictional resistance (\u03c4\u02dc1\/l).","The multilayer channel designs shown in ,  and  utilize a cover plate having a lateral length scale smaller than that of the underlying channels. The cover plate of  contains a tapered slot that is the only area of contact between the liquid and the adjacent vapor phase. Thus, the pressure difference between the phases (capillary pressure) is controlled by the meniscus curvature within that slot. Just as in a single-layer channel, the taper of the slot provides a lower minimum pressure at the outlet than at the inlet. Thus, so long as the meniscus remains attached to the side walls of the cover plate, this taper assures that fluid can be drawn to the far end of the evaporator (whereas a straight slit in the cover plate will not, owing to the dead zone issue illustrated in FIG. ). Thus, the depth of the cover plate should be made thick enough to ensure fluid contact with the upper layer for the lowest expectations of fluid depth.","The primary channels beneath the cover plate have lateral dimensions considerably greater than those of the slits or holes in the cover plate. Wider spacing of the lower primary channel walls greatly reduces friction. However, these dimensions cannot be increased without limit because heat conduction through the lower channel walls and across the cover plate is relied upon to transport heat from the substrate to the meniscus where evaporation occurs. However, a primary channel width that is equal to the channel depth would only increase the conduction path length by about 50% while greatly increasing the fluid flow. As an example, suppose that the channel depth is on the order of 1 mm and that the slots in the cover plate have a width of about 50 microns. If the primary channel width in the lower level is increased from 50 microns (as in an open one-layer system) to 1 mm, viscous friction is reduced by a factor of more than 100, increasing the maximum flow rate and cooling capacity by that same factor.","The slits or holes in the cover plate need not be continuous, as illustrated in . The introduction of closed portions helps to improve the structural integrity and the lateral heat conductivity of the cover plate. For any given cutout pattern, the overall pressure distribution in the liquid beneath the cover plate is still controlled by the interfacial vapor\/liquid matching conditions that apply in the open portions of the pattern. As in open channels, excessive fluid depletion in any region of the channel causes downward bowing of the meniscus, lowering the local pressure and drawing fluid toward that location. The pressure in the liquid beneath the closed portions of the upper plate varies smoothly between these control points. Although fluid flow within open portions of the cover plate may be impeded by the lack of a continuous channel, this is of little consequence because nearly all of the flow passes beneath the plate.","A preferred pattern for a cover plate is illustrated in FIG. . The porosity of the plate is on the order of 50%. The circular hole pattern decreases in scale along the flow path to provide the same benefit as a tapered channel. In addition, the pattern need not be carefully aligned with the channel system below. The fluid and heat transport characteristics for this pattern are nearly insensitive to the alignment between upper and lower levels. This is in contrast to the axial slot patterns of  which would perform poorly if the slots were inadvertently aligned just above the underlying channel walls, perhaps blocking the upward fluid flow to the meniscus or inadvertently interrupting the metallic conduction path from the base plate to the meniscus region where evaporation occurs.","The circular hole pattern of  is also advantageous in assuring a relatively short path length for lateral heat conduction in the cover plate. The holes are numerous enough and small enough relative to the underlying channel structure, that some of the holes will be quite near to the regions of contacts between the cover plate and the walls (webs) of the underlying channel structure.","Because the thermal conductivity of typical working fluids is about 100 times less than that of metals, it is important to maintain relatively close proximity between the cover plate and the tops of the underlying channel walls. This difficulty can be minimized by use of a relatively thin and hence flexible cover plate. Also, in a capillary pumped loop device like that shown in , the cover plate will be sandwiched between the widely spaced partitions of the upper and lower halves of the evaporator.","Vertical flow of liquid through the open pattern of the cover plate to the meniscus does not place any severe restrictions on the cover plate design. Since the vertical velocity v through the cutout holes of area Amust account for all of the evaporative mass flux we can write \n\n\nThe second of the above expressions for the velocity, \u03bd, is similar to that given in Eq. (2) except that wand hrefer to the width and depth of holes in the top plate, and \u0394Pis the vertical pressure differential across the plate. Similarly, evaporation of the longitudinal mass flux must also account for all of the evaporative flux. \n\n\nCombination of these expressions yields the following estimate for the ratio of the vertical and longitudinal pressure differentials. \n\n\nHere we have set A\/A=0.5 corresponding to a 50% porosity and W\/W\u02dc0.5. Thus, the vertical pressure gradients will be relatively small provided that the ratio of the hole size to the lower channel width, W\/W, is considerably greater than the ratios of the upper and lower channel depths to the length, a condition that is relatively easy to satisfy. For a channel length of L=20 mm, upper and lower layer depths of h=1 mm and h=0.2 mm, and a lower level channel width of 0.3 mm, the vertical pressure differential will be no greater than 10% of that available provided that the hole size, w, is greater than 20 microns. Furthermore, in this example the ratio of the lateral length scales between the upper and lower regions is 20\/300, and provides more than a 100 fold reduction in friction compared to a 20 micron longitudinal channel.\n"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4C","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4C"],"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIGS. 5A and 5B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A and 8B","FIG. 8A","FIG. 8B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A and 9B","FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A and 10B","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 12A-12C","FIG. 12A","FIG. 12B","FIG. 12C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 20"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
