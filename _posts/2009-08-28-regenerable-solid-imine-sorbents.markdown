title: Regenerable solid imine sorbents
abstract: Two new classes of amine-based sorbents are disclosed. The first class comprises new polymer-immobilized tertiary amine sorbents; the second class new polymer-bound amine sorbents. Both classes are tailored to facilitate removal of acid anhydrides, especially carbon dioxide (CO), from effluent gases. The amines adsorb acid anhydrides in a 1:1 molar ratio. Both classes of amine sorbents adsorb in the temperature range from about 20° C. upwards to 90° C. and can be regenerated by heating upwards to 100° C.

No. 11\/506,120 filed Aug. 18, 2006 now abandoned.","This invention was made with government support pursuant to the employer-employee relationship between the Government and the inventors as U.S. Department of Energy employees at the National Energy Technology Laboratory. The government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to sorbents for the removal of acid anhydrides from effluent gases, and more specifically, this invention relates to two classes of amine-based sorbents: polymer-immobilized tertiary amines and polymer-bound tertiary amines which can serve as sorbents for the removal of carbon dioxide and other acid anhydrides from any effluent stream.","2. Background of the Invention","Carbon dioxide is considered to be the major greenhouse gas due to its effect on the earth's ozone layer. It has been estimated that 36% of the United States' anthropogenic COis produced from coal-fired power plants. Consequently, the capture and sequestration of COfrom flue gas streams is an essential step for carbon management in our environment.","New research efforts for the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO) from flue gas streams are being proposed and will have a direct or indirect impact on the types of systems ultimately designed and implemented. Currently, techniques for the capture and separation of COemploy solvents, cryogenic techniques, membranes, and solid sorbents. Large-scale operation of these technologies is energy intensive when applied to capturing COin dilute streams, such as flue gas. For example, coal combustion gases comprise approximately 15 mol % CO.","Carbon dioxide is removed from natural gas streams via stripping into aqueous amine solutions. A significant improvement over the past 30 years has been the introduction of sterically hindered amines which allow for a 1:1 molar adsorption ratio of COto amine rather than the 1:2 ratio found in typical primary and secondary amines. The most serious drawbacks to aqueous amine processes are corrosion of process vessels, degradation of amine during thermal cycling, and the large energy requirements owing to water's high heat capacity.","Amine-based wet scrubbing systems have also been proposed as capture techniques for COremoval from flue gas streams. However, these systems are very energy-intensive due to the large amount of water needed and the need to recover the amines via evaporation of the water. Large amounts of water are required because of the mechanism, corrosiveness, and air flow problems created by the use of monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), or methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). Also, these amines are volatile and losses can occur due to evaporation. Thus, these amines lack thermal stability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"sub":["2","2 ","2","2 ","2 ","2 "],"sup":["1","2","3"],"i":"J. Org.

The immobilization of these amines on supports, via evaporation of the amines into the supports' pores, increases their thermal stability and thus reduces evaporation losses. Nevertheless, the cost of these sorbents is too high for large-scale applications in utility industries such as electrical generation, in part because these sorbents adsorb acid anhydrides at a 2:1 molar ratio of amine to anhydride. Also, these sorbents operate only at 25\u00b0 C. and are thus limited for other applications.","Some work has been done in attempting to improve upon current sorbents' limitations by the preparation of less costly immobilized secondary amine sorbents, as reported in M. L. Gray, Y. Soong, K. J. Champagne, H. Pennline, J. P. Baltrus, R. W. Stevens, Jr., R. Khatri, S. S. C. Chuang, and T. Filburn, \u201cImproved Immobilized Carbon Dioxide Capture Sorbents,\u201d 86 (14), 1449-1455 (2005). While the sorbents seemed to have a stronger adsorption capability for CO, their loading capacity decreased with each adsorption\/regeneration cycle.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,908,497 awarded to Sirwardane on Jun. 21, 2005 discloses carbon dioxide-specific sorbents fabricated by placing amines and\/or ethers between the unit layers of an inert substrate's lattice.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,582,498 awarded to Sass, et al. on Jun. 24, 2003 discloses a method of separating carbon dioxide from a gas using a fluid dynamic instability. The method includes the use of a tertiary amine, methyldiethanolamine (MDEA).","U.S. Pat. No. 6,547,854 awarded to Gray, et al. on Apr. 15, 2003 discloses carbon dioxide-specific sorbents fabricated by chemically bonding amines to inert substrates.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,364,938; 5,876,488; and 5,492,683 awarded to Birbara, et al. on Apr. 2, 2002; Mar. 2, 1999; and Feb. 20, 1996, respectively, disclose carbon dioxide-specific sorbents fabricated by chemically bonding amines to inert and polymeric substrates.","None of the aforementioned patents discloses a flue gas stream sorbent which can adsorb COat a 1:1 molar ratio of amine to CO.","None of the aforementioned patents and articles discloses an immobilized tertiary amine-based sorbent which can adsorb carbon dioxide at temperatures in excess of 25\u00b0 C.","None of the aforementioned patents and articles discloses a chemically bound tertiary amine-based sorbent which can adsorb carbon dioxide at temperatures in excess of 25\u00b0 C.","In addition, none of the aforementioned patents disclose a flue gas stream sorbent for acid anhydrides which can be used in a system open to the environment.","A need exists in the art for sorbents which can adsorb COat higher COto sorbent molar ratios. A need also exists in the art for acid anhydride sorbents with greater thermal stability that can thus adsorb COat temperatures significantly above 25\u00b0 C. Finally, a need exists in the art for acid anhydride sorbents which can be used in open systems.","It is an object of the present invention to provide sorbents for acid anhydrides in flue gases that overcomes many of the disadvantages of the prior art.","Another object of the present invention is to provide an amine-based acid anhydride sorbent with a greater temperature range for acid anhydride adsorption. A feature of the invention is that the sorbents have greater thermal stability. An advantage of the invention is greater cost-effectiveness.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide an amine-based sorbent which retains its amines at higher temperatures. A feature of this invention is that in one invented class of amines, the polymer-immobilized amines, the amines have high boiling points or are solids. Another feature is that in the other class of amine sorbents, the polymer-bound sorbents, the amine is chemically bound to the support material. An advantage of these two features is that the sorbents can be used with little or no evaporation loss of the amine. This results in lower costs.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an amine-based sorbent which adsorbs acid anhydrides in a 1:1 molar ratio of amine to acid anhydride. A feature of the invention is that tertiary amines are utilized in both classes of amine-based sorbents. An advantage of this feature is that a bicarbonate is formed. Another advantage is that less amine is needed to adsorb the acid anhydrides. This also results in lower costs.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide an amine-based sorbent which can be employed in environmentally open systems. A feature of this invention is that both polymer-immobilized amine sorbents and polymer bound sorbents retain their amines after exposure to anhydride. An advantage of this feature is a broader applicability of the sorbents and simpler systems for containment of the sorbents, resulting in lower costs.","Briefly, the invention provides polymer-immobilized tertiary amine-based sorbents for the adsorption of acid anhydrides in effluent gas streams.","The invention also provides polymer-bound tertiary amine-based sorbents for the adsorption of acid anhydrides in effluent gas streams.","The inventors have found two new classes of new amine-based sorbents for the removal of acid anhydrides from effluent gases. Target acid anhydrides, but are not limited to, CO, SO, and NO.","One class of sorbents has tertiary amines immobilized in the pores of polymer substrate supports wherein the support material to amine molar ratio is 5:1. This first class is depicted in . The second class of sorbents is defined as amines chemically bonded to the surface of polymeric substrates, and thus are amine-functional polymeric sorbents. A depiction of this second class of sorbents is .","A salient feature of the invention is that both classes of sorbents adsorb acid anhydrides in a 1:1 molar ratio. A second salient feature is that both classes of sorbents can adsorb acid anhydrides at temperatures above 25\u00b0 C., and at least as high as 85\u00b0 C.","Immobilized Amine Sorbent Detail","The amines for the invented immobilized amine-based sorbents include, but are not limited to, 1,8 Diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene (DBU); 1,3,4,6,7,8-Hexahydro-2H-pyrimido[1,2,-a]pyrimidine (TBD); and N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine. As depicted in , these amines, designated as element , are contained on a support material  via evaporation of the amines into the support materials' pores. The amines do not chemically react with the support material but are enclosed by the support material. The support material is a polymeric material selected from a group consisting of polyethers, polystyrenes, siloxanes, and polyacrylates, or combinations thereof. The support material can be a copolymer, e.g., styrene and chloromethyl styrene. The immobilized amines can be evenly and consistently deposited upon a support material. The molar ratio of amine in the sorbents to support material is 1:5 or about 16.7 wt. amine.","Since DBU and other tertiary amine-based sorbents have the stoichiometric capability of capturing COat a 1:1 molar ratio and have greater thermal stability due to higher melting and boiling points, the cost and efficiency of these tertiary amine sorbents can offer considerable improvements, and make them feasible for use in large-scale CO-generating operations. A typical flue gas stream from a power plant consists of 10-15% CO, 10-15% water, 20-50 ppm SO, 10-20 ppm NOand air. These amines can be immobilized in the pores of polymeric supports or even chemically bound directly to the polymers, the later depicted in .","These tertiary amine systems can also be used for the removal of other acid anhydrides such as SOand NOfrom effluent gas streams. This has been shown with acyclic amines in A. Diaf and E. J. Beckman, \u201cThermally Reversible Polymeric Sorbents for Acid Gases, IV. Affinity Tuning for the Selective Dry Sorption of NO25 (1), 89-96 (1995).","For this invention, two commercially available polymers have been used to fabricate the polymer-immobilized amine-based sorbents. These are Dialon\u00aeHP2MG, a polymethylmethylacrylate (PMMA) (Mitsubishi Chemicals, Chesapeake, Va.), and Macronet MN-200 polystyrene (Purolite, Bala Cynwyd, Pa.). Generally, the resultant surface areas (e.g. the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller surface area, or BET surface area) of the invented amine sorbents are between approximately 100 meters squared per gram (m\/g) and 350 m\/g. Untreated polymeric supports have BET surface areas of from about 500 m\/g to 600 m\/g.","Untreated polymeric supports have typical particle sizes with diameters ranging from about 125 mesh to 130 mesh. For Macronet MN-200, the pore volume is about 1.0 mL\/g and a particle size of 16 mesh to 50 mesh or between 0.3 millimeter (mm) and 1.2 mm. For Dialon\u00ae HP2MG (PMMA) the pore volume is 1.2 milliliters per gram (mL\/g) and the average pore radius is 170 \u212b and the particle size>250 microns (\u03bcm). Table 1 infra has surface areas and pore volumes for three polymer-immobilized amine-based sorbents using PMMA.","An increased DBU to PMMA ratio in a polymer-immobilized DBU-based-sorbent results in increasingly smaller surface areas and pore volumes, and increasingly larger COloading capability. A suitable DBU:PMMA ratio is selected from between 2.5:1 and 5:1.","Both classes of sorbents can be used in the temperature range from 20\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C.","The temperature range is suitable even for the immobilized amine-based sorbents inasmuch the amines used therein have high melting and boiling points, e.g., N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine, b. p. 240\u00b0 C.; DBU, b. p. 115\u00b0 C.(80\u00b0 C. to 83\u00b0 C. at 0.6 mm Hg) and a flash point of 110\u00b0 C.; and TBD, m. p. 125\u00b0 C.-130\u00b0 C. These moieties have very low vapor pressures under normal barometric conditions. Other tertiary amines such as the imines, amidines, and guanidines typically have high molecular weights and hydrogen bonding which in turn yield high boiling points and concomitant low vapor pressures. This minimizes vaporization of amines from the immobilized amine-based sorbents as discussed infra and as demonstrated in Table 2 infra via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Performance of PMMA\/DBU Immobilized Sorbents at 25\u00b0 C."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Mole CO"]},{"entry":[{},"Wt.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out with a PHI 5600ci ESCA instrument (Physical Electronics USA, Chanhassen, Minn.) using monochromatic Al K\u03b1 x-rays. The pass energy of the analyzer was 58.7 electron volts (eV) for high-resolution scans. Relative elemental concentrations on the surface of the sorbents were calculated by measuring peak areas in the high-resolution spectra and then converting to atomic concentrations using instrument manufacturer-provided sensitivity factors. The relative elemental concentration for N is given in Table 2 infra as XPS N1s.","Under these conditions the levels of N contained in the chemically attached amines can be determined for each of the COcapture sorbents. XPS analyses carried out before and after use of an amine-based sorbent reveal the extent of retention of the amine, especially for the immobilized amine-based sorbents, wherein the amines are contained within the pores of the polymeric support material and therefore below the surface of the polymer. The XPS N1s values thus measure the thermal stability of the immobilized amine-based sorbents.","For example, sorbent  (15 g of DBU in 75 g of PMMA) has an XPS N1S value of 0.9 before any usage. After four cycles of adsorption\/desorption at 25\u00b0 C., one cycle of adsorption\/desorption at 45\u00b0 C., and one adsorption\/desorption cycle at 65\u00b0 C., the XPS N1s value is 1.0. Over the course of six cycles including two at elevated temperatures, the DBU remained within the pores of the PMMA demonstrating the thermal stability of this sorbent. In general, this is true for all of the XPS N1s sets of values shown infra.","The thermal stability of the immobilized amine-base sorbents is due in large part to the amines' high boiling points as discussed supra.","Table 2 displays masses, temperatures, XPS, and COadsorption data for 13 different amine-based sorbents. Sorbents  through  and  through  are polymer-immobilized, and sorbents  through  are polymer-bound. For some of the polymer-immobilized sorbents, the mass ratios of polymer to amine are given. The XPS values give a relative measure of the nitrogen content of the sorbents. Each XPS entry was obtained before the sorption data in the same row. The mols of COadsorbed per Kg of sorbent are given for previously unused sorbent and sorbent which has been regenerated by heating to 90\u00b0 C.","According to Table 2, the new immobilized and chemically bound amine-based sorbents have COcapture capacities of 2.9 to 5.7 mol of COper kilogram of sorbent and are thermally stable over as many as six test runs. The XPS N1s values indicate that the losses of nitrogen are minimal. Since the XPS N1s values are very similar before and after regeneration cycles, the amine functionality was not lost during the course of these tests.","These regenerable solid amine sorbents can capture carbon dioxide in a temperature range from of about 20\u00b0 C. to 85\u00b0 C. The capture of carbon dioxide at these elevated temperatures can create potential applications in flue gas stream clean-up since the exit temperature of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) scrubbing systems is in the range of from about 50\u00b0 C. to 70\u00b0 C.","In summary, the invented sorbents adsorb acid anhydrides at a molar ratio of 1:1 (amine to anhydride). The sorbents are thermally stable (little or no loss of amine) from 20\u00b0 C. upwards of 100\u00b0 C.","One class of sorbents employs tertiary amines, which are immobilized (polymer-immobilized) via evaporation into the pores of polymeric substrates. The second class of sorbents employs tertiary amines, imines, amidines, and guanidines, which are chemically bonded (polymer-bound) to polymeric substrates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"392pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
