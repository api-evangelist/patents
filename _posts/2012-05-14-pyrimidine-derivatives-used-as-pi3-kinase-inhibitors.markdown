compounds, either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent, with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; and uses of the new compounds, either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent, in the prophylaxis or treatment of a number of diseases, in particular, those characterized by the abnormal activity of growth factors, receptor tyrosine kinases, protein serine\/threonine kinases, G protein coupled receptors and phospholipid kinases and phosphatases.","Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) comprise a family of lipid and serine\/threonine kinases that catalyze the transfer of phosphate to the D-3\u2032 position of inositol lipids to produce phosphoinositol-3-phosphate (PIP), phosphoinositol-3,4-diphosphate (PIP) and phosphoinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP) that, in turn, act as second messengers in signaling cascades by docking proteins containing pleckstrin-homology, FYVE, Phox and other phospholipid-binding domains into a variety of signaling complexes often at the plasma membrane ((Vanhaesebroeck et al., 70:535 (2001); Katso et al., 17:615 (2001)). Of the two Class 1 PI3Ks, Class 1A PI3Ks are heterodimers composed of a catalytic p110 subunit (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4 isoforms) constitutively associated with a regulatory subunit that can be p85\u03b1, p55\u03b1, p50\u03b1, p85\u03b2 or p55\u03b3. The Class 1B sub-class has one family member, a heterodimer composed of a catalytic p110\u03b3 subunit associated with one of two regulatory subunits, p101 or p84 (Fruman et al., 67:481 (1998); Suire et al., 15:566 (2005)). The modular domains of the p85\/55\/50 subunits include Src Homology (SH2) domains that bind phosphotyrosine residues in a specific sequence context on activated receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, resulting in activation and localization of Class 1A PI3Ks. Class 1B PI3K is activated directly by G protein-coupled receptors that bind a diverse repertoire of peptide and non-peptide ligands (Stephens et al., 89:105 (1997)); Katso et al., 17:615-675 (2001)). Consequently, the resultant phospholipid products of class I PI3K link upstream receptors with downstream cellular activities including proliferation, survival, chemotaxis, cellular trafficking, motility, metabolism, inflammatory and allergic responses, transcription and translation (Cantley et al., 64:281 (1991); Escobedo and Williams, 335:85 (1988); Fantl et al., 69:413 (1992)).","In many cases, PIP2 and PIP3 recruit Akt, the product of the human homologue of the viral oncogene v-Akt, to the plasma membrane where it acts as a nodal point for many intracellular signaling pathways important for growth and survival (Fantl et al., Cell 69:413-423 (1992); Bader et al., 5:921 (2005); Vivanco and Sawyer, 2:489 (2002)). Aberrant regulation of PI3K, which often increases survival through Akt activation, is one of the most prevalent events in human cancer and has been shown to occur at multiple levels. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which dephosphorylates phosphoinositides at the 3\u2032 position of the inositol ring and in so doing antagonizes PI3K activity, is functionally deleted in a variety of tumors. In other tumors, the genes for the p110\u03b1 isoform, PIK3CA, and for Akt are amplified and increased protein expression of their gene products has been demonstrated in several human cancers. Furthermore, mutations and translocation of p85\u03b1 that serve to up-regulate the p85-p110 complex have been described in a few human cancers. Finally, somatic missense mutations in PIK3CA that activate downstream signaling pathways have been described at significant frequencies in a wide diversity of human cancers (Kang at el., 102:802 (2005); Samuels et al., 304:554 (2004); Samuels et al., 7:561-573 (2005)). These observations show that deregulation of phosphoinositol-3 kinase and the upstream and downstream components of this signaling pathway is one of the most common deregulations associated with human cancers and proliferative diseases (Parsons et al., 436:792 (2005); Hennessey at el., 4:988-1004 (2005)).","The present invention provides new phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor compounds, pharmaceutical formulations that include the compounds, methods of inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and methods of treating proliferative diseases.","In one aspect of the present invention, new phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor compounds that are pyrimidine-based compounds, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and prodrugs thereof are provided. The pyrimidine compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and prodrugs are PI3K inhibitors and are useful in the treatment of cellular proliferative diseases.","One embodiment of the invention provides a compound having Formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"41.40mm","wi":"58.34mm","file":"US08563549-20131022-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"or a stereoisomer, tautomer, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein,","W is CR, or N, wherein Ris selected from the group consisting of","(1) hydrogen,","(2) cyano,","(3) halogen,","(4) methyl,","(5) trifluoromethyl,","(6) sulfonamido;","Ris selected from the group consisting of","(1) hydrogen,","(2) cyano,","(3) nitro,","(4) halogen,","(5) substituted and unsubstituted alkyl,","(6) substituted and unsubstituted alkenyl,","(7) substituted and unsubstituted alkynyl,","(8) substituted and unsubstituted aryl,","(9) substituted and unsubstituted heteroaryl,","(10) substituted and unsubstituted heterocyclyl,","(11) substituted and unsubstituted cycloalkyl,","(12) \u2014COR,","(13) \u2014COR,","(14) \u2014CONRR,","(15) \u2014NRR,","(16) \u2014NRCOR,","(17) \u2014NRSOR,","(18) \u2014OCOR,","(19) \u2014OR,","(20) \u2014SR,","(21) \u2014SOR,","(22) \u2014SOR, and","(23) \u2014SONRR,","wherein R, and Rare independently selected from the group consisting of","(a) hydrogen,","(b) substituted or unsubstituted alkyl,","(c) substituted and unsubstituted aryl,","(d) substituted and unsubstituted heteroaryl,","(e) substituted and unsubstituted heterocyclyl, and","(f) substituted and unsubstituted cycloalkyl;","Ris selected from the group consisting","(1) hydrogen,","(2) cyano,","(3) nitro,","(4) halogen,","(5) hydroxy,","(6) amino,","(7) substituted and unsubstituted alkyl,","(8) \u2014COR, and","(9) \u2014NRCOR,","wherein R, and Rare independently selected from the group consisting of","(a) hydrogen, and","(b) substituted or unsubstituted alkyl;","Ris selected from the group consisting of","(1) hydrogen,","(2) cyano,","(3) nitro,","(4) halogen,","(5) substituted and unsubstituted alkyl,","(6) substituted and unsubstituted alkenyl,","(7) substituted and unsubstituted alkynyl,","(8) substituted and unsubstituted aryl,","(9) substituted and unsubstituted heteroaryl,","(10) substituted and unsubstituted heterocyclyl,","(11) substituted and unsubstituted cycloalkyl,","(12) \u2014COR,","(13) \u2014NRR,","(14) \u2014NRCOR,","(15) \u2014NRSOR,","(16) \u2014OR,","(17) \u2014SR,","(18) \u2014SOR,","(19) \u2014SOR, and","(20) \u2014SONRR,","wherein R, and Rare independently selected from the group consisting of","(a) hydrogen,","(b) substituted or unsubstituted alkyl,","(c) substituted and unsubstituted aryl,","(d) substituted and unsubstituted heteroaryl,","(e) substituted and unsubstituted heterocyclyl, and","(f) substituted and unsubstituted cycloalkyl; and","Ris selected from the group consisting of","(1) hydrogen, and","(2) halogen.","In another embodiment thereof, Rcomprises substituted or unsubstituted arylalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroarylalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkylalkyl, or substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclylalkyl.","In a more particular embodiment, W is CH.","In another embodiment, W is N.

A Serine\/Threonine (Ser\/Thr, or S\/T) protein kinase, termed Akt, is identified as a downstream target of PI 3-kinase. This protein kinase is recruited to the cell membrane by interaction of its pleckstrin homology domain with PI3K products, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP), and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-biphosphate (PIP), where it is activated by phosphorylation of its catalytic domain by 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent Kinase-1 (PDK-1). Akt is further activated by phosphorylation of a serine in its C-terminal hydrophobic motif by another candidate kinase (PDK-2). The activation of Akt acts downstream to regulate additional kinases many of which are implicated in cellular processes that control survival, proliferation, metabolism and growth translation. PI3K can also drive cellular processes that impact transformation, cellular proliferation, cytoskeletal rearrangement and survival through a parallel pathway that does not involve Akt (Hennessy et al., 4:988-1004 (2005)). Two of these pathways are activation of the small GTP-binding proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 and activation of the serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK). Cdc42 and Rac1, which regulate cytoskeletal movement and cell motility and can function as oncogenes when over-expressed, are also linked to the RAS pathway. Thus, PI3K activity generates 3\u2032-phosphatidylinositol lipids that act as a nodal point to stimulate a diversity of downstream signaling pathways.","That these pathways impact cellular properties proliferation, survival, motility and morphology that are often disrupted in cancer, proliferative diseases, thrombotic diseases and inflammation, among others, suggests that compounds inhibiting PI3K (and isoforms thereof) have utility, either as a single agent or in combination, in the treatment of these diseases. In cancer, deregulation of the PI3K\/Akt pathway is extensively documented, including overexpression of the PIK3CA gene, activating mutations of the PIK3CA gene, overexpression of Akt, mutations of PDK-1, and deletions\/inactivation of PTEN (Parsons et al., 436:792 (2005); Hennessy et al., 4:988 (2005); Stephens et al., 5:1 (2005); Bonneau and Longy, 16:109 (2000) and Ali et al., 91:1922 (1999)). Recent findings indicate that PIK3CA is frequently mutated (>30%) in various solid tumors in humans (Samuels and Ericson, 18:77 (2005)) and the most frequent of these mutations promote cell growth and invasion (Samuels et al., 7:561 (2005), and are transforming (Kang et al., 102:802 (2005), Zhao et al., 102:18443 (2005)). Thus, inhibitors of PI3K, particularly of the p110\u03b1 isoform encoded by PIK3CA and its mutations, will be useful in the treatment of cancers driven by these mutations and deregulations.","The present invention provides novel compounds that act as inhibitors of serine threonine kinases, lipid kinases, and, more particularly, as inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) function. The compounds provided herein can be formulated into pharmaceutical formulations that are useful in treating patients with a need for an inhibitor of PI3K, especially, in particular embodiments, to provide compositions and methods for reducing cellular proliferation and increasing cell death in the treatment of cancer.","In one aspect of the present invention, new phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor compounds, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and prodrugs thereof are provided.

Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type of genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma, mild asthma, moderate asthma, severe asthma, bronchitic asthma, exercise-induced asthma, occupational asthma and asthma induced following bacterial infection. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as \u201cwheezy infants\u201d, an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics (\u201cwheezy infant syndrome\u201d).","Compounds of the invention that are selective for one PI3 Kinase isoform (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4) over a different isoform are compounds that preferentially inhibit one isoform. For example, a compound may preferentially inhibit the alpha isoform over the gamma isoform. Alternatively, a compound may preferentially inhibit the gamma isoform over the alpha isoform.

Although trastuzumab has demonstrated durable responses in some patients expressing Her2\/neu-ErbB2, only a subset of these patients respond. Recent work has indicated that this limited response rate can be substantially improved by the combination of trastuzumab with inhibitors of PI3K or the PI3K\/AKT pathway (Chan et al., 91:187 (2005), Woods Ignatoski et al., 82:666 (2000), Nagata et al., 6:117 (2004)).","A variety of human malignancies express activating mutations or increased levels of Her1\/EGFR and a number of antibody and small molecule inhibitors have been developed against this receptor tyrosine kinase including tarceva, gefitinib and erbitux. However, while EGFR inhibitors demonstrate anti-tumor activity in certain human tumors (e.g., NSCLC), they fail to increase overall patient survival in all patients with EGFR-expressing tumors. This may be rationalized by the fact that many downstream targets of Her1\/EGFR are mutated or deregulated at high frequencies in a variety of malignancies, including the PI3K\/Akt pathway. For example, gefitinib inhibits the growth of an adenocarcinoma cell line in in vitro assays. Nonetheless, sub-clones of these cell lines can be selected that are resistant to gefitinib that demonstrate increased activation of the PI3\/Akt pathway. Downregulation or inhibition of this pathway renders the resistant sub-clones sensitive to gefitinib (Kokubo et al., 92:1711 (2005)). Furthermore, in an in vitro model of breast cancer with a cell line that harbors a PTEN mutation and over-expresses EGFR inhibition of both the PI3K\/Akt pathway and EGFR produced a synergistic effect (She et al., 8:287-297 (2005)). These results indicate that the combination of gefitinib and PI3K\/Akt pathway inhibitors would be an attractive therapeutic strategy in cancer.","The combination of AEE778 (an inhibitor of Her-2\/neu\/ErbB2, VEGFR and EGFR) and RAD001 (an inhibitor of mTOR, a downstream target of Akt) produced greater combined efficacy that either agent alone in a glioblastoma xenograft model (Goudar et al., 4:101-112 (2005)).","Anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen, inhibit breast cancer growth through induction of cell cycle arrest that requires the action of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Recently, it has been shown that activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP Kinase pathway alters the phosphorylation status of p27Kip such that its inhibitory activity in arresting the cell cycle is attenuated, thereby contributing to anti-estrogen resistance (Donovan, et al, 276:40888, 2001). As reported by Donovan at al., inhibition of MAPK signaling through treatment with MEK inhibitor reversed the aberrant phosphorylation status of p27 in hormone refractory breast cancer cell lines and in so doing restored hormone sensitivity. Similarly, phosphorylation of p27Kip by Akt also abrogates its role to arrest the cell cycle (Viglietto et al., 8:1145 (2002)). Accordingly, in one aspect, the compounds of formula (I) may be used in the treatment of hormone dependent cancers, such as breast and prostate cancers, to reverse hormone resistance commonly seen in these cancers with conventional anticancer agents.","In hematological cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), chromosomal translocation is responsible for the constitutively activated BCR-Ab1 tyrosine kinase. The afflicted patients are responsive to imatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as a result of inhibition of Ab1 kinase activity. However, many patients with advanced stage disease respond to imatinib initially, but then relapse later due to resistance-conferring mutations in the Abl kinase domain. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BCR-Ab1 employs the Ras-Raf kinase pathway to elicit its effects. In addition, inhibiting more than one kinase in the same pathway provides additional protection against resistance-conferring mutations. Accordingly, in another aspect of the invention, the compounds of formula (I) are used in combination with at least one additional agent, such as Gleevec\u00ae, in the treatment of hematological cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), to reverse or prevent resistance to at least one additional agent.","Because activation of the PI3K\/Akt pathway drives cell survival, inhibition of the pathway in combination with therapies that drive apoptosis in cancer cells, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, will result in improved responses (Ghobrial et al., 55:178-194 (2005)). As an example, combination of PI3 kinase inhibitor with carboplatin demonstrated synergistic effects in both in vitro proliferation and apoptosis assays as well as in in vivo tumor efficacy in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer (Westfall and Skinner, Mol. Cancer. Ther 4:1764-1771 (2005)).","In addition to cancer and proliferative diseases, there is accumulating evidence that inhibitors of Class 1A and 1B PI3 kinases would be therapeutically useful in others disease areas. The inhibition of p110\u03b2, the PI3K isoform product of the PIK3CB gene, has been shown to be involved in shear-induced platelet activation (Jackson et al., 11:507-514 (2005)). Thus, a PI3K inhibitor that inhibits p110\u03b2 would be useful as a single agent or in combination in anti-thrombotic therapy. The isoform p110 \u03b4 the product of the PIK3CD gene, is important in B cell function and differentiation (Clayton et al., 196:753-763 (2002)), T-cell dependent and independent antigen responses (Jou et al., 22:8580-8590 (2002)) and mast cell differentiation (Ali et al., 431:1007-1011 (2004)). Thus, it is expected that p110\u03b4-inhibitors would be useful in the treatment of B-cell driven autoimmune diseases and asthma. Finally, the inhibition of p110\u03b3, the isoform product of the PI3KCG gene, results in reduced T, but not B cell, response (Reif et al., J. Immunol. 173:2236-2240 (2004)) and its inhibition demonstrates efficacy in animal models of autoimmune diseases (Camps et al., Nature Medicine 11:936-943 (2005), Barber et al., Nature Medicine 11:933-935 (2005)).","The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one PI3K inhibitor compound (e.g., a compound of formulas (I)-(III)) together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier suitable for administration to a human or animal subject, either alone or together with other anticancer agents.","In one embodiment, the present invention provides methods of treating human or animal subjects suffering from a cellular proliferative disease, such as cancer. The present invention provides methods of treating a human or animal subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a PI3K inhibitor compound (e.g., a compound of formulas (I)-(III)), either alone or in combination with other anticancer agents.","In particular, compositions will either be formulated together as a combination therapeutic or administered separately.

The compounds of the invention can also be administered in conjunction with other anti-cancer drugs including those used in antisense and gene therapy.","As used herein, \u201climit\u201d, \u201ctreat\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d are interchangeable terms as are \u201climiting\u201d and \u201ctreating\u201d and, as used herein, include preventative (e.g., prophylactic) and palliative treatment or the act of providing preventative or palliative treatment.","The term \u201cPI3K-mediated disorder\u201d refers to a disorder that can be beneficially treated by the inhibition of PI3K.","The term \u201ccellular proliferative diseases\u201d refers to diseases including, for example, cancer, tumor, hyperplasia, restenosis, cardiac hypertrophy, immune disorder and inflammation.","The term \u201ccancer\u201d refers to cancer diseases that can be beneficially treated by the inhibition of PI3K, including, for example, lung and bronchus; prostate; breast; pancreas; colon and rectum; thyroid; liver and intrahepatic bile duct; hepatocellular; gastric; glioma\/glioblastoma; endometrial; melanoma; kidney and renal pelvis; urinary bladder; uterine corpus; uterine cervix; ovary; multiple myeloma; esophagus; acute myelogenous leukemia; chronic myelogenous leukemia; lymphocytic leukemia; myeloid leukemia; brain; oral cavity and pharynx; larynx; small intestine; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; melanoma; and villous colon adenoma.","The PI3K inhibitors of this invention, as described herein, can be administered in the form of acid addition salts. The salts are conveniently formed by reacting a compound, if basic, with a suitable acid, such as have been described above. The salts are quickly formed in high yields at moderate temperatures, and often are prepared by merely isolating the compound from a suitable acidic wash as the final step of the synthesis. The salt-forming acid is dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent, or aqueous organic solvent, such as an alkanol, ketone or ester. On the other hand, if the compound of this invention is desired in the free base form, it is isolated from a basic final wash step, according to the usual practice. A preferred technique for preparing hydrochlorides is to dissolve the free base in a suitable solvent and dry the solution thoroughly, as over molecular sieves, before bubbling hydrogen chloride gas through it. It will also be recognized that it is possible to administer amorphous forms of the PI3K inhibitors.","The invention also provides isotopically-labeled PI3K inhibitors, which are structurally identical to those disclosed above, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as H, H, C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, F and Cl, respectively. Compounds of the present invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds and of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and\/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., H, and carbon-14, i.e., C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out known or referenced procedures and by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","The compounds of the invention are useful in vitro or in vivo in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. The compounds may be used alone or in compositions together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor compound described herein formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. As used herein, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator. Other suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are described in \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,\u201d Mack Pub. Co., New Jersey, 1991, incorporated herein by reference.","The compounds of the present invention may be administered to humans and other animals orally, parenterally, sublingually, by aerosolization or inhalation spray, rectally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, bucally, or topically in dosage unit formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles as desired. Topical administration may also involve the use of transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or ionophoresis devices. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques.","Methods of formulation are well known in the art and are disclosed, for example, in Remington: , Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 19th Edition (1995). Pharmaceutical compositions for use in the present invention can be in the form of sterile, non-pyrogenic liquid solutions or suspensions, coated capsules, suppositories, lyophilized powders, transdermal patches or other forms known in the art.","Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-propanediol or 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.","In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations may also be prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions, which are compatible with body tissues.","Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.","Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and\/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, acetyl alcohol and glycerol mono stearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.","Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.","The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.","The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.","Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, EtOAc, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.","Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulations, ear drops, and the like are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.","The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.","Compositions of the invention may also be formulated for delivery as a liquid aerosol or inhalable dry powder. Liquid aerosol formulations may be nebulized predominantly into particle sizes that can be delivered to the terminal and respiratory bronchioles.","Aerosolized formulations of the invention may be delivered using an aerosol forming device, such as a jet, vibrating porous plate or ultrasonic nebulizer, preferably selected to allow the formation of an aerosol particles having with a mass medium average diameter predominantly between 1 to 5 \u03bcm. Further, the formulation preferably has balanced osmolarity ionic strength and chloride concentration, and the smallest aerosolizable volume able to deliver effective dose of the compounds of the invention to the site of the infection. Additionally, the aerosolized formulation preferably does not impair negatively the functionality of the airways and does not cause undesirable side effects.","Aerosolization devices suitable for administration of aerosol formulations of the invention include, for example, jet, vibrating porous plate, ultrasonic nebulizers and energized dry powder inhalers, that are able to nebulize the formulation of the invention into aerosol particle size predominantly in the size range from 1-5 \u03bcm. Predominantly in this application means that at least 70% but preferably more than 90% of all generated aerosol particles are within 1-5 \u03bcm range. A jet nebulizer works by air pressure to break a liquid solution into aerosol droplets. Vibrating porous plate nebulizers work by using a sonic vacuum produced by a rapidly vibrating porous plate to extrude a solvent droplet through a porous plate. An ultrasonic nebulizer works by a piezoelectric crystal that shears a liquid into small aerosol droplets. A variety of suitable devices are available, including, for example, AERONEB and AERODOSE vibrating porous plate nebulizers (AeroGen, Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.), SIDESTREAM nebulizers (Medic-Aid Ltd., West Sussex, England), PARI LC and PARI LC STAR jet nebulizers (Pari Respiratory Equipment, Inc., Richmond, Va.), and AEROSONIC (DeVilbiss Medizinische Produkte (Deutschland) GmbH, Heiden, Germany) and ULTRAAIRE (Omron Healthcare, Inc., Vernon Hills, Ill.) ultrasonic nebulizers.","Compounds of the invention may also be formulated for use as topical powders and sprays that can contain, in addition to the compounds of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons.","Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and the like. The preferred lipids are the phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott (ed.), \u201cMethods in Cell Biology,\u201d Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, 1976, p. 33 et seq.","Effective amounts of the compounds of the invention generally include any amount sufficient to detectably inhibit PI3K activity by any of the assays described herein, by, other PI3K activity assays known to those having ordinary skill in the art, or by detecting an inhibition or alleviation of symptoms of cancer. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. The therapeutically effective amount for a given situation can be readily determined by routine experimentation and is within the skill and judgment of the ordinary clinician.","According to the methods of treatment of the present invention, tumor growth is reduced or prevented in a patient such as a human or lower mammal by administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result. By a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of a compound of the invention is meant a sufficient amount of the compound to treat tumor growth, at a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts.","For purposes of the present invention, a therapeutically effective dose will generally be a total daily dose administered to a host in single or divided doses may be in amounts, for example, of from 0.001 to 1000 mg\/kg body weight daily and more preferred from 1.0 to 30 mg\/kg body weight daily. Dosage unit compositions may contain such amounts of submultiples thereof to make up the daily, close. In general, treatment regimens according to the present invention comprise administration to a patient in need of such treatment from about 10 mg to about 2000 mg of the compound(s) of this invention per day in single or multiple doses.","In another aspect of the invention, kits that include one or more compounds of the invention are provided. Representative kits include a PI3K inhibitor compound of the invention (e.g., a compound of formulas (I)-(III)) and a package insert or other labeling including directions for treating a cellular proliferative disease by administering an PI3K inhibitory amount of the compound.","The term \u201ckit\u201d as used herein comprises a container for containing the pharmaceutical compositions and may also include divided containers such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. The container can be in any conventional shape or form as known in the art which is made of a pharmaceutically acceptable material, for example a paper or cardboard box, a glass or plastic bottle or jar, a resealable bag (for example, to hold a \u201crefill\u201d of tablets for placement into a different container), or a blister pack with individual doses for pressing out of the pack according to a therapeutic schedule. The container employed can depend on the exact dosage form involved, for example a conventional cardboard box would not generally be used to hold a liquid suspension. It is feasible that more than one container can be used together in a single package to market a single dosage form. For example, tablets may be contained in a bottle which is in turn contained within a box.","An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process, recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of individual tablets or capsules to be packed or may have the size and shape to accommodate multiple tablets and\/or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses accordingly and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are individually sealed or collectively sealed, as desired, in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.","It maybe desirable to provide a written memory aid, where the written memory aid is of the type containing information and\/or instructions for the physician, pharmacist or other health care provider, or subject, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested or a card which contains the same type of information. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., as follows \u201cFirst Week, Monday, Tuesday,\u201d \u201cSecond Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . \u201d Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A \u201cdaily dose\u201d can be a single tablet or capsule or several tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day. When the kit contains separate compositions, a daily dose of one or more compositions of the kit can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of another one or more compositions of the kit can consist of several tablets or capsules.","Another specific embodiment of a kit is a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use. Preferably, the dispenser is equipped with a memory-aid, so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory-aid is a mechanical counter, which indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory-aid is a battery-powered micro-chip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout, or audible reminder signal which, for example, reads out the date that the last daily dose has been taken and\/or reminds one when the next dose is to be taken.","The kits of the present invention may also comprise, in addition to a PI3K inhibitor, one or more additional pharmaceutically active compounds. Preferably, the additional compound is another PI3K inhibitor or another compound useful to treat cancer, angiogenesis, or tumor growth. The additional compounds may be administered in the same dosage form as the PI3K inhibitor or in different dosage forms. Likewise, the additional compounds can be administered at the same time as the PI3K inhibitor or at different times.","The present invention will be understood more readily by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention.","Referring to the examples that follow, compounds of the present invention were synthesized using the methods described herein, or other methods, which are known in the art.","The compounds and\/or intermediates were characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters Millenium chromatography system with a 2695 Separation Module (Milford, Mass.).

To start the reaction, 20 \u03bcL of 6 nM PI3 kinase are added into each well followed by 20 \u03bcL of 400 nM ATP containing a trace of radiolabeled ATP and 900 nM 1-alpha-phosphatidylinositol (PI). The plates are briefly centrifuged to remove any air gap. The reaction is performed for 15 minutes and then stopped by the addition of 20 \u03bcL of 100 mM EDTA. The stopped reaction is incubated overnight at RT to allow the lipid substrate to bind by hydrophobic interaction to the surface of the flashplate. The liquid in the wells is then washed away, and the labeled substrate is detected with scintillation counting.","Assay 2: One Step Solid Phase Assay","This method is similar to Assay 1 except that the lipid substrate (1-alpha-phosphatidylinositol (PIP)) is first dissolved in a coating buffer and incubated on flashplate at room temperature overnight to allow the lipid substrate to bind by hydrophobic interaction to the surface of the flashplate. Unbound substrate is then washed away. On the day of assay, 20 \u03bcL of 6 nM PI3 kinase are added into each well followed by 20 \u03bcL of 400 nM ATP containing trace of radiolabeled ATP. Compounds are added together with enzyme and ATP to the lipid-coated plates. The plates are briefly centrifuged to remove any air gap. The reaction is performed for two to three hours. The reaction is stopped by addition of 20 \u03bcL of 100 mM EDTA or by immediate plate washing. Phosphorylated lipid substrate is detected by scintillation counting.","Assay 3: ATP Depletion Assay","Compounds to be tested are dissolved in DMSO and directly distributed into a black 384-well plate at 1.25 \u03bcL per well. To start the reaction, 25 \u03bcL of 10 nM PI3 kinase and 5 \u03bcg\/mL 1-alpha-phosphatidylinositol (PI) are added into each well followed by 25 \u03bcL of 2 \u03bcM ATP. The reaction is performed until approx 50% of the ATP is depleted, and then stopped by the addition of 25 \u03bcL of KinaseGlo solution purchased from Promega. The stopped reaction is incubated for 5 minutes and the remaining ATP is then detected via luminescence.","In this method, an assay for measuring the PI3K-mediated pSer473-Akt status after treatment with representative inhibitor compounds of the invention is described.","A2780 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. Cells were plated in the same medium at a density of 15,000 cells per well into 96 well tissue culture plates, with outside wells vacant, and allowed to adhere overnight.","Test compounds supplied in DMSO were diluted further into DMSO at 500 times the desired final concentrations before dilution into culture media to 2 times the final concentrations. Equal volumes of 2\u00d7 compounds were added to the cells in 96 well plates and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for one hour. The media and compounds were then removed, the plates chilled and cells lysed in a lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. After thorough mixing, lysates were transferred to both pSer473Akt and total Akt assay plates from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD), and incubated overnight with shaking at 4\u00b0 C. The plates were washed with 1\u00d7MSD wash buffer and the captured analytes detected with secondary antibodies. After incubation with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1-2 hours, the plates were washed again and 1.5\u00d7 concentration of Read Buffer T (MSD) was added to the wells.","The assays were read on a SECTOR Imager 6000 instrument (Meso Scale Discovery). Ratios of the signal from pSer473Akt and total Akt assays were used to correct for any variability and the percent inhibition of pSer473Akt from the total signal seen in cells treated with compound versus DMSO alone was calculated and used to determine ECvalues for each compound.","A2780 ovarian cancer cells obtained from George Coukos (Fox Chase Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa.) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum with 1% glutamine. Cells were propagated as recommended by the Dr. Coukos and colleagues. Female nu\/nu mice (8-12 weeks old, 20-25 g, Charles River) were used for all in vivo pharmacology studies. The mice were housed and maintained in accordance with state and federal guidelines for the humane treatment and care of laboratory animals and received food and water ad libitum. Cancer cells were harvested from mid-log phase cultures using trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen, Inc.). Five million cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of each mouse. Compound treatment was initiated when tumor size reached to 300-400 mmfor PK\/PD studies and 200-300 mmfor efficacy studies. All compound treatment was administrated orally. Tumor volumes were determined by using StudyDirector software.","For in vivo target modulation PK\/PD time-course studies, tumor tissues were resected from individual mice at different time points ranging from 30 min to 36 hr after a single dose of compound (60 or 100 mg\/kg) or vehicle was administrated orally. For PK\/PD dose-dependent studies, tumor-bearing mice were given a single oral dose of compound at different concentrations (10, 30, 60 and 100 mg\/kg or vehicle) and tumors were resected at 10 hr or 24 hr after dosing. Blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture using a syringe primed with heparin sulfate. Resected tumors were snap frozen on dry ice and pulverized using a liquid nitrogen-cooled cryomortar and pestle, and lysed in cold cell extraction buffer (Bio source) containing protease inhibitor tablet (Complete; EDTA-free, Amersham). Supernatants were taken after centrifugation of tumor lysates at 300\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C. and the protein concentration in each supernatant was determined by BCA (BioRad). An equal amount of protein from each tumor lysate was loaded onto 10% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen), for sodiumdoceylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) after which proteins were transferred from the gel onto PVDF membrane. Membranes were probed with antibodies that recognize phosphoAktor phosphoAkt(Cell Signaling) followed by secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP(Amersham). Positive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with X-ray film. Similar procedures were used to determine total AKT in the same tumor lysates to serve as normalization for total protein in each determination. The density of the positive band on the X-ray film was scanned and the target modulation for each compound was expressed as percentage inhibition by each compound compared to vehicle treatment. A rank order (<50%, 50-75%, >75%, as compared to vehicle treatment) of target inhibition is used to present compound target modulation activity.","For efficacy studies, A2780 cancer cells (5\u00d710in 100 \u03bcl of DMEM culture medium) were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of each nu\/nu mouse. When average tumor sizes reached about 200 mmmice were dosed orally daily (q.d.) or twice a day (b.i.d.) at three different compound concentrations (typically at 10, 30 and 100 mg\/kg) in 100 \u03bcl incipient. Tumor growth and animal body weight was measured twice weekly with daily clinical observation to monitor potential toxicities related to the treatment. Typically, studies were terminated when tumors in vehicle-treated group reached 2500 mmor adverse clinical effects were observed. Activation of the PI3K signaling pathway results in the phosphorylation of the downstream signaling molecule Akt at Serand\/or Thr. Compound modulation of Aktphosphorylation was examined in A2780 xenograft tumors at time points ranging from 30 min to 36 hr after a single compound dose at 60 or 100 mg\/kg. Table 2 summarizes modulation of AKTphosphorylation by representative compounds at 8 hr or 10 hr time points. Percentage inhibition was ranked as <50%, 50-75%, and >75%, as compared to vehicle treatment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1042","num":"1040"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Modulation of Aktphosphorylation by representative"},{"entry":"pyrimidine compounds of the invention."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Compound","60 mg\/kg","100 mg\/kg"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"\u200291 at 8 hr",{},">50%"]},{"entry":[{},"183 at 8 hr",{},"50-75%"]},{"entry":[{},"103 at 8 hr",{},"<50%"]},{"entry":[{},"10 at 10 hr",">75%",">75%"]},{"entry":[{},"84 at 10 hr","50-75%"]},{"entry":[{},"76 at 10 hr",">75%",">75%"]},{"entry":[{},"66 at 10 hr","<50%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Efficacy of Compound 91 was tested in the A2780 tumor xenograft model. Mice bearing A2780 tumors received oral administration of Compound 91 twice daily at 10 and 60 mg\/kg. Tumor growth inhibition (50%) was observed at 60 mg\/kg treatment, while at 10 mg\/kg no inhibitory activity was observed ().","The modest tumor growth inhibition by Compound 91 at 60 mg\/kg q.d. was due to its short-lived target modulation (50% inhibition lasted for 8 hr). Therefore, antitumor efficacy of three other compounds (Compound 10, Compound 76, and Compound 66), that demonstrated longer inhibition of Akt(>50% inhibition>10 hr) in A2780 tumors were evaluated in A2780 model. Compounds were orally administrated daily when tumor sizes reached to about 200 mm. Compound 10 demonstrated a dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition: 40% at 30 mg\/kg, 70% at 60 mg\/kg and tumor growth stasis at 100 mg\/kg (). A similar dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition was observed with Compound 76 treatment at 30 and 60 mg\/kg in the A2780 tumor model () while Compound 84 was found to possess weaker antitumor activity (<50% TGI at 60 mg\/kg) ().","Antitumor activity of Compound 10 was also evaluated at more frequent dosing regimen (b.i.d). As shown in , Compound 10 demonstrated a significant antitumor activity at 30 mg\/kg when orally dosed b.i.d. Notably, tumor growth inhibition at 30 mg\/kg b.i.d. was more potent than when dosed on a schedule at an equivalent daily dose (60 mg\/kg, ). The compounds were well tolerated in this study. This result indicated that a sustained but less profound target inhibition (covering the whole dosing period, but with <75% target inhibition) in A2780 tumors by Compound 10 was able to induce significant antitumor efficacy.","While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","The ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit cellular proliferation were determined by using Cell Titer Glo, a commercially available assay from Promega Corporation. A2780 ovarian cancer cells were seeded in TC treated 96-well plates at a density of 1,000 per well in DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% Sodium Pyruvate, and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin for a minimum of 2 hrs prior to addition of compound. For each concentration of test compound, 2 \u03bcl (500\u00d7) aliquots of compound or 100% DMSO diluted in 500 \u03bcl of culture medium for 2\u00d7 concentration then diluted 1\u00d7 on the Cells. Cells were incubated for 72 hrs at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO. After the 72 hour incubation, Cell Titer Glo reagent is added to determine number of viable cells remaining after exposure to the compound, and the ECvalue was calculated. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis. USA). Each experimental condition was performed in duplicate.
