{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/511,890 entitled \u201cVisualization of Ad-Hoc Network Nodes\u201d and filed on the same day as this application. The disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates generally to communication networks and more particularly (but not exclusively) to representing ad-hoc network nodes, their capabilities, their consumption of network services, and their geographic locations in a display.","The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.","In military network-centric operations (NCO), it is highly desirable for communications and\/or weapon systems to perform effectively under difficult conditions, and particularly under battle conditions. Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) can be extremely flexible and are often characterized by a significant amount of mobility and geographical movement. Because MANET nodes are mobile, however, the topology of a MANET network may change quickly and unpredictably. It can be extremely difficult to visualize trends and to spot potential trouble in a MANET in real time. Planning and management of mobile ad-hoc networks becomes even more complicated for a network-of-networks, in which a plurality of different network systems may be used.","The present disclosure, in some implementations, is directed to a method of managing a network including a plurality of nodes. The nodes are displayed, in a pictorial display, relative to a current geographic location of the nodes. The method includes modifying, via the display and via the network, one or more capabilities of one of the nodes. The one of the nodes is an ad-hoc node.","Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.","The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.","Although various implementations of the present disclosure are described with reference to network-centric operations (NCO) and military applications, the disclosure is not so limited. The disclosure may be implemented relative to many different networks and network-centric environments, including but not limited to various enterprise systems and non-military applications. Further, the disclosure may be implemented in relation to networks including nodes other than or in addition to mobile ad-hoc nodes. Thus the disclosure can be implemented in relation to various networks including stationary nodes and\/or mobile (but not necessarily ad-hoc) nodes. Additionally, although implementations of the disclosure are described with reference to a testing, planning and demonstration environment, the disclosure is not so limited. Implementations also are contemplated in relation to networks which are not included in a testing environment.","A system for managing a communications network in accordance with some implementations of the present disclosure is indicated by reference number  in . The system  is used for managing a communications network indicated generally by reference number . The network  includes a plurality of nodes , one of which is referred to as and includes the management system . In the present exemplary configuration, the network  includes a physical simulation network  that may be used to plan, test and\/or demonstrate various systems for a typical battle space at a plurality of levels. The simulation network  may be, e.g., LabNet by Boeing. Nodes  also may together form one or more networks, and in such cases the network  may be referred to as a network-of-networks. A given node  of the network  may be real (i.e., live), virtual or constructive. A real or live node may be formed when a human operates hardware, e.g., when a soldier operates a wireless telephone. A virtual node is formed, e.g., when a human operating a workstation controls software to emulate a live node. A constructive node is formed, e.g., when a live node is emulated entirely by software execution as further described below.","The nodes  may be fixed, mobile and\/or ad-hoc nodes. Communication between mobile nodes in a battle space typically relies on terrestrial and\/or air\/space, wired and\/or wireless communication modes using equipment such as radios, radio systems, beyond-line-of-sight terminals, satellites, routers, relays and\/or switches for the transport of data bits from one user platform (i.e., end node) to another. Exemplary nodes  of the network  include fixed nodes , land mobile nodes , and air mobile nodes . Nodes  also include sea\/sub-sea nodes , which in the present configuration are live nodes. It should be understood that other or additional types of nodes may be included in the network  and managed in accordance with implementations of the disclosure.","The network  may include, in addition to the network , other real physical network(s) which may include real routers, real network management system(s), and live nodes. The network  also may include one or more distributed simulation systems which may be used, as further described below, to represent various real and virtual nodes, and constructive nodes modeled in real time by the system , on real physical network(s).","The management system  may be used to manage the real network , e.g., while simultaneously managing a simulated network and\/or network-of-networks that are part of a war game, experiment, exercise or demonstration that involves virtual nodes. The system  can be used to manipulate the network  to detect and address less-than-perfect communication from a variety of simulated effects, e.g., terrain, weather, actions of adversaries, and\/or unintended misconfiguration of the network .","The management system  can be used, e.g., for health management of the network . In some implementations and as further described below, network health and status of live and virtual nodes  of a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) may be dynamically displayed on a geographical background at a user-selected display scale. In some implementations, the management system  may be used to protect the network  against various types of system attacks, including but not limited to viruses, Trojans, worms, polymorphic worms, and spam. In some implementations, an attack generator may be used for purposes of testing and\/or demonstrations. In the exemplary system  shown in , a network traffic generator subsystem may be used to generate a denial-of-service (DOS) attack in the network  or a sub-network thereof. As further described below, a network restore subsystem can detect the DOS attack, filter packets causing the denial of service, and restore the affected network to its normal operating bandwidth.","Net-centric interoperability of live and virtual nodes  can be provided, where live nodes  register with a mobile ad-hoc registry (further described below) to announce level(s) of interoperability possessed by the nodes . The management system  includes a plurality of subsystems  configured with hardware and\/or software for performing various functions relative to network nodes  (e.g., routers, switches, live nodes, virtual nodes, constructive nodes, etc.) managed by the system . A logical simulation subsystem  includes a 2-D logical visualizer . A visualization subsystem  includes a geo-spatial information subsystem (GIS) 3-D visualization module  and a user GUI (graphical user interface) subsystem . The subsystem  is configured to provide a visualization of nodes  of the network  on a geographical background. The user GUI subsystem  is configured to allow a user to interact with the visualization and with the management system .","A network performance subsystem  is configured to monitor health and performance of the network . A mobile ad-hoc registry subsystem  is configured to register nodes  joining the network  and to record, in a registry , levels of interoperability of a node  and capabilities of applications available on a node .","A network traffic generator subsystem  is configured to generate real network traffic to selected segment(s) of the network . A network restore subsystem  is configured to detect a network traffic problem and restore network communication. A master control module  is configured to determine data flow and protocol(s) of data transfer among subsystems . The system  may obtain data pertaining to network health of the network  at predefined time(s) and for location(s) of various nodes of the network . Such health data may be stored in a configuration database . Initial configuration data for various tools of the management system , including but not limited to configuration data for the subsystems , may also be stored in the configuration database . A GIS database subsystem  is configured to store digital terrain elevation data (DTED) and imagery data.","During operation of the system , the network performance, mobile ad-hoc registry, network traffic generator, and network restore subsystems , , , and  are included in the management system virtual node which communicates with the physical network . The management system  multicasts entity state protocol data units (PDUs) to the physical simulation network . In such manner, the system  can send control information to a selected node  as further described below. Various subsystems  shall now be described in greater detail.","Logical Simulation Subsystem","The logical simulation subsystem  acts as a central logical simulation subsystem, e.g., for common planning using the management system . The logical simulation subsystem  models constructive nodes and simulates live, virtual, and constructive nodes  on the physical network . The logical simulation subsystem  includes one or more application programming interfaces (APIS) for interfacing with source data coming to it in protocol, which may include but are not necessarily limited to distributed interactive simulation (DIS), higher-language architecture (HLA), and real data. A DIS interface listens for DIS entity state data through a port. A HLA interface listens for HLA entity state data through a different port. An IP network emulator (IPNE) interface intercepts real data before forwarding it to an appropriate IP address on the physical network .","The logical simulation subsystem  receives data from various sources and protocols, e.g., for use in illustrating a scenario to be demonstrated. The subsystem  receives precise participant location and identification information (PPLI) entity state data from nodes  via DIS protocol. PPLI entity state data is also received from container nodes for the subsystems , ,  and . The logical simulation subsystem  also receives real data from each node  being simulated and from the system  virtual node . The logical simulation subsystem  forwards real data to target node(s) on the physical simulation network .","The logical simulation subsystem  models constructive nodes using a variety of models, including but limited to antennae, radios, routers, switches, relays, etc. Such constructive nodes can number in the thousands and can be modeled in essentially real time. The logical simulation subsystem  can simulate live, virtual, and constructive nodes on the physical simulation network . Data pertaining to line of sight (LOS), power and range between two nodes  is received in the logical simulation subsystem . LOS calculations are performed in the visualization subsystem , although in some implementations, calculation of line-of-sight (LOS) may be performed in the logical simulation subsystem .","When the logical simulation subsystem  completes logical modeling for a node , the subsystem  outputs node data to the visualization subsystem  via the master control module .

Link data between nodes of similar communication subsystem type at time T may also be visualized. Alternatively or additionally, and as further described below, applications capability(s) of a node  and\/or interoperability information, including a level of interoperability of a node , may be visualized. Network health data for the network  may also be shown using the visualization subsystem .","The visualization subsystem  receives location data from the logical simulation subsystem , or through the master control module , to display 2-D and\/or 3-D views of the network . A 2-D view may represent a functional topology of the network , including a network health management representation. A 3-D view may include a geographical background and\/or interoperability levels and\/or application capabilities of the node(s) . The visualization subsystem  queries the mobile ad-hoc registry subsystem  for node interoperability levels and application capabilities.","Network health data can come to the visualization subsystem  via notification and\/or request. The master control module  may query the network performance module  for the latest network health data, or may request to be notified if a network issue is detected at a node  or on a path on the network .","The visualization subsystem  displays a 3D geographic background that can cover all node  locations. Such a background may be provided from beginning to end of a demonstration via the system . An icon for each node  is displayed on top of the geographical background at an appropriate moving speed. The visualization subsystem  displays potential lines of communication between assets of the network  which are capable of communicating with one another. Various levels of network performance may be differentiated, e.g., by a color coding scheme (green, yellow, and red) in 2-D. The visualization subsystem  displays an interoperability level for a node  when requested by a user of the system . The visualization subsystem  provides for human interaction with the system  through the user GUI subsystem . For example, a mouse hover may be activated to display details as to a node, or the user may right-click to select displayable attributes of a node.","As further described below, the visualization subsystem  provides a capability to pan, zoom in, and\/or zoom out. Various specialized looks for a view may be available to a user through various on-screen \u201cbuttons\u201d displayed by the GUI subsystem .","The visualization subsystem  identifies a node and\/or a path between two nodes relative to which a network health issue is detected, e.g., when a network health measure exceeds or falls below a threshold level or there is loss of communication. The visualization subsystem  may zoom automatically to such a trouble spot.","The visualization module  may be implemented using a programmer-enhanced COTS base. Such COTS tool may be, e.g., ESRI or Arc Engine\u2122 on Windows platform, with programming languages Visual C++ or VB. The geographical database  may be, e.g., a personal geographic database (Microsoft\u00ae Access). In some implementations, ArcSDE\u2122 may be used to act as a gateway into an Oracle\u00ae database and geographic files. Geographic data may also be provided in real time via ArcWebServices\u2122. ESRI includes three protocol options for receiving input location data: DIS data from the physical network , regular data through sockets of the logical simulation subsystem , and Tracking Server\u2122 in the visualization module .","Request and return of interoperability data from the mobile ad-hoc registry subsystem  is performed via socket protocol. Request and return of network health data from the network performance subsystem  is performed via SNMP protocol. Notification when new network health data is available from the network performance subsystem , or when a defined network health problem is detected, occurs via SNMP interface. When such event occurs, the visualization subsystem  can call procedure(s) in the network performance subsystem  to get network health data for all network nodes or for a problematic node and\/or path. When a communications (COMM) link is lost, a database trigger may call a pop-up window to display a loss of COMM link notification to the visualization subsystem , and invoke red-lining properties of the visualization subsystem  to zoom to the trouble node(s).

One type of capability that may be included in the registry  is referred to as a LIINCO level. \u201cLIINCO\u201d is an abbreviation for \u201clevels of information interoperability for network-centric operations\u201d. Exemplary LIINCO levels are indicated generally in  by reference number . In some implementations, a LIINCO level represents a level of interoperability at which a node is capable of performing in relation to other node(s) in a network. For example, a capability by a node for performing hypermedia transfer is represented in  by a LIINCO level . A capability by a node for performing instant messaging is represented by a LIINCO level , and so on. The LIINCO levels shown in  represent a plurality of different capabilities that may be utilized in various ways by various nodes.","In some implementations, two or more types of data may be collected from an end node  and stored in the registry  when the node joins the network . Specifically and for example, one or more LIINCO levels and one or more applications capabilities of the node  are collected and stored in the registry . Applications capabilities may include, e.g., one or more capabilities to meet a mission requirement that the node entity can provide, such as \u201cfire weapons\u201d, \u201ctrack data\u201d, and\/or \u201cjam network traffic\u201d.","The capability registry  is connected with the physical network . When a node that is equipped with a \u201ccapability\u201d client enters the network , the node registers its LIINCO level(s) and its application capability(s) in the registry . The registry database  includes LIINCO and application capability data for all registered nodes . It should be noted that in some implementations, other or additional node information and\/or criteria could be stored in the registry  and used by the management system  for displaying and\/or modifying nodes . It also should be noted that when a node  leaves the network , the registry  may retain the LIINCO and application capability data for that node.

It will be understood by those knowledgeable in the art that many and various configurations of computers, processors, memory, storage devices, communication devices, etc., could be used to implement systems such as the management system .","A conceptual diagram of one implementation of various software components of the management system  is indicated generally in  by reference number . A GIS, web-enabled GUI  is configured to provide a 3-D GIS-based graphical display and menus. A supporting GIS database  is, e.g., SQL-based and may be extended with additional attributes (e.g., rows and\/or columns) as desired to contain information specific to the management system .","As further described below, the GUI  provides a display  as well as display menus and tools for manipulating an eye point of a 3-D earth map view (using, e.g., zoom, pan, tilt, etc.). The GUI  also makes available means (e.g., buttons) for activating additional services specific to the system , which may be linked directly into the display application or launched via a stand-alone separate process.","Network Emulation","Network emulation  may be used to provide virtual network device nodes, to augment the physical network . Virtual nodes may serve a plurality of purposes, e.g., emulating RF network devices attached to simulated vehicles, and\/or shadowing real network  nodes  desired to be represented in the configuration database  (shown in ). Communications system data for such uses may be stored in a network emulation database .","It should be noted that through the use of network emulation, network device identification and performance data can be joined with geo-location data. For network devices emulated as being attached to mobile assets, geo-location data is provided, e.g., by incoming data from an external vehicle motion simulation via a DIS protocol interface. In such manner, specific network device IDs may be associated with specific DIS entity IDs. Referring to , for virtual nodes acting as shadows of real nodes  of the physical simulation network , the configuration database  may also be used to store values representing the desired fixed geographic locations of such nodes as may be desired for a demonstration scenario. Thus, all network nodes may have a geo-location value (dynamic via DIS, or static) as attributes within the configuration database . The logical simulation subsystem  can be tasked to perform various analyses of the network  and add additional information to the configuration database . An API mechanism may be used to export a total set of data to the visualization system  for further use, including but not limited to graphical display.","Simulated Entities","Referring to , mobile node assets and host systems (e.g., ground vehicles, aircraft, etc.) to which network devices are attached may be simulated using software  and may communicate with other network elements via DIS protocol messages. DIS messages may inform interested receivers as to vehicle identification, location, orientation, and health (e.g., damage).","In some implementations, simulation of mobile systems is primarily constructive. A simulation software framework, e.g., a software program by The Boeing Company, Chicago, Ill., may be used to provide constructive entities. In some implementations, a demonstration configuration may allow the addition of virtual simulation models and live simulation (e.g. surrogate, miniature, etc.) systems where available.","In one implementation, a demonstration network node may host an instance of a capability server . The capability server  may be used in augmenting simulated entities system(s)  to perform registration interactions to populate the capability registry database  (shown in ). The main application framework for the system  may include a capability to request node registry data (e.g., node ID information, applications capability(s), and LIINCO level(s)) from the capability server  to add to configuration database  content. Capability registry information may be available for selective display by a user as a part of the various attributes of a selected node.","The management system  can be used to monitor various network paths and end nodes for connectivity and other performance and health status indications for immediate network commander awareness and visibility to mobile network node issues. In some configurations, a network health monitoring tool , e.g., AppCritical by Apparent Networks, may be configured to monitor selected network nodes  and generate triggers to initiate notifications of network issues to the configuration database .","In Operation","When in use, the management system  can provide 3-D visualization of a mobile network, for example, as shown in . A display  includes a geographical background  relative to which a plurality of fixed and mobile network nodes  and communication paths  between nodes  are geo-located in essentially real time. For a node  that is \u201cattached\u201d to a mobile system (e.g. Humvee, UAV, ship, fighter, etc.), a symbol for the node may be representative of the vehicle. For nodes such as routers and switches in a fixed location such as within a building, a symbol representing the network device type may be displayed. Various additional attributes such as maximum network capacity, current load, health status, as well as host system geo-location and identification may be selectively displayed by the user. Potential lines of communication between nodes  also may be selectively displayed by the user. Such information, for example, may be included in the augmented GIS database and populated by a service retrieving data via an API from an external source (e.g., QualNet by Scalable Network Technologies).","A second display in accordance with one implementation of the disclosure is indicated generally in  by reference number . A user of the system  may activate a capability filter, e.g., a LIINCO filter , to selectively display nodes  which meet the selected filter requirement(s). For example, in the display , a square symbol  is used to indicate those nodes  having a LIINCO level indicative of an ability to perform instant messaging.","Information pertaining to a user-selected node  is displayed in a window . The window  can include entity information , network information  that includes capabilities such as LIINCO levels , and link information . In another implementation, the window  may additionally or alternatively include applications capability(s) of the selected node . A refresh button  allows the user to refresh the information shown in the window  in essentially real time.","A third display in accordance with one implementation of the disclosure is indicated generally in  by reference number . In the display , an alert window  is displayed to indicate that a DoS event has been detected. The DoS has prevented communication between nodes  and  over a link , which is shown in a color different from a color of functioning links . Information as to the status of the link  is displayed in a window . The alert window  allows the user, e.g., to control network restoration and\/or delete the alert.","A fourth display in accordance with one implementation of the disclosure is indicated generally in  by reference number . The visualization  indicates that the link  is restored to use and that the LIINCO filter  is reconfigured.","In some implementations, the user of the system  can select a node in a display of the management system  and change a capability level, e.g., a LIINCO level and\/or application capability, for the selected node. Such change(s) could be made in various ways, e.g., by activating a window  menu and\/or capability filter such as the LIINCO filter . The management system  sends the capability change(s) to the selected node and, in some implementations, to the capability registry , as previously described with reference to . In some implementations, the user can make such changes in a 3-D visualization mode, e.g., to evaluate such changes before actually updating the nodes.","A user thus can gain control over available capabilities of ad-hoc nodes, for example, as a node enters the network. Where a node has a plurality of capabilities, the user can select a different capability based, e.g., on the essentially real-time status of the network as shown in the management system display. Thus the user can influence the operation of the network in essentially real time via displays such as the display . Further, in some implementations, the user can implement policy, i.e., rules set for operation of the network, by graphically implementing options available in the management system  display. The ability by a user to control node capabilities can provide a high degree of network management flexibility, improved asset utilization, recourse sharing, load leveling, and capability expansion, e.g., by means of application programming interfaces (APIs).","Various implementations of the disclosure can provide a 3-D visualization of all connections of a network, identify any connection problems discovered, and provide supporting diagnostics. The user GUI subsystem  provides a pleasant, non-crowded, easy-to-use human interface. The management system  provides a high degree of flexibility in planning, testing and demonstrating systems. The foregoing simulation methods make it possible to \u201cwarp the problem\u201d in a simulation. For example, a live node that is physically 1,000 miles apart from another node can be simulated as being only a few miles apart from the other node.","Various implementations of the present disclosure provide policy-based network management with self-forming and self-healing capabilities. The foregoing management system provides for interoperability control of ad-hoc nodes in an ad-hoc network. It is possible to view the physical locations of all network assets in an environment. Additionally, nodes not currently in the network but whose identities and capabilities have been identified through capability registration are still recognizable, and controllable, by the system  when such nodes reappear in the network.","Mobile and ad-hoc network planning, which support look-ahead to anticipate future asset deployment prediction, are facilitated. Policy management methodologies for traversing information and network management layers of mobile ad-hoc networks can be implemented using the foregoing system. The system  can make integrated network management (end-to-end across sub-network boundaries) possible. Further, self-forming communities of interest (CDIs) can be observed, and influenced, in real time.","Various application programming interfaces between COTS tools and the subsystems of the present disclosure make it possible to provide a high level of visibility of network nodes and links. In contrast to other tools currently in use, implementations of the present disclosure can be used to show real-time update of nodes on a network in a 3-D visualization indicating the quality of links. Active network management is facilitated, whereby one can see the quality of connection, including jitter and latency, and link capacity for data."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 5-8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
