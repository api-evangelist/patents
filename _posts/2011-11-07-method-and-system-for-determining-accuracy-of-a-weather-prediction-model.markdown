Generally, there are several current popular weather models including Fifth Generation Mesoscale Model (MM5), Weather Research and Forecasting-Advanced Research Weather Research Forecasting (WRF-ARW), Weather Research and Forecasting-Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model (WRF-NMM) and Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS). Currently, determining the \u201cbest\u201d model over the most recent 24 hour period based on accuracy of the model output parameters involves extensive scripting and setup, creating a high possibility of error, and minimizing repeatability of the model execution.","Creating input meteorological data files for mesoscale modeling is a daunting task for the uninitiated researcher working on a case study. The researcher\/user is required to know what data should be acquired and where to obtain it from and to run a complex sequence of scripts, modifying variables and file locations, C and FORTRAN code modifications and recompilations. Specifically, as part of the C gridded binary (GRIB) decoder, the user must indicate where the output decoded GRIB file should be placed. In the FORTRAN file, edits are required regarding central latitude and longitude, output file names, etc. Each of these code changes would be followed by recompilation. If the user mistypes any of the parameters, additional changes and recompilations must be made, leading to a highly error-prone and time consuming process.","Therefore, there is a need in the art for a method and apparatus for determining accuracy of mesoscale weather modelsin an easy-to-use and efficient manner.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to a computer implemented method for determining accuracy of mesoscale weather models. A preferred embodiment comprises selecting user parameters, extracting data corresponding to the selected user parameters from initialization data, executing each of the plurality of mesoscale weather models using the data to generate output data, comparing the output data to expected truth data and selecting at least a first mesoscale weather model ascertained for a surface level and a second mesoscale weather model ascertained for an upper-air level from the plurality of mesoscale weather models, wherein the first and second selected mesoscale weather models of the plurality of mesoscale weather models have a lowest error at the surface level and the upper-air level based on the selected user parameters.","Another embodiment of the present invention relates to apparatus for selecting a mesoscale weather model from a plurality of mesoscale weather models comprising selecting user parameters and extracting data corresponding to the selected user parameters from initialization data, executing each of the plurality of mesoscale models based on the selected user parameters to generate output data, comparing the output data to actual data and selecting at least a first mesoscale weather model ascertained for a surface level and\/or a second mesoscale weather model ascertained for an upper-air level from the plurality of mesoscale weather models, wherein the first and\/or second mesoscale weather models have a lowest error at the surface level and\/or the upper-air level based on the selected user parameters.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise a method and apparatus for determining an ideal mesoscale weather model by executing each model using a grouping of parameters and comparing each weather model to determine which has a lowest error according to the selected parameters and user-selected statistical metric.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","114","124","126","126","128","100","116","118","120","122","123","101","100","130","132"]},"The user interface  allows a user to drive the apparatus  to determine a best model of mesoscale weather data. The selection module  determines the selections of the geographical area for performing the mesoscale models, the selection of weather parameters to optimize the models for, the selection of physics packages to apply for each model, the selection of an error metric and model resolution (coarser\/finer). The database  stores information relating to model data as well as data corresponding to the selection options available to users in the user interface . Model data  is extracted from the database  and the model is compiled by the compiler . Both the compiled model data  and the selection parameters in the selection module  are validated by the validator . The validator  first confirms that the selection parameters and the model are compatible. Then the validator  confirms that the selection parameters are compatible between themselves. For example, if the user selects a physics package which does not align with a certain model, then the UI  displays an error. In an exemplary embodiment, the models used in model data  comprise at least two of the Fifth Generation Mesoscale Model (MM5), Weather Research and Forecasting-Advanced Research Weather Research Forecasting (WRF-ARW), Weather Research and Forecasting-Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model (WRF-NMM) or Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","100","200","202","204","206","202","204","202","208","208","206","204","208","210"]},"The memory , or computer readable medium, stores non-transient processor-executable instructions and\/or data that may be executed by and\/or used by the processor .
