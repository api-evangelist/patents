For example, \u201cKODOMO YOU HERUMETTO\u201d (helmet for children), \u201cOTONA YOU HERUMETTO\u201d (helmet for adults) and the like are distributed into the classification item \u201cUser\u201d, \u201cJITENSHA YOU HERUMERTTO\u201d (helmet for bicycle), \u201cBAIKU YOU HERUMETTO\u201d (helmet for motorbike) and the like are distributed into the classification item \u201cTarget\u201d, and \u201cBOUSAI YOU HERUMETTO\u201d (helmet for disaster prevention), \u201cYAKYU YOU HERUMETTO\u201d (helmet for baseball) and the like are distributed into the classification item \u201cPurpose\u201d. Incidentally, a compound word that does not fit to any classification item is distributed into \u201cOthers\u201d. Incidentally, the information processing server  may distribute the base word itself into the classification item using the classification model.","Thus, the information processing server  functions as an example of the compound word classification means that distributes a compound word containing a base word into a classification item acquired by the classification item acquisition means using a classification model generated in advance and feature information acquired by the feature information acquisition means for the compound word acquired by the compound word acquisition means. The information processing server  also functions as an example of the compound word classification means that distributes a compound word containing a base word into a classification item using a classification model constructed by the classification model construction means and a feature vector of the compound word acquired by the compound word acquisition means.","Next, the information processing server  conducts a search based on the base word (step S). More specifically, the system control unit  of the information processing server  conducts a search using the base word as a search keyword by referring to the product DB and acquires a search result (an example of base word related information) such as the product name, product image and the like obtained as hits in the search. Incidentally, base word related information includes elements of a search result and also elements like individual special topic targets when a special topic page is built. As such elements, for example, individual search result targets and special topic targets can be cited and in the case of a product search, individual product obtained as hits in a search based on a predetermined search keyword can be cited. The system control unit  of the information processing server  may acquire a search result by the search server  through the network . In addition, the information processing server  may acquire base word related information about a predetermined base word related to a special topic article to build a special topic page. In a special topic article of \u201cJITENSHA\u201d (bicycle), for example, product names (an example of base word related information) of product to be sold in connection with \u201cJITENSHA\u201d (bicycle) are acquired in advance. Also, search results using such product names as search keywords may be used as base word related information.","Thus, the information processing server  functions as an example of a base word related information acquisition means that acquires base word related information containing a plurality of elements related to the base word based on the base word. The information processing server  also functions as an example of the base word related information acquisition means that acquires a search result by conducting a search based on a search keyword.","Next, the information processing server  classifies a search result (step S). More specifically, the system control unit  of the information processing server  compares a product name as a hit in the search and classified compound words and assigns the classification item of a compound word that is the same as or similar to the product name. Then, the system control unit  classifies the search result according to the assigned classification item. For example, in a Web page , as shown in , a classification item region  corresponding to each classification item is provided in a related product region . The classification item region  has a classification item name attached thereto and an image of each product in the search result arranged therein. A name of the modifier portion of a compound word is attached to the lower neighborhood of each of the images . Incidentally, a search result of the product name that does not fit to any of the predetermined classification items or a search result of the product name corresponding to the classification item \u201cOthers\u201d is displayed in a search result region .","When a compound word is acquired based on text to be searched, the classification in step S is sufficient, but if the text to be searched and the source from which a compound word is acquired are different, even if a classification item is present, a search result may not be classified into the classification item and thus, such a classification item may not be displayed.","The system control unit  generates the Web page  described in HTML or the like.","Incidentally, the order of arranging images in the classification item region  may be, as shown in Formula (6) stated below, in descending order of score as a function of the base word, suffix, and other words. The system control unit  calculates scores of Formula (6) for compound words \u201cKODOMO YOU HERUMETTO\u201d (helmet for children), \u201cOTONA YOU HERUMETTO\u201d (helmet for adults), . . . and causes each of the classification item regions  to display information about compound words of top five scores of Formula (6).","Thus, the information processing server  functions as an example of a base word related information classification means that classifies each of at least a portion of elements contained in base word related information acquired by the base word related information acquisition means, into one of classification items in accordance with a classification result by the compound word classification means. The information processing server  also functions as an example of the base word related information classification means that classifies each of at least a portion of elements contained in a search result searched by the base word related information acquisition means, into one of classification items in accordance with a classification result by the compound word classification means.","Incidentally, the information processing server  may acquire a search result based on a base word (an example of a first search result using a base word as a search keyword) and a search result based on each compound word (an example of a second search result using a compound word as a search keyword) to display the search result based on each compound word (an example of the second search result) in the related product region  and a search result (an example of at least a portion of the first search result) obtained by deleting a portion common to the search result based on the compound word from the search result based on the base word (an example of the first search result) in the search result region . More specifically, the information processing server  compares elements (individual product or the like) of search results obtained as hits in a search in the first search result and the second search result, and deletes elements that are the same as elements in the second search result from elements in the first search result.","For example, the information processing server  removes search results of compound words such as the search keywords \u201cKODOMO YOU HERUMETTO\u201d (helmet for children) and \u201cJITENSHA YOU HERUMETTO\u201d (helmet for bicycle) from a search result of the search keyword \u201cHERUMETTO\u201d (helmet) by comparing URL (Uniform Resource Locator), product names or the like of elements of search results and deleting the same elements. Incidentally, when acquiring a first search result, the above processing may be omitted by generating a search formula that deletes each compound word in the search based on a base word. Further, the information processing server  arranges a product image as a first hit in a search result of the compound word \u201cKODOMO YOU HERUMETTO\u201d (helmet for children), a product image as a first hit in a search result of the compound word \u201cOTONA YOU HERUMETTO\u201d (helmet for adults) and the like as the images in the related product region . Top  hits of a search result based on each compound word may be displayed when the image or the name of the modifier portion is clicked. As an example of the compound word, among related-words related to a base word, a related-word having a suffix like \u201cKODOMO YOU HERUMETTO\u201d (helmet for children) will be called a typed related-word.","As shown in , the information processing server  may generate the Web page  (an example of search result information) described in HTML or the like to cause the display unit  of the user terminal device  to display by distinguishing a portion of the first search result (the search result region ) and the second search result (the related product region ). In the Web page , a portion of the first search result (the search result region ) and the second search result (the related product region ) are displayed in distinguished regions.","Thus, the information processing server  functions as an example of a search result acquisition means that acquires a first search result using a base word as a search keyword and a second search result using a compound word as a search keyword. The information processing server  also functions as an example of a search result information generation means that generates search result information so that at least a portion of a first search result and a second search result acquired by the search result acquisition means are made to be distinguished and displayed on the screen of a display means. The information processing server  also functions as an example of the search result information generation means that generates search result information so that a search result obtained by removing a portion of a second search result from a first search result is made to be displayed at least as a portion of the first search result.","Next, the information processing server  outputs the search result (step S). More specifically, the system control unit  of the information processing server  transmits information about the Web page  to the user terminal device  as the search result. Then, the system control unit  of the user terminal device  receives search result information and displays the Web page  as shown in  in the display unit .","Thus, the information processing server  functions as an example of an output means that outputs base word related information classified by the base word related information classification means.","According to the present embodiment described above, a base word to be abase (for example, a search keyword), a compound word in which the base word becomes a modifiee, classification items to classify the compound word, and feature information (for example, a matrix of an feature vector) about an feature that provides a clue to classify the compound word are acquired, the compound word containing the base word is distributed into a classification item using a classification model (classification model constructed by machine training) generated in advance and the feature information (for example, an feature vector calculated by using a matrix of an feature vector for the compound word), base word related information based on the base word and containing a plurality of elements related to the base word is acquired (for example, a search result based on a search keyword is acquired), each of at least a portion of elements contained in the base word related information is classified into one of the classification items in accordance with a result of the classification, and the classified base word related information is output to classify the base word related information according to classification item and therefore, mixing of the base word related information is distributed out based on the classification item so that a display that is easy for the user to view can be provided.","When a compound word for training is acquired, classification items for training corresponding to the acquired compound word for training are acquired, a classification model is constructed by doing machine training using an feature vector of the compound word for training generated from the acquired compound word for training and the classification items for training, an feature vector of the compound word is generated using feature information for the acquired compound word, and the compound word containing a base word is distributed using the constructed classification model and feature vector of the acquired compound word, the classification model to provide a display that is easy for the user to view can be realized by machine training with high precision. More specifically, when compared with a case of heuristic training, various features can be considered by using machine training so that high precision can be realized and various kinds of information can be effectively used for classification.","When classification items into which compound words are distributed are output to the user terminal device  from among classification items into which compound words are distributed to cause the user to select a specific classification item, a selection result of the classification items is acquired from the user terminal device , and base word related information acquired based on the acquired selection result of the classification items and abase word is classified in accordance with a classification result, a display that is easy for the user to view user-desired information in accordance with the user's selection can be provided.","When a search keyword is acquired from the user terminal device  as a base word, a search result is acquired by conducting a search based on the search keyword, and the search result obtained by conducting a search is classified according to classification item, a display that is easy for the user to view information searched for by the user can be provided.","By acquiring a first search result using a base word as a search keyword and a second search result using a generated compound word as a search keyword and generating the Web page  (an example of search result information) so that at least a portion of the acquired first search result and the second search result are made to be distinguished and displayed on the screen of the display unit , mixing of search targets searched for based on a search keyword can be reduced for display.","When search result information is generated so that a search result obtained by removing a portion of a second search result from a first search result is made to be displayed as at least a portion of the first search result, mixing of the first search result and the second search result is eliminated, which makes product related to the second search result more noticeable. In addition, the user is more likely to notice a search result based on a compound word.","[4. Operation of Second Embodiment of Information Processing System]","Next, the operation of a second embodiment of the information processing system will be described using figures. Incidentally, the same reference numerals are used for the same units as those in the first embodiment or corresponding units and only different configuration and operations will be described.

Then, the system control unit  acquires keywords matching these lexico-syntactic patterns and category IDs of the category to which the keywords belong by referring to the query log DB ","Next, the information processing server  extracts keywords corresponding to \u201cHITO\u201d (human) (step S). More specifically, the system control unit  of the information processing server  extracts a word corresponding to a word X of the lexico-syntactic pattern from the acquired keywords. Then, the system control unit  determines whether the word X expresses a human (\u201cHITO\u201d (human)) based on a dictionary in which expressions indicating a human are collected (the system control unit  determines, for example, whether a word in the dictionary and the word match). In the case of \u201cDANSEI YOU\u201d (for men), for example, the word X becomes \u201cDANSEI\u201d (men) and \u201cDANSEI\u201d (men) is registered in the dictionary and so is determined to be \u201cHITO\u201d (human). Thus, if the word X is determined to express \u201cHITO\u201d (human), the system control unit  extracts keywords corresponding to \u201cHITO\u201d (human) from keywords matching the lexico-syntactic pattern by adopting the original keyword containing the word X.
