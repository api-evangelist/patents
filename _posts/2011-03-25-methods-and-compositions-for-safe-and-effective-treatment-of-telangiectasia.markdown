Telangiectasias are visible small, red, purple or blue surface blood vessels that can be located on the face, upper chest, neck or other parts of the body. Telangiectatic blood vessels, which can include swollen blood vessels, spider veins, red dermal patches, purple dermal patches, or blue dermal patches are abnormal and are not necessary for any essential body function.","Telangiectatic blood vessels can appear with or without a preceding or concurrent skin or internal disease. Telangiectasias can develop anywhere within the body, but can be most easily seen in the skin. Telangiectasias include essential or primary telangiectasias, which include blood vessel dilations of unknown etiology. Generalized essential telangiectasias (GET) exhibit a widespread distribution pattern over the body. Other primary telangiectasias include angioma serpiginosum, ataxia telangiectasia, varicose of smaller veins, such as starburst veins, angiomas and spider naevi. Some other examples of conditions, syndromes, diseases and disorders which can include telangiectasia are CREST Syndrome (acronym for Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysfunction, Sclerodactyl), and Telangiextasis), hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome), ataxia-telangiectasia, rosacea (also known as acne rosacea), basal cell carcinoma, scleroderma, telangiectatic nevus, unilateral nevoid telangiectasia, cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Secondary telangiectasia can develop after actinic damage (such as in erythrosis interfollicularis colli), radiation therapy and as well steroid therapies including chronic corticosteroid treatment. Chronic hepatic and collagen-vascular disorders can also induce telangiectasia.","Telangiectasia can be a symptom of rosacea. However, rosacea also encompasses erythema, and is, accordingly, a phenomenon distinct from a telangiectasia.","Current treatments for ameliorating telangiectasias include laser therapy, light therapy including IPL intense pulsed light, electrocoagulation and electro-optical synergy (ELOS), which combines intense pulsed optical energy and conducted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy into a single pulse (Sadick, N S et al., J. Drugs Dermatolog. 4: 181-186, 2005).","Brimonidine, a selective \u03b12-adrenergic agonist, has been used as either a monotherapy or an adjunctive therapy to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension (OHT) since its approval in 1996. The most common side effects associated with brimonidine therapy are dry mouth, fatigue\/drowsiness, headache, mild hyperemia, blurred vision and foreign body sensation. Hypertension, palpitations and syncope have been reported by less than 3% patients in clinical trials involving brimonidine ophthalmic treatment. See McGhie, , May\/June 2001, at World Wide Web: pswi.org\/professional\/pharmaco\/brimonidine.pdf, and references therein. Results from the dose-ranging study in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension showed that although 0.5% (w\/w) had higher efficacy in the early phase of treatment, the 0.5% (w\/w) and 0.2% (w\/w) had similar efficacy after two weeks of treatment, and that 0.5% (w\/w) had more systemic and ocular side effects than 0.2% (w\/w). See, e.g., Walters, 1996, 41: S19-S26). Ophthalmic formulations containing 0.2% (w\/w) brimonidine have been used for chronic applications to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension, while that containing 0.5% (w\/w) brimonidine has been only used for acute therapy for the prevention of postoperative intraocular pressure spikes. In order to reduce a variety of ocular and systemic side-effects associated with the ophthalmic application of 0.2% (w\/w) brimonidine, ophthalmic formulations containing lower concentrations of brimonidine, e.g., 0.15% (w\/w) or 0.1% (w\/w), have been subsequently developed and used for chronic ophthalmic applications.","Brimonidine has been reported to be useful in treating telangiectasias. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,838,563 to DeJovin et al. Brimonidine has also been reported to be useful in treating erythema caused by rosacea. See, e.g., U.S. Ser. No. 10\/853,585 to DeJovin et al. To ensure the safety and avoid unacceptable side effects, a previous clinical study used 0.2% (w\/w) brimonidine tartrate as the \u201chigh\u201d dosage for treating erythema. See US 2009\/0061020 to Theobald et al.","In the present invention, it has been surprisingly discovered that topical administration of brimonidine to an affected skin area resulted in significantly less systemic exposure to brimonidine than topical ophthalmic application of brimonidine. It has been found that although systemic exposure increased with the applied dose of brimonidine, statistical analysis showed that the increase in systemic exposure (C) was not dose proportional, e.g., the increase in the mean Cwas much less than the increase in the dose. It has also been discovered that, unlike the topical ophthalmic application of brimonidine, topical administration of higher than 0.2% (w\/w) brimonidine to a skin area affected by telangiectasias or a related symptom resulted in increased efficacy without observable loss of effectiveness over time. No unacceptable drug related adverse events was observed with the treatment of higher concentration of brimonidine tested.","Accordingly, a higher concentration of brimonidine, such as about 0.3% (w\/w) to about 10% (w\/w), can now be used in improved methods and compositions for safe and effective treatment of telangiectasias or a symptom associated therewith.","In one general aspect, embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of providing a safe and effective treatment of telangiectasia or a symptom associated therewith in a subject. The method comprises topically administering to a skin area affected by the telangiectasia or the symptom a topical composition comprising about 0.3% to about 10% by weight brimonidine and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the topical administration effects a serum or plasma profile of brimonidine having a mean Cof about 54\u00b128 pg\/mL or less and a mean AUCof about 568\u00b1277 pg.hr\/mL or less.","In another general aspect, embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of producing a packaged product for providing a safe and effective treatment of telangiectasia or a symptom associated therewith in a subject, comprising:","(1) obtaining a topical composition comprising about 0.3% to about 10% by weight brimonidine and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier;","(2) devising instructions for topically administering the topical composition to a skin area affected by the telangiectasia or the symptom to obtain the safe and effective treatment, and","(3) providing the topical composition and the instructions in a unified package, wherein the topical administration effects a serum or plasma profile of brimonidine having a mean Cof about 54\u00b128 pg\/mL or less and a mean AUCof about 568\u00b1277 pg.hr\/mL or less.","In a preferred embodiment, the topical composition used in or encompassed by embodiments of the present invention comprises about 0.4% (w\/w) to about 0.6% (w\/w) brimonidine tartrate.","In another preferred embodiment, the telangiectasia is telangiectasia associated with rosacea.","Other aspects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following disclosure, including the detailed description of the invention and its preferred embodiments and the appended claims.","Various publications, articles and patents are cited or described in the background and throughout the specification; each of these references is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Exemplary forms of formulation that can be used for topical administration in embodiments of the present invention include, but are not limited to, sprays, mists, aerosols, solutions, lotions, gels, creams, ointments, pastes, unguents, emulsions and suspensions.","The term \u201ctopically administrable composition\u201d as used herein, also encompasses locally applied and locally acting formulations such as formulations for use with implants, injections, or patches.","The choice of topically administrable composition will depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, the nature of the symptoms to be treated or prevented, the physiochemical characteristics of the particular compound to be administered and of other excipients present, their stability in the formulation, the aesthetics of any given formulation, available manufacturing equipment, and cost constraints.","As used herein, the term \u201ccomposition\u201d is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredient in the specified amount, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the specified ingredient in the specified amount.","As used herein, the term \u201csubject\u201d means any animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, to whom will be or has been administered compounds or topical formulations according to embodiments of the invention. Preferably, a subject is in need of, or has been the object of observation or experiment of, treatment or prevention of telangiectasia or a symptom associated therewith.","As used herein, the term \u201cinstructions\u201d when used in the context of a packaged product includes a publication, a recording, a diagram or any other medium of expression which can be used to communicate the usefulness of the packaged product for its designated use.

For example, it was discovered that topical administration of a topical composition comprising increasing concentration of brimonidine to a skin area affected by erythema or a symptom associated therewith resulted in a clear dosage responsive increase in the efficacy and an increase in the systemic exposure. However, statistical analysis showed that the increase in systemic exposure (C) was not dose proportional, e.g., the increase in mean Cwas much less than the increase in dose. No unacceptable adverse event was observed with the treatment of higher concentration of brimonidine tested. Topical skin treatments with all concentrations and regimens tested resulted in significantly lower systemic exposure to brimonidine than the treatment with eye drops applied as recommended in the label of the ophthalmic products.","Such superior clinical activities of the higher concentrations of brimonidine, e.g., about 0.3% to about 10% by weight, have not been previously reported. The present discovery is surprising and unexpected, particularly in view of the previously reported efficacy and safety profiles of brimonidine in ophthalmic applications, where a significant loss of effectiveness over time was seen with the brimonidine 0.5% (w\/w) formulation and the chronic use of much lower concentrations of brimonidine, e.g., 0.1% or 0.15% by weight, is preferred, because the lower concentrations provide improved tolerability while maintaining IOP-lowering efficacy.","Accordingly, in one general aspect, embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of providing a safe and effective treatment of telangiectasia or a symptom associated therewith in a subject, comprising topically administering to a skin area affected by the telangiectasia or the symptom a topical composition comprising about 0.3% to about 10% by weight brimonidine and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the topical administration effects a serum or plasma profile of brimonidine having a mean Cof about 54\u00b128 pg\/mL or less and a mean AUCof about 568\u00b1277 pg.hr\/mL or less. The mean Cand the mean AUCcorrespond to the serum or plasma profile of brimonidine after ophthalmic treatment with 0.2% (w\/w) brimonidine tartrate eye drops as recommended in the label of the ophthalmic product.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the topically administrable composition comprises about 0.3%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%, 4.5%, 5.0%, 5.5%, 6.0%, 6.5%, 7.0%, 7.5%, 8.0%, 8.5%, 9.0%, 9.5% or 10.0%, by weight of brimonidine, such as brimonidine tartrate.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the topically administrable composition comprises about 0.4%, about 0.45%, about 0.5%, about 0.55% or about 0.6%, by weight of brimonidine, such as brimonidine tartrate.","In a preferred embodiment, the topical composition comprises about 0.5% by weight of brimonidine, such as about 0.5% by weight of brimonidine tartrate.","To treat or prevent telangiectasia or a symptom associated therewith, in view of the present disclosure, the topically administrable compositions of the invention can be topically applied directly to the affected area in any conventional manner known in the art, e.g., by dropper, applicator stick, or cotton swab, as a mist via an aerosol applicator, via an intradermal or transdermal patch, or by simply spreading a formulation of the invention onto the affected area with fingers, a sponge, a pad, or wipes. Generally the amount of a topical formulation of the invention applied to the affected skin area ranges from about 0.0001 g\/cmof skin surface area to about 0.05 g\/cm, preferably, 0.002 g\/cmto about 0.005 g\/cmof skin surface area.","In various aspects, an application of a topical composition can noticeably ameliorate a telangiectasia within about 2 minutes following application, within about 5 minutes following application, or within about 10 minutes following application. In some aspects, a composition can be maximally effective at about 30 minutes after application, and the ameliorative effects can last up to about 2 hours, up to about 4 hours, up to about 8 hours, up to about 12 hours, up to about 18 hours, or up to about 24 hours, or longer. Accordingly, in some aspects, a composition can be topically applied to skin at a site of telangiectasia symptoms once per day, twice per day, or three or more times per day.","Methods of the present invention can be used in conjunction with one or more other treatments and\/or medications to provide more effective treatment of a telangiectasia. In some aspects, a topical formulation can be used in combination with treatment regimens and medications for treatment of dermatologic disorders, such as those disclosed in THE MERCK MANUAL 811-830 (Keryn A. G. Lane et al. eds. 17th ed. 2001), hereby incorporated herein by reference.","In one aspect, the topical formulations can be used in combination with systemic administration of antibiotics or retinoids including, but not limited to, orally dosed antibiotics, such as tetracycline, minocin, minocycline, erythromycin, and doxycycline, and orally dosed retinoids such as isotretinoins (e.g., Accutane or Roaccutance).","In other aspects, the topical formulations disclosed herein can be used in combination with other topical treatments including, but not limited to, topical formulations consisting of metronidazole, hydrogen peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, lipoic acid, and azelaic acid, and sulfur preparations; topically dosed antibiotics, such as metronidazole, clindamycin, and erythromycin; antiparasitics such as permethrin and ivermectin; topical retinoids such as tretinoin, adapalene, tazarotene; or topical steroids.","In other aspects, topical formulations described herein can be used in combination with other therapies such as, for example, laser therapy, such as pulsed dye laser treatment; light therapy, such as mixed light pulse therapy (photoderm), IPL intense pulsed light; photodynamic therapy; electrocoagulation and electro-optical synergy (ELOS); or electrosurgery.","The other medicament or treatment can be administered to the subject simultaneously with, or in a sequence and within a time interval of, the administration of brimonidine, such that the active ingredients or agents can act together to treat or prevent telangiectasia and symptoms associated therewith. For example, the other medicament or treatment and brimonidine can be administered in the same or separate formulations at the same or different times, i.e., before or after. Any suitable route of administration can be employed to deliver the additional treatment or medication.","Another aspect of the invention relates to a method of producing a packaged product for providing a safe and effective treatment of telangiectasia or a symptom associated therewith in a subject. The method comprises:","(1) obtaining a topical composition comprising about 0.3% to about 10% by weight brimonidine and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier;","(2) devising instructions for topically administering the topical composition to a skin area affected by the telangiectasia or the symptom to obtain the safe and effective treatment, and","(3) providing the topical composition and the instructions in a unified package, wherein the topical administration effects a serum or plasma profile of brimonidine having a mean Cof about 54\u00b128 pg\/mL or less and a mean AUCof about 568\u00b1277 pg.hr\/mL or less.","In one embodiment of the invention, the topical composition is contained within one suitable container, such as a dropper, a jar, or a tube with a suitable small orifice size, such as an extended tip tube, made of any pharmaceutically suitable material. The topical formulations according to embodiments of the invention can be filled and packaged into a plastic squeeze bottle or tube. Suitable container-closure systems for packaging a topical formulations of the invention are commercially available for example, from Wheaton Plastic Products, 1101 Wheaton Avenue, Millville, N.J. 08332. Optionally, an applicator can be provided in or attached to the container, or separately from the container.","In one embodiment of the invention, the instructions are, for example, a pamphlet or package label. The instructions explain how to administer topical formulations of the invention, in an amount and for a period of time sufficient to provide a safe and effective treatment of telangiectasia or a symptom associated therewith. Preferably, the instructions include, for example, the dosage and administration instructions, the topical formulation's composition, the clinical pharmacology, drug resistance, pharmacokinetics, absorption, bioavailability, and contraindications.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the topical composition is a topical gel composition, which comprises:","about 0.3% (w\/w) to about 10.0% (w\/w) brimonidine;","about 0.20% (w\/w) to about 4.0% (w\/w) gelling agent; and","about 5.0% (w\/w) to about 30.0% (w\/w) at least one polyol,","The topically administrable composition are prepared by mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with the safe and effective amount of brimonidine according to known methods in the art, for example, methods provided by standard reference texts such as, REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY 1577-1591, 1672-1673, 866-885(Alfonso R.

To stabilize the pH, preferably, an effective amount of a buffer is included. In one embodiment, the buffering agent is present in the aqueous topical formulation in an amount of from about 0.05 to about 1 weight percent of the formulation.","The topical gel composition of the present invention can include one or more other ingredients, such as a protective agent, a cosmetic agent, an adsorbent, a preservative, an antioxidant, a surfactant, a skin-penetration agent, local anesthetics, analgesics etc.","In a preferred embodiment, a topical gel composition according to embodiments of the invention further comprises water dispersible form of titanium dioxide (TiO2), preferably at an amount that is sufficient to mask the color of brimonidine or another colored ingredient in the formulation, but would not cause irritation to the skin. TiO2 may cause mild irritation and reddening to the eyes, thus eye contact with the TiO2-containing topically administrable composition should be avoided. Titanium dioxide imparts a whiteness to the topically administrable composition and helps to increase the opacity and reduce the transparency of the composition. Titanium dioxide absorbs, reflects, or scatters light (including ultraviolet radiation in light), which can help protect products from deterioration. Titanium dioxide can also be used as a sunscreen to protect the user from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation that is part of sunlight.","According to embodiments of the present invention, the amount of water dispersible form of titanium dioxide in the composition is about 0.04 to 0.2%, such as 0.04%, 0.0425%, 0.0525%, 0.0625%, 0.0725%, 0.0825%, 0.09%, 0.10%, 0.15%, or 0.20% (w\/w).","Suitable preservatives include, but are not limited to, quaternary ammonium compounds, such as benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, cetrimide, dequalinium chloride, and cetylpyridinium chloride; alcoholic agents, for example, chlorobutanol, phenylethyl alcohol, and benzyl alcohol; parabens such as methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben; antibacterial esters, for example, esters of parahydroxybenzoic acid; and other anti-microbial agents such as chlorhexidine, chlorocresol, benzoic acid, polymyxin, and phenoxyethanol. Preferably, the preservative is selected from the group consisting of sodium benzoate, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, methylparaben, imidazolidinyl urea and diazolidinyl urea.","In addition to brimonidine, the topically administrable composition according to embodiments of the invention can optionally include one or more other pharmaceutically active ingredients, including, but not limited to, medications used to treat the underlying disease that causes telangiectasia, antihistamines to control itching, antibiotics, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, acetaminophen, etc.","This invention will be better understood by reference to the non-limiting examples that follow, but those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the examples are only illustrative of the invention as described more fully in the claims which follow thereafter.","This example illustrates gel topical formulations that can be used in the present invention.","A first group of gel

Major entrance criteria included clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe facial erythema associated with rosacea, CEA score \u22673, and IOP level 11-21 mmHg. Intra-subject comparison of topical to ophthalmic exposure following one day treatment with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was performed.","A total of 102 subjects were randomized: 24, 26, 25, and 27 subjects in 0.5% Gel QD, 0.18% Gel BID, 0.18% Gel QD, and 0.07% Gel BID, respectively. On the Day 1 visit, one drop of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% was administered to each eye every 8 hours over a 24 hour period. After a 2-day wash-out period, one gram of topical gel (0.07%, 0.18%, or 0.50% of brimonidine tartrate) was applied once (QD) or twice daily (BID) to the face of subjects for 4 weeks.","Blood samples for complete PK profiling were taken during the 24-hour ocular treatment (study Day 1) and during the first day of topical application (study Day 4), fifteen days of topical application (study Day 18) and after the last topical application up to 72 hours post-dose (study Day 32). Additional blood samples were collected before application (Day 10, Day 24). Brimonidine plasma concentrations were determined by using a validated LC-MS\/MS method with a lower limit of quantification (LOQ) of 10 pg\/mL.","The PK parameters for brimonidine were calculated using standard non-compartmental method and C, AUCwere analyzed statistically using log-transformed data. For both the differences between times administration routes and between treatment groups, the limits of the intervals were back-transformed into exponential to obtain 90% confidence intervals (90% CI) of the ratios of geometric means on the original scale.

There is no identifiable relationship between any PK parameter and the incidence or severity of any AEs related to the topical gel. There were no SAEs reported during the treatment period with the topical gel for skin application (DAY 4 through study completion). Two SAEs were reported during the ophthalmic solution treatment period (DAYS 1-3) in two subjects, with one SAE (Acute Hypotensive Event) considered related to the ophthalmic solution.

A single application was applied to the face in the morning. Subjects remained at the site for a mandatory 12-hour post-dose observation period. All 122 subjects completed the study and were included in the intent to treat (ITT) and Safety population. A total of 117 subjects (96%) were included in the population point (PP) population.","Each patient's telangiectasia was graded on a scale from 0 to 4 by Telangiectasia Global Assessment (TGA), with 0 being the rating for no signs of telangiectasia and 4 being the rating for severe telangiectasia, with the presence of many clearly visible telangiectasias. The TGA score was recorded pretreatment or pre-dose and at various time points after the treatment.","Changes in TGA score were analyzed using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) with analysis center, treatment as factors and the corresponding baseline value as covariate.","Efficacy of the Treatment","Table 6 provides the summary of average mean change and the average minimum (min) and maximum (max) change of TGA from the pre-dose baseline over a 12-hour interval. The treatment with 0.5% (w\/w) brimonidine has resulted in more reduction in TGA compared to that with vehicle or lower concentration of brimonidine, e.g., at 018% (w\/w) or 0.07% (w\/w).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Average Changes of the TGA from the Pre-dose"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"0.5%","0.18%","0.07%",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Brimonidine","Brimonidine","Brimonidine","Vehicle"]},{"entry":[{},"(N = 31)","(N = 31)","(N = 28)","(N = 32)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Average Mean","\u22120.28","\u22120.16","\u22120.21","0.03"]},{"entry":"Change"},{"entry":["Average Min,","\u22122.4, 1.5","\u22121.7, 0.5","\u22121.7, 0.1","\u22121.7, 0.9"]},{"entry":"Max Change"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Also as shown in , significant reduction in telangiectasia was observed with the treatment of 0.5% (w\/w) brimonidine, e.g., 30 minutes post treatment, which lasted even 12 hours post treatment.","The more effective and long lasting treatment of telangiectasia by 0.5% (w\/w) brimonidine observed from the clinical study is unexpected in view of the ophthalmic applications of brimonidine, where increasing the concentration of brimonidine does not appear to significantly increase its efficacy and lowering the concentration of brimonidine, e.g., to 0.1% (w\/w), maintains its IOP-lowering efficacy.","Safety of the Treatment","Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at pre-dose (T0) and Hour 12 on the treatment day. Slight reductions were observed in all treatment groups. However, no clear pattern relating to the dosage level of brimonidine could be identified. The result indicates that topical application of increasing concentrations of brimonidine up to 0.5% (w\/w) to the skin area affected with telangiectasia did not increase the effect on IOP.","No serious adverse event (SAE) and no adverse event (AE) leading to discontinuation of the study were reported. The number of AEs is comparable between the groups. There is no increase in the number of AEs with the increase in the dose level. No unacceptable drug related adverse event was observed.","Unlike ophthalmic applications of brimonidine, where the chronic use of lower concentration of brimonidine, e.g., 0.1% (w\/w), provides improved tolerability while maintaining IOP-lowering efficacy, the present clinical studies unexpectedly discovered that higher concentrations of brimonidine provide significantly improved clinical efficacy in treating telangiectasia or related symptoms, while not causing any observable change in patient safety and tolerability as compared to lower concentrations of brimonidine.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the broad inventive concept thereof.
