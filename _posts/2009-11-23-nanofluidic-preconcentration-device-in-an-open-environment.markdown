No. 61\/117,506, filed Nov. 24, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under Grant Nos. CA119402 and EB005743 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in this invention.","Due to the low abundance of most information-rich bio\/chemical species to be detected, the amplification\/preconcentration of such species has become the most important issues in bioanalytical research and industry. Considerable improvement in the non-genomic preconcentration methods have been achieved in the last decade, leading at least 100-1000 fold accumulation in sensitivity. Available methods include physical filtration and various novel approaches were studied such as field-amplified sample stacking (PASS), field-amplified sample injection (FASI), isotachophoretic stacking (ITP) and liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). Million-fold amplification of peptides and proteins using micro- and nano-channel hybridized system has been reported. Such methods utilized novel concentration polarization (CP) phenomena near nanochannels where the sample can stay and be accumulated at the ion depletion boundary which was created by CP. However, micro\/nanochannels are usually fabricated within the material boundaries confining the flow of the sample. Due to the extremely high concentration gradient after preconcentration procedure, diffusion and dispersion inside the microchannel are critical, limiting the delivery of such high concentrated sample to a desired location such as mass spectrometry (MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization-MS (MALDI-MS) systems. In this manner, dispersionless extraction of the concentrated plug has been an important issue. Electrodiffusion, which is proportional to the concentration gradient, or dispersion, which is proportional to the length it travels through, can be controlled only by having less travel length and time from the point of concentration to the point of detection. In this manner, many researchers tried detecting samples inside the channel rather than taking it out, but this limits the usage of the concentration device.","Many efforts have been made for carrying immunoassay inside microchannels in order to utilize the electrokinetic trapping preconcentration. However, implementing immunoassay within a microchannel is generally challenging, especially due to issues related to surface chemistry to immobilize antibodies and other chemical reagents required for immunoassays. On the other hand, conventional immunoassay processes (such as ELISA) were done on open surfaces, with much more robust control on surface chemistry and easier detection. To enjoy both advantages of conventional open surface immunoassays and efficient sample concentration by nanofluidic preconcentration, a preconcentration process outside the microchannel is highly desired.","In one embodiment, this invention provides a new method of concentrating low-abundance molecular species using the CP-enabled preconcentration process, but within a droplet on a surface. By having a droplet in between an inlet microchannel and an outlet microchannel, the droplet itself acts as a droplet chamber to concentrate low-abundance species. In one embodiment, this invention demonstrates an electrokinetic preconcentration process inside the droplet using fluorescence dye, thus successfully proving the concept of such device. After preconcentration, the accumulated molecules can be detected using conventional immunoassays and other techniques (MALDI-MS or ELISA), without the need for integrating the detectors to the microfluidic system directly.","In one embodiment, this invention provides an electrokinetic concentration device comprising:\n\n","In one embodiment, the sample microchannels comprise liquid or

The field in the nanofluidic channel (E) generates an ion-depletion region (colored white area within droplet in ) and an extended space charge layer that traps charged species.

According to this embodiment, over a course of time, ion depletion in the droplet leads to ion enrichment in the buffer microchannel or reservoir, such that the buffer concentration in the buffer channel or reservoir increases with prolonged conduction of a species separation process or of any other prolonged device operation. By providing a lower concentration buffer, at prescribed time periods, in one embodiment, or continually, in another embodiment, by electroosmosis, or in another embodiment, by pressure driven flow, or by any other means in the buffer microchannel, this effect is mitigated, according to this embodiment.","In one embodiment, the electric field induced in the conduit is a result of the voltages applied to the sample and buffer microchannels.

If the buffer reservoir is in the form of a ground channel as shown in to , the channel can be grounded on both ends.

In one embodiment, the conduit may be made of a charged gel or random nanoporous material, wherein charged group are embedded in the nanoporous material.

According to this aspect of the invention, ion depletion near the nanofluidic channel thickens the Debye layer, causing its overlap more significantly in the nanofluidic channel, speeding up the concentration polarization effect, and above a certain threshold En value, results in electroosmosis with second order kinetics.","According to this aspect of the invention, counter ion depletion from the nanofluidic channel, and creation of an extended space charge layer in bulk solution within the sample microchannel prevents co-ion migration in this region. In one embodiment, controlling the electric fields (Eand E), to balance the two forces (anion repulsion from the space charge layer vs. nonlinear electroosmotic flow from the reservoir), stabilizes the interface, which is where anionic species of interest are trapped and collected, according to this aspect of the invention.

In one embodiment, the species of interest is a protein, nucleic acid, virus or viral particle found in, or secreted from a cell, and in another embodiment, is found in very low quantities, such that it represents less than 10% of the protein extracted form a protein extract of the cell.","Conduits thinner than 50 nm demonstrate unique ion-perm-selectivity at moderate ionic strength, due to the fact that the Debye layer thickness is non-negligible compared with the channel thickness in these conduits. Often these phenomena are explained as Debye layer overlap, with the ratio between (equilibrium) Debye length and the channel dimension as the critical parameter. Typical ion behavior is such that the anodic side of the conduit is almost completely depleted from ionic species, while ion enrichment occurs in the cathodic side of the conduit, in some embodiments, attributable to the permselective nature of the conduits at low-ionic strength conditions, caused by the Debye layer overlap in the conduits. According to this aspect of the invention, due to this concentration gradient, preferential cation transport through the conduit is satisfied across the entire system, while maintaining net zero anion flux at the cathodic side.","According to this aspect of the invention, and in one embodiment, typically in the perm-selective membrane facing the bulk solution, there exist a diffusion layer outside of which convective mixing eliminates any concentration gradient, rendering the ion concentration comparable to that of bulk solution. In some embodiments, when the device operation is with a fixed diffusion length and increasing DC bias, the system responds by decreasing the local ion concentration on the anodic side of the membrane or the conduit. While it would be predicted that when this happens the system reaches a limiting current, above which no further increase in ion current is possible even with higher voltage applied to the system, surprisingly, it was found herein that significant over-limiting current can be observed in most perm-selective membranes, and in this case, the electrokinetic response may be amplified because of significantly lowered ion concentration near the conduit, therefore higher \u201clocal\u201d zeta potential.","In some embodiments, the methods of this invention result in the acceleration of liquid flow in a microchannel and in a droplet.

In one embodiment, concentration of a minute quantity of a species of interest for detection is a critical element of a biosensor device. In one embodiment, such methods are particularly useful in detecting organisms in a latent or spore state, wherein detection of the organism is otherwise difficult.","In other embodiments, various applications of the methods of the present invention are possible without deviating from the present invention. For the method of concentrating a species in a liquid, for example, multiple microchannels may be so deposited such that droplet content is directed to a central reservoir, to which additional microchannels may be connected. According to this aspect, the fluid once within the reservoir may then be mixed, and in turn, be pumped through the second set of microchannels to another reservoir connected thereto, for further manipulation. It can be appreciated that the concentration method of the present invention works with various types of fluids including water and biological fluids.","By way of example, the concentrating methods of the present invention allow for high-throughput robotic assaying systems to directly interface with the devices of the present invention, and to concentrate a species of interest.","In one embodiment, the dark region containing the charged species, shown on the left side of the droplet as depicted in  is called the ion-concentration plug.","As shown in  an integrated system or an array of devices can be formed. ) shows an embodiment of an integrated device for parallel dispensing. Multiple devices are stacked up into one big device with different samples on the bottom. This can be connected to a motorized-stage to dispense droplet on a target surface (possibly protein\/DNA microarrays). This dispensing can be done either simultaneously or separately, depending on the motorized stage configuration. In ), devices are shown bonded to a glass plate, where analysis can be done on-plate.","In some embodiments, the charged species concentration as a result of the methods\/using the devices of this invention is appropriate for MALDI sample preparation and for MALDI detection.","In some embodiments, the concentrating methods\/devices of this invention, or devices\/methods for the isolation of a species of interest have a high flow rate even in the absence of additional mechanical pumping mechanisms, which in some embodiments, is superior to current electro-osmotic pumping devices. In some embodiments, the high flow rate is useful in high throughput sample preparation for micro-total analysis systems and for micro-synthesis.","Methods of this invention may employ various configurations of a device. Devices used in methods of this invention may have different features, different dimensions, different number of microchannels and conduits, different inlets and outlets and various sample, buffer, collection and waste reservoirs or containers.","In other embodiments, separation devices connected to or working with devices of this invention, which may interface with the droplet, or concentrated species or sample microchannels of this invention include, but are not limited to, micro high performance liquid chromatographic columns, for example, reverse-phase, ion-exchange, and affinity columns.","It is to be understood that the exact configuration of any systems, devices, etc. which are coupled to the droplets or to the concentrated species of the device are to be considered as part of this invention, and that the configuration may be varied, to suit a desired application. In one embodiment, a module for separation of concentrated peptides which is positioned in contact with the droplet or the droplet contents of the concentrating device comprises a separation medium and a capillary between the ends of which an electric field is applied. The transport of a separation medium in the capillary system and the injection of the sample to be tested (e.g., a sample band comprising peptides and\/or partially digested polypeptides) into the separation medium can be carried out with the aid of pumps and valves, or in another embodiment, via electric fields applied to various points of the capillary.","In another embodiment, the method is utilized to detect said species of interest when said species is initially present in said liquid at a concentration, which is below a limit of detection.","In one embodiment, the method is used for analysis of a charged species. In one embodiment, the species that was concentrated in the droplet according to methods of this invention is conveniently transferred from the droplet to a measurement system without decreasing the concentration of the species. In one embodiment, such direct transfer can be done using a needle, a tip, a syringe, or substrate by bringing the needle, tip, syringe, or substrate into contact with the droplet and by retrieving it, until at least a portion of the droplet is transferred to the needle, tip, syringe, or substrate. This type of transfer is advantageous over in-channel delivery wherein the high concentration is lost while the sample flows in the channel through the device. Direct transfer of the concentrated species in a liquid from the droplet is faster and more efficient than collection by flow through channels.","In one embodiment, the solution containing the concentrated species is transferred to another device or to another system directly. In one embodiment, the solution containing the concentrated species is transferred to another device or to another system without the need to flow the solution. In one embodiment, the solution containing the concentrated species is transferred to another device or to another system without diluting it. In one embodiment, the solution containing the concentrated species is transferred to another device or to another system by dispensing the droplet (or portions thereof) containing the concentrated species. In one embodiment, the solution containing the concentrated species is transferred to another device or to another system by suction of the droplet (or portions thereof) containing the concentrated species. In one embodiment, the solution containing the concentrated species is being analyzed without transfer. According to this aspect and in one embodiment, an analysis system is constructed such that the contents of the droplet can be analyzed on the edge of the concentration unit. Such analysis systems may include but are not limited to spectrometers and imaging and microscopy instruments.","Because the droplet is exposed to the environment, analysis can take place without the need to transfer the species. Spectral analysis for example can be carried out by irradiating the droplet and detecting the change in radiation.","In one embodiment, the method is adapted for synthesis in the micron scale. In one embodiment, synthesis in the micron scale comprises synthesis using volumes in the micro-liter range. In one embodiment synthesis in the micron scale comprises reactors, bio-reactors, synthesis containers, and\/or sample tubes, channels or conduits having at least one dimension ranging between 1 micrometer and 1000 micrometer.

In one embodiment, drugs concentrated by methods of this invention are used for therapeutics.","In one embodiment, the method is adapted for chemical or biological analysis. In one embodiment, methods of this invention provide fluid dilution and\/or species concentration in a fluid that may aid in chemical and biological analysis.","In one embodiment, concentrating a charged species reduces the time needed for analysis. In one embodiment reducing the time also reduces the cost of the analysis.

In one embodiment, such implanted device can be operated remotely. In one embodiment, such implanted device can be used for sampling of body fluids on a regular basis.","In one embodiment, an implanted device working according to methods of this invention may be used to release drugs in accurate doses and at precise times into a patient's blood stream or into a tissue.","In one embodiment, devices and methods of this invention could be used as a sample delivery system for DNA\/protein microarrays, providing additional boost in the detection sensitivity and dynamic range. Devices and methods of this invention are amenable to massive parallelization and do not suffer from the technical difficulties of integrating microfluidic immunoassay systems, since the concentrated sample plugs are readily available in droplets for any surface-based assays.","In one embodiment, concentration processes of this invention exhibit concentration of species in a volume of liquid that is exposed to the environment. In one embodiment, this feature enables to use the concentrated species within the volume of liquid directly without the need to flow the concentrated species through a channel to a collection area. By running a liquid comprising a concentrated species in a channel, the concentration of the species decreases. This decrease in concentration and dilution of the species is eliminated in methods of this invention because the volume of liquid in which the concentrated species is present can be collected directly. The volume of liquid in which the concentrated species is present can be collected by dispensing it, or by transferring it upon contact to another substrate or to a container. The concentrated species can be collected directly using a syringe or a pipette, by suction, by applying positive or negative pressures, such that the volume of liquid in which the concentrated species of interest is present does not mix with other diluting volumes of liquid. Accordingly, the concentration of species does not decrease during transfer in one embodiment.","Various modes of carrying out the invention are contemplated as being within the scope of the following claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter, which is regarded as the invention.","Device Fabrication:","PDMS was used to fabricate the preconcentrator (a concentration device of this invention) following a general PDMS chip fabrication process. As the first step, an SU8 photoresist pattern on silicon wafer was used as a master. The positive master mold contained microchannels. As the second step, PDMS was poured on the master mold. After curing in an oven at 65 degrees C. for 3 hours, the PDMS layer was peeled off from the master. For nanojunction fabrication, self-sealed method was utilized (S. J. Kim and J. Han, Anal. Chem. 80, 3507-3511 (2008)). The polymeric nanojunction was created by infiltrating Nafion polymer solution between the gaps created by mechanical cutting on PDMS substrate which had a mold of microchannels. The PDMS can seal itself with the heterogeneous polymeric nanoporous material between PDMS\/PDMS gap. Then the PDMS substrate was bonded with glass plate by plasma treatments.","Biomolecule and Reagent Preparation","A 1 mM solution of potassium phosphate dibasic solution (pH=8.4) was used as a main buffer solution and it contained 1 \u03bcg\/ml of FITC (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) for fluorescent tracking.","Optical Detection Setup","Experiments were conducted on an inverted microscope (IX-71) with fluorescence excitation light source attached. A thermoelectrically cooled CCD camera (Cooke Co., Auburn Hill, Mich.) was used for fluorescence imaging. Sequences of images were analyzed by IPLab 3.6 (Scanalytics, Fairfax, Va.). A dc power supply (Keithley 236 source measure unit (SMU)) was used to apply electrical potential to each reservoir using a custom-made voltage divider. The built in 100 W mercury lamp was used as a light source, and a neutral density filter was used to reduce the light intensity and to increase the dynamic range of detection.","As shown in ), two microchannels (channel  and channel ) are open to the outside of the PDMS chip. Injecting sample liquid from either channel  or channel  can create droplet that can connect two channels. Ground channel, which buried inside the PDMS chip, is connected to the droplet through via nanojunction. Once DC was applied with depletion voltage conditions (V=V=V and V=V=0), CP was initiated and the ionic concentration in anodic side started to deplete (ion depletion zone) with the normal electric field (EN) through nanochannel. Then adjusting V lower than V (preconcentration voltage condition) gives tangential electric field (ET) through the droplet. With the application of the tangential electric field (ET), any charged species would accumulate and form a preconcentrated plug inside the droplet. The electric potential can be applied by the electrodes as shown in ). This preconcentration voltage condition can also maintain (or control) the size of the droplet. Since the droplet is formed at open environment, evaporation would make the size of droplet decrease. However, since the flow rate into\/out of droplet can be maintained much higher than the evaporation rate, this voltage configuration can keep (or control) the size of droplet.","Successful concentration process was achieved with applied voltages of V=400V, V=350V and V=V=0V as shown in ). Initially no fluorescence is in the droplet (t=0 sec). The concentrated plug is formed from the channel  (t=5 sec), and then inside the droplet (t=10 sec). After 15 seconds, the fluorescence are concentrated at the left side of the droplet (t=15 sec). The droplet size is slightly increasing since the induced force of EOF is stronger than the surface tension. In this example, the droplet size slightly increases from 696 \u03bcm to 768 \u03bcm. The bright shell in the image of t=10 sec is due to reflection. In order to remove the reflection effect near the edge, the saturated fluorescent area of region (i) (the half of droplet) and region (ii) (the inner part of droplet) was measured as shown in ). The area is exponentially growing and shows excellent preconcentration efficiency.","A microfluidic device is constructed. Due to its microscale size, the droplet on the PDMS chip has a hemispherical shape. With upper plate or objects touching the droplet, droplet changes itself into a liquid bridge. By moving the plate away, liquid bridge breaks apart into two droplets, splitting the samples into two ( ()). In this method, concentrated sample transfers directly to the target plate without any driving force for transporting (external pressures or electric fields), restricting plug dispersion or electrodiffusion. Also, it can be easily integrated into a massively parallel sensor array ()) since the sample droplets locate at the edge of the device.","In addition to this, the parallelization can be done even without dispensing process as shown in ). Microchannels in PDMS are bonded to large glass rather than PDMS itself so that the resulting droplets would be quarter spherical shape and directly react with molecules on the glass surface. Since glass surface is the most widely used surface for immunoassay or other chemical treatments, this method can be used for most of the processes where higher concentration is needed.","It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.
