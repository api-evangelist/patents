{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This document generally relates to systems and methods for use with data profiling. More specifically, this document relates methods and system for performing data profiling in-memory.","Data profiling is the process of analyzing source data and gathering information inherent to its internal metadata, data structures, content, relationships, and derivation rules. Profiling allows the user to validate data quality and track anomalies, but also to discover metadata. Currently, data profiling requires that a system first extract data from a data source and place it into a memory. The process of transferring this data can take a lot of time. The result is that data profiling is a slow process, especially as the amount of data grows, including performing table-wide or even cross-table profiling.","The description that follows includes illustrative systems, methods, techniques, instruction sequences, and computing machine program products that embody illustrative embodiments. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the inventive subject matter. It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art that embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In general, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures, and techniques have not been shown in detail.","In an example embodiment, data profiling is performed in-memory, meaning that the data profiling occurs in the memory that is storing the source data. This reduces and possibly eliminates any need to transfer the data to another memory prior to profiling it. Additionally, this allows for the flexibility of allowing multiple clusters to work in parallel to perform the data profiling, further improving the speed of such profiling.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Here, an in-memory database system  may be coupled to one or more client applications , . The client applications , may communicate with the in-memory database system  through a number of different protocols, including Structured Query Language (SQL), Multidimensional Expressions (MDX), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Representational State Transfer (REST), and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In an example embodiment, unique SQL commands are created allowing the client application , to request that a particular data attribute calculation be performed by the in-memory database system . In essence, this allows the client application , to request that data profiling be performed without actually performing any of the data profiling calculations itself.","Data profiling computes different attributes from the data, such as minimum, maximum, mean, mode, percentile, standard deviation, frequency, variation, count, and sum. Additional metadata could include data type, length, discrete values, uniqueness, occurrence of null values, representation, and duplicates. For purposes of this document, all of these data profiling aspects may be performed as what is termed \u201cdata attribute calculations\u201d. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the data attribute calculations could also include other calculations not specifically described here.","Also depicted is a studio , used to perform modeling by accessing the in-memory database system .","The in-memory database system  may comprise a number of different components, including index server , XS engine , statistics server , preprocessor server , and name server . These components may operate on a single computing device, or may be spread among multiple computing devices (e.g., separate servers).","In an example embodiment, the index server  contains the actual data and the engines for processing the data. It also coordinates and uses all the other servers. In an example embodiment, new procedures are defined in the index server  to perform various data attribute calculations when requested by a client application , . In a further example embodiment, these new procedures are designed to receive and interpret SQL commands from the client applications , ","The name server  holds information about the database topology. This is used in a distributed system with instances of the database on different hosts. The name server  knows where the components are running and which data is located on which server.","The statistics server  collects information about status, performance, and resource consumption from all the other server components. The statistics server  can be accessed from the studio  to obtain the status of various alert monitors.","The preprocessor server  is used for analyzing text data and extracting the information on which the text search capabilities are based.","The XS engine  allows clients to connect to the database system  using HTTP.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["106","200","100","202","204"]},"The client requests can be analyzed and executed by a set of components summarized as request processing and execution control . The SQL processor  checks the syntax and semantics of the client SQL statements and generates a logical execution plan. Multidimensional expressions (MDX) is a language for querying and manipulating multidimensional data stored in OLAP cubes. As such, an MDX engine  is provided to allow for the parsing and executing of MDX commands. A planning engine  allows financial planning applications to execute basic planning operations in the database layer. One such operation is to create a new version of a dataset as a copy of an existing dataset, while applying filters and transformations.","A calc engine  implements the various SQL script and planning operations. The calc engine  creates a logical execution plan for calculation models derived from SQL script, MDX, planning, and domain-specific models. This logical execution plan may include, for example, breaking up a model into operations that can be processed in parallel.","The data is stored in relational stores , which implement a relational database in main memory.","Each SQL statement may be processed in the context of a transaction. New sessions are implicitly assigned to a new transaction. The transaction manager  coordinates database transactions, controls transactional isolation, and keeps track of running and closed transactions. When a transaction is committed or rolled back, the transaction manager  informs the involved engines about this event so they can execute necessary actions. The transaction manager  also cooperates with a persistence layer  to achieve atomic and durable transactions.","An authorization manager  is invoked by other database system components to check whether the user has the required privileges to execute the requested operations. The database system allows for the granting of privileges to users or roles. A privilege grants the right to perform a specified operation on a specified object.","The persistence layer  ensures that the database is restored to the most recent committed state after a restart and that transactions are either completely executed or completely undone. To achieve this goal in an efficient way, the persistence layer  uses a combination of write-ahead logs, shadow paging, and save points. The persistence layer  also offers a page management interface  for writing and reading data to a separate disk storage , and also contains a logger  that manages the transaction log. Log entries can be written implicitly by the persistence layer  when data is written via the persistence interface or explicitly by using a log interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["206","208","300","302","304","304","302","306","308","214","310","312","314","316","318","316","320"]},"L infrastructure  includes a number of components to aid in the running of L procedures, including L-runtime (system mode) , L compiler , and L-runtime (User mode) .","As described briefly above, in an example embodiment, a technique is provided allowing data profiling to be performed in-memory, providing high quality calculations in little time. In this example embodiment, all relevant data is kept in main memory, so that read operations can be executed without requiring disk input and output. Additionally, data is stored in columns. This allows for the use of high compression techniques, high performance reading contiguous data for column operations, and parallelization of the column processing. In a column store, data is already vertically partitioned. This means that operations on different columns can be easily processed in parallel. If multiple column need to be searched or aggregated, each of these operations can be assigned to a different processor core and\/or computer cluster. In addition, the execution of operations within a single column can be further parallelized by dividing the column into multiple sections that are processed by different processor cores.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","400","400","402","400","402","400","402","402"],"i":["a","b","c ","a ","a","b ","b","c ","c","d. "]},"In an example embodiment, specialized client software may be run by one or more client machines interfacing with the database system. This specialized client software may be known as an information steward, and may combine the functionality for data profiling, metadata management, and data quality monitoring in a unified framework. The solution provides tools that help companies perform data assessments, view data lineage, and improve data traceability to support governance initiatives.","In another example embodiments, business objects data services software is run on the client. In such an embodiment, a single enterprise-class solution is used for data integration, data quality, data profiling, and text data processing that allows users to integrate, transform, improve, and deliver trusted data to critical business processes.","Since both types of software run data profiling and are located on clients, the various data profiling techniques described herein can be run on either type of software. More particularly, SQL or other database control statements can be implemented in either business objects data services software or information steward software, which then can be used to interface with an index server containing data attribute calculations. Therefore, while in the past such software would perform the data profiling itself, causing the previously mentioned delays, now the software can leverage the strength of the index server to greatly improve performance of data profiling techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},"Because the tests cover the replacement of the information steward profiling engine, it focuses on the same profiling attributes. Other profiling attributes, of course, can be derived using the same techniques.","In an example embodiment, any data attribute calculation that can be calculated using a SQL query can be implemented in a way to allow the information steward to generate such a SQL query. This would include data attribute calculations such as min, max, count, null counts, blanks, zeroes, and string length. For other data attribute calculations that may not be computed using pure SQL script, procedures and functions can be utilized. Examples of such other data attribute calculations include median and pattern.","SQL script is a high-level language used to control and manipulate the dataflow, allowing a developer to create high performance and concurrent execution code. When data transformation and complex data manipulation are necessary, extra support can be provided using the scalar language L. L is natively compiled, allowing the developer to implement high performance operators called from SQL script.","It should be noted that implementations using alternative programming languages, such as C++ and R, are also foreseen.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","606","602","604","608","602","610","604","612","602","600"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702","704"]},"As described above, the procedures used in the index server to perform the data attribute calculations may be written in SQL script and L language.
