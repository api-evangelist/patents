This invention also relates to immunoregulatory agents and their uses. In particular, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an immunoregulatory substance and its use for treating disorders related to an immune response.","The immune system functions are one of the biological function systems most essential to understanding the phenomenon of life. Essentially divided into self and non-self, the immune system is a biological defense mechanism with more than a trillion cells that control the maintenance of the living body by complex and dynamic processes, and without a tissue structure. However, because of this complexity and subtlety, failure of these functions generates a variety of diseases, including therapeutically difficult diseases. It is important to understand the inflammatory reactions in infectious diseases, auto-immune diseases accompanying tissue destruction, and rejection during transplantation.","Antigen invasion into cells in the first stages of inflammation is nonspecific, or occurs via antibody and complement receptors. Antigens taken up into cells are processed into peptide fragments, and presented to T cells as a complex with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In these antigen presenting cells (APCs) are dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, Langerhans cells, interdigitating cells, monocytes in peripheral blood, and so on; that is, the so-called professional APCs. Depending on differences in the expression levels of the coreceptor molecules CD80 and CD86, and differences in the type of cytokines that are produced, a bias will arise in subsequent helper T cell (Th cell) divisions. Th2 types, which are mainly concerned with humoral immunity under the influence of IL-4, are dominant over Th1 types, which play a large role in cellular immunity under the influence of interleukin-12 (IL-12). In this way, primary effector cells are activated, or antibody production is induced, and sensitization is established. At the same time, memory T cells and memory B cells are produced. Primary effector cells, starting from Th1 cells, include cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), mast cells, monocytes, macrophages, basophils, neutrophils, NK cells, platelets and the like. The action of cytokines, chemokinds, chemical mediators and such, which are produced by the activation of primary effector cells, activates vascular endothelial cells in the inflamed area. The activation of secondary effector cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils and so on, is induced, and inflammation arises. Finally, the inflammation reaction is suppressed by phagocytosis of causative substances or effector cell apoptosis by Fas\/Fas-L at the inflamed region, and transduction of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) inhibition signals by CTLA-4 and Fc\u03b3RIIB and so on.","The onset mechanism of autoimmune diseases is still unknown, however, research is progressing into where the cause of the above-mentioned process may lie. Despite the fact that in inflammation induction in post-organ transfer rejection and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is very clearly caused by the invasion of foreign antigens, these diseases are still not completely controlled.","Other than Th cells and CTL cells, as mentioned above, auto-antibody production and a variety of effector functions of complements, cytokines and the like contribute to the inflammation reactions accompanying tissue destruction that occurs with immune abnormalities such as autoimmune disease and rejection, GVHD and so on. To control these effector functions for disease therapies, a number of immunesuppression therapies have been attempted. Many of these targeted T cells, and thus, the focus in controlling immune abnormalities is becoming control of effector T cells. Therefore, the study of T cells as inflammation effector cells can be said to be extremely important for the treatment of immune abnormalities.","Based on the above, the present inventors focused on studies of CD26. CD26 positive T cells are Th1 type cells, a subset that very easily migrates to the inflamed region. They contribute to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and immune abnormalities such as rejections and GVHD, and are known to accumulate in diseased regions. Thus, by furthering the understanding of CD26 positive T cells, more pathology-specific therapeutic methods can be established.","CD26 is a widely distributed 110-kDa cell surface glycoprotein consisting of 766 amino acids with known dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC3.4.14.5) activity in its extracellular domain (Morimoto, et al., 1998; von Bonin et al., 1998). This enzyme is capable of cleaving amino-terminal dipeptides with either L-proline or L-alanine at the penultimate position. The expression of CD26 is enhanced after activation of T cells in a resting state. In addition, the CD4+CD26T cells respond maximally to recall antigens such as tetanus toxoid (Morimoto, et al., 1989). Accumulating evidence suggests that DPPIV enzyme activity plays a role in the immune response (Oravecz et al., 1997; Iwata, et al., 1999). Crosslinking of CD26 and CD3 with solid-phase immobilized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can induce T cell costimulation and IL-2 production by either human CD4+ T cells or Jurkat T cell lines transfected with CD26 cDNA (Tanaka, et al., 1992; Fleischer, et al., 1994). In addition, anti-CD26 antibody treatment of T cells leads to a decrease in the surface expression of CD26 via its internalization, and such modulation results in an enhanced proliferative response to anti-CD3 or anti-CD2 stimulation as well as enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules such as CD3\u03b6 and p56-Lck (Hegen, et al., 1997). Moreover, DPPIV enzyme activity is required for the CD26-mediated T cell costimulation (Tanaka, et al., 1993). A recent report showed that internalization of CD26 after crosslinking is mediated in part by the mannose-6-phosphate\/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P\/IGF-IIR), and that the interaction of CD26 and M6P\/IGFIIR plays a role in CD26-induced T cell costimulation (Ikushima, et al., 2000).","Maximal T cell activation requires both an antigen (Ag)-specific stimulus provided by an MHC peptide complex and a costimulatory signal (Lenschow, et al., 1996). Engagement of CD28 on the surface of T cells by B7-1 (CD80) or B7-2 (CD86) expressed on antigen presenting cells (APC) provides a potent costimulatory signal (Yokochi, et al., 1982; Azuma, et al., 1993; Freeman, et al., 1993; Lenschow, et al., 1996; McAdam, et al., 1998). CD28-B7 interactions lead to T cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine secretion (McAdam, et al., 1998; Chambers, 2001). In contrast, engagement of CTLA-4 on activated T cells by B7-1 or B7-2 results in an inhibition of T cell responses (Croft, et al., 1992; Walunas, et al., 1994; Krummel, et al., 1995). However, only CD28 is constitutively expressed, and hence it has an important role in the generation of T cell immune response (Fraser, et al., 1992; Caux, et al., 1994; Hathcock, et al., 1994; yi-qun, et al., 1996; Hakamada-Taguchi, et al., 1998; Manickasingham, et al., 1998).","Recombinant soluble CD26 (rsCD26) reportedly enhanced proliferative responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) to stimulation with the soluble antigen tetanus toxoid (TT) (Tanaka, et al., 1994). Amore recent report demonstrated that the target cells of rsCD26 were the CD14 positive monocytes in the peripheral blood, and that rsCD26 could upregulate CD86 expression, but not CD80 or HLA-DR antigen levels on monocytes (Ohnuma, et al., 2001). M6P\/IGF-IIR is thought to be one of the platform molecules for CD26 interaction with APC. However, while both DPPIV-positive and DPPIV-negative rsCD26 were taken up by monocytes via M6P\/IGF-IIR, only DPPIV-positive rsCD26 displayed an effect of CD86 upregulation on monocytes, thus suggesting that additional factors may interact with CD26 to directly induce CD86 upregulation on monocytes. Moreover, the molecular mechanism for the maximal response of CD4+CD26T cells to the memory antigens has not yet been clarified.","Caveolin-1 is the primary coat protein of caveolae, and is involved as a regulator of signal transduction through binding of its scaffolding domain to key signaling molecules in various cells (Smart, et al., 1999; Peiro, et al., 2000; Carver, et al., 2003). Although CD26 was present in caveolae of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (Riemann, et al., 2001), its direct binding or signaling event was not demonstrated in immune cells.","An objective of this invention is to provide a molecule that interacts with CD26 to directly induce CD86 upregulation on monocytes.","The present inventors attempted to identify CD26-interacting molecules directly involved in the upregulation of CD86 and found that CD26 bound caveolin-1 on APC, and identified that residues 201 to 211 in CD26 along with the serine catalytic site at residue 630, which constitute a pocket structure of CD26\/DPPIV (Rasmussen, et al., 2003), contributed to binding to the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1. Following binding of CD26 to caveolin-1 on APC, caveolin-1 was phosphorylated and released Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) from caveolin-1 into the cytosol. Moreover, release of Tollip from caveolin-1 led to phosphorylation of RAK (interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) associated serine\/threonine kinase), which links to activated NF-\u03baB, followed by upregulation of CD86 and subsequent engagement of CD28 molecule on T cells. CD86 upregulation resulted in potent T cell-APC interaction, leading to the development of activated memory T cells locally and activation of the immune response, and the consequence of various inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, the inventors found that caveolin-1 binds to Tollip and IRAK-1 in APC simultaneously.","The inventors showed here that CD26 was directly bound to caveolin-1 using a series of CD26 and caveolin-1 deletion mutants, and that caveolin-1 was phosphorylated following binding to CD26. Caveolin-1 was reported to be an integral membrane protein with a cytoplasmic N-terminal domain and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (Smart, et al., 1999). As shown in , the N-terminal domain of caveolin-1 was expressed on cell surface of monocytes 12-24 hrs after tetanus toxoid was loaded. Since tetanus toxoid was trafficked in cells through caveolae (Montesano, et al., 1982; Pelknans, et al., 2002), caveolin-1 may be transported with the peptide-MHC complex developed in APC, and be expressed on cell surface by antigen-processing machinery for T cell contact (Grakoui, et al., 1999; Turley, et al., 2000). The data shown in  indicates that CD26 on activated memory T cells directly faced caveolin-1 on TT-loaded monocytes in the contact area, which was revealed as the immunological synapse for T cell-APC interaction. It is conceivable that the interaction of CD26 with caveolin-1 on antigen-loaded monocytes resulted in the upregulation of CD86, therefore enhancing the subsequent interaction of CD86 and CD28 on T cells to induce antigen-specific T cell proliferation and activation.","By studying the crystal structure of CD26\/DPPIV, the horizontal helix of residues 201-207 was situated in front of the DPPIV enzyme active site at the serine residue 630. This small horizontal cavity allowed substrate amino acids to reach the active-site serine residue 630 and is involved in the DPPIV activity of CD26 (Rasmussen, et al., 2003). In this regard, this horizontal cavity has an essential role in caveolin-1 binding as well as DPPIV enzyme activity. In particular, CD26 mutants del 201-211 and S630A, in which this cavity was destroyed, had lost the ability to associate with caveolin-1 (, H, A, and B), and did not exert an effect on CD86 upregulation on monocytes (Ohnuma, et al., 2001). In addition, binding of CD26 to caveolin-1 was inhibited by the competitive inhibitor of DPPIV, valine-pyrrolidide (, n, o). The valine-pyrrolidide (Val-Pyr) is bound in a smaller pocket within the DPPIV enzymatic active site (Rasmussen, et al., 2003), and two glutamic acids in the horizontal helix of CD26, Glu205 and Glu206, form salt bridges to the free amino group of Val-Pyr. Thus Val-Pyr blocks the accessibility of amino acids to the enzymatic cavity. These findings explain the previous work showing that CD26 lacking DPPIV enzymatic activity could not induce the enhancement of TT-mediated T cell proliferation as well as upregulation of CD86.","One striking feature presented in this invention is that caveolin-1 was associated with Tollip in monocytes (). It was reported previously that Tollip was involved in IL-1R\/Toll-like receptor mediated signaling, and that it linked IRAK to NF-\u03baB, JNK and p38 MAP kinase (Cao, et al., 1996; Burns, et al., 2000). Other investigators described that Tollip was associated with Toll-like IL-1R\/Toll-like receptor and IRAK complexes, and that removal of Tollip from the complexes would allow signaling to continue by freeing activated IRAK to bind to downstream TRAF6 (Zhang, et al., 2002). Although IRAK was not detected in the complex of caveolin-1 and Tollip, CD26 and caveolin-1 were associated, and caveolin-1 was aggregated in the contact area, followed by caveolin-1 phosphorylation. Phosphorylated caveolin-1 subsequently released Tollip presumably due to conformational changes, and Tollip found in the cytoplasm then associated with IRAK for phosphorylation. The present inventors have now found that caveolin-1 and Tollip are complexed with IRAK-1 to form a triad (, C, and D).","We next explored the role of the 5\u2032-flanking region of the human CD86 gene in regulating expression of this gene following the interaction of CD26-caveolin-1. The cloning and functional analysis of a 1.3 kilo-base pairs fragment upstream of the transcriptional site of the CD86 gene indicated that two NF-\u03baB binding sites were required for the upregulation of CD86 after CD26-caveolin-1 interaction (). Moreover, in transcription factor assay of TT-loaded monocytes stimulated with CD26, levels of NF-\u03baB (p50 and p65) were detected to be significantly higher than those of STAT-1, or AP-1 (c-Fos, c-Jun) (). In this regard, several other factors, such as IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, or CD40-CD154 ligation, were also reported to be involved in the upregulation of CD86 (Berberish, et al., 1994; Li, et al., 1999; Gordon, 2002).","Since loss of caveolae in monocytes was not reported in a caveolin-1 knock-out mouse model (Drab, et al., 2001), and the role and distribution of CD26 in human may be different from that of mouse (Morimoto, et al., 1998), we utilized the RNAi method to analyze directly the function of native caveolin-1 in purified human monocytes. During the past several years, it is shown that RNAi is very effectively utilized in mammalian cells with sequence-specific, small (19- to 22-nucleotides) double strand RNAs (Elbashir, et al., 2001). Although this approach helps to identify the mammalian gene function, one important limitation is that siRNA-based technology only provides a \u201cknock-down\u201d of the targeted protein but not a \u201cknockout\u201d. Caveolin-1 is expressed constitutively in monocytes as well as other human tissues including endothelia, fibroblasts, and adipocytes, and treatment of purified human monocytes with siRNA resulted in knockout of caveolin-1 and inhibition of CD86 upregulation following stimulation with CD26-coated beads (). siRNA against Tollip in monocytes attenuated TT-loaded T cell proliferation induced by CD26 ( and C). Therefore, our findings strongly suggest that caveolin-1 and Tollip are directly involved in CD86 upregulation in monocytes.","On the basis of our results and previously reported findings, we propose a model to describe the signaling events in monocytes triggered by CD26-caveolin-1 interaction (). In this model, caveolin-1 is exposed to cell surface after tetanus toxoid is trafficked in monocytes, and CD26 induces aggregation and phosphorylation of caveolin-1 expressed in T cell-APC contact area, removal of Tollip and subsequent phosphorylation of IRAK. This sequence of events allows for activation of NF-\u03baB and transcription of the CD86 gene. Finally, the induction of CD86 expression and the interaction of CD86 on monocytes and CD28 on T cells resulted in the antigen-specific T cell activation and proliferation. In another model (), Tollip recruits IRAK-1 to caveolin-1 and release IRAK-1 following stimulation with CD26, bringing about CD86 upregulation. With regards to T cell-APC local interaction and immune response (), entry of recall antigens via caveolae into APC leads to presentation of antigen peptides on MHC class II molecules and exposure of caveolin-1. Then, APC induces the activation of memory T cells through TCR and costimulatory molecules such as CD86\/CD80-CD28, leading to formation of mature immunological synapse. Following the association between caveolin-1 on APC and CD26 on memory T cells, CD86 is upregulated on APC surface, and memory T cells are subsequently activated via the costimulatory effect of CD26 on enhancement of TCR activation (Hegen, et al., 1997). By enhancing TCR activation by CD26-caveolin-1 interaction, prolongation of immunological synapse may be maintained (Huppa, et al., 2003).","Patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and Graves' disease have been found to have increased numbers of CD26T cells in inflamed tissues as well as in their peripheral blood (Hafler, et al., 1985; Eguchi, et al., 1989; Mizokami, et al., 1996). In addition, enhancement of CD26 expression in these autoimmune diseases may correlate with disease severity. These findings imply that CD26T cells play a role in the inflammation process and subsequent tissue damage in such diseases. In endothelial cells, inhibition of the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 reduced inflammation by inhibition of eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase), which was bound to caveolin-1 (Bucci, et al., 2000). The present invention provides a new approach to the treatment of autoimmune diseases or other immune-mediated disorders by directly interfering with activated memory T cell and APC interaction. Moreover, targeting the interaction of the pocket structure of CD26 and the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 may lead to novel therapeutic approaches utilizing agonists or antagonists regulating antigen-specific immune response in not only immune-mediated disorders, but also cancer immunotherapy and viral vaccination as strategies to enhance immune response.","In one aspect, the present invention provides methods for identifying a substance that down-regulates or up-regulates an immune response and kits used for the methods. A method of this invention comprises detecting a substance that inhibits the interaction between CD26 and caveolin-1, in particular the interaction between the pocket structure of CD26 and the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1. Another method comprises detecting a substance that inhibits or enhances the interaction between caveolin-1 and Tollip, in particular the interaction between the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 and the C2 domain of Tollip. Still another method comprises detecting a substance that inhibits or enhances the interaction among caveolin-1, Tollip, and IRAK, in particular the interaction between the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 and the C2 domain of Tollip, and\/or the interaction between the CUE domain of Tollip and the CT domain of IRAK-1.","The present invention also relates to immunoregulatory agents that inhibit or enhance the CD26 signaling pathway. The term \u201cimmunoregulatory agents\u201d used herein include inhibitors, potentiators, antagonists, and agonists. Immunoregulatory agents that inhibit the CD26 signaling pathway may comprise an siRNA against caveolin-1 or an siRNA against Tollip as an active ingredient. The active ingredient may also be a substance obtained by the identification methods as mentioned above.","In addition, the present invention provides uses of immunoregulatory agents for treating inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, or other immune-mediated disorders.","The words \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d as used herein mean \u201cat least one\u201d unless otherwise specifically indicated.","One aspect of the invention involves methods of determining whether a substance modulates an immune response in an animal by modulating the stimulatory actions of CD26 on the immune system. This aspect involves methods of determining whether a substance modulates any action of CD26 or any downstream factor in the signaling pathway of CD26. In one embodiment, methods are provided for identifying a substance that down-regulates an immune response in an animal, comprising determining whether a substance inhibits an interaction between factors in the CD26 signaling pathway. In one embodiment, methods of determining whether a substance inhibits the interaction between CD26 and caveolin-1, in particular the interaction between the pocket structure of CD26 and the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1, are provided. In another embodiment, methods of determining whether a substance inhibits the interaction between caveolin-1 and Tollip, in particular the interaction between the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 and the C2 domain of Tollip, are provided. In a further embodiment, methods of determining whether a substance inhibits the interactions between caveolin-1, Tollip, and IRAK-1, in particular the interactions between the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 and the C2 domain of Tollip, and\/or the interaction between the CUE domain of Tollip and the CT domain of IRAK-1, are provided. In one embodiment, the methods are screening assays, wherein more than one substance is tested. In another embodiment, libraries of substances are tested.","Any method known in the art for identifying inhibitors of protein interactions or signaling may be used in the present invention. Techniques useful for the detection of protein interactions, e.g., binding, are well known in the art, and include, but are not limited to, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, two hybrid systems, fluorescent microscopy, and affinity chromatography. See, e.g., Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1988); Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning\u2014A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Vol. 1-3 (1989); Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New York 3rd Edition, (2000). Protein interaction assays may be carried out using whole cells, cell extracts or isolated proteins. Any cells which express the proteins of interest (e.g., CD26, caveolin-1, Tollip, IRAK-1, NF-\u03baB, CD86) may be used. The cells may express such proteins naturally (e.g., immune system cells such as T cells and monocytes) or recombinantly. Cells may be established cell lines (e.g., Jurkat T cells, THP-1 monocytes), newly created cell lines, or cells isolated from subjects, e.g., humans. For assays involving isolated proteins, the proteins may be naturally occurring or recombinantly expressed proteins. The proteins may be recombinantly expressed in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells. The proteins may be isolated by purification methods routinely used in the art, e.g., immunoprecipitation, affinity chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, or ion exchange chromatography. The proteins used in the assays may be wild type proteins or may be mutants comprising one or more additions, deletions, or substitutions. Full length proteins or truncated proteins comprising interaction domains may be used. For example, the scaffolding domain (amino acid residues 82-101) of caveolin-1 may be used. Similarly, the pocket structure of CD26 comprising the caveolin-binding consensus motif (amino acid residues 201-211) and amino acid residue 630 may be used. The C2 domain of Tollip (amino acid residues 47-178) may also be used. The proteins may be modified to include tags that are useful for purification and identification, e.g., glutathione-S-transferase, hemagglutinin, Flag, or one or more his.","Substances that may be tested in the methods for inhibitory activity include, but are not limited to, proteins, peptides, antibodies, nucleic acids, oligonucleotides, natural products, organic molecules, extracts, and libraries of these substances.","The effect of substances on protein:protein binding may be assayed by any method known in the art. Substances may be tested for the ability to block any binding interaction in the CD26 signaling pathway, e.g., the binding of CD26 and caveolin-1, in particular the binding of the pocket structure of CD26 and the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1, the release of Tollip from caveolin-1, the binding of Tollip and IRAK-1, or the binding of caveolin-1 and IRAK-1, in particular the binding between the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 and the C2 domain of Tollip, and\/or the binding between the CUE domain of Tollip and the CT domain of IRAK-1.","An example of a suitable assay is immunoprecipitation, e.g., using an antibody specific for a protein of interest to precipitate the protein of interest and any protein bound to it from a cell extract. For example, a GST-linked CD26 or caveolin-1 protein can be added to monocytes or an extract from monocytes and then precipitated using an anti-GST antibody. The precipitated protein is then separated by electrophoresis and any proteins that were precipitated along with the GST-linked protein are identified by Western blotting. The ability of a substance to block the immunoprecipitation of a protein indicates an inhibitory action on the binding of the protein to the antibody-bound protein.","Another assay that may be used to analyze protein:protein binding is affinity chromatography. A protein of interest may be linked to a suitable support material. Suitable support materials (e.g., Sepharose beads) and linkers are well known in the art. The protein of interest may also be bound by a binding partner which itself is linked to a support material (e.g., CD26 bound to adenosine deaminase-linked Sepharose beads). The linked protein is then contacted with a cellular extract such that proteins in the extract may bind to the linked protein. After washing away unbound proteins, any proteins that remain bound to the protein of interest may be eluted and identified, e.g., by Western blotting or peptide mass fingerprinting. The ability of a substance to block the binding of a protein to the linked protein indicates an inhibitory action on the binding of the protein to the protein of interest.","A further suitable assay is the two hybrid system. In this cell-based assay one protein of interest (e.g., CD26) is prepared as a fusion protein with a transcriptional activation domain and a second protein of interest (e.g., caveolin-1) which binds to the first protein of interest is prepared as a fusion protein with a DNA binding domain. When the two proteins of interest bind to each other the transcriptional activation domain and the DNA binding domain are brought together and alter the expression of a reporter gene linked to a regulatory element recognized by the DNA binding domain. The ability of a substance to block the binding of the two proteins of interest and thereby alter the expression of the reporter gene indicates an inhibitory action on the binding of the two proteins of interest.","In addition to protein binding, other types of assays that relate to the CD26 signaling pathway are included within the invention. These include detecting the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 or IRAK-1. Antibodies specific to the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of these proteins are commercially available (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif.; BD Transduction, Santa Cruz, Calif.) or more be raised using routine techniques well known in the art. The antibodies may be used to detect the level of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of each protein in whole cells, cell extracts, or solutions of purified proteins and other components. The ability of a substance to block the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 or IRAK-1 in response to activation of the CD26 signaling pathway indicates an inhibitory action on CD26 signaling.","Assays related to DNA binding and gene activation in the CD26 signaling pathway may also be used. Stimulation of the CD26 pathway results in activation of NF-\u03baB and upregulation of CD86 (B7-2) expression. Assays that detect the activation of the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB, e.g., the binding of NF-\u03baB to polynucleotides comprising one or more NF-\u03baB response elements in a reporter gene construct can be used to identify inhibitors of CD26 signaling. For example, assays can be performed using nuclear extracts from CD26-stimulated antigen presenting cells and oligonucleotides comprising one or more NF-\u03baB response element in a DNA binding assay. Whole cell assays may also be employed. For example, the upstream regulatory region of the CD86 gene contains two NF-\u03baB response elements. A reporter gene construct comprising the CD86 upstream region may be used to identify inhibitors of the NF-\u03baB activation that follows stimulation of the CD26 pathway by detecting a change in expression of the reporter gene. Any suitable reporter gene known in the art may be used, e.g., luciferase, green fluorescent protein, and \u03b2-galactosidase. The ability of a substance to inhibit the increase in reporter gene expression indicates an inhibitory action on CD26 signaling.","The increase in the level of NF-\u03baB protein or its two subunits (p50 and p65) in response to CD26 signaling can also be used to identify inhibitors of the CD26 pathway. The ability of a substance to inhibit the increase in p50 and p65 levels indicates an inhibitory action on CD26 signaling.","The measurement of expression of CD86, e.g., in whole cells in which the CD26 pathway has been stimulated, can be used to identify inhibitors of the CD26 signaling pathway. The cells may naturally express CD86 or may comprise a recombinant vector comprising the CD86 gene. The ability of a substance to inhibit the increase in CD86 expression indicates an inhibitory action on CD26 signaling.","The co-localization of interacting proteins (e.g., caveolin-1 and Tollip) can be assayed in living cells by transfecting cells with proteins fused to a sequence detectable in living cells, e.g., green fluorescent protein. The ability of a substance to block the co-localization of interacting proteins in the CD26 pathway indicates an inhibitory action on CD26 signaling.","Assays involving the detection of cellular interactions may also be used. For example, the interaction of T cells expressing CD26 and antigen presenting cells (e.g., monocytes) expressing caveolin-1 may be detected as a method of identifying inhibitors of the interaction between CD26 and caveolin-1. Activated T cells and antigen-loaded monocytes may be mixed to form conjugates, stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies, and the recruitment of CD26 and caveolin-1 to the contact area of the cells detected by confocal laser microscopy. To mimic the interaction of activated T cells and antigen-loaded antigen presenting cells, antigen presenting cells may be stimulated by contacting the cells with soluble CD26 or CD26-coated beads. The ability of a substance to block the recruitment of CD26 and caveolin-1 to the contact area of the cells indicates an inhibitory action on CD26 signaling.","In one aspect of the invention, kits are provided for identifying modulators of the CD26 signaling pathway.

The kits may be used to determine the level or function of at least one factor in the CD26 signaling pathway, e.g., CD26, caveolin-1, Tollip, IRAK-1, NF-\u03baB, or CD86. In this embodiment, a kit is provided, with one or more containers comprising at least one agent which may be used to determine the level or function of at least one factor in the CD26 signaling pathway.

Alternatively, or concurrently, administration may be by the oral route. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired.","The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are manufactured in a manner which is itself known, for example, by means of conventional mixing, granulating, dragee-making, dissolving, or lyophilizing processes. Thus, pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compounds with solid excipients, optionally grinding the resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired or necessary, to obtain tablets or dragee cores.","Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as saccharides, for example lactose or sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and\/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, as well as binders such as starch paste, using, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and\/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone.

Suitable carriers include vegetable or mineral oils, white petrolatum (white soft paraffin), branched chain fats or oils, animal fats and high molecular weight alcohol (greater than C12). The preferred carriers are those in which the active ingredient is soluble. Emulsifiers, stabilizers, humectants and antioxidants may also be included as well as agents imparting color or fragrance, if desired. Additionally, transdermal penetration enhancers can be employed in these topical formulations. Examples of such enhancers can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,989,816 and 4,444,762.","Creams are preferably formulated from a mixture of mineral oil, self-emulsifying beeswax and water in which mixture of the active ingredient, dissolved in a small amount of an oil such as almond oil, is admixed. A typical example of such a cream is one which includes approximately: 40 parts water, 20 parts beeswax, 40 parts mineral oil, and 1 part almond oil.","Ointments may be formulated by mixing a solution of the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, such as almond oil with warm soft paraffin and allowing the mixture to cool.

Second dimension SDS-PAGE was performed using 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Analytical gels were stained with SilverQuest Silver Staining Kit (Invitrogen). Peptide mass mapping was performed by recording peptide mass fingerprints of typical in-gel digests of the corresponding gel bands using MALDI-TOF MS (AXIMA-CFR plus; SHIMADZU BIOTECH, Kyoto, Japan) and subsequently searching the MASCOT database (Matrix Sciences, London, U.K.).","(16) T Cell Proliferation Assay","Freshly isolated monocytes (0.5\u00d710\/well) were transfected with siRNAs, preincubated with 0.5 \u03bcg\/ml of TT for 16 hours, followed by 24-hour incubation with srCD26 (0.5 \u03bcg\/ml). After washing with PBS, 1.0\u00d710\/well of the preincubated monocytes were then subjected to the assay with 1\u00d710\/well of purified T cells from the same donor. Proliferation of cells was monitored in all instances by measuring BrdU incorporation by ELIZA BrdU Kit (Roche) on day 7 of culture. Degree of proliferation is indicated as cpm in the ordinate. The experiments represent mean values\u00b1standard error calculated from 5 independently performed experiments.","(17) Statistics","Student's t test was used to determine whether the difference between control and sample was significant (p<0.05 being significant).","To identify CD26-interacting proteins in monocytes, the present inventors generated CD26-bound affinity columns with ADA-sepharose, since ADA is a CD26-binding protein (Kameoka, et al., 1993). Cellular extracts from the monocyte cell line THP-1 were applied to this CD26-ADA sepharose column. After vigorous washing, bound proteins were eluted using highly concentrated salt buffer. These proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Non-specific multiple bands were found in lanes of lysate, elution of ADA (mock) column, and washout solution after eluting through CD26-ADA columns (lanes 1-3 in ). On the other hand, three major bands were revealed in the elution of CD26-ADA columns (lane 4 in ). The protein bands specifically bound to CD26 on ADA columns were subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). With searching of the MASCOT database, obtained masses and apparent molecular weights of the different polypeptides revealed that the fraction eluted from CD26-ADA sepharose columns contained three major bands, and these bands were determined to be CD26, ADA and Caveolin-1 (). Since CD26-ADA beads were generated with passive conjugation, CD26 and ADA in the elution fraction might be contaminated from column beads. Caveolin-1 at approximately 20-25 kDa was strongly stained with silver in the elution fraction (lane 4), and was not detected specifically in the fraction through the mock ADA beads column (lane 2). These findings suggested that caveolin-1 was associated with the CD26 molecule.","To confirm the interaction between CD26 and caveolin-1 in living cells, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. THP-1 cells cocultured with soluble CD26 (sCD26) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either anti-caveolin-1 or anti-CD26 antibodies. Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-CD26 or anti-caveolin-1. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with the indicated antibodies. CD26 was detected by its specific antibody in lysates coimmunoprecipitated with caveolin-1 specific antibody (left panel of ). Endogenous caveolin-1 was detected in THP-1 (lower of left panel in ). Caveolin-1 was detected specifically with Western blots of lysates coimmunoprecipitated with CD26 specific antibody (upper of right panel in ). Endogenous CD26 was not detected in THP-1 (lower of right panel in ). Thus, the above results showed that caveolin-1 is the binding protein to CD26 in THP-1.","To determine the binding domain of caveolin-1 to CD26, we performed a GST pull-down assay using a series of GST-fused deletion mutants of caveolin-1 (), and CD26 transfected Jurkat T cells (J.CD26). GST-fused caveolin-1 and its mutants on glutathione sepharose (GSH) beads were incubated with J.CD26 cell lysate after preclearing with GST on GSH beads. Bound proteins and 1% amount of input lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-CD26 antibody, followed by stripping and reprobing with anti-GST antibody. As shown in , CD26 was co-precipitated with GST-Cav-1 wt, Cav-1 (1-101), and Cav-1 (82-178), but not with GST-Cav-1 (1-82), Cav-1 (102-178) and Cav-1 (del82-101), indicating that residues 82-101 of caveolin-1 is the binding domain to CD26. This domain is known as the scaffolding domain (SCD) of caveolin-1 (Smart, et al., 1999). To confirm these findings in living cells, we constructed GFP-fused full-length caveolin-1 and caveolin-1 lacking the scaffolding domain (del 82-101). After the GFP-fused caveolin-1 and its mutant were transfected into HEK293 cells, which expressed neither CD26 nor caveolin-1, Texas red conjugated CD26 (sCD26-TR) was added to the transfectants. Full-length caveolin-1-GFP, which was detected in surface membrane and perinuclear area (), was clearly merged with sCD26-TR (, c). On the other hand, since caveolin residues 61-101 was demonstrated to be necessary for oligomerization (Smart, et al., 1999), caveolin (del 82-101)-GFP lacking its scaffolding domain was localized diffusely (), and showed no evidence of interacting with sCD26-TR (, f). Although CD26-TR was slightly detected in HEK293 cells transfected with GFP alone (, h), CD26-TR was not associated with GFP ().","To determine the region(s) in CD26 responsible for binding to caveolin-1, we performed a GST-pull down assay using a series of GST-fused deletion mutants of CD26 produced by COS-7 cells (). To preserve the natural composition of CD26, we constructed a series of GST-fused deletion mutants of CD26 expressed in COS cells, using GST-fused proteins vector expressed in mammalian cells (Sanchez, et al., 1994). GST-fused CD26 and deletion mutants on GSH beads were incubated with THP-1 cell lysate after preclearing with GST on GSH beads. Bound proteins and 1% amount of input lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-caveolin-1 antibody, followed by stripping and reprobing with anti-GST antibody. As shown in , caveolin-1 was co-precipitated with GST-CD26 wt, and CD26 D3 (residues 31-429), but did not coprecipitate with GST-CD26 D1 (residues 507-766), CD26 D2 (residues 267-584), and CD26 del 201-211. These results suggested that amino acids 201-211 of CD26 were required for binding of CD26 to caveolin-1. This region in CD26 contains a caveolin-binding consensus motif (CBD) (\u03c6X\u03c6XXXX\u03c6XX\u03c6; \u03c6 and X depict aromatic residue and any amino acid, respectively) (Smart, et al., 1999), specifically VEEEVSA (SEQ ID NO: 12) (Tanaka, et al., 1992). Our previous report revealed that DPPIV enzymatic activity of CD26 was necessary to exert activation effect of TT-loaded monocytes (Ohnuma, et al., 2001). In this regard, caveolin-1 was not detected in complexes with GST-CD26 S630A, with DPPIV enzymatic activity being deleted (). To confirm these findings in living cells, we constructed GFP-fused full-length CD26, mutant lacking CBD (del 201-211) and mutant lacking DPPIV enzymatic activity (S630A). After the GFP-fused CD26 and mutants were transfected into HEK293 cells, Texas red conjugated caveolin-1 (cav-TR) was added to the transfectants. CD26 wt-GFP, CD26 del201-211-GFP and CD26 S630A-GFP were localized in cell surface membrane (, d, g). Cav-TR was colocalized in HEK293 cells transfected with CD26-wt-GFP (, c). In CD26 (del201-211) as well as CD26 S630A-GFP transfected cells, however, cav-TR was not detected (, f, h, i). Cav-TR was not observed in HEK293 cells transfected with GFP alone (, k, l). To confirm the role of DPPIV active site in binding of CD26 to caveolin-1, we used the competitive inhibitor of DPPIV, valine-pyrrolidide (Val-Pyr). After GFP-CD26 wt transfected HEK293 cells were treated with Val-Pyr (), cav-TR was added to the cells. Cav-TR was not observed in HEK293 cells transfected with GFP-CD26 wt after treatment with Val-Pyr (, o). To confirm CD26 binding activity other than DPPIV-related molecules, Texas red conjugated ADA was added to HEK293 cells transfected with GFP-fused wild type CD26 (wt) which were incubated with Val-Pyr (p-r). Since the binding of Texas red conjugated-ADA to CD26 was observed in HEK293 cells transfected with GFP-CD26 wt after treatment with Val-Pyr (, q, r), Val-Pyr did not change the nature of the transfectants as well as the binding activity of CD26. Taken together, CD26 is demonstrated to bind to caveolin-1 through CBD as well as the serine residue 630 in CD26 and the scaffolding domain in caveolin-1.","Caveolin-1 was demonstrated to be localized to the cytoplasmic membrane inner layer, toward the cytosolic side (Smart, et al., 1999). The inventors previously showed that rsCD26 upregulated CD86 on monocytes only after treatment with the recall antigen tetanus toxoid (TT) (Ohnuma, et al., 2001). Since TT was reported to be taken up by antigen presenting cells (APC) through caveolae (Montesano, et al., 1982; Pelkmans, et al., 2002), we examined a flip-flop event of caveolin-1 in monocytes after treatment with TT. After purified monocytes were incubated with or without TT for the indicated time periods in , cell surface caveolin-1 was stained with anti-caveolin-1 antibody detecting the N terminal region, followed by staining with anti-rabbit Ig FITC, and analyzed for % positive cells by flow cytometry. Caveolin-1 was detected on cell surface of monocytes 12-24 hours after treatment with TT (). On the other hand, caveolin-1 on untreated monocytes was not detected after 0-48 hours of culture. To further examine TT effect on caveolae, monocytes were treated with Filipin, which inhibits caveolae trafficking by dispersing cholesterol in cell membrane (Peiro, et al., 2000). Purified monocytes were preincubated with Filipin for 30 min, followed by incubation with or without TT for the indicated time periods, and then cell surface caveolin-1 was detected by the same method as described above. As shown in , caveolin-1 was not detected on monocytes treated with Filipin, even after TT was loaded. These data demonstrated that certain populations of TT-loaded monocytes were found to express caveolin-1 on cell surface.","Since CD26T cells strongly responded to memory antigens such as TT (Morimoto, et al., 1989), and activated CD26T cells are accumulated in the inflammatory regions (Morimoto, et al., 1998; von Bonin, et al., 1998), the inventors hypothesized that activated memory T cell-antigen-loaded monocytes interacted directly via surface expressed CD26 on T cells and caveolin-1 on monocytes. To further characterize these points, we examined potential colocalization of CD26 and caveolin-1 in T cell-monocyte contact site. For this purpose, activated peripheral T cells were mixed with TT-loaded monocytes, and conjugate formation was then initiated by centrifuging these cell mixtures. Thirty minutes later, cells were prepared for confocal laser microscopy as described in Example 1. First, without centrifugation after mixing, activated T cells and TT-loaded monocytes were attached to coverslips, fixed without permeabilization, stained with anti-CD26 (FITC) and anti-caveolin-1 (Texas red) antibodies. In these experiments, CD26 was detected exclusively on activated T cells ( a), and cell surface caveolin-1 was detected exclusively on TT-loaded monocytes ( b, c). These results are consistent with previous report showing that T cells did not express caveolin-1 (Galbiati, et al., 2001) and resting monocytes did not express CD26 (Morimoto, et al., 1989). To form cell-cell conjugation, activated T cells and 24-hour TT-loaded monocytes were mixed, followed by centrifugation. Following incubation for 30 min, conjugates were attached to coverslips, fixed without permeabilization, stained with anti-CD26 (FITC) and anti-caveolin-1 (Texas red) antibodies. CD26 and caveolin-1 were recruited in the contact area of activated T cells and TT-loaded monocytes ( to i). Quantification of cell conjugation between T cells and monocytes was performed as follows. After purified monocytes were incubated with or without TT for the indicated time periods in , T cell-monocyte conjugation was formed and stained as described in Example 1. For inhibition study of caveolae formation, purified monocytes were preincubated with Filipin for 30 min, followed by incubation with or without TT for the indicated time periods, and then subjected to T cell-monocyte conjugation assay by the same method as described above. The results are shown in . As shown in caveolin-1 expression study (), conjugation formation of activated T cells and TT-loaded monocytes was increased in monocytes with TT loaded for 12-24 hrs (solid circle in ). Cell conjugation was not detected in TT-untreated monocytes or with Filipin-treated monocytes (open circle, solid triangle, and open triangle in ). These data suggested that memory CD26+ T cells interacted with antigen-loaded monocytes through interaction of CD26 on T cells and caveolin-1 expressed on monocytes.","The present inventors focused on caveolin-1-mediated signal transduction events and determined whether such events upregulate CD86 expression following CD26 binding to caveolin-1 on TT-loaded monocytes. To stimulate TT-loaded monocytes with CD26, we used CD26 coated polystyrene latex beads to mimic the physiological interaction of CD26 expressed on peripheral T cells and TT-loaded monocytes. TT-loaded monocytes were incubated with polystyrene latex beads coated with wild type CD26 (wt) or deletion mutant CD26 lacking the CBD (del201-211). After attachments to coverslips, conjugates were fixed without permeabilization and stained with anti-caveolin-1 antibody, followed by staining with anti-rabbit Ig FITC antibody. Cells and beads were visualized by confocal laser microscopy.  shows that beads coated with wild type CD26 engaged caveolin-1 on TT-loaded monocytes, whereas beads coated with mutant CD26 lacking CBD did not alter caveolin-1 expression on TT-loaded monocytes (). It is reported that in signaling events via caveolin-1, phosphorylation of caveolin-1 was implicated (Smart, et al., 1999). For this purpose, at various time periods following stimulation of TT-loaded monocytes by these beads, cell lysates were prepared for analysis. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-caveolin-1 antibody, and immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-phospho-caveolin-1 or anti-Tollip antibodies, followed by stripping and reprobing with anti-caveolin-1 antibody. Total cell lysates were also resolved by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-IRAK antibody. 0.5-10 minutes following stimulation with CD26 wt-coated beads, caveolin-1 was phosphorylated (), and the changes in intensity were shown as a bar graph in the bottom panel of . The signaling cascade leading to CD86 upregulation appears to involve a number of proteins, such as MyD88, IRAK, and Tollip (Medzhitov, 2001). MyD88 and IRAK contain the Toll-IL-1-receptor domain and the death domain for interacting with each other or the IL-1 receptor or Toll-like receptor (Medzhitov, 2001). Tollip contains a C2 domain (Protein kinase C conserved region 2), which was predicted, but not yet clearly demonstrated, to be associated with membrane lipids (Burns, et al., 2000). The C2 domain is a region containing approximately 130 residues involved in binding phospholipids in a calcium dependent manner or calcium independent manner. C2 domains are found in over 100 different proteins with functions ranging from signal transduction to vesicular trafficking. Calcium binding to the C2 domain of synaptotagmin induces little conformational change in the C2 domain, but calcium induces a change in the electrostatic potential to enhance phospholipid binding, suggesting the C2 domain functions as an electrostatic switch. In addition to electrostatic interactions, side chains in the calcium binding loops influence the binding of different C2 domains to either neutral or negatively charged phospholipids. Tollip C2 domain was not reported to be associated with calcium dependent action in the IL-1 receptor or Toll-like receptor signaling (Medzhitov, 2001). We therefore examined the potential involvement of these proteins in signaling cascade via CD26-caveolin-1 interaction. As shown in , Tollip was found in IP complexes with caveolin-1 pAb, and released from caveolin-1 2-5 minutes after CD26-caveolin-1 interaction (between 2 to 5 min, Tollip was not detected in IP complex with caveolin-1 pAb). At these time points, IRAK showed hyperphosphorylation () by Western blot analysis. It should be noted that neither MyD88 nor IRAK-4 was observed in the complexes (data not shown). On the other hand, caveolin-1 was not phosphorylated after stimulation with mutant CD26 (del201-211) beads, nor release of Tollip, nor shift of IRAK (). These results suggested that the Tollip-IRAK cascade was triggered by CD26-caveolin-1 interaction.","Previous reports demonstrated that Tollip was present in a complex with IRAK, and that recruitment of Tollip-IRAK complexes to the activated IL-1 receptor or Toll-like receptor complexes led to activation of NF-\u03baB (Cao, et al., 1996; Burns, et al., 2000). The above results suggested that Tollip in monocytes was present in a complex with caveolin-1. We next examined in detail the association between caveolin-1 and Tollip. IP study in monocytes shown in  and C revealed that caveolin-1 was associated with Tollip. In living cells, Tollip was partially colocalized with caveolin-1 in THP-1 cells transfected with GFP-fused caveolin-1, especially in surface membrane (, b, and c). Endogenous caveolin-1 was detected by its specific antibody in THP-1 cell lysates coimmunoprecipitated with a Tollip specific antibody (left panel in ). Endogenous Tollip was also detected by anti-Tollip antibody in THP-1 cell lysates coimmunoprecipitated with caveolin-1 specific antibody (right panel in ). These results indicate that caveolin-1 on monocytes associates with endogenous Tollip in THP-1 cells.","To further determine the binding domains of Tollip-caveolin-1 complexes, we performed a GST-pulldown assay using a series of GST-fused caveolin-1 and GST-fused Tollip mutants (). GST-fused caveolin-1 and deletion mutants on GSH beads were incubated with THP-1 cell lysate after preclearing with GST on GSH beads. Bound proteins and 1% amount of input lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Tollip antibody, followed by stripping and reprobing with anti-GST antibody. Similarly, using GST-fused Tollip and deletion mutants on GSH beads, immunoblotting with anti-caveolin-1 antibody was performed. As shown in , Tollip was coprecipitated with GST-Cav-1 wt, Cav-1 (1-101), and Cav-1 (82-178), implying that the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (residues 82-101) was required for binding to Tollip. As shown in , caveolin-1 was coprecipitated with GST-Tollip wt, Tollip (47-274), Tollip (1-178), and Tollip (47-178). These results revealed that the C2 domain of Tollip (residues 47-178) was associated with caveolin-1 interaction. Taken together, after ligation of caveolin-1 on TT-loaded monocytes by binding of CD26, caveolin-1 was phosphorylated and released Tollip, associated with phosphorylation of IRAK in monocytes.","The data above suggested that IRAK might play a role in CD86 upregulation in monocytes as a downstream event of CD26-caveolin-1 interaction. Previous studies reported that IRAK phosphorylation was associated with TRAF6 to induce activation of NF-\u03baB, JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAP kinase (Cao, et al., 1996). We next identified the transcriptional factors activated by CD26 in the presence of TT-loaded monocytes. TT-loaded monocytes were stimulated with CD26-coated beads for 2 hours or PMA, and harvested for extraction of nuclear proteins (NE). Each 6 \u03bcg of NE with or without the specific competitor oligonucleotides was subjected to ELIZA-based DNA-binding protein assay. In this experiment, we detected significant levels of p50 and p65 NF-\u03baB components in nuclear extracts of TT-loaded monocytes stimulated with wild type CD26 (right panel of ). The increase in p50 and p65 NF-\u03baB levels was inhibited by the specific competitor oligonucleotides (left panel of ). Levels of AP-1 (c-Fos and c-Jun) and STAT1 were not detected in nuclear extracts of TT-loaded monocytes stimulated with wild type CD26 (). These results suggested that NF-\u03baB was activated via IRAK phosphorylation after Tollip was released from caveolin-1. We next examined whether NF-\u03baB binding sites were required in the human CD86 promoter regions for activation, since previous reports revealed that GAS elements (gamma-interferon activation sites) and NF-\u03baB binding sites were present and required for activation of CD86 transcription (Li, et al., 1999). For this purpose, we constructed a series of luciferase chimera mutants of 5\u2032-flanking promoter region of human CD86 (). Using these luciferase mutants, we tested CD86 promoter activity after CD26-caveolin-1 interaction. Twelve hrs after HE 93 cells were cotransfected with CD86-promoter luciferase constructs and wild type caveolin-1 expressing vectors, wild type soluble CD26 (rsCD26 wt) or mutant rsCD26 del 201-211, lacking 201-211 residues, was added to the culture media, and incubated for an additional 20 hrs. Cells were harvested for measurement of luciferase activity and protein concentration. In the same manner, luciferase assay was performed using HEK293 cells cotransfected with pGL3-Luc\/1181 or pGL3-Luc\/basic, and wild type caveolin-1 expressing vectors, various concentrations of wild type soluble CD26 (rsCD26 wt) or mutant rsCD26 del 201-211, lacking 201-211 residues. In the presence or absence of GAS elements (pGL3-Luc\/1181 and pGL3-Luc\/783), luciferase activity was not affected following stimulation of TT-loaded monocytes with CD26 (). On the other hand, two NF-\u03baB binding sites in the promoter regions were required for activation of CD86 transcription following CD26 treatment in caveolin-1 expressed HEK293 cells (). In contrast, significant activity in single NF-\u03baB luciferase construct (pGL3-Luc\/409) was not detected (). It should be noted that no significant activity in NF-\u03baB luciferase was observed in cells treated with rsCD26 or cells with caveolin-1 alone. Moreover, an enhancement in luciferase activity was observed with increasing doses of rsCD26 wt in HEK293 cells transfected with pGL3-Luc\/1181 and caveolin-1 (). This dose dependent luciferase activity was not observed following stimulation with CD26 del201-211. These results showed that NF-\u03baB activation downstream of caveolin-1 resulted in the upregulation of CD86 in TT-loaded monocytes stimulated with CD26.","To examine CD26-caveolin-1 interaction and its functional consequences more directly, we performed siRNA experiments utilizing freshly isolated monocytes. We first tested whether siRNA was successfully transfected into primary monocytes. Purified monocytes were transfected with Texas red conjugated mismatched siRNA (siRNA-TR), using HVJ-E vector. After 24 hrs of transfection, cells were attached to coverslips, fixed, stained with anti-CD14-FITC, and visualized by confocal laser microscopy. As shown in , more than 95% of monocytes were transfected with siRNA-TR, using HVJ-E (Hemagglutinating Virus of Japan Envelope) vector and centrifugation method. We next examined by Western blot analysis whether siRNA against caveolin-1 was effective in knocking down caveolin-1 protein levels in transfected monocytes. We prepared 2 sets of specific siRNA against caveolin-1 (ss1 is targeted for +81 to +101 of caveolin-1 gene and ss2 for +138 to +158) as described in Example 1. Purified monocytes were transfected with or without sense-siRNA as described above or mismatched siRNA, using HVJ-E vector. 48 hrs later after transfection, cell lysates were prepared, resolved by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-caveolin-1 antibody, followed by stripping and reprobing with anti-\u03b2-actin antibody. As shown in , both of these siRNA effectively knocked down caveolin-1 expression in monocytes. Since caveolin-1 in monocytes was not significantly knocked down by mismatched siRNA or HVJ-E vector alone, this inhibitory effect by siRNA was specific. We next examined whether CD26 exerted its effect in monocytes in which caveolin-1 expression was knocked down by siRNA. Purified monocytes were transfected with or without siRNA using HVJ-E vector, followed by treatment with TT. After stimulation with CD26-coated beads, cells were subjected to analysis of surface CD86 expression by FCM. Monocytes were identified by gating of CD45-Cy Chrome and CD14-PE positive population. CD86 was upregulated among a significant population of TT-loaded monocytes stimulated with CD26 wt-coated beads (right of upper panels in ). On the other hand, sense siRNA (ss1 and ss2) inhibited this effect on CD86 upregulation in TT-loaded monocytes (middle and right of lower panels in ). Mismatched siRNA did not exhibit this inhibitory effect (left of lower panel in ). Changes in CD86 expression were clearly demonstrated in , demonstrating that knockdown of the caveolin-1 expression resulted in the inhibition of CD86 upregulation in TT-loaded monocytes stimulated with CD26 (* and ** in ). These results suggested that caveolin-1 played an important role in signal transduction following CD26 binding to TT-loaded monocytes, leading to the upregulation of CD86 in monocytes.","To confirm the association among endogenous caveolin-1, Tollip, and IRAK-1 in living cells, lysates of THP-1 cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with an IRAK-1 specific antibody and a Tollip specific antibody. After SDS-PAGE, Caveolin-1 was detected by Western blotting (). Tollip was also detected by its specific antibody in the immunoprecipitates with the IRAK-1 specific antibody (), while IRAK-1 was detected by its specific antibody in the immunoprecipitates with the Tollip specific antibody (). These results indicate that caveolin-1 and Tollip are complexed with IRAK-1 to form a triad.","Binding between Tollip and IRAK-1 has already been reported. The CUE domain of Tollip binds the CT domain of IRAK-1, and Tollip inhibits IRAK-1 phosphorylation. In other words, Tollip can be said to function as a negative regulator for IRAK-1. Furthermore, as shown in Example 5 above, Caveolin-1 scaffolding domain binds the Tollip C2 domain. Thus, to determine the binding domains of a complex among caveolin-1, Tollip, and IRAK-1 (), the following experiments were carried out.","A full-length Tollip (wt) and deletion mutants (47-274, 1-178, delC2, 47-178 (C2)) were tagged with FLAG. In addition, a full-length caveolin-1 and a full-length IRAK-1 were tagged with HA (cav wt-HA) and VSV (IRAK-1 wt-VSV), respectively. These proteins were coexpressed in COS cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody M2 agarose beads and were submitted to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Flag antibody (Tollip), anti-HA tag antibody (caveolin-1) or anti-VSV tag antibody (IRAK-1). Caveolin-1 was not coprecipitated with delC2 Tollip mutant (). IRAK-1 was not coprecipitated with either of 1-178 or 47-178 (C2) Tollip mutant, however, was coprecipitated with delC2 Tollip mutant. These results suggest that the possibility that the triad forms from the binding of the Tollip C2 domain to caveolin-1 and the Tollip CUE domain to IRAK-1.","Since it is also possible that caveolin-1 and IRAK-1 bind directly, the following experiments were performed. HA-tagged full-length caveolin-1 (HA-cav-wt), and HA-cav-d82 in which the scaffolding domain is deleted, were constructed. Also constructed were FLAG-tagged full-length Tollip (FLAG-Tollip-wt), and FLAG-Tollip-dC2 in which the C2 domain is deleted; and a VSV-tagged full-length IRAK-1 (VSV-IRAK-wt), and VSV-IRAK-dCT in which the CT domain is deleted. These proteins were coexpressed in COS cells and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated as described above. The results are shown in . Tollip and IRAK both co-precipitated when all full-lengths were expressed. Tollip co-precipitated when IRAK-dCT was expressed, but IRAK did not. Neither Tollip nor IRAK-1 co-precipitated when Tollip-dC2 was expressed. Thus, it was strongly indicated that caveolin-1 and IRAK do not bind directly, and that the Tollip C2 domain binds caveolin-1, and the CUE domain binds IRAK-1.","To examine a role of Tollip in a signal transduction through CD26-caveolin-1 interaction, T cell proliferation assay was performed following the procedure shown in . Western blot analysis showed that both of the siRNAs specifically knocked down the expression of endogenous Tollip (). When monocytes were stimulated with tetanus toxoid (TT) and rsCD26, only Tollip knocked down cells inhibited T cell proliferation (). These results suggest that Tollip plays an important role as a positive regulator in a signal transduction through CD26-caveolin-1 interaction.","From the above results, Tollip may recruit IRAK-1 to caveolin-1 and release IRAK-1 following stimulation with CD26, bringing about CD86, upregulation. When Tollip is reduced, recruitment of IRAK-1 to caveolin-1 may also be reduced, and thus signal transduction induced by CD26 may be reduced.","The present invention involves the discovery that CD26-caveolin-1 interaction plays a role in the upregulation of CD86 on antigen-loaded monocytes and subsequent engagement with CD28 on T cells, leading to antigen-specific T cell activation. CD86 upregulation resulted in potent T cell-APC interaction, leading to the development of activated memory T cells locally and activation of the immune response, and the consequence of various inflammatory diseases. The present invention provides a new approach to the treatment of autoimmune diseases or other immune-mediated disorders by directly interfering with activated memory T cell and APC interaction. Moreover, targeting the interaction of the pocket structure of CD26 and the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1, the interaction between the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 and the C2 domain of Tollip, and\/or the interaction between the CUE domain of Tollip and the CT domain of IRAK-1, may lead to novel therapeutic approaches utilizing agonists or antagonists regulating antigen-specific immune response in not only immune-mediated disorders, but also cancer immunotherapy and viral vaccination as strategies to enhance an immune response.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0172","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Azuma, M., Ito, D., Yagita, H., Okumura, K., Phillips, J.
