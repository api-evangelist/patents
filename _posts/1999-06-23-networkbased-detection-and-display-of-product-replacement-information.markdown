title: Network-based detection and display of product replacement information
abstract: A method and system for determining part replacement related information by an end user. A user scans an identifier associated with a part. A scanner interface automatically couples the scanned identifier to a network enabled browser. The browser automatically connects over a network connection to a remote database to retrieve replacement related information for the part, where such database searchable by the associated identifier. The retrieved replacement related information for the part is automatically displayed for the end user. The retrieved information may also contain information related to the part, such as related parts that also need to be replaced, along with instructions, concerns, and warnings related to replacing the part. This information may be processed by an expert-type system, allowing the end user to engage in an interactive session regarding the part replacement. This information may also include expert-system instructions, e.g., a rule-set or the like, allowing the expert system to interactively aid the end user in diagnosing the nature and/or extent of the part defect, and help the end user to effect proper maintenance.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention generally relates to locating vendors stocking a part needing replacement, and more particularly, to scanning an identifier affixed or associated with the part, and then retrieving potential vendors from a database of vendors.","We live in a technological era. As time progresses, common everyday items become increasingly more complex. Thus, when something breaks, it is no longer a simple task to identify what has broken, and where to obtain a replacement or repair. In particular, in a complex device, one broken part may signal required modifications or replacements for other parts that do not appear to need servicing. Thus, identification of all parts needing replacement can be a somewhat challenging task. The term \u201cpart\u201d is intended to refer to any replaceable device (or portion thereof), appliance, or other piece of equipment, such as refrigerators, pipes\/tubing, computing devices, bicycles, radios, computer peripherals (e.g., printers or print cartridges, and the like). The term \u201cpart\u201d is not intended to refer to any particular class of replaceable goods, such as high-tech components.","Thus, for example, a user might receive notification that a printer's print-head needs replacement. However, the printer manufacturer might also require, or strongly advise, that a related component also be replaced at the same time. Or, the manufacturer might advise that certain cleaning or other printer maintenance be performed when print heads are replaced. And, it is possible that the print head has not malfunctioned, but that another part has failed, causing an erroneous report of print head failure. These related issues and concerns are not properly identified and addressed by a simple notification that the print head has stopped functioning.","Or, a home heating system may fail. Here, however, there is likely to be no indicator suggesting what might have gone wrong, or where to begin searching for what has gone wrong. Although some devices, especially in the high-tech context, have become more adept at performing self-diagnostics to help determine what is wrong with a device (e.g., a light indicating printer head replacement), most devices are not capable of self-diagnostics. In the heating-system context, the failure may be due to a failure in a pilot light for an oil-based heating system, or a faulty fuel nozzle, a kink in a fuel line to the nozzle components, a clogged fuel line filter, or some other type of problem. Here, a manual inspection is required to determine what needs to be replaced, as well as manual identification of related parts (or other concerns) for a part that needs to be replaced. In the context of complex heating systems, this search can be difficult.","Naturally, a device can be expected to be shipped along with detailed instructions to aid in a problem-determination process. However, for complicated devices such as heating systems, computer network devices, etc., the instructions are typically used by an installer of the system. When a problem arises, the typical end-user may no longer have access to these instructions. In addition, assuming the end-use can identify what needs to be replaced, there still is the issue of locating a vendor for replacement parts.","Frequently, instructions propose a vendor (usually the manufacturer) for obtaining replacement parts. But, such advice may be very costly, and may also be stale by the time it is needed (e.g., the manufacturer or other listed vendors may no longer support the device). And, such instructions usually do not provide information to determine part inter-dependencies. Thus, necessary or suggested maintenance might not be performed simply because it is not known to be related to a particular part failure. And finally, even the best manual is of little use when, as noted above, the instructions are unavailable, lost or damaged, when they are needed.","What is needed, then, is a straightforward and efficient system for automatically identifying a part that has failed, and for determining related part failures or related replacement concerns for a failed part.","A method and system for determining part replacement related information by an end user. A user obtains an identifier associated with a part. A scanner interface automatically couples the obtained identifier to a network enabled browser. The browser automatically connects over a network connection to a remote database to retrieve replacement related information for the part, where such database is searchable by the associated identifier. The retrieved replacement related information for the part is automatically displayed for the end user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Shown is a computing device , which may be a typical computer (see e.g., FIG. ), or some other computing device capable of performing the described actions (e.g., a personal digital assistant (PDA), hand-held computer running Windows CE, etc.) (Note that all marks referenced herein are the property of their respective owners.) Executing on the computing device are scanning software , browser software , and a browser interface  to integrate the scanning software with the browser.","The browser  can contain typical browser portions such as a menu bar , toolbar , address field , client window  (shown containing a search form for initiating a search  and receiving results ), etc. However, the browser configuration may be controlled\/modified by the scanning software  and\/or browser interface . For example, browser portions - may be suppressed when an Application Programming Interface (API) (e.g., Microsoft Corporation's JDirect API), JavaScript, ActiveX, Java, or equivalent control system is used that provides direct control over the browser. In such a configuration, the browser may be configured to only show the client window  search form for performing an outgoing search  and receiving its search results . For example, the client window may be controlled by providing (e.g., setting the window's contents) Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and\/or Dynamic HTML (DHTML) page data for display.","The scanning software  is in communication with a scanner or other scan code source (not shown) through an input\/output port (not shown) (see, e.g.,  items , ). Alternate scan code sources include codes manually entered, such as by keyboard input, or by retrieval from a database containing scan data. The browser  is in communication with a network interface , such as a Network Interface Card (NIC), Universal Serial Bus (USB), or other networking implementation. This interface  provides access to a network , such as the Internet, by which information about scan data is obtained. As discussed further below with reference to , devices have associated scan codes, which are obtained (as scan data) and utilized to obtain information about a defective device.","Scan data corresponds to traditional bar code formats, as well as other formats not ordinarily considered a scan code, such as magnetic strips, text string identifiers (e.g., a brand name or product name) that is scanned or manually entered, and the like (see also  discussion)","After the scanning software  obtains scan data, the browser is directed to one or more Internet locations for obtaining further data corresponding to the scan input. In a simple configuration, a search query  is prepared and submitted to one or more search engines , , where the search query corresponds to the scan data. The search results , if any, are returned and displayed within the browser client window . The results will have to be reviewed and interpreted (e.g., by a user or other controlling program, such as an expert system).","In a more complex configuration, the search query  can be augmented with product data retrieved from a data storage , such as from non-volatile storage, CD-ROM, hard-disk, etc. that may accessible through a local attachment  to the computing device  (e.g., as an internal installed device), or through attachment  to the network . In this configuration, the scan data is used to search the storage  for further search terms, such as product name, description, manufacturer, etc. The search proceeds as before, however, the additional search information allows the one or more search engines ,  to perform a more refined search, and thus provide more relevant search results .","The scan data used to search the storage  need not correspond to a unique code such as a Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code. Instead, any distinguishing markings on the part could serve as keys for a database search. Note that product identifiers may only be \u201cpartially unique,\u201d e.g., unique only with respect to a particular manufacturer, but perhaps duplicated by other manufacturers. In cases where the markings correspond to multiple entries in the storage, a user could be presented with the list of matching items to select the desired item. However, the user is not required to select a particular entry from the list; if desired, all available information can be submitted as key terms for a search.","Although the storage  is depicted as a single database in , it could also be implemented as a set of database sources, possibly distributed across the Internet (see, e.g., , items , ). Manufacturers or product distributors can develop cross-reference web pages containing mappings between scan codes and product search keywords; these mappings can be expressed using Extensible Markup Language (XML), Standard Generalized Markup Language (SMGL), Microsoft's Channel Definition Format (CDF), or equivalent technology for describing data semantics. Links to cross-reference pages could be placed at well-known \u201ccross-reference hubs\u201d (e.g., common access points), or such pages can be associated with special keywords to enable part-search software (or generic search engines) to discover the linksthrough an initial Internet search. By this method, the storage  would not need to be centrally administered, allowing the search system to scale well.","In a still more complex configuration, the scanning software automatically processes the search results  and arranges them for a user. For example, search results from an Internet search will typically include general web pages located throughout the Internet, which would include web pages from manufacturers , , resellers , , etc., for a defective part identified by the scan data. The scanning software  can employ internal heuristics, such as weighted keyword evaluation of web site content, or other evaluative methods to help identify and categorize the results. If web sites employ XML-based content, XML tags can be used in addition to keyword searches to help identify pages to include in the search results. In addition, manufacturer and reseller can be recorded within storage , and utilized to help identify and categorize the search results . (This manufacturer and reseller data can be used in composing a search .)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","102","104","104","102"]},"For some devices, such as those that are small, fragile, extremely hot, etc., it may be impractical for the identifier to be affixed to the device as shown. In such circumstances, the identifier may be located in a different location, such as in a physical directory, or in an electronic database. If stored in a database, a scanner may not be required, since an appropriate bar-code can be located and directly submitted to scanning software. Alternatively, the database can be used to print out a copy of the bar-code, allowing it to be scanned. Note that an expert-type system can be used to aid in searching the database to identify an unlabeled device. Further, as noted above, any identifiable markings on the device could be used in conjunction with the database to obtain scan data for the device.","After obtaining the scan data, the data can be transferred  to a computing device. The computing device can be a separate computer-type device (see, e.g., FIG. ), to which is attached the scanner by cable or wireless technology (e.g., infrared (IR) link). Or the computing device may be integrated with the scanner (see FIG. ). Once the computing device has the scan data, a remote computing device  is contacted through a network connection. As shown, the network is a public access network , which includes networks such as the Internet, public corporate intranets, and other public-access networking infrastructures. The scanned code data is used to search through a database  on remote computing device .","The database  contains records  for each known device. This database may either be centralized or distributed across multiple entities on a public access network. The database records can include a product identifier  such as the scanned code data (the scanned data may be a subset of this identifier), a more human readable identifier , such as \u201cwidget\u201d or \u201cXYZ Co.'s widget\u201d, a list  of related \u201cgadgets\u201d to the widget (e.g., encompassing dependency data), other installation issues  (e.g., warnings or safety information), vendors for the widget (not shown), as well as other related product information (indicated by ellipses). The record can also contain cross-reference entries to capture interdependencies between different parts. For example, a linked-list can be defined to allow traversal of all related parts for a particular scanned (defective) part. Note that although this description assumes a database for storing part data, other structures, such as COM (Common Object Model) objects and Distributed-COM (DCOM) objects can also be used (e.g., via persistent storage and the like).","Once an appropriate record is located (e.g., by searching with the scanned code data), the record is inspected for registered vendors ,  for the damaged widget . This vendor data (e.g., name, address, telephone number, network address, etc.) is conveyed through the public network  to the contacting computing device . Other record data can be returned as well, and related records can also be retrieved (or retrieved later, if necessary or desired). There can be a large number of known vendors for a particular part. Thus, once potential vendors are identified, a list of available vendors can be prepared. An available vendor refers to one that has a particular part, or related part (e.g., as identified by the linked-list) in stock. However, \u201cavailable\u201d can also refer to satisfying other user requirements, such as a geographic preference or price. For example, a user may require that vendors be located within 10 miles of the defective part's geographic location. (Note that a default geographic proximity can be defined, such as 10 miles, or zero miles (e.g., no default).)","In addition to preferences relating to obtaining replacement parts, users can have preferences relating to performing the repair or maintenance. Some users have sufficient time and experience (given appropriate instructions) to effect the repair or replacement themselves. Others may prefer a professional service to perform the task (subject to price constraints).","To enforce user preferences, an expert-type system can be used to filter and organize data retrieved from the remote  (or local  (see following)) database. Expert system rules can be implemented as a Lisp, Prolog, or equivalent interpreted or compiled language program. However, for simple rules, where a user is only concerned about a few characteristics, such as price or location, the complexity and overhead of an expert system can be avoided through application of a series of if . . . then . . . else statements to parse retrieved data. If retrieved data is marked with semantic tags such as XML, parsing the data and interpreting its semantics is greatly simplified. An Extensible Style Language (XSL)-based transformation can be applied to retrieved XML data to filter, sort, and render the results of the search on the browser. (XSL is a template-based method for separating style from content when creating HTML or XML pages.) If semantic analysis is incorporated into the search and retrieval process, this information can be used to cull false hits from global searches performed with non-unique keywords.","Note that in some configurations, the computing device  may contain its own database  of device records . For example, this \u201clocal\u201d database may be mirror the remote database , or simply contain a subset of database entries. It is understood in the art that various methods exist for scheduling synchronization of distributed databases, if required. That is, databases may be distributed geographically, or according to predicted usage, and known methods may be used to ensure that each local database contains appropriate data. (Content can be limited to typical device entries, with higher-level databases responsible for further entries.) If a database request to a local database  fails to provide results, the request can be forwarded to an appropriate higher-level database (e.g., one or more remote databases ).","Once the vendor data , , or other record data, is received by the requesting computing device , this data may be used to aid a user in replacing a defective part. For example, the data can be simply presented to the user, allowing the user to pick a resource (from the list of available vendors and other locations) for obtaining a replacement part. Or, the data may include information about the defective part and its typical installation environment, where this information is fed to an interactive interface (e.g., an expert-type system) to help a user identify the nature of the problem, and aid in diagnosing a solution.","Thus, for example, assuming the user has scanned a print head from a printer, the interactive interface can inform the user that a print head has been scanned, and then ask the user various questions concerning the status of lights on the printer, hardware settings, the condition of various parts, and the like. With these responses, the interactive system can then identify the probable part failure as well as any related parts that may require replacement along with the print head. This system can also be used to determine that the scanned part might in fact not be defective, and that some other part may be broken. The degree to which an interactive system can aid the user depends on the depth of information stored about the part in the database(s) , .","Note that even if we assume that products are labeled with a UPC-type bar-code, the practical reality is that such codes are frequently lost. For example, typical consumer items place the code on the packaging\u2014once the packaging is discarded, a user no longer has a code to scan. A search on general product type, or model number, may retrieve an immense number of search results, since (as noted above) such identifiers frequently use common disignations. Thus, it is beneficial to allow manufacturers, suppliers, etc. to provide a cross-reference between descriptive markings on their products and a more precise product identifier. A search can then be performed at a hub to locate more precise information, such as distinctive product identifier, manufacturer data, etc. Usage of cross-reference hubs provides for narrower search results, since the context of the search is more refined than a typical \u201cgeneral\u201d web search.","Note also that as with most endeavors, implementing a cross-referencing system has its associated costs, such as manpower required to setup and maintain cross-reference sites, network service provider costs to maintain public access to the site, and other typical business costs. Consequently, a system can be implement where manufacturers are charged to have their products listed at a hub, allowing them the convenience of simpler product identifiers on their products, with the benefits inherent to targeting search results for a consumer needing to replace consumables. Such targeting can be arranged to always provide search results having the manufacturer given as a primary search result, thus increasing manufacturer business traffic.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["250","252"]},"After identifying  the part, the database is searched to identify  related parts. As discussed above, related parts are those parts that ought to be replaced along with a defective part. Typically, such related parts do not appear to require replacement. A search for related parts can be performed through a linked-list type data structure that can be maintained by cross-referencing database records. Other linking methods can be used as well.","After identifying  related parts, the database can be searched  to identify related issues, such as installation instructions, ordering methods or requirements, safety tips, etc. For example, if the defective part were a printer toner cartridge, a related concern might be cleaning internal printer parts before installation of a new cartridge. These concerns can be presented to a user to guide proper replacement of a defective part.","Given the part, related part, and other related data, user preferences are obtained  (they may already be present as stored preferences) and used to cull the retrieved data according to the user preferences. That is, a list of all potential vendors is identified , and per user preferences, a list of available vendors is identified . In addition to state user preferences, other preferences can be implied, even if not specified by the user, e.g., the system can require that a replacement part be in vendor stock for the vendor to qualify as being available. Ones skilled in the art will also recognize that search optimizations can be used to streamline the retrieval process (e.g., SQL query optimizations). That is, rather than obtaining a list of all vendors in advance, as such a list may be quite large, user preferences can be obtained first, and then used to speed up the search process.","For example, user preferences can be reviewed to identify the most uncommon preference, and this preference can be used to reduce the search set, thus making the search more efficient. Assume preferences are (1) vendors within 50 miles, and (2) a cost of less than $50. If the retail value of the part is $75, then there are going to be few, if any, vendors offering the part for $50. But, there may be many vendors within 50 miles of the part to be replaced (note that geographic references are presumed to concern part locations versus vendor locations, and not user location versus vendor location). Thus, a set of all possible vendors can be significantly reduced by first applying the cost constraint, and then, if any potential vendors remain, applying the second geographic constraint. But, for clarity of presentation, it is assumed herein that no particular search optimizations are performed.","After identifying available vendors , these vendors can then be sorted  according to certain user preferences. For example, the user may desire to sort available vendors according to price, and then by nearest vendor location, and then by expected delivery time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["300","302"]},"The output  from the input sensor  is a signal corresponding to the data being seen by the input lens . The output is input to scanner circuitry  which receives and processes the scanned data. The scanner circuitry generally includes a central processing unit  (CPU) and logic control code . There may also be RAM\/ROM or other memory storage, if needed, for operation of the device. It is understood that the CPU  and logic control code may be encoded as dedicated circuitry for performing the scanning task, or may be implemented as a special-purpose integrated circuit. However, since the scanning device may be configured to include local database information, as well as other computing device functionality, the scanner is depicted in a more general form amenable to such more-advanced configurations.","Also shown is a trigger mechanism  that can be used to control activation of the lens  and input sensor. In an emitter\/receiver configuration, the trigger causes appropriate emissions and checking for received scan data. In a CCD context, the trigger causes a snapshot to be taken of what the CCD is currently receiving as input data. Depending on the CCD configuration, the CCD may be unpowered until the trigger causes power to be provided to the CCD, and the CCD subsequently reads to obtain scan data.","Also shown is an input\/output port  to allow the scanning device to be attached to a computing device, such as a home computer, personal information manager, advanced cellular telephone, and the like. However, with the possibilities afforded by advanced microelectronics, the external computing device may instead be integrated within the scanning device itself. If completely integrated, then input\/output port  can be an external interface for a network interface card allowing the scanner to contact the public switched network directly (see FIG. ). The external (or integrated) computing device receives the scanned data from the input\/output port , and can then begin the process of identifying and ultimately replacing a scanned part (and its related parts).","FIG.  and the following discussion is intended to provide a brief, general description of suitable computing devices (see, e.g., , item ) with which the invention may operate. And, even though the invention and related computing devices may be described by reference to different high-level program modules and\/or low-level hardware contexts, one skilled in the art realizes that program module references can be interchanged with low-level instructions and hardware encoding.","Program modules include procedures, functions, programs, components, data structures, and the like, that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The modules may be incorporated into single and multi-processor computing systems, as well as hand-held devices and controllable consumer devices. It is understood that modules may be implemented on a single computing device, or processed over a distributed network environment, where modules can be located in both local and remote memory storage devices (see, e.g., , items , ).","An exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a computing device  having system bus  for coupling together various components within the computing device. The system  bus may be any of several types of bus structure including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of conventional bus architectures such as PCI, AGP, VESA, Microchannel, ISA and EISA, to name a few. Note that only a single bus is illustrated, although plural buses typically achieve performance benefits. Typically, attached to the bus  are a processor , a memory , storage devices (e.g., fixed , removable , optical\/laser ), a video interface , input\/output interface ports , and a network interface .","The processor  may be any of various commercially available processors, including Intel processors, or the DEC Alpha, PowerPC, programmable gate arrays, signal processors, or the like. Dual, quad processors, and other multi-processor architectures also can be used. The system memory includes random access memory (RAM) , and static or re-programmable read only memory (ROM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS), stored in ROM, contains routines for information transfer between device  components or device initialization.","The fixed storage  generally refers to hard drive and other semi-permanently attached media, whereas removable storage  generally refers to a device-bay into which removable media such as a floppy diskette is removably inserted. The optical\/laser storage  include devices based on CD-ROM, DVD, or CD-RW technology, and are usually coupled to the system bus  through a device interface , , . The storage systems and associated computer-readable media provide storage of data and executable instructions for the computing device . Note that other storage options include magnetic cassettes, tapes, flash memory cards, memory sticks, digital video disks, and the like.","The exemplary computing device  can store and execute a number of program modules within the RAM , ROM , and storage devices ,, . Typical program modules include an operating system , application programs  (e.g., a web browser or network application program), etc., and application data . Program module or other system output can be processed by the video system  (e.g., a 2D and\/or 3D graphics rendering device), which is coupled to the system bus  and an output device . Typical output devices include monitors, flat-panels displays, liquid-crystal displays, and recording devices such as video-cassette recorders.","A user of the computing device  is typically a person interacting with the computing device through manipulation of an input device . It is expected that the input device is a scanner as depicted in FIG. . However, other common input devices include a keyboard, mouse, tablet, touch-sensitive surface, digital pen, joystick, microphone, game pad, satellite dish, etc. One can also provide input through manipulation of a virtual reality environment, or through processing the output from a data file or another computing device.","The computing device  is expected to operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computing devices. One such remote computing device  may be a web server or other program module utilizing a network application protocol (e.g., Hyper-Text Transport Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Gopher, Wide Area Information Server (WAIS)), a router, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements discussed for the computing device . The computing device  has a network interface  (e.g., an Ethernet card) coupled to the system bus , to allow communication with the remote device . Both the local computing device  and the remote computing device  can be communicatively coupled to a network  such as a WAN, LAN, Gateway, Internet, or other public or private data-pathway. It will be appreciated that other communication links between the computing devices, such as through a modem  coupled to an interface port , may also be used.","In accordance with the practices of persons skilled in the art of computer hardware and software programming, the present invention is described with reference to acts and symbolic representations of operations that are sometimes referred to as being computer-executed. It will be appreciated that the acts and symbolically represented operations include the manipulation by the processor  of electrical signals representing data bits which causes a resulting transformation or reduction of the electrical signal representation, and the maintenance of data bits at memory locations in the memory  and storage systems , , , so as to reconfigure or otherwise alter the computer system's operation and\/or processing of signals. The memory locations where data bits are maintained are physical locations having particular electrical, magnetic, or optical properties corresponding to the data bits.","Having described and illustrated the principles of the invention with reference to illustrated embodiments, it will be recognized that the illustrated embodiments can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles.","What is claimed as the invention, is all such modifications as may come within the scope and spirit of the following claims and equivalents thereto."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
