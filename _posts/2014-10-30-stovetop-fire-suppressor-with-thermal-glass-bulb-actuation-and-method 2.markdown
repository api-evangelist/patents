title: Stovetop fire suppressor with thermal glass bulb actuation and method
abstract: An automatic stovetop fire suppressor using a compressed spring to lower a bottom lid upon thermal glass bulb fracture is provided herein. A plastic lid seals on the bottom of a can and forms a closed container. The closed container is filled with a fire suppressing agent. A compressed spring extends when a thermal glass bulb fractures. The extending spring lowers the bottom lid to open the closed container. Fire suppressing agent flows out of the radial opening, suppressing a stovetop fire with minimal or no splashing of cooking oil. A center post is secured to a top wall of the container. A ledge, or bottom support, secured to the container catches the bottom lid to limit the radial opening height. A gradual release of a fire suppressing agent in a desired distribution pattern and method of gradual and spatial agent release can be provided with a cone-shaped bottom lid.

No. 14\/246,024 claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/943,017, filed 21 Feb. 2014, the entire contents of which are also incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to a device and method of fire suppression, and more particularly to an automatic stovetop fire suppressor using thermal glass bulb actuation.","Stovetop fires are a well-known residential and commercial hazard. An unattended stovetop fire, for example a grease fire, can cause damage to nearby appliances and cabinets. Worse, stovetop fires can lead to structural damage or injury. Because the propensity for stovetop fires is so pervasive, an efficient means of automatic fire suppression is desired. Even if a stovetop fire is attended, an automatic extinguishing method may be more effective and expedient compared to manual means.","A number of conventional automatic stovetop fire extinguishers, which mount above the stovetop surface, are available. These include: U.S. Pat. No. 6,105,677 to Stager using pressurized liquid; U.S. Pat. No. 6,276,461 to Stager using a pendulum device; U.S. Pat. No. 4,813,487 to Mikulec using a fluid under pressure device; U.S. Pat. No. 5,899,278 to Mikulec using fluid under pressure; U.S. Pat. No. 7,472,758 to Stevens and Weintraub using a fuse activated initiator; U.S. Pat. No. 5,518,075 to Williams using a self-contained device with fire suppressing powder-like agent; U.S. Pat. No. 4,256,181 to Searcy using pyrotechnic fuse; U.S. Pat. No. 5,297,636 to North using fluid under pressure; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,351,760 to Tabor using fluid under pressure.","The array of conventional fire suppression systems vary from pendulum swing apparatus (Stager '461), to canister systems (Williams '307 and Stager '677), or to tube connecting systems for fire suppressing liquid effluent under pressure (Mikulec '278, '487). The array of conventional fire suppression systems also vary across activation forms, for example, by: melting of a fusible pin (Stager '461); melting a solder fusible plug (Stager '677); melting solder and wire activation (North '636); melting a link (Tabor '760); to burning of a fuse (Williams '307, Stevens '758, Searcy '181); or to activating via a glass bulb fuse mechanism (Mikulec).","Conventional stovetop fire suppressors can include pressurized fluid with complex mounting mechanisms or may include a swinging pendulum mount. Liquid effluent stovetop fire extinguishers may be activated by melting of a meltable material, such as solder. Conventional stovetop fire suppressors with a particulate fire suppressing agent may activate by pyrotechnic charge containing initiators. Still other conventional pressurized liquid effluent stovetop fire suppressors may activate by thermal glass bulb.","In a stovetop fire condition, it may be desirable to provide a controlled release of a fire suppressing agent both in a pattern of distribution of the agent and in the release of the agent as a function of time. It is most desirable to an provide an early, reliable, and quick response to a fire condition. It may be desirable to provide a fire suppressor device in a closed container that is readily mounted above the stovetop cooking surface.","The present invention addresses some of the issues presented above by providing a controlled release of a fire suppressing agent via a thermal glass bulb activation in an automatic stovetop fire suppressor. Embodiments of the present invention may have any of the aspects below. Aspects of the present invention are provided for summary purposes and are not intended to be all inclusive or exclusive. Embodiments of the present invention may have any of the aspects below.","Conventionally, a fire suppressing agent deploys in a bulk release upon rupture of metal segments. It may be desirable to provide a gradual release of fire suppressing powder or powder-like agent over time. A gradual release over time may enable decreased or eliminated splash of liquid on the stovetop, which may be burning cooking oil. Further, a broader or directed distribution of the released fire suppressing agent may be desired. In addition, it may be desirable to eliminate the need for an initiator charge. A self contained stovetop fire suppressor which employs an activation method using a United Laboratories (UL) rated fuse may be desirable.","By departing from an activation process that includes the rupture of metal segments in a bottom container wall and by implementing an activation process which incorporates the release of compressed spring energy to deploy, to lower, a bottom lid, the present invention can employ a thermal glass bulb initiator. The thermal glass bulb initiator provides a multitude of desirable qualities to the automatic stovetop fire suppressor device and method. As applied in embodiments of the present fire suppressor invention, these qualities include predictable, consistent, early, and quick activation of the fire suppressing device.","One aspect of the present invention is to provide a user friendly method of suppressing a stovetop fire.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an automated release of fire suppressing agent in the presence of a stovetop fire.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a flow of fire suppressing agent upon activation of the stovetop fire suppressor.","Another aspect of the present invention is a mounting device and method, or compatibility with the same, which affords full and proper function of a stovetop fire suppressor mounted beneath a vent hood.","Another aspect of the present invention is to be compatible with a convenient mounting device for a micro-hood stovetop environment.","Yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide a consistent release of fire suppressing agent upon activation of the stove top fire suppressor.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a gradual release of fire suppressing agent over time.","Another aspect of

from the closed container.","Still another aspect of the present invention is the use of plastic for the bottom lid of the fire suppressor container.","Another aspect of the present invention is the containment of the fire suppressing agent in a closed container from manufactured end to activation of the device in a fire condition.","Another aspect of the present invention is a method of releasing the fire suppressing agent upon lowering of the bottom lid.","Another aspect of the present invention is the use of a thermal fuse bearing the UL Mark in the initiator of the fire suppressing device.","Another aspect of the present invention is open air exposure of a thermal sensitive fuse above the stovetop cooking surface.","Another aspect of the present invention is the positioning of the thermal sensitive fuse on an outer side of and beneath a bottom plastic lid.","Another aspect of the present invention is the ability to vary the distribution pattern of the fire
