title: Media mashup system
abstract: A media mashup system functions as a virtualizable endpoint called an Intelligent Multimedia Pod, or IMP, that ensures a reliable and high-quality multimedia user-experience for a variety of mobile user devices such as intelligent phones etc. The media mashup platform uses a web 2.0 media mashup model that offers several key features including Near Real Time (NRT) service continuity, control-proxy for a mobile-friendly web-surfing experience, finely-filtered content aggregation based on meta-data, context sensors and buddy blaster content sharing/recommendation. These features are brought together using a web 2.0 service mashup model that integrates media meta-data together with various context sensors including mobility-related sensors such as location and presence, time-of-day, voice commands, as well as time-shifted playback.

Access to these services are limited to paid subscribers and the choices of media is limited to what is being offered on the channels at a particular time. In other words, there is no notion of on-demand viewing. Furthermore, the cost of deployment is prohibitive because of the need to use specialized single-purpose hardware. Other services such as \u201cOrb\u201d require the use of specialized players that are hard to install on mobile devices. Yet another kind of offering is a media search that provides a low-quality catchall type of service of media clips that caters to the lowest common denominator of phones.","Media sharing is achieved primarily via email as attachments. The problem with this approach is that it subjected to length restrictions by the device and service providers. In addition, there is no guarantee that the media will render well enough to play on a particular phone.","The disclosure is directed to an architecture of a media mashup platform providing a variety of media-related services for users of handheld\/mobile client devices such as intelligent phone devices. There is particular emphasis on a function referred to herein as a \u201cbuddy blast\u201d function\u2014a dynamic, stream-aware clipping and forwarding function made possible using a combination of techniques including automatic segmentation of clips that enables user initiation of buddy blasts from within use of a media object. The buddy blast feature is used to dynamically share media from one person to his friends. Other supporting features include Dynamic Contextualization, Media Circles, and Virtual Streaming.","Dynamic Contextualization gives the system intelligence to perform device detection to determine the format of the media, length of the media and type of delivery (streaming or download) that a particular device can handle. This allows the system to send, upon request made from the recipient, a representation of the media compatible with the client's device is delivered to the client and contextualized by advertisements associated with the recipients current location, time, and interests.","Media Circles are dynamic groups for sharing based on attributes for sharing instantly among friends selected by metadata attributes (interest, location, etc). The groups are dynamically selected using the interests of the media selected for sharing as a key to match the interests of the friends. The results of the match are then selected for sharing the media. The media circle is personal in that it reflects the group of friends associated with the sender.","Virtual Streaming allows a stream to be dynamically adapted to a particular end user's context including time, location, end-device and activity-derived preferences in a scalable manner. Each context change is sensed and forwarded to the User-Interaction Engine for dynamic adaptation of content to the user's context. The adaptation includes the selection of appropriate content to present to the user as well as the appropriate advertisement to show to the user.","Rich media is very useful but requires a lot of bandwidth and is usually made for lengthier consumption at the desktop or home. On a mobile device, there is not enough bandwidth and the user has limited attention span. Hence, a snackable version of rich media is very useful for the end user. To implement this, we have made innovations in the area of content ingestion where a rich media file is automatically prepared by segmenting and transcoding to various bit-rates and formats suitable for mobile consumption. A system of references, also called \u201cmedia markers\u201d, is used to pass only a reference to a particular portion of the media to the recipient. This avoids sending the actual stream which could unnecessarily tie-up resources. In addition, the recipient is able to read and make comments around the referenced portion of the media. These comments are displayed together with the media using a media-mashup mechanism described below.","The system has intelligence to perform device detection to determine the format of the media, length of the media and type of delivery (streaming or download) that a particular device can handle. This allows the system to send, upon request made from the recipient, a representation of the media compatible with the client's device is delivered to the client and contextualized by advertisements associated with the recipients current location, time, and interests. In another embodiment, the client request is routed to a data center that is ideal in relation to the client in order to satisfy the request based on the client's location. In addition, media that need to be assembled before delivery are \u201cmashed up\u201d or combined together, such as in a pre-roll ad, based on specific mashup rules that enable the creation of a final representation of the media object.","Among the novel aspects of the presently disclosed media mashup platform and methods are the following:\n\n","Disclosed herein is a ubiquitous (device- and network-neutral) software realization of a virtualizable endpoint called an Intelligent Multimedia Pod, or IMP, that ensures a reliable and high-quality multimedia user-experience for a variety of mobile user devices such as intelligent phones etc. The media mashup platform uses a web 2.0 media mashup model that offers several key features including Near Real Time (NRT) service continuity, control-proxy for a mobile-friendly web-surfing experience, finely-filtered content aggregation based on meta-data, context sensors and buddy blaster content sharing\/recommendation. These features are brought together using a web 2.0 service mashup model that integrates media meta-data together with various context sensors including mobility-related sensors such as location and presence, time-of-day, voice commands, as well as time-shifted playback.","Increasingly, the web offers interesting services and media. However, most of these are directly enjoyable only on desktops. The disclosed system brings similar experiences to handheld (mobile) devices using a ubiquitous endpoint virtualization software that enables each handheld device become an IMP. This provides a way to transition Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) to mobile devices while at the same time coping with a range of capabilities found in these devices.","Each IMP can both receive and transmit key pieces of data called \u201cmetadata\u201d to bring alive the media entertaining experience. For example, one can store manually or automatically via sensors of location, time, user identity, etc. store on metadata associated with each clip or song playback information that can aid the present user or his peers in enhancing his media experience. In addition, freely distributable (viral) media as well as bits of Javascript, may be propagated via a peer-to-peer service using a Bittorrent-like client among the IMPs. Note that the IMP not only consumes but also generates entertainment via the metadata mechanism.","The IMP can be extended by virtualizing it to include a collection of handhelds and a desktop\/server system referred to as a \u201cPeerPC\u201d, which may itself be virtualized by a hosted PeerPC-Service. In the latter case, the service access point also naturally is a service control point. We refer to this service as the Mash Media Service and the platform delivering the service as a Mash Media Platform. In the rest of this document, references to a PeerPC generally apply equally to a Mash Media Platform.","The intent of creating a PeerPC is to explicitly recognize the boundary between the broadband wireline world and the wireless handhelds which may experience poor bandwidth and occasional dropouts due to being out of coverage or running out of power. The combination of metadata and viral distribution can further enhance a user's experience by being able to define the UI based on any available mashup. Thus, one could envision peers discovering interesting UI mashups (between metadata and webservices) to enable interesting user-created ways of exploring media. For example, ads or multimedia entertainment could be selected based on location and time rather than merely blasting it out to an unresponsive user.","Other features offered by the service include NRT service continuity including offload to a PeerPC in the event of a total outage or for battery preservation. Also, other service-enhancing mashups could result from mashups with social networking services to enable finding peers with similar media interests via metadata clues.","Benefits of the system to the end user are: (1) a seamless entertainment using informed selections through metadata-based fine-filtering and peer-recommendation; (2) continuous service monitoring and media discovery with power-saving and security for the mobile environment; and (3) customization (for UI and ads) based on device, identity, time and location.","The IMP may be viewed as composed of a native web 2.0 widget engine with multiple plug-in modules (both local and remote) that implement individual features and functions. In addition, each module may offer an XML-based API that enable other modules to take advantage of the services of that module in a manner similar to how high level mash-up services are implemented. Examples of such modules are the ID management module and the display virtualization module.","The guiding principles in the design are inspired by the following Web 2.0 phenomena:\n\n","The IMP extends the reach of desktop web entertainment services onto mobile handheld devices. It provides near always-on access to the connected world via progressive downloads or store-and-forward services of online multimedia streams. Quality of user experience, Access security and Control are of paramount concerns. For copyrighted content, DRM (Digital Right Management) policies are preferably observed.","In addition, it is assumed that as WiFi access points and Wimax infrastructure continue to expand its footprint, new IP services will quickly emerge, replacing traditional voice services and creating new near real time mobile services with rich media that have never been seen before. The IMP assumes that while \u201clegacy 3 G\u201d services are necessary, the integration of WiFi and WiMax will be the inflection point for all IP services to explode.","Experience Sharing","The system advances the user experience (UE) sharing concept. UE includes not only a linear stream of actions but also a non-linear stream with possible branching, which is made possible by mashing up of the media. This will enable further last minute orchestration that suits the user. Thus, it is possible to have a set of UEs encoded associated with an experience but orchestrated according to the context. In the case of external events, each UE instance could be a user-generated experience that is shared via the community and merged.","Let us consider three cases: a conference, a tour, and a piece of media such as a baseball game.","In the conference, the UE metadata could refer to various times at which various events are occurring that are specific to a particular topic of interest. These UEs could be created by specialists and user-contributed, are then merged together and republished by the conference organizers.","In the tour example, the UE metadata could refer to various locations at which special exhibits or highlights are being showcased. Again the UEs could be user-contributed and merged and republished.","In the ball game example, the UE data could refer to special portions of the video that highlight exciting moments as well as focus on a particular player's actions.","Social Networking","Social networking is a key aspect of the user experience. The sharing of UE was discussed above. In addition, the system can enable the limited sharing of media via streaming or progressive download. The limits are to ensure fair use and should not normally pose a problem. In addition, there is the need to embed applications of the system within existing social networks such as FaceBook or MySpace.","Communities are possible via informal invitations to view content. The PeerPC owner must specifically give access to his friend, implying that there is a registration with a centralized server which is referred to as a \u201cSeedPC\u201d herein. While this is going to exercise the underlying mechanisms, we expect that most users would prefer to leverage their existing memberships in other web logins such as IMs (AOL, Yahoo, MSN) or Communities (FaceBook, MySpace), etc. For the IMs, there are APIs to login available via a web service API.","Each PeerPC may serve as a media aggregation point for one or more clients. In addition, there could be clients that are only listeners. Thus, it enables the concept of a Personal Media Community much like a home for your media content. Note this leverages the storage and computing power of the desktop. In addition, by combining the power of multiple desktops, or in the case of a server platform, the combined storage capacity, bandwidth, and processing power of the community is amplified. All the while, each PeerPC offers to the rest of the community the ability to listen to the personal media collection of the owner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","12","14","16","18","10","10","20","20","22"]},"The items in the upper part of  (stream servers , proxy clients  etc.) constitute the PeerPC in one embodiment. The PeerPC may be physically realized by one or more conventional server-type computer systems, each including one or more processors, memory, I\/O circuitry for connecting to a network, and storage (e.g., magnetic disk storage).","The client handheld  may have a hardware organization as shown in ). The device  includes various hardware sensors  (location and orientation sensors, touch-screen sensors, etc.) and RF interface circuitry  which are connected to a processor  by interconnect circuitry . The RF interface circuitry provides the interface to the wide-area wireless (e.g. cell) network. The processor  is coupled to memory  which includes volatile as well as non-volatile (e.g., flash-programmable) storage. The user interface is rendered on a display , which is preferably touch-sensitive to provide for flexible, software-defined user input.","System actions include the following:\n\n","As shown in , the proxy clients  retrieve content from external sources by emulating a media client. The media is delivered either as a real-time stream or by progressive download (also called byte range http). In both cases, the retrieved media is stored in the media library .","Thus, this new model enables the PeerPC-Service to be in constant pull\/push from the Internet\u2014as seen in news feeds, RSS, internet TV\/radio, stocks, weather, chat\/twitter as well as email. Feeds are aggregated using the mashup of metadata embedded in the media and from other sources including environmental signals, 3rd party web services, and peer-generated tags.","Buddy Blast","This feature lets a user send to his buddies (up to a small limit), an instant \u201cblast\u201d of the stream that he is listening to. The user could also optionally view the stream later in a time-shifted manner. The idea is to be able to share via the PeerPC a live stream that you are viewing on the handheld\u2014instantly. This is like an instant message, except the stream is beamed over to the peer. Of course, it means that the \u201cbuddy\u201d gets a notification such as an IM (Instant Message) which he clicks and immediately the stream is available for his consumption. The recipient is sent a link to the version of the media that is compatible with the recipient's context as determined by context sensors of the device detection and bandwidth detection. This stream in all respects is like a stream that originates in his PeerPC with the exception that he cannot save it unless he has the right credentials or it is DRM-free.","MetaData","The system distinguishes itself with the range of metadata that may be associated with any media clip. The definitions of the metadata are in the Appendix. The basic operations with the database are summarized as follows.\n\n","PeerPC Architecture","The PeerPC has to perform several functions as described earlier.  describes the high-level conceptual architecture of the PeerPC. Note that many of these functions are separated into multiple computer systems in a hosted version of the media mashup platform.","The main functional blocks of this design are: the PeerPC ; the PeerServer ; and the HandHeld client . The key functions of these blocks are listed below.","I. PeerPC","1. Peer Server Authentication","Every time the PeerPC  boots up it registers itself with the PeerServer . At this time, it gets the credential-checking code and is able to allow handheld clients  to join its PeerGroups.","2. Client Community Authentication\/Manager\/P2P","The client must authenticate itself to the PeerServer  and receive a timed-ticket that serves as a credential that may be presented to the PeerPC  to enable it to access a PeerGroup.","3. Station List","The PeerPC  initially gets a station list of Internet streaming media sites from the PeerServer . This is a seed list that is then used to start the collection of stations that is \u201ccontextualized\u201d for the specific user.","4. MetaData Library","The PeerPC  also maintains a MetaData library that is extracted from the Station List via a metadata extraction applet that is downloaded from the PeerServer  (initially). This applet either uses a web-service API or html-parsing (screen-scraping) to perform the extraction. Note that this functionality may not be legally performed at the PeerServer . To speed up the library creation and to encourage collaboration the discovered metadata may be shared among peers in a PeerGroup. This functionality is called \u201cMetaCast\u201d.","In addition, there is the notion of metadata such as ratings and comments that is user contributed. The idea is to enable user participation in creating metadata for video content. This is especially useful for user-generated content such as video clips because there is almost no metadata available. Even for regular programming, user-generated metadata is very useful as a objective trusted metadata along the lines of Wikipedia.","5. Storage from Media Stream","The PeerPC  preferably stores streaming media in local buffers in order to support the NRT functions of (a) de-jittering (removing delay variation from the stream); and (b) time-shifting (letting the user play a stream at any time of his choosing including fast forward and rewind).","Note that the media could include any of the following:\n\n","6. Directory Manager","The PeerPC  presents to the user a list of the media available (both live and recorded) after filtering it through a metadata filter. This filter is based on contextual clues including user-tastes, location, time, PeerGroup profiles, etc. The filter is also a sorting-filter in that it sorts and filters the metadata.","7. Stream\/Cached Proxy\/Local Ad Insertion (Optional)","The PeerPC  inserts local ads by splicing an advertisement clip into the stream to the client. This requires identification of the ad-slots in the stream and a splicer that switches between the ad file and program file respectively, or that plays a pre-stitched stream.","8. Manager for Client","This function is the control proxy for the handheld. Its purpose is to offload the client UI and adapt it to suit a handheld environment. Some of the envisioned offload are: one-button selection of program streams; remembering client state from last use; aggregation of streams into a single stream to the handheld; instant buy button; instant share button.","9. Community Statistics Aggregation","The PeerPC  (together with the handheld) collects useful statistics that are then contributed to statistics on the media in the community. This enables a better collaboration on media selection.","Typical statistics collected by the PeerPC  include:\n\n","10. Mashup","The functionality here is to use signals such as (location, time, buddy presence, etc.) together with metadata from media to get an integrated experience that provides a multidimensional media experience such as:\n\n","etc.","11. Location","A very useful feature here is the concept of a \u201cPersonal Media Station\u201d. The point is to be able to support the notion of location-specific Internet media that is locally-generated by the users at a particular location. Thus, a user can \u201ctune\u201d in to a local PeerGroup and listen\/view content that is specific to that location. The idea is that a \u201cpublic\u201d area is enabled for the PeerGroup content that can be accessed by someone in the vicinity. The location is keyed by the GPS-coordinates that is then used to access the PeerPC  serving the content at that location.","12. Presence of Contacts and Buddy Blast","This functionality refers to the detection of buddies online via their IM clients and the possibility of beaming them content that might be of mutual interest. Of course, a buddy might choose to remain inconspicuous mode and therefore not receive any Buddy Blast.","13. Ad Entertainment","Usually Ads are sent out to people without any relevance to their tastes, preference, location, etc. Moreover, the ads are pushed rather than pulled. This assumption is turned on the head in this feature where ads are selected by the user based on preference and then shown to pay for the service. Thus, metadata of the ad is used to match the user's taste, location, and style.","II. PeerServer","1. Authentication","The PeerServer  authenticates each client and registers each PeerPC . It is responsible for creating credentials including an encrypted expiry time that allows a client access to a PeerGroup in which it has membership.","2. PeerGroup Location","The PeerServer  enables a client to locate a PeerGroup by a process similar to DynamicDNS. Each PeerPC  registers and maintains a heartbeat with the PeerServer . It constantly updates the PeerServer  with its IP address which is subject to change from time to time. The client has to reach the PeerPC  via port . This should work by enabling the router to map port  requests to the PeerPC  via uPnP. In the case of older routers, the NAT Traversal (described below) is needed. In the short term, the PeerServer  can be used to relay requests back and forth.","3. Station List","The PeerServer  has a station list of Internet Media Sites with associated metadata that it uses to seed a PeerPC  that registers with it. In addition, this list could serve as a global PeerGroup (default) for clients that do not have a private PeerGroup.","The PeerServer  preferably maintains a list of PeerGroups that are currently registered as well as their status (ACTIVE\/INACTIVE).","4. Statistics","The PeerServer  is responsible for aggregating statistics that are uploaded by PeerPC as part of the on-going heartbeat. The intention is to provide global statistics on all media including ads and make it available to content owners and publishers in order to support marketing efforts.","Other statistics of interest at this level include PeerGroup sizes as well as distribution of content by location and time\u2014very valuable to content publishers.","III. Client","1. PeerPC Authentication","A Client Handheld needs to initially authenticate itself with the PeerServer  via a well-known URL. A successful authentication will give it a set of credentials as well as the URL of the PeerGroup that it seeks to enter. The default PeerGroup is used when none is requested during the authentication.","2. Community Authentication","A Client must then seek to authenticate to the community PeerGroup that it seeks to access. This is achieved by presenting the credentials it received from the PeerServer  and via the URL that it also received from the PeerServer . Upon successful authentication it can gain access to the PeerGroup by getting the welcome page of the PeerGroup.","3. Getting Station List","A Client can get a station list from either the PeerServer  (via the default PeerGroup) or from the Welcome page of the PeerGroup it was trying to enter.","4. UI\/Applet","A Client must display the java applet that it receives from a PeerPC . This applet implements the Welcome page of the PeerGroup and contains among other things several menus and lists that access the media hosted by the PeerGroup.","This is described under the UI section below.","5. Invoke Player","The Client must be able to invoke a media player to play the media hosted by the PeerGroup. One of the standard players such as WMV, QT, and Real are assumed to be available. In addition, the player could be invoked in the context of a browser frame in order to offer the PeerMeta controls as well as important features such as BuddyBlast and InstantBuy.","6. Statistics (Collection)","The Client must be able to collect usage stats as discussed earlier under PeerPC. These are generated even and held in memory even when offline in order to upload to the server.","7. Location Sensor","The Client must implement a location sensor via GPS (preferred) or via an alternative technique such as IP address or MD. The intent is to be able to locate the device in order to appropriately contextualize the ads as well the media playlists and personal media stations.","Service Building Blocks","The following system architecture exposes the underlying building blocks of the system. We describe service-centric and resource-centric views.","Service-Centric View","The service-centric view is illustrated in ) and ().","The main portions of this diagram are the Database  and its DB access components  that are the interface to the database. This connects with the service-oriented architecture (SOA) component  that translates incoming representational state transfer (REST) requests to internal DB commands. The remaining major pieces are Ruby  and the Streaming Engine . The Ruby code  implements key service blocks of the system including any scrubbers (for metadata extraction), social networking interaction, Ad-network interaction, CDN (Content Delivery Networks), CMS (Content Management Systems), and interaction with the local file system for personal media discovery and cataloging. The Streaming engine  contains the components of the system and is described below in the hardware resource-centric view.","The widget engine  and the handset  are external to the system and interact via the SOA layer with the rest of the system. Thus, the UI on the handset  for example is a page that is constructed by the system and delivered in XML format to the widget engine  for rendering to display on the handset .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0139","num":"0230"},"figref":"FIG. 3(","i":"c"},"Note the XML-based feed ingestion, the REST-based user-generated content (UGC) upload API and the FTP-based media ingestion. A content provider publishes a feed that the mash media platform ingests, and in this feed is a link to a media that is ingested via FTP. The UGC consists of user photos and videos that are uploaded via an API that enables the user to specify meta data.","The interfaces to the social networks are via REST or email.","The middle portion of the diagram depicts the functions of the mashup engine which integrates the various CMS inputs via keyword metadata matching and filters based on the personalization for user context. Segmentation of the media in to small chunks capable of being played on mobile devices, transcoding to appropriate formats, and the stitching of ads to video are all done at this point.","In the media publishing subsystem, the page and media are delivered to the end points based on the chosen delivery method: data center, CDN, or Cloud\/p2p. The analytics interfaces enables third party verification of site visits. Ad network interfaces provide delivery of ad banners, cpc, etc. as well as video ads.","As mentioned elsewhere, the system is based on a Model-View-Controller paradigm where the Model is described by the state of the various media objects cataloged by the system in its media metadatabase. The View is synthesized based on user filters and the current end user context. The Controller is SOA (on behalf of the widget engine) and it issues commands to the database to as well as the media block to start and stop streams chosen by the end user.","It is useful to consider the flow of control through the system for each of the functions described above. Thus, will examine each of these in order and understand the implication from a system standpoint. Along the way, we will understand the implications from software library support.","Authentication","Authentication begins at the client browser GUI which is started in response to the client selecting a URL from an SMS message (in response to a buddy invite) or by launching the browser and navigating to the PeerMeta PeerPC link. In both cases, an http request is sent to the Seed PC which in turn redirects the request to the appropriate user PeerPC  (which may belong to a friend in the case of a buddy invite). The http request received by the web server is passed to the SOA component that in turn calls the Ruby library to authenticate. The results are returned via the SOA to the client. In the case of a successful authentication, the result is a 256-bit key that encodes the following: the client id, the session id, the client context including device, network, and activity.","Media Discovery","The desktop or host browser GUI is used to create a user-defined filter for media. This filter is a set of key-value pairs that indicate the user's preferences. Examples are \u201cGenre=Drama\u201d and \u201cYear=1997\u201d, etc. The filter is associated with a URI that points to a media catalog from which content is to be selected for the end user. The selection remains in effect until the user changes the selection. Any number of filters may be setup for any number of content catalogs each identified by the URI.","The filters are passed on by the SOA to the data base in appropriate set of database calls.

This playlist is the one that is customized to his preferences and context. It contains all media types including audio, video, blogs and photos that meet his filter criteria. The filter criteria could include in addition to keywords other rules including ten most recently viewed by my friends, top ten for the past month, all time top ten and so on.","On clicking on the playlist, the user is taken to the appropriate media and shown with contextual ads.","Media Markers","A media marker is a time interval indicated by start and end times relative to the beginning of the media. One or more media markers could overlap completely or partially. Markers are an artifact of the system data model and represent a navigable portion of a larger piece of media that may be commented on and shared via BuddyBlast with others.","Stream Mashup","Before a clip is delivered to the end user, an appropriate pre- or post-roll ad is stitched to the clip. This is accomplished using the notion of a stream mashup where multiple clips are \u201cstitched\u201d together dynamically before serving to the end user. To be able to achieve this mashup seamlessly, the source clips are previously transcoded to the same video format, bit rate and resolution. This guarantees that the target clip will play out seamlessly for any mobile device.","Other types of stream mashups such as the radio station mashup require different mechanisms for ingesting content from various sources and for mashing up the content before playing to the user. The mashup may let the user choose to switch between simultaneous content or time-shift one or more for viewing later.","Another type of stream mashup is the aggregation of comments related to a particular spot in the media identified by a media marker. The marker serves as the anchor for sharing and socializing around that portion of the media. This is considered as a mashup of social networking and media.","The stream mashup function is carried out in the Front End and the Mashup Engine of the system. The latter is used for the stream stitching for pre- and post-roll video advertisements while the former does the rest of the mashups.","Contextual Ad Insertion","Contextual advertisements are a sub-case of stream mashup. The metadata around a media or comments around the corresponding markers are used for selection of the most appropriate advertisement for the mashup. Other contextual hints include personal preferences of the viewer (identified by the cookie or recent user navigation) and location\/time. Note that location can be detected accurately only in the case of an installed application. Otherwise, the best practice is to query the user for zip code or city. This information is then used to determine more context-specific advertising.","Usage Analytics","Every ad that is streamed is logged in the syslog for post-processing. The usage analytics are aggregated for delivery to the ad networks. In addition, the individual content metadata are added to a user's personal profile for personalized content discovery.","Personalization","Personalization is done by a specialized database that classifies content on ingestion into various play-lists that represent user preferences and other contextual hints. A user request for a personalized playlist maps into one of these ready-to-go playlists based on the closest match. The lookup is based on a attribute-based routing where attributes are organized into a tree based on user preferences. Thus, every new user registration or other user-preference discovery event could result in the creation of a new branch of the preference tree.","The order of attributes in a search path is based on request structure and multiple paths may lead to the same playlist. The duplication of nodes does not significantly increase the storage requirements of the playlists.","Activity Stream","The activity stream is the set of media interactions of a user and his friends. This includes media comments, viewing, and sharing. The system can publish into and out of an activity stream from\/to external web sites. This enables the creation of more contextual media experiences including advertising.","Social Networking","The system enables a user to connect to multiple external communities via connectors that are customized to the specific external community. This includes Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, etc. The connectors enable user information to be imported into the PeerMeta system as well as activities from the user's activity stream to be exported into the appropriate external community.","Media Circle","A Media Circle is a subset of a user's friends that is dynamically selected based on some contextual selection criteria such as the metadata of a certain media that is to be shared, the location, time, activity, etc. Each user can dynamically create any number of Media Circles and blast a media reference to the friends in the Media Circle. Note that a Media Circle can overlay friends from multiple external communities such as Facebook, MySpace, etc. In addition, a Media Circle is created centered around the sender.","Details of Buddy Blast","Buddy blast is defined as\u2014the dynamic stream-aware clipping and forwarding made possible using a combination of techniques including automatic segmentation of clips that enables the buddy blasts of specific portions of media from within a media object.","A user may at any time while playing a piece of media decide to share it with a media circle. This is achieved through the unique method of content ingestion and preparation described below in which the media are segmented into chunks based on time from the beginning of the clip.","Media Segmentation","Content is ingested into the system via \u201cconnectors\u201d that connect to external content management systems (CMSes) and download content via media RSS feeds or ftp. Any video ingested is automatically segmented into fixed size (e.g. 30 sec) long clips in overlapping pieces as illustrated in .","Note that there is an audio fade in\/out at the beginning\/end of each segment. It has been found by experimentation that a 30-second segment length is adequate to capture a highlight such as a jump shot in a basketball game while it is short enough to play on most phones including low-end phones. Also, this segment length is long enough to cover the response time from the time of interaction on the web-based UI to the time the server responds.","After segmentation, the clips are transcoded into multiple target formats such as wmv, mov, and 3gpp, with a bit rate for example of 350 kbbp and resolution of 320\u00d7240. The transcoded segments are stored in the media cache for later reference.","The interaction between the client  and server  is illustrated in . Note that when the user clicks to indicate that he wants to buddy blast, the client playout point tc is behind the server playout point ts, (ts\u2212tc)<30 seconds, and therefore the system can accurately determine the media clip that the user wants to share.","Media References","The reference to these segments are via markers which denote time intervals of the media object where time is the run-time of the media object. The reference to the marker is via a URI as in:\n\n","which defines the marker from time 5 to 9 seconds of the media identified as 123 in the given URL. The times are relative to the start of the media. This reference uniquely identifies the media file by using a unique media ID together with the starting time value such as:\n\n","where the unique media ID is derived off the MAC address, processor id, and ingestion time.","Retrieving Media Comments","The markers referencing a media object is stored in a file where the path name corresponds to the hierarchical tree structure corresponding to the named-attribute values (in a fixed attribute order). This is illustrated in . Thus, a media defined by \u201cgenre=action; actor=ford; year=1980\u201d would correspond to the file path \/\/action\/ford\/1980. This allows for quick lookup of the media avoiding costly database lookups.","The path lookup points to a metadata file containing the markers of the media file ordered by starting time. At each of these lines is a pointer to a starting time position in a time-ordered comment index file where each line corresponds to a time in the media file and contains pointer to all comments that cover that time. Each time a new comment is added, all the lines corresponding to the times spanned by the comment are updated. When looking up comment density for a time interval, a single pass through the file between the starting and ending time positions will yield the total comment count. This system is a file-based logical database for comments and markers. It has the advantage of rapid lookup and replication\/distribution. The files can be held in a RAM-disk for fast access.","Note at the highest level is the entire media object with the next level markers below it corresponding to the second largest span of time intervals. Below each of these markers in the tree are the ones contained inside the span of the parent marker. All these are represented by the system described above.","In another embodiment, the comments are held in a relational database and the markers are held in a different database. Each time, the media object is pulled up, the comments come up and from there the markers. To get the density of comments, one would have to walk through the database and find all comments that apply within the span of a marker. Similarly, the attributes of the media are keys used to lookup the media.","Device Context Detection","The system has intelligence to perform device detection to determine the format of the media, length of the media and type of delivery (streaming or download) that a particular handheld client device  can handle. This allows the system to send, upon request made from the recipient, a representation of the media compatible with the client's device is delivered to the client and contextualized by advertisements associated with the recipients current location, time, and interests. In another embodiment, the client request is routed to a data center that is ideal in relation to the client in order to satisfy the request based on the client's location. In addition, media that need to be assembled before delivery are \u201cmashed up\u201d or combined together, such as in a pre-roll ad, based on specific mashup-rules that enable the creation of a final representation of the media object.","The request from the buddy is analyzed to detect the client mobile device and the corresponding action is taken as described for example in the following table.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0195","num":"0288"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Window","Windows","Symbian","Symbian",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Mobile 5","Mobile 6","S60","S40","Brew"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Sprint WAP -","Http","Http","n\/a","n\/a","RTSP"]},{"entry":["EVDO","Progressive","Streaming",{},{},"streaming"]},{"entry":[{},"Download"]},{"entry":["Verizon WAP -","Only photos,","Only photos,","n\/a","n\/a","n\/a"]},{"entry":["EVDO","blogs","blogs"]},{"entry":["ATT WAP -","Http","Http","Http","Http","Http"]},{"entry":["GSM","Progressive","Progressive","Download","Download","Download"]},{"entry":[{},"Download","Download","and play","and play","and play"]},{"entry":["Vodaphone -","Http","Http","RTSP","RTSP","n\/a"]},{"entry":["GSM (3G)","Progressive","Streaming","streaming","streaming"]},{"entry":[{},"Download"]},{"entry":["Other GSM","Http","Http","RTSP","RTSP","n\/a"]},{"entry":[{},"Progressive","Progressive","streaming","streaming"]},{"entry":[{},"Download","Download"]},{"entry":["No WAP","Http","Http","RTSP","RTSP","n\/a"]},{"entry":[{},"Progressive","Streaming","streaming","streaming"]},{"entry":[{},"Download"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Media Mashup","Other context detection devices include the detection of user behavior by recording the keywords of media that he is watching in a keyword tag cloud. Later, this cloud is checked against potential advertisements that may be mashed together with the media. The tag cloud is organized such that each tag has an associated set of related keywords. Thus, car could be associated with tires, insurance, etc. Then, when a car media is played, the pre-roll ad could come from auto insurance or tire company.","The ads are ingested into the system in two manners depending on whether they are banner or video. The following algorithm describes this media mashup.","Step 1. Periodically (interval is configurable), video ads are ingested into the system from an external ad server (of an ad network or content provider) as follows:\n\n","Step 2. On a request to play a video, the system determines the user context based on time, location, activity\u2014based on the content viewed by the user. This is performed by the front end system in conjunction with the database.","Step 3. The front end then invokes the mashup engine and passes it the user device context as determined by the User Interaction engine. The mashup engine invokes the stitching function of the video transcoding tool which demuxes video and audio, stitches the two and muxes the result into a single stream.","Step 4. The resulting stream is delivered to the client based on the device\/carrier capability matrix as shown above.","Fair Use","The system provides a means of sharing that enables a user to remain within the bounds of fair use yet enables him to let his friend sample the media.

The results of the match are then selected for sharing the media. The media circle is personal in that it reflects the group of friends associated with the sender.","These lists of friends are kept sorted using a mechanism similar to that of media comments, viz., a directory structure where the path indicates the categories that define a contextual filter to be applied in retrieving a particular media circle. The media circle itself is stored in a file.

This capability is provided by filtering content based on metadata attributes that match user preferences. This is accomplished either by on-demand database query or by continuous filter evaluation described below in reference to .","A tree of filters is placed on one or mode underlying computers where content flows continuously over the tree and the information is dynamically sorted over the tree. The system of hierarchical filter elements are used to continuously evaluate and classify newly arriving media as well as events into a hierarchical structure of filter expressions where each node is an \u201cAND\u201d or \u201cOR\u201d condition. An AND node may correspond to the case where a content could simultaneously satisfy multiple conditions such as the actor could be \u201cFord\u201d AND \u201cThompson\u201d. On the other hand an OR node may have one pathway, such as the year could be \u201c80s\u201d OR \u201c90s\u201d but not both. The results of the filters are buckets that collect objects that meet the specific criteria of the filters.","The algorithm is as follows:","1. At each node, if it is an AND node then\n\n","2. If the node is an OR node then\n\n","At each branching node, information flows over all the branches or one branch depending on whether the node is an \u201call\u201d or \u201cone\u201d type of node. The resulting structure is a tree of playlists that are continuously evaluated against new content and enables instant personalized playlists. In addition, new playlists can be formed by either merging or splitting existing ones. Also, by re-evaluating against all content run so far over the tree.","Note that in one embodiment the file system is used to represent the tree as done earlier in the case of markers.","A specific combination of filters corresponds to a path in this tree. The lookup is via a single DB access whose key corresponds to a path in the tree. In addition, the key may be partitioned into smaller pieces where each piece corresponds to a separate DB and a lookup corresponds to multiple lookups in different databases in sequence.

This data store holds the:\n\n","Frontend Server","The main function of the Frontend Server is to process SOA API. The SOA API is a restful API, i.e., the system is stateless and requests can be directed to any available server without any state having to be transferred on the backend. This allows the system to scale to a large number of simultaneous users. The SOA API handles all user transactions including authentication (if needed), playlist requests, ClickZoom navigation, media play requests, marking and commenting on tiles.","The Frontend Server also calls on the backend components such as the assembly engine, streaming server and database to mashup and serve the content. Other operations of the frontend include connections to social networks.","Assembly Engine","The main function of the assembly engine is to mashup media files such as stitching pre-roll ad to a media file dynamically to produce a final files that is ready for the stream server.","As new media arrives, the Assembly Engine imports new media from disk array and after preparation places the final data object in the flash drive. As disk is getting full, older, less used media is removed from the flash drive. (Note: A copy of the original media is always in the disk array.)","Stream Engine","The stream engine support HTTP streaming, HTTP Progressive download, HTTP download and play, and RTSP streaming.

This leads to an interesting problem how a mobile client should be able to reach a users peer PC. The requirements for this are:\n\n","The solution consists of having a test service such as \u201cpeermeta.sprint.com\u201d to which a client sends a test UDP packet containing the client's own IP address in the payload. The test server verifies whether the header source IP address matches the payload and can determine whether the client is behind a firewall (e.g., the STUN server as described in RFC 3489 could be used.) Note that these packets have to be encrypted in order to ensure that they are not manipulated in transit. Further, the server can reply to the client via a second server and the client would know if it is behind a partial or full cone (full cone means a symmetric hole, i.e., the outgoing destination IP address\/port must match the incoming source IP\/port.)","The next component of the solution consists of a global peermeta directory server. The PC is always in touch with the directory server via a keep-alive that conveys its current global IP address. When a client needs to find its peer PC, it contacts the directory server which then forwards the PC's global IP address and port number and whether it is behind a partial or full cone. Then, the client can directly contact the PC if it is behind a partial cone. Alternatively, it can ask the PC to call back if it is behind a full cone as long as the client itself is not behind a full cone. In the case of a dual-global cone, there are two solutions: (1) use a well-known port, say 10101, together with a port-map to send incoming traffic towards a redirector kept behind the firewall; (2) use a paid-for relay service that forwards packets between the client and PC. It is anticipated that these latter scenarios are primarily for enterprise users.","PeerUI (User Interface)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0271","num":"0409"},"figref":"FIGS. 14-17"},"Client Device Component Interface (Applies to Rich Client Version of the Client User Interface that Involves a Client Software\/Hardware Installation)","Referring to , the various component interfaces have been indicated by the lines connecting components and these have been labeled using letters.

In addition, there is a need to support SDP (Service Discovery Protocol), DHCP, and DNS. These protocols enable the device to get its own IP address and discover other services on the net. It must also be possible to manually configure the servers into the IMP by a configuration screen and by downloading via a dialup service.","At the higher level, in this view, the IMP needs to interact with servers to fetch email, voice mail, media mail (photos and videos), TV program guide, weather, news, RSS feeds, etc. In addition, it must transmit its own presence and GPS coordinates and other sensor data to the appropriate presence-enabled applications and any other subscriber to its sensor feeds via RSS.","Special Features","Social Network Interaction","As depicted in , the system leverages existing social networks such as: Yahoo!Go, Google, MySpace, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.","In this outsourced community model, a single social network is used as the basis of the PeerMeta community.

Overview","A User Interface Engine (UIE) is made available along with the MashMedia Platform to serve as a Web-driven Interactive Media Portal (or Reference Application) built upon the platform SOA Web API. This Reference Application housed on the UIE is re-brandable and re-skinnable for a given content publisher or mobile operator.","The UIE provides several key functions including:\n\n","II. Device Support Database","The platform maintains a device database of profiling feature phone and smart phone capabilities and attributes which are important in the delivery of Azuki MashMedia services. This attributes include:\n\n","Updates and changes to this device database are facilitated through operational configurability of an Azuki maintained master device database file. Such changes may be applied to the UIE at any time. The UIE also processes updates from a 3rd party supplementary device database (e.g. WURFL or DeviceAtlas) whereby a broad range of new devices are added to the system along with a subset of defining device attributes crucial to delivering MashMedia services.","Separate from the platform, it is desirable to maintain a process for continual testing of new and existing devices across a matrix of device manufacturers, mobile operators and operating systems. A test suite is utilized to characterize the defining attributes for each of these devices to aid in browser renderability according to defined \u201cUI device classes\u201d. Customer care and operations staff can utilize this method of updating device attributes based upon any reported deviation from expected performance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0310","num":"0465"},"figref":"FIG. 22","b":["48","48","50"]},"III. Automated Device Detection","As part of the device rendering process to a given browser enabled device, the UIE performs a method of intelligent device detection based upon browser header\/User Agent string values obtained and the Azuki Device Support Database. The UIE utilizes a UI Layout Selection algorithm (described below) that minimizes explicit dependencies on \u201cexact matches\u201d of UA strings and proper treatment of \u201clike devices\u201d which are not completely described in the Device Support Database but for which known device attributes provide sufficient info to render one of the defined UI device classes for that mobile handset. Using this combination of the Device Support Database and intelligent device detection, Azuki is able to support hundreds of handsets with a combination of a subset of physical device testing and test coverage for other \u201clike devices\u201d whereby renderability is highly predictable.","IV. User Interface Rendering","Based upon the device detected by the UIE (correlation of device detection techniques and Device Support Database), the UIE renders the following device classes based upon the device capabilities:\n\n","For UI-1 and UI-2, separate style sheets may be rolled out to handle variations in screen sizes or other device variability within each device class. An example is to gray out the media upload button if the device cannot do media upload. UI-3 by definition only supports a single method of renderability by design which serves as a least common denominator across devices capable of browser and media playback.","The rest of this section describes the UI Layout Selection algorithm.","We begin with the UIE Bootup sequence described below. Referring to , at step  the UIE initially reads the Azuki Database (ADB) , and then reads a device configuration file (step ) that is provided to explicitly handle devices that are not in the ADB  or that need to be overridden manually to a different UI group. At step , the two are then consolidated into a table called the Azuki Device Table (ADT) that is used for the real-time in-line device selection. Note that the ADT is a hash table where the key is a 32-bit CRC of the UA String. The size of the ADT is set at 2K and the maximum hash chain-length was found to be under 4 which is considered as acceptable. There is room for improvement of the hash if this assumption changes down the road. The schema of the ADT may include the following: Hash key and Capability ID which is the row number of a table called the Capability Table with a schema containing several UI features including the browser and version, UI-Layout CSS, media upload, streaming type, distinguishing xhtml properties such as table support, CSS support, background color support, etc.","First, the Capability Table is hand-populated with one row per known layout. Note that rows may be installed in this table so that all the CSS layouts are covered. Also, the lowest browser version number that supports the layout is also specified and is called the Lowest Applicable Version (LAV). Multiple rows with the same browser are organized in decreasing LAV. Also, rows that differ by stream type are placed next to each other in a fixed order.","Next, the ADT is populated automatically as follows. Every UA in the third party database is hashed and added to the ADT. The corresponding browser is checked against the known browsers in the Capability Table. If a match is found, then the row with the highest LAV equal or below the version in the UA is selected for the Capability ID in the ADT provided the streaming type is compatible. If no match is found, the necessary xhtml and CSS properties are checked against the rows in the Capability Table for a match. The richest layout that is applicable is selected.","Referring to , we next look at what happens when a request from a phone arrives. At step , the User Agent (UA) String is extracted from the request header. At step , the extracted UA string is used as a hash key into the ADT. If a match is found (step ), then at  the appropriate UI-Layout is selected for the phone. If no match is found, then at  the cell phone is redirected to a phone detection test suite. Note that this happens only once for example when a carrier sends a browser version update over the air. But, before sending to the redirection work flow, a simple regular expression pattern match of the UA is carried out to detect known browsers. If found then the Capability table is searched for the nearest smaller LAV under this browser. The corresponding row gives the Capability ID.","For the test suite, it may be desirable to only handle the bare minimum which is to get the User Agent field and the device resolution. If the end user chooses to not run the test, then the user is given the UI-3 layout.","Note also that in the case of BlackBerry devices older than the Bold, key xhtml properties are turned off by default.

SOA Caching","The concept of SOA caching is achieved by using a mechanism that essentially reuses the last result for the same SOA call.

For example, t0 may be 5 minutes whereas t1 could be as high as 30 minutes. Also, t2 will depend on the rate of ingestion of new media\u2014for example, t2 needs to be no larger than the period of ingestion of the media that needs to be the freshest e.g. Scores. Similarly, t3 need not be faster than the fastest ingestion. On the other hand, t4 can be made as large with no side effect. These parameters could be tweaked via a configuration file.","VI. Carrier Detection","This is achieved during the Device Detection phase as follows. The source IP address of the request is used to do a reverse DNS lookup. First, the source IP address is masked using the appropriate mask and then compared to the Carrier's CIDR prefix. This information is pre-populated by ingesting a gateway database. The longest matching prefix is used selected.","VII. ClickZoom Navigation","As an important core capability of the Azuki platform, ClickZoom navigation controls are extended from the SOA API to the UIE. ClickZoom proves a novel method of navigating within monolithic media objects, generating more snackable forms of media that ease browsing, discovery and consumption, applying contextual advertising around the media, viewing user generated comments tied to a particular portion of a video clip and sharing a particular context (or clip) of a particular video across mobile (SMS) or social networks (posting to Facebook news feed).","Users are presented with either a top level 3\u00d73 or 2\u00d72 thumbnail tile grid that represents the media whereby they may zoom into a particular portion based upon their interests or visual clues to where user generated comments exist. For lower level tile views where there is limited time separation between snackable clips, a 2\u00d72 or single thumbnail image may be displayed with user navigation controls left and right from that point.","As noted in the Ingestion Section of this document, media objects may either not contain a ClickZoom representation (only able to play the entire clip) or ClickZoom representations defined as either Time (uniformly spaced) or Editorial (explicitly defined points) Media Marker points which are represented in the rendered tiles.","VIII. Logging and Reporting","The UIE logs all webpage rendering statistics as well as UIE related items such as device detection information and rendered UIE device class utilized (UI-1, UI-2, UI-3 and specific style sheet) with the corresponding user ID and timestamp. This logged information is processed by the Azuki platform reporting subsystem for report generation.","The logging and reporting metrics may be logged to a data repository that could be utilized for generating canned and custom reports centered around USER EXPERIENCE. Also this helps automated keywords generation from server side behind SOA layer.

The request goes to the UIE and FE where in step 3\u2032 the play context consisting of user and media info is passed in to get a contextual ad recommendation in step 4\u2032. Finally, the assembly server is called in step 5\u2032 to assemble the Final Data Object (FDO) for delivery to the UIE in step 7\u2032. At this time, it is possible to use statistical correlation on user behavior changes to predict emergent patterns.","Personalization","Personalized media is defined as a set of media that corresponds to the user's context. Personalization is the process of finding and presenting personalized media to a user. Context is defined as \u201cthat which surrounds, and gives meaning to, something else\u201d. Thus, when a user is located in Boston, the keyword \u201cRed Sox\u201d means something. This is not the case for a user in say India. Thus, keywords in the content metadata have to be interpreted in the user context which is looked up using the user's identity.","The process of personalization involves three distinct steps:","User Identity\u2192User Personalization Array\u2192Personalization DB","where\n\n","Each of these data structures are described below. However, it is important to also understand that personalization is a property of the aggregate system usage and not of a specific instance of use. However, it is nontrivial to define a metric for direct measurement of personalization. Instead, we use metrics that are, or at least very likely, a consequence of personalization.","User Identity","A User Identity in our system comes from multiple sources. Subscriber ID from a content provider is only part of our internal global ID. Because our direct customers are not always content providers (portals and carriers have their own scheme, on-deck content like ESPN does not control subscribers, carriers do).","As shown in , Azuki Global ID consists of two parts.","The first part is partner ID assigned by Azuki for internal identification only. The 2nd part is system generated UUID. UUIDs guarantee uniqueness across space and time. The coupling of partner ID and UUID guarantees ID uniqueness across space, time and content where content is defined by the partner who controls it. Using this approach, we provide a way to differentiate on-deck content under Verizon vs. content hosted by ESPN directly. Content in this context also dictates the content scope that a partner's subscribers have access to.","Cookies are simply Azuki generated objects that contain, among other things, UUID of the user that Azuki uses for internal indexing and tracking.","The partner field of Azuki's global ID could be one of the following:\n\n","User Personalization Array (UPD)","A fixed number of real time dynamic contextual hints could be inserted by Azuki automatically. They are:\n\n","Other than the system generated fields, User Personalization Array is the SQL key into the personalization database. It presents a normalized key, partially filled or generated based on available personalization data acquired in real time or via user generated key words to indicate preferences. The key point here is that the UPD must present a normalized key that the system can use to query the Personalization Database.","An example of a normalized UPD, partially filled, is:\n\n","which is used to obtain a set of contextual records from the PDB.","Personalization DB (PDB)","The PDB is initially created as part of the content ingestion process. How the PDB is populated will be different depending on the content source.\n\n","Regardless of the type of ingestion, behavioral and usage data are dynamically updated in the PDB so as to create usage related bias. First, let us look at how a PDB might be organized in a manner that is natural for its content space. Noting that the PDB is used to query for personalized media lists, we look at some typical usage patterns.\n\n","In all these usage patterns, we find certain keywords appearing together such as\u2014rival teams; regional teams (Sox, Celts, Pats); regional data (market, news, weather). These behavioral patterns can be called \u201clocal\u201d, \u201cregional\u201d, etc.","There can be a hierarchical relationship that can help organize these keywords into these types of patterns, for example in the following sense:\n\n","One goal of normalization is to help with the learning of context, i.e., disambiguating the meaning of a keyword. For example, Sports\/Soccer\/Mika a soccer player is different from an artist by the same keyword such as Music\/Artist\/Mika.","The other goal is to enable keywords need to be normalized to fall into buckets that represent a concept. The hierarchy together with a bucketization dictionary achieves this goal. The simplest normalization is using a synonym dictionary. The buckets may be represented by the root-to-leaf path in the normalized tree.","The other goal of normalization is achieved by adding contextual hints to the keywords in a hierarchical manner. Thus, when we learn about the context we augment the keywords with the context. We have to discover the context using the normalization hierarchy and find out what portion of that hierarchy we are in. This will let us place keywords in context.","Media companies and content providers go through a rigid, systematic process to ingest content for mobile consumption. That is our initial focus. For that type of customers, we institute a \u201cKey word Normalization\u201d process that helps Azuki index and organize content based on a multi-level keywords based tree.

The id is a foreign key from the second table that associates it with a specific type-value pair of keyword and \u201cRedsox\u201d.","The normalization process has three steps:","1. Create a set of hierarchical keyword classes","2. Reorder any collection of keywords in the descending order.","3. Fill in any missing elements with a missing keyword marker.","Keyword class hierarchies are created at ingestion using a tool to map often structure-less tags that are basically UIDs into a hierarchy.

The latter concerns the demographic metadata that is relevant to the system.","Keyword Ingestion","Good results need good data. In the personalization system this means we need to clean up keywords that are ingested into the system both at media ingestion time and as part of searches. The main sub-tasks here are:\n\n","The Keyword Ingestion Subsystem is described with reference to . A Sphinx search engine  implements \u201cimperfect\u201d search using misspelled keywords, related keywords, and weighted searches. It can be used for real-time search queries as well as for online media metadata ingestion. In the case of metadata validation, a set of keywords are sent to Sphinx and if a keyword is returned with a % match greater than a configurable threshold, then we ingest it. If a keyword match is below the threshold, we create a new keyword and add it to the database and re-index.","Personalization Algorithms","Multiple algorithms are employed for achieving a personalized experience. In general, three categories of selections are used: explicit content provider campaigns; individualized user preferences; as well as statistical models for aggregate and pattern behavior learning models. The content provider can control via the ops console the percentage of mix among these categories.","Examples of explicit rules for content placement include:\n\n","User preferences are matched using the UPD query against the database. The matching process against the UPD query results in a sub-tree of paths that are most relevant to the user's context. The UPD and PDB are normalized using the same schema and hence a procedure like the Longest Prefix-Match (LPM) could be used to discover the matching sub-tree. [Note: In a database, this is equivalent to looking up adjacent rows in a set of sorted columns. However, this depends on having a well-populated UPD which requires a dynamic learning mechanism to accumulate keywords based on user behavior.]",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0444","num":"0678"},"figref":"FIG. 37"},"Lastly, individual and group behavior are tracked using a combination of statistics and learning models based on weights with a feedback mechanism and controls for reinforcing and forgetting.

Let us take a moment to review the idea of a media circle.","A media circle is defined to be a collection of users that happen to share similar tastes in media. A user might belong to multiple media circles at the same time. A media circle can be implicit and its membership fluid and correlate to user attributes. This definition allows for the notion of a media circle to correspond to a set (or sequence) of media items that are related either explicitly by a person or indirectly by social influence where a linkage is established based on the cross correlation of group behavior.","In this section, we will describe learning algorithms that track individual user behavior that are then used in conjunction with group level correlation to arrive at personalized content recommendations.  shows a general model of the learning subsystem described in more detail below. Usage stats  are fed into a feedback-based reinforcement function  whose outputs are weighted against business rules  for various types of usage patterns such as clicks, views, plays, sharing, comments and explicit user-stated preferences.","Context Learning Algorithm","We try to learn the context by doing the behavior analysis. This will help us figure out what we need to filter against. We assign and adjust weights to this learning. Thus, the weight of a leaf is the sum of the root to leaf weights. Note, that it may be necessary to assign weights to the different parts of the name. When, we assign a weight to a non-leaf node (in our normalization hierarchy), it has the effect of influencing the sub-tree below for selection. This normalization hierarchy is constructed to create localization and other such behavioral patterns. A weight for a non-leaf node is assigned by a diffusion technique where we spread the weights along the path to the root using a decaying factor. This type of learning helps protect against getting too narrowly focused and missing the forest for the trees. Also, one can expect to get higher reliability at higher levels of the hierarchy when reinforced by weights from the leaves. This is especially useful in the situation where one has a hierarchy that looks more like a forest than a single tree\u2014such as in the case of a broad portal. Then, it becomes useful to be able to know which tree is currently being visited to more by the user. The correlative and diversity portions of learning algorithm (below) can be tailored around the current portion of the hierarchy rather than uniformly scattered.","Individual Behavior Adaptation Algorithm","The algorithm shown in  is used to learn user behavior based on user actions that are used as inputs. It is a simple weighted summing algorithm and appears to be promising in simulations. We are able to vary the UPD while respecting the user's preferences. However, tuning may be desired to avoid losing accuracy of personalization.","Note that it may be necessary to have a separate table consisting of weights, paths, and user in order to capture the dynamic weights. This above learning algorithm uses a simple-weighted learning method with a forgetting feature. It is meant to be used as part of nightly log processing. Simulation shows that this algorithm does a good job of maintaining user preferences while also introducing a diversity of other content. However, more fine-tuning is needed to avoid losing focus. One area of promise is to combine this algorithm with the cross-correlation or the slope-one described below.","Cross-Correlation Algorithm","Another type of learning algorithm is where one correlates using a cross-correlation matrix the probabilities of watching a group of media together. This matrix is built up aggregating statistics from multiple users. In the figure below, the rows and columns are the media items. The numbers in the table represent the probabilities of going from video to video. Thus, for example, the probability of going from Video A to Video B is 0.2 whereas the probability of going from Video B to Video A is 0.7.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0459","num":"0706"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00016","num":"00016"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Video A","Video B","Video C"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Video A",{},".2",".5"]},{"entry":[{},"Video B",".7",{},".5"]},{"entry":[{},"Video C",".1",".8"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The steps of the algorithm with a worst case of O(M*2N^2) for M consumers and N media items as follows:\n\n","One drawback with this approach is that it may not be useful for short-lived content such as news clips because it can take longer to compute than the lifetime of the content. In this case, we might want to explore the same algorithm but applied among groups where a group is defined as the items that fall under a single node in the hierarchy.

Considering only users who rated both A and B, say that there are 10 such users, we sum the ratings that A and B got, say 55 and 75. Items are recommended based on the smallest differential with a high degree of confidence that it would match the tastes of the user. This algorithm would be less useful if the number of media items were small and would take training time and might be less useful if the content changes rapidly.

These are also part of the user's viewing context.","To understand this service, let us consider a couple of use cases: (1) a college age sports enthusiast watching the latest Red Sox game on his newly acquired iPhone; (2) a middle-aged professional checking the market conditions on his blackberry.","In case 1, lets say the user has selected to watch a home-run highlight on his phone. He might be at his dorm room taking a study break. The ad shown will be something that is compatible with his demographic such as a new TV or web show or something that is compatible with the specific media such as Red Sox tickets for an upcoming game.","Similarly, in case 2, lets say the user is watching a newscast clip on the latest market developments. He might be at a restaurant during lunch hour. The ad shown will be something that is compatible with the demographic such as a new car or iPhone or something contextual with the media such as a financial service.","What is Contextual?","Context is defined as \u201cthat which surrounds, and gives meaning to, something else\u201d.","In the case of ads, ads are presented to the user that are related to the user's viewing context, i.e., related to the user's personal situation or to the media being watched.","First, let us look at what we mean by context. To begin with there are two types of context: user and media. User context itself divides into two types: one that changes infrequently such as gender, age, address, occupation, and viewing device; and another that changes frequently such as time and location.","The media context refers to the media categorization that in general can be organized in a hierarchical manner such as \u201cSports.ESPN.Baseball.RedSox.Manny\u201d. This information is fairly static at the upper levels of the hierarchy because one presumably would stay with a particular top-level domain for a bit before switching to a different context noting that at the highest level we expect only about 15 different top-level domains. However, we can expect it to change more at lower levels of the hierarchy such as when one changes from Manny to Ortiz.","Requirements for Ad Network Interface","The following represents requirements from a particular ad network company. These are generic enough that it is quite possible that others are pretty similar in their requirements.\n\n","It is clear that we are in a better position to adapt our contextual intelligence in real time while ad networks can hold a much large data set and content space and can correlate better for \u201coffline\u201d contextual intelligence. The two are complementary and are consistent with our view of interfacing to external recommendation engines are needed.","Ad Stitching","Clearly, context changes and the system needs to respond accordingly with what is being presented to the user. We achieve this functionality with a collection of tools ranging from real-time stitching to context caching (as defined below) depending on the scale of the applied load. This is explained in detail below.","Real-Time Stitching","This function refers to the process of combining an ad and piece of media while serving it out in real-time to the end user. During the process, the stitched media is also cached for re-use. This function is resource intensive and requires the use of multiple specialized servers that have integrated disk arrays in order to serve about 5000 requests per sec per server.","Context Caching","This function refers to the process of serving contextual ads from cached copies. The only difference between this and real-time stitching is that we are serving the ad from a cached copy. The challenge of course is to ensure that we have enough space to cache the ads. Here we employ the following assumption: dynamic ads are served initially via real-time stitching and later from cached copies.  shows the message flow that achieves this.","Message Flow","The flow starts with the client issuing a request to watch a piece of media. This results in a request to the assembly engine to get the media and prepare it with a contextual Ad. If a cached copy exists, then this is sent to the streaming server via a socket from which the streaming server copies to the destination. Otherwise, a real-time assembly is performed and the Ad and Media files are read and combined in memory and streamed out by the socket interface to the streaming server while the combined file is also written out to the cache. This is shown in .","Combining Rules","The combining rules for this mashup are:\n\n","Data Model","The source media in the system is identified by the media ID which is a unique identifier that specifies the requested content and a different unique identifier for the Ad media. Note that each representation of the content may have its own unique identifier called an FDO identifier. In other words, there would be one FDO ID for each of the different transcoded formats. The same may be the case for the ad. In addition, the media ID is also coded into the file name for tracking and billing.","The combined media is has a unique identifier and is stored into a cache where the key is the combination of the Ad and Content media IDs.","Scalability","The scalability of the Contextual Ads MashMedia service depends on the idea that there are not too many number of contexts that are reusable for the aggregate and hence it is possible to reuse previously used FDOs (Finalized Data Objects) which in this case are media mashed with contextual ads.","Context Caching is determined by noting the following points.\n\n","Clearly, N_contexts can be large on the face of it. However, we have some constraints that allow a practical solution. For example, frequently clips are an alias for gender and age. In other words, advertisers often use a clip's keywords to identify and target a demographic. Note that the keywords associated with a clip are assumed to be hierarchical as previously described. Under spike loads, the longest matching path of the hierarchy may be used in order to reduce the number of cached contexts.","Time of day is a contextualization hint that may be used to refine the selection of ad. Similarly, location can be used to regionalize ad selection. Initially, however, we are not going to worry about regional variations because we may not have access to location.","Thus, we derive the following formula for N_contexts_total, the total number of contexts that needs to be cached for short tail content is:\n\n_contexts_total=Formats\u00d7TOD\u00d7Clips\u00d7_ads=3\u00d74\u00d720\u00d75=1200\n\n_contexts_spike=300 per TOD\n","where","Formats=3 for (WMV, QT, and 3gpp)\u2014assuming only high-resolution and progressive download","TOD=4 for different times of day for time-specific targeting","Clips=20 to account for the short tail content","N_ads=5 per hierarchical keyword sub-tree such as \u201cESPN-Baseball-RedSox\u201d and TOD, based on the 50 ads that might be used during a day divided by 10 hierarchical Keywords in a sub-tree","The storage requirement is about 300\u00d72 MB=600 MB per spike. Clearly, this is not a large amount. Also, the upload time to pre-position a CDN cache is about 10 minutes.","Next, we describe how long-tail requests during a spike are handled. The load balancer bypasses the CDN by using a layer 5 content rule and pass through the long-tail request onto the Azuki system which would perform real-time stitching on the content. However, we would need as many as 40 servers to handle these long-tail requests.","Another approach under study is to use a memory-based storage appliance such as the G100 from Gear6 which can handle as many as 10,000 requests per second. (Only about 8,000 requests per second is needed to handle the long-tail requests during a spike.) However, this is a fairly expensive piece of equipment and may be used only if it is justified by the business economics.","A more economical way to deal with long-tail during a spike is to use pre-stitching of long-tail content based on some high-level keyword with periodic refresh to round robin through the ads and cycle through them once a day. The mathematics of this approach works as follows:\n\n_contexts_longtail=Formats\u00d7Clips\u00d7_ads=3\u00d710000=30K per cycle.\n","where","Formats=3 for (WMV, QT, and 3gpp)\u2014assuming only high-resolution and progressive download","Clips=10K to account for the long tail content","The storage requirement is about 30K\u00d72 MB=60 GB per cycle. This would take 5 assembly servers for stitching and caching.","Finally, there is the case of an unexpected spike or what is usually termed as a \u201cFlash Crowd\u201d. This may be handled using a combination of techniques including a \u201cwaiting room\u201d as well as \u201cserver busy\u2014try later\u201d. The flash crowd is indicated when the number of active sessions exceeds a threshold and the request is not for a pre-positioned content which the layer 5 rule would catch on the load balancer."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages will be apparent from the following description of particular embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which like reference characters refer to the same parts throughout the different views.
