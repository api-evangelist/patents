{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","ADDITIONAL EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/919,848 filed Jun. 17, 2013 which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/730,163 filed on Dec. 28, 2012. This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/862,014 filed on Aug. 3, 2013 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/875,112 filed on Sep. 9, 2013. The subject matter of this application is also related to the subject matter of the following co-pending U.S. patent application: U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/547,982 filed on Jul. 12, 2012. The disclosures of all five of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","Electronic devices and systems are frequently relied upon to provide information to users. Content providers and distributors naturally desire to track usage of that content. Content providers and advertisers rely on tracking content use and advertisement use on the Internet to determine appropriate distribution and pricing schemes and to identify relevant content and ads to present to particular users. Providers of paid content typically either offer subscriptions to periodicals or content libraries and\/or offer per item pricing for particular publications.","Presently available systems for tracking content usage typically determine whether a particular piece of content was accessed by a user by, for example, tracking page hits for freely available content and tracking purchases of and\/or logins to restricted access content. Also, techniques have been proposed for determining and tracking certain types of interactions with webpage content such as scrolling (see, for example, \u201cAdvanced Content Tracking with Google Analytics: part 1\u201d posted Feb. 21, 2012 at http:\/\/cutroni.com\/blog\/2012\/02\/21\/advanced-content-tracking-with-google-analytics-part-1\/#wrap).","Although existing content tracking schemes can determine whether content was accessed, systems and methods are needed to better determine whether content, particularly text content, was in fact consumed, i.e., read by the user. Also, there is a need to better track partial consumption to determine, for example, how much text in a given piece of content was read. This can facilitate better content targeting as well as more accurate and flexible pricing schemes. Furthermore, more accurately determining whether and how much of a particular piece of content was consumed can facilitate providing more accurate search results than simply relying on known metrics such as page hits and links.","Communications devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, e-readers, etc. continue to grow in popularity, and have become an integral part of both personal and business communications. As a result, users continue to spend more time using their communications devices during the course of a day reading e-mails, reading web sites, sending short message service (SMS) messages, etc.","Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is a method of displaying textual content in which each word of the textual content is displayed in sequential order, one at a time, at a certain display rate, at a fixed location on a display. RSVP was first introduced in the 1970s as a technique for presenting text one word at a time in a display. Many references since then have provided information on the use of RSVP in a variety of applications. Commercially available products based on RSVP include \u201cZap Reader\u201d (www.zapreader.com\/reader) and \u201cSpreeder\u201d (www.spreeder.com). Some prior methods exist for improving the effectiveness of an RSVP by varying the display time of a word in the display based on word length and word type (see, U.S. Pat. No. 6,130,968 to McIan et al. (\u201cMcIan\u201d)) and based on word frequency (see WO\/37256 by Goldstein et al. (\u201cGoldstein 2002\u201d)). While these techniques are beneficial in improving comprehension of the displayed text, new techniques and methods are needed to further increase a user's reading speed, and improve the presentation of dense content on electronic displays.","Isolated efforts have also been made to apply RSVP to particular applications (e.g., email applications) in mobile communications devices (see US 2011\/0115819 by Hanson). However, the challenges and opportunities for integrating RSVP into user interfaces for increasing the density of displayable content remain largely unexplored. Moreover, despite the increased need for more accurately tracking content consumption, RSVP has not yet been exploited for that purpose.","In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, computer-implemented methods, computer program products, and systems are provided for provisioning content and tracking content use, the content including textual content that is displayable using RSVP. A particular embodiment identifies content, including textual content, to be displayed using RSVP on an electronic device to a user, displays that content to the user using RSVP, and generates content tracking information by tracking a number of words of the textual content that is displayed using RSVP. In some embodiments, a user session identifier is stored and related to a content identifier in an electronic database.","In some embodiments, other variables are tracked and stored and are associated with the content identifier including, for example, variables that track a number of total words, a number of words left or remaining in content, a block size, a number of words downloaded, a block finished indicator and a content finished indicator. In some embodiments, reading speed is calculated and used to select content and\/or determine aspects of content presentation. In some embodiments, tracked textual content is provided in the context of tracked content including various mixed media types including, for example, maps, images, video, audio, and\/or augmented reality.","In some embodiments, tracked RSVP data is aggregated by user, media, and other categories. In some embodiments, RSVP aggregated data analytics (including totals, averages, percentages, and\/or rates of change corresponding to such data) corresponding to digital media items are utilized to determine or enrich search ranking results related to those items. In other embodiments, RSVP data is used to track the amount or percentage of words that users viewed prior to leaving a content item. In a particular aspect of such an embodiment, particular words or keywords that are near points at which significant user exits occur are tracked and graphically displayed so that a content provider can analyze how to potentially alter content to improve reader retention rates. Also, in some embodiments, the number of user selections of displayed sub-content within a particular piece of content is tracked and graphically displayed relative to a percentage of words read. In some embodiments, drops in total user sessions and corresponding rises in total selections of sub-content items are used to compute, for each drop in sessions between sentences, a relative drop ratio.","The present description is made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which various example embodiments are shown. However, many different example embodiments may be used, and thus the description should not be construed as limited to the example embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete. Various modifications to the exemplary embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Thus, the present disclosure is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.","Referring to , computer system , according to an embodiment of the present invention includes one or more server computers , network , one or more user devices  and computer program product . Computer program product  may be provided in a transitory or non-transitory computer readable medium; however, in a particular embodiment, it is provided in a non-transitory computer readable medium (e.g., persistent (i.e., non-volatile) storage, volatile memory (e.g., random access memory), or various other well-known non-transitory computer readable mediums).","User device  includes display  memory , storage , and database . Display  may be implemented as a touch screen display but is not limited thereto. Display  further includes designated Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (\u201cRSVP\u201d) display area (DRDA)  on display .","Server computer  further includes central processing unit (CPU) , storage , memory  and database (DB) . Server computer  may be any computing device capable of hosting computer product  for access by one or more client computers, for example user device , over a network such as the Internet, for example network .

Storage  and  may include any known computer storage device.","Although not illustrated, memory  and  and\/or storage  and  may also include any data storage equipment accessible by the server computer  and user device , respectively, such as any memory that is removable or portable, (e.g., flash memory or external hard disk drives), or any data storage hosted by a third party (e.g., cloud storage), and is not limited thereto.","DB  may reside in both memory  and storage  to provide optimized seek time and response time. Similarly, database (\u201cDB\u201d)  may reside in both of memory  and storage . In some implementations described herein, a database such as DB  does not necessarily need to be separately maintained on the user device. However, in some implementations, maintaining a user-side database for the presentation and tracking systems and methods described herein will be beneficial.","User device(s)  and server computer(s)  access and communicate via the network . Network  includes a wired or wireless connection, including a Wide Area Networks (WANs) and cellular networks or any other type of computer network used for communication between devices.","The content tracking system, according to an embodiment of the present invention, is implemented on user device  and server computer  by computer program product . Specifically, computer program product  includes instructions for executing the content tracking method and system on server computer  and user device  and the instructions are stored on computer readable memory  and memory , respectively. Computer program product  includes instructions to serially present text in the DRDA  and to execute tracks for carrying out related content tracking and content selection and presentation methods described further herein. In some embodiments, portions of computer program product  are distributed across multiple servers and devices.","User device  may include any type of electronic device capable of controlling text display. Some examples include desktop computers and portable electronic devices such as mobile phones, smartphones, multi-media players, e-readers, tablet\/touchpad, notebook, or laptop PCs, smart televisions, smart watches, head mounted displays, and other communication devices. In some implementations (e.g., a smart phone or e-reader), the display  may be packaged together with the rest of device . However, in other implementations, a separate display device (e.g., a monitor) maybe be attached to device . While the illustrated embodiment shows a graphical border around DRDA , DRDA  simply refers to a region (e.g., a window) on display  where text is serially presented in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention and in particular implementations, DRDA  may or may not be outlined by a graphical border.","In the illustrated embodiment, computer program product  is loaded into memory  to configure device  in accordance with the present invention. In one embodiment, text data may be loaded into memory for text processing and display processing by device  as will be further described herein. Text data loaded into memory for text processing and display processing may be retrieved from persistent storage on a user device such as device  and\/or may be received from one or more server computers  through a connection to network  (e.g., the Internet). One or more server computers  may be for example, one or more advertiser computers, one or more search engine computers, one or more web servers, one or more application servers, etc. In an alternative embodiment, at least some processing\/pre-processing of text data for display in accordance with the principles illustrated herein may be carried out by one or more remote computers such as server computers  and then sent to end user device  for display in DRDA  on display . In such an alternative, some or all of a computer program product such as computer program product  for implementing an embodiment of the present invention may reside on one or more computers such as server computers  that are remote from end user device . In some embodiments, the entire computer program product may be stored and executed on remote computers and the results presented within a browser application component (e.g. a media player application) of user device  (browser application and media player application not separately shown).","Although not illustrated, user device  may also include a processor and an input and output subsystem. In some implementations (e.g., a smart phone or e-reader), user device  may include a wireless transceiver and one or more input interfaces including a touch enabled display, a trackball, keyboard, microphone, smart television controller, etc.","User content, including textual data is loaded into memory  and\/or memory  for text processing, display processing, and tracking, as further described herein. Text data loaded into memory for text processing and display processing may be retrieved from persistent storage on a user device such as device  and\/or may be received from one or more server computers  through a connection to network  (e.g., the Internet).","One or more server computers  may include, for example, one or more advertiser computers, search engine computers, content provider computers, broadcasting provider computers, web servers, application servers and the like. Some of the content tracking and processing, including textual content tracking and processing, may be carried out by one or more remote computers such as server computers  and then sent to end user device  for RSVP display in DRDA  on display . The results of the processed content, including textual content, may be presented within a browser or other software application installed on user device . In some embodiments, the processing for RSVP display and content tracking may occur entirely offline on user device  and, optionally, the results of the content tracking methods described herein may then be transmitted to server computer  when a connection to network  is available.","According to an aspect of the present invention, content providers and advertisers may determine content and sequence of serial display and sub-displays. Additionally, a user may specify in user preferences used to determine sequencing and sorting of serially displayed content and how to choose or sort the sub-content. The content served as sub-content may be based on keywords corresponding to the words that have been serially displayed from the content.","Program product  may be configured to enable system  to take into account preferences of multiple entities, for example, the user, content providers, and advertisers, when serially presenting content in serial display and sub-display. Alternatively, program product  may be configured to only apply the settings and preferences of one of the entities or always override all settings based on a specific settings profile.","In an embodiment of the invention, text (which includes, for example, strings of characters\u2014e.g., letters, numbers, symbols, etc.\u2014which constitute words, numeric figures, and combinations of both with punctuation marks and symbols\u2014note that words may include words represented by any human language including, without limitation, words represented by roman characters, script elements, or pictographic characters\u2014) is presented serially (for example, one word at a time) within DRDA . As referenced herein, a \u201cdisplay element\u201d will refer to a group of text data that is displayed at one time within DRDA . In other words, display elements are displayed serially. In the primary embodiment discussed herein, a display element will generally consist of one word. However, in alternative embodiments, two words may be presented as a single display element. Also, in the primary embodiment, two words are sometimes part of a single display element such as, for example, when a number e.g., \u201c9,\u201d is displayed together with a unit, e.g. \u201cfeet,\u201d so that, for example, the text \u201c9 feet\u201d may constitute a single display element and be presented together.","In a conventional RSVP system, each word is centered in the display area, and the optimal fixation position shifts as words of differing lengths are sequentially displayed, resulting in saccade movements as the eyes shift to the optimal fixation position. The reader has to refocus on the display every time a new word appears that is of a different length than the previous word. The reader's eyes will move from one character to the next to find the optimal position, which is also referred to as a recovery saccade. In addition, when a longer word follows a shorter one, the saccadic movement direction will be from right to left. When reading text in lines in a traditional paragraph display, most saccadic movement is from left to right so the reader is accustomed to this type of eye movement. Only occasionally, if the optimal fixation position is not found directly, the reader may have to move back from right to left. Thus conventional RSVP forces the reader to experience saccades which are not normal. Conventional RSVP approaches offer no solution to these problems. In order to prevent or minimize recovery saccades in an RSVP, it is preferable to display each word such that the optimal fixation position does not shift in the display. The focal point of the reader can then remain fixed on the optimal fixation position, which is a specific point in each word that is determined by the total number of characters or width of the word. This Optimal Recognition Position (ORP), can be identified in the display such that the reader's eyes are directed to focus there as the words are serially presented. An RSVP which incorporates an ORP is hereinafter referred to as \u201cORP-RSVP.\u201d With an ORP-RSVP, text can then be presented at a faster rate because no saccades occur during the presentation. In addition, the elimination of saccades reduces eye fatigue and makes it more comfortable, resulting in a better reading experience for the user. Embodiments described herein may be implemented using conventional RSVP or ORP-RSVP.","With respect to embodiments implemented using ORP-RSVP, a corresponding method embodiment for serially displaying text on an electronic display comprises identifying an ORP for a plurality of words to be displayed and serially displaying the plurality of words such that the ORP of each word is displayed at a fixed display location on the electronic display. In some embodiments, the ORP is identified as a character in the word. In another embodiment, the ORP is identified as a proportionate position relative to the width of the word in pixels. In some embodiments, visual aids are used to mark the fixed display location (see e.g., hash marks) and\/or an ORP within the word (e.g., different colored font). In some embodiments, for words that are four or more characters, a word is displayed so that the fixed display location is closer to the beginning than to the end of the word.","In addition, words are rarely greater than 13 characters (according to Sigurd, only 0.4% of the words in the English language are longer than 13 characters\u2014see Sigurd, B. et al, \u201cWord Length, Sentence Length and Frequency\u2014ZIPF Revisited\u201d, Studia Lingustica 58(1), pp 37-52, Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Oxford UK, 2004) and therefore, for the vast majority of words, it is preferable to limit the number of characters to the right side of the fixation point to 8 characters. Also, in some embodiments, a word having a length of greater than thirteen characters is divided into first and second display elements such that a first portion of the word is displayed first (along with a hyphen) and then the second portion of the word is displayed next. In some embodiments, an empirically determined ORP of each display element is presented at a fixed location of the DRDA . For example, each word of a plurality of words is serially presented and positioned in the display such that the ORP is displayed at a fixed display location within DRDA  and this enables recognition of each word in succession with minimal saccade by the reader. Determining and displaying the ORP for display elements, and presenting display elements within DRDA  is described in more detail in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/547,982, which is incorporated by reference above.","Configuring text content for RSVP display may include parsing text into a plurality of display elements, inserting blank elements at the end of a sentence, and determining a multiplier for each display element that can be used, along with user selected settings and\/or other display parameters, to determine a display time for each display element. While, in some embodiments, each element may be displayed for the same amount of time, it has been demonstrated empirically that a longer display time is beneficial for comprehension of longer words. It has also been demonstrated empirically that a longer pause between sentences is beneficial for comprehension of longer sentences. Further details of certain systems and methods for preparing and displaying text using RSVP are described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/547,982 referenced above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["210","211","210","210","208","210","210"]},"User device  includes desktop\/homescreen manager  to control various elements to be displayed on a homescreen (e.g., a \u201chomescreen\u201d of a smart phone running a mobile operating system such as iOS\u2122, Android\u2122, or Windows Phone\u2122 or a \u201cdesktop\u201d display of a PC, laptop, etc., running an operating system such as Windows\u2122, or Mac\u2122 OS; or a homescreen\/desktop screen of an intermediate portable device such as notepad, touchpad, e-book reader, smart watch, head mounted display etc. running a corresponding operating system). For example, desktop\/homescreen manager  may control the icons, widgets, tiles, windows, folders, etc. and other information that may be displayed on a desktop or homescreen. Input manager  manages inputs received from one or more input mechanisms such as a touch-screen, trackball, keyboard, mouse, microphone, eye-tracking, a gesture detector, or other natural interface input detector, etc. For example, text input may be provided using a virtual (i.e., touch screen) or physical keyboard, mouse, trackball, etc. Alternatively, or in addition, a user may provide voice\/speech input via a microphone, which may then be converted to text. Various serial display enabled applications  (including, for example, applications , , and ) may run on the device and may provide data to be displayed through desktop\/homescreen manager .","Various messages (e.g., email, SMS) may be received over a network such as a wireless communications network connected to the Internet, via a wireless interface (not separately shown). Information received from the network, such as from one or more remote servers, may be provided to the applications  by event manager , and information may be passed from applications  back to the network. Event manager  may manage notification events that are presented to a user, e.g., through display . For example, event manager  may receive notification events from the wireless network. Notification events may include, for example receipt of text messages, emails, voicemails, social network updates, file transfers, etc. Event manager  may in turn forward the notification events to corresponding applications. For example, an email notification may be forwarded to the email application. The application may then instruct the desktop or homescreen manager  to display status or notification information to alert the user.","As will be described in further detail below, RSVP library  allows user device  to present display elements using RSVP. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, applications , , and , which may be email applications, messaging application, social networking applications, word processing applications, spreadsheet applications, photo applications, map applications, webpage editors, browser applications, search applications, video application, augmented reality applications, etc., may communicate with RSVP library  through an RSVP application programming interface (API) (not separately shown). For example, each application , , and may include application-specific RSVP software, such as RSVP software , , and , respectively, which may allow applications , , and to detect presence of RSVP content. Upon detecting RSVP content, RSVP software, such as RSVP software , , and\/or may call RSVP library  via the API. In response, RSVP library  may display RSVP notification markers\/icons, display DRDA , display RSVP content in DRDA , etc. In some embodiments, the application specific RSVP software, such as RSVP software , , and\/or may instead be included in RSVP library . In some embodiments, application-specific RSVP software, such as RSVP software , , and may additionally include logic to allow embedding of textual content within a file.","The RSVP library , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, includes RSVP notification markers or icons , RSVP parser , designated RSVP display area manager , RSVP settings , RSVP activation listener , and RSVP duration indication . Although the software modules are illustrated separately in this example for clarity of explanation, one or more modules may be combined or arranged in other ways.","RSVP notification markers or icons  are displayed by RSVP library  to alert a user of the presence of RSVP content. RSVP markers or icons  may also include icons indicating sponsored content. RSVP parser  parses textual data into individual display elements suitable for display in DRDA . Alternatively, a parser may be invoked before serving content to a user. Designated RSVP display area manager  displays DRDA  when appropriate user input is received. Appropriate input includes a system event that notifies the RSVP library  that user-selected content is serially displayable, in offline or online mode, to serially display content automatically or user-initiated input requesting RSVP display of the content.","RSVP settings  include settings related to displaying display elements using RSVP such as, the speed of display, font, font color, selection of the type of user input to activate RSVP display, block size for textual content and the like. RSVP activation listener  detects appropriate user input which is intended to select a RSVP notification marker\/icon. RSVP duration indication  determines the duration of the RSVP content, which may be displayed, for example adjacent to DRDA . In some embodiments, the duration may be displayed as an amount of time (e.g., in seconds). Alternatively, or in addition, the duration may be displayed graphically, for example as a status bar. The duration of RSVP content may be computed, for example, based on reading speed. In this case, if reading speed is 500 words per minute, and the content contains 1000 words, then the duration is computed as two (2) minutes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["208","208","208","208","208","208","209","209","209","208","208","208","209","209","209","212","212","209","209","209","212","209","209"],"i":["d","e","f","d","e","f ","d","e","f","d","e","f ","d","e","f ","d","e","f ","d ","e "]},"Additional components of user device  that are relevant to AR applications are also shown.

In some cases, a user session is created including an anonymous User ID to keep track of the words downloaded and words read. The User ID is anonymous in this scenario as one example, and is not limited thereto. For example, the User ID may not be anonymous and may include identifying user information. The user session is used to track content use and includes values for identification variables, including Session ID, User ID, a Text ID, and values for tracking variables such as Words Downloaded and Words Read, as described further in reference to Tables 1-3 below.","Step  identifies the selected content and the content type and stores values for Content ID and Content Type variables. The content type may include the type of media of the selected content, including whether there is textual content, whether the content is paid content such as an online news article or e-book content, or ad content and the like.

When downloaded entirely, the content may be prepared for serial display in segments, for example by retrieving text based on block size. When content is downloaded in sections (e.g., block-by-block), display of a first content section can be initiated for a user without having to wait for the entire download. Additionally, downloading or retrieving by block size allows for efficient use of memory and processing, for example, by storing the content that will actually be used and removing less content when the content will not be used.","Whether entirely downloaded or partially downloaded, for online or offline use, or streamed for online use, the content may be retrieved block by block and displayed and tracked word-by-word.

The predetermined content size may be set in the user settings, the RSVP server, or determined based on connection quality or user device characteristics, such as available memory, or user characteristics such as reading speed and reading level.","Upon partial (step ) or full (step ) download, the Content ID and the Session ID are associated and stored in an RSVP tracking database and updated in the user session (not shown).","Step  identifies a text block for serial display by querying the database and prepares it for the user. Each text is represented on the server side in a table (e.g., as a row or column of data in a table) in the database, including a Text ID, for example. The text block is identified by the Text ID, starting from the Words Downloaded with a Block Size number of words. Additionally, the block may be identified by the latest total Words Read by a user.","Step  retrieves the identified text block and prepares it for serial display. The text block may be a section of the content, including textual content. The textual content may be extracted from the content to be displayed using RSVP display on the user device. That is, the text block is configured for RSVP display by parsing text included in the content, and other displayable elements in the content, and dividing the content into a plurality of displayable elements. The content may be flagged as displayable upon retrieving the text block or after preparing the content for serial display.","For example, for webpage content, the textual content may be extracted by parsing the HTML and scrubbing the webpage for text to display serially. As another example, a content provider may provide content, including text, to be serially displayed using RSVP along with the content, without the need for parsing the content.","Step  initializes the content tracking variables, including Words Downloaded and Words Read, for each new block. Words Read is set to zero (0) and Words Downloaded is set to the block size of words to be serially displayed or the number of words downloaded to the device in this request, or the number of words cached for this iteration of the display.","The Block Size can be either defined in the application as a constant, for example, 10-100 words, or chosen by the user in the application\/OS settings, or computed automatically, based on the network connection quality and user reading speed. The block size may be also be chosen by a time interval such as the time it takes to read a single block, for example on average, or according to a user speed. For example, if your reading speed is 500 words per minute, then the block size would be determined to be 500. This would require a download every minute, and may also be adjusted, depending on the bandwidth of the user's network connection.","That is, the Block Size may vary during the tracking process depending on other conditions and may also be adjusted during the tracking process by the user or by the system, as needed. At the very least, for example, the block size of the last block of a text will be smaller than the other blocks, unless the words in the text are evenly divisible by the block size.","Step  serially displays the text block word-by-word and, after each word, step  increments the Words Read session variable.","Step  determines whether the user is still actively viewing the textual content, for example, by whether the user has stopped the RSVP display of the content. That is, step  determines whether the user stops displaying content. This may be determined, for example, by controlling the RSVP interface to stop the RSVP display or navigating away from the web page or other application interface window in which RSVP display of the content was triggered Additional factors may also be used to determine if the user is still actively viewing the content, for example by monitoring the user's presence, eye position, the user's facial expression, or other indicators via a camera or other monitoring means. Although not illustrated, step  determining may also be performed parallel to step  displaying the content.","If the result of step  is yes, then step  updates the Words Read value in persistent storage on the server side, for example, a database, to be set equal to Words Downloaded minus Block Size, plus Words Read. The Words Read value in the calculation is taken from session where it was incremented for each word read (e.g., each word displayed via RSVP) from the block in step . Method  then proceeds to step  (described further below).","If the result of step  is no, then step  determines whether the current block has finished displaying. If the result of step  is no, then step  continues to serially display the block word-by-word and step  continues to increment the Words Read variable. If the result of step  is yes (i.e., the block finished), then step  determines whether the text is finished.","If the result of step  is yes, then step  determines whether there are sub-texts to display to the user. After step  (not shown), the content may be marked as read to indicate that the user previously accessed and read the content. Alternatively, the content may be marked as read or accessed after step .","If step  determines that there are sub-texts, the sub-texts may be automatically presented based on the content author's request to present particular sub-text. However, they may also be generated based on keywords related to the parent text. For example, a sub-text may be generated to be displayed based on a degree of relatedness between the text content in a text table and text content in a sub-text table.","The same sub-text may appear within multiple related threads and a visual indication may be provided to distinguish such sub-text. A visual indication may include, for example, graying out the title of the sub-text or displaying an indicator or icon distinguishing the sub-text element from other elements.","The sub-text may be based on keywords corresponding to the words that have been serially displayed from the content at a predetermined point in the serial display. The content based on which the sub-content is determined may be referred to as originating content for ease of explanation. The sub-text or the sub-content may be embedded in originating content or looked up dynamically from a lookup list of related keywords. The lookup list may be itself dynamic, based on advertisement supply and demand or bidding outcomes at the time the list is generated.","The sub-text may be displayed under the text display and may be linked to the original text. Specifically, the title of the sub-text is displayed and used to visually represent the sub-text to the user. The sub-text and the text may be visually linked circularly and functionally allow for circular navigation between texts and sub-texts. Each sub-text, similar to the text, may have another sub-text displayed after the sub-text.","If the result of step  is yes, then step  displays the list of sub-texts to the user. That is, representations of the sub-texts (e.g., titles, icons, thumbnails, and\/or other markers), retrieved from the sub-text elements are displayed to the user. Alternatively, the sub-texts may be displayed parallel to serially displaying originating content, in addition to, or instead of, being displayed at the end of the block or at the end of the text of the originating content.","Once the user chooses the sub-text to serially display, by selecting the title of the sub-text, the currently serially displaying Text ID is set to the Sub Text ID, and saved in the session, counting variables are reset and the process returns to step .","If the result of step  is no (i.e., the block is finished but the next is not finished) then in step  the client application sends a request to the server with the current Session ID, to get the next text block.

The RSVP tracking database, for example, may be implemented to include a table such as table 1 below with values for variables including User ID, Content ID, Is Displayable, Words Downloaded and Words Read. The field Is Displayable may be implemented as a flag to mark the selected content serially displayable to the user. The RSVP tracking database may also include additional information relevant to tracking content use, for example a Request ID, Request Entity, Request Type, Total Words, Words Left, Block Size, Is Block Finished, Is Text Finished and Is Charged fields. The tracking database may be used as a buying database to determine the appropriate charge to a user or an advertiser based on content used, and words read.","The variables Is Block Finished and Is Text Finished may be implemented as flags used to indicate whether a downloaded block of text and whether the entire selected text is finished displaying to the user, respectively. The Request ID may be used to keep track of each sequential request for content or partial content. The Request Entity field may be used to track whether the request is by a client or server, or the like.

Therefore, evidence of how likely a user is to find the result relevant combined with keyword scoring or other criteria can provide better search results. The RSVP tracking and trending data may be used to determine relevancy of a search result, by an RSVP search enrichment process, as described herein.","The RSVP search enrichment process begins when a user request is received to display content in RSVP. The RSVP content is provided and the content consumption is tracked. At the same time, the content consumption data is generated and refined. Further, content consumption data is aggregated and grouped by content, user, media and various other analytics. This data is used to enrich the user search results and provide more relevant results to the user.","When a user provides a search term, an object list is extracted based on the search terms and provided to the user in the most relevant order to the user. The object list contains a list of content or pages that relate to at least one keyword or search term. The object list may be initially sorted by assigning an initial rank to each content or page within the list. This initial ranking may be determined using one or more various known search criteria including, for example, the number of other pages that link to the page or the frequency of keywords or search terms within the content or page.","The search results object list is then enriched by the RSVP analytics data to obtain an adjusted ranking to provide more relevant results. One example of enriching the object list is to adjust the ranking after assigning a higher weight to words read (e.g., the total words displayed using RSVP) in a page than to other factors (e.g., user clicks, links to the page, etc.) when determining the adjusted ranking of the object. Another example includes assigning a higher weight to the recent trend trajectory for words read of that website. Thus, page ranking within an object list can be determined according to the Words Read, or other RSVP tracking and trending data, in addition to other weighting variables.","An object within an object list of search results would show up higher in search results because it has a higher number of words read (as a running total of words read) or because of an upward trending trajectory of most recent words read. Ranking can also be determined in combination with other criteria, for example, a number of links that lead to that content based on the search criteria, or a number of clicks. In this case, words read data or RSVP trending data may be used to adjust the existing ranking RSVP enriched search may also be applied to searching videos based on the analytics gathered for RSVP previews and video RSVP data. A video specific search may use RSVPs started and video tracking data, as described further herein.","Now turning to  in detail, step  receives search terms, generated at least in part by a user performing a search. A user may perform a search by submitting search terms to a search application, a web browser, an RSVP enabled application, or an RSVP search ranking application implementing method . The user search query includes at least one keyword or search term. In cases of using a web browser, the search terms and clicks are tracked by search engines and web crawlers to generate usage data for generating search results.","Step  requests a search result based on the search terms and the keywords in the entered search terms.","Step  extracts an object list comprised of content and each content matches the search terms and at least one keyword. The object list includes search results, each entry in the list may include, for example, a sort position, a rank for the object, an object identifier, an object title, and an object preview, such as the first few characters or words of the textual content. The object list format may depend on the type of content being searched. For example, when searching photos, the object list may include a thumbnail of the photo being searched and the textual content associated with the photo, for example from the caption of the image. As another example, the content being searched may include a file being searched in a file system, an email and\/or various other types of content. The sort position may be determined, for example, by how many times a file or photo has been opened or an email has been read.","After step  extracts the object list, step  queries DB  for relevant RSVP tracking data while step  determines the initial content ranking for the objects in the object list, as follows.","Step  determines the initial content ranking of each content or page in the object list, for example, by determining the number of keywords present in the content or the number of user clicks, or a combination of other factors. Step  may be performed parallel to steps -.","Step  queries DB  for relevant RSVP tracking and trending data. DB  contains an aggregation of data which reflects how content on the Internet is actually viewed and read through the use of an RSVP application implementing the displaying and tracking methods previously described and an RSVP search ranking application implementing method . The RSVP data may also contain other knowledge about content usage such as content consumption trends. As described in the context of , RSVP tracking and trending data may be aggregated and gathered in various ways to provide aggregated data that is available to queries for enriching search results. Aggregated tracking data includes a total aggregate of content read (TACR) for a particular media item (Media ID), as shown in media information  (which corresponds to media information of ). TACR for a particular media item is determined based on the total count of words displayed using RSPV across all user view sessions. Trending data may be computed as the rate of change in the tracked data over a predetermined period of time.","Thus, for example, step  may query DB  to return, from media information , total aggregate content read (i.e. TACR), for each content (media) item in the object list. As another example, step  may request a trend trajectory factor from RSVP trends information  for each content item in the object list.","Step  provides the query result from DB , which includes RSVP tracking and trending data, relevant to the object list.","Applying the query result, step  adjusts the initial content ranking based on RSVP tracking and trending data in the query result. For example, the initial rank may be adjusted by a factor of a TACR score for each content in the search results or object list. Additionally, other RSVP data such as RSVP Read % or RSVP Previews Read % from Media information , and RSVP Read % Trend or RSVP Previews Read % Trend from RSVP Trends information , may be used to adjust each object rank.","Here, RSVP data measures such as TACR and TACR Trend, as described above, may be used to increase or decrease initial content ranking of content to better indicate how interesting that content might be to the user performing the search. For example, the initial content ranking of each content in the object list is adjusted by adding or multiplying by a fraction (e.g., 0.1) of the page's trending score to the initial content ranking.","Additionally, TACR and TACR trending factors may be combined to rank the content in the object list. For example, the initial content ranking of each content in the object list is adjusted by adding some fraction (e.g., 0.1) of the page's RSVP trending score and some fraction (e.g., 0.01) of the page's TACR score to the initial content ranking. However, in alternative implementation, both factors are not necessarily needed to determine ranking. For example, in particular alternative implementations, only the trending information may be used or only the TACR may be used to determine the rank.","After adjusting the object list ranking by applying RSVP tracking and trending data, step  returns the RSVP enriched object list to the user. The object list may be returned entirely, or in segments.","The data in RSVP DB  is built from actual user attention related data (reading of RSVP content) collected from RSVP applications that can be distributed to users in all parts of the world. Thus, the RSVP trending and tracking data stored in DB  contains useful information that can be used to adjust an initial content ranking and produce more relevant and interesting results.","Initial content ranking, or initial page ranking, may be based, for example, on simple keyword frequency and the order in which search terms appear in an object (or other factors such as click count or links), to influence the initial page ranking RSVP data may be used in conjunction with initial rank data to rank search results, or object lists.","The tracking and trending data in the RSVP database (i.e., DB ) is continually being enhanced to support search engines and RSVP search ranking applications implementing method , or any applications or programs that may rely on RSVP DB  or RSVP tracking and trending data.","Accordingly, using this data in a content-ranking algorithm (e.g., RSVP search ranking application implementing method  or other ranking algorithm) is an improvement over previous approaches in that it relies at least in part on more direct evidence of content consumption of individual users in the form of words displayed to users via RSVP.","RSVP search ranking application implementing method  or other ranking algorithm may use two types of aggregated RSVP tracking and trending data stored in DB  to gauge how relevant a particular content or page is for a given search term or keyword, total aggregated data and trending data collected in part by RSVP content tracking. For example, aggregated RSVP data may include Total Aggregate Content Read (TACR) data and RSVP trending data.","TACR data includes a total aggregate amount of content read for a specific media (i.e., content) item. TACR data goes beyond the concept of the page being linked from other locations and more accurately indicates the actual amount of content read (i.e., displayed by RSVP) on that page when linking to that page.","TACR trending data may be computed as the rate of change in the TACR data over time. If more people are reading a content than what is \u201cnormal\u201d (for that page), the content is considered to have an upward trending trajectory. If fewer people are reading less content than normal (for that content), the content is considered to have a downward trending trajectory. If approximately the expected amount of content is being read in the content, the trending is considered to be neutral, or normal.","Normal or neutral trending may be determined by an average trend of a predetermined number of people a day reading a predetermined amount of content per day per user. If the number of people per day increases or the amount of content being read increases per day, then the content is considered to have an upward trending trajectory. The trend may also be determined based on a number of unique people reading a predetermined percentage of the content.","With this measure, a downward trending trajectory may actually decrease the content's rank. That is, even though there are many keywords that match, people are currently losing interest in the content.","The trend trajectory of content may be computed as (Latest Trend-Average Trend)\/Average Trend, where Latest Trend is the most recent value of the trending and Average Trend is the expected (average) trending over a historical time period.","Latest Trend and Average Trend may be calculated over predetermined time periods. Latest Trend may be calculated over a short predetermined time period, for example one hour. Thus, the Latest Trend can be computed by subtracting the value of the TACR from the previous hour from the current value of the TACR. Average Trend may be calculated over a longer predetermined time period, for example one day or one week, by averaging the Latest Trend values for that time period. Thus, a trending of zero is neutral.","When Latest Trend is greater than Average Trend, the trajectory is determined as upward trending. When Latest Trend is less than Average Trend, the trajectory is determined as downward trending.","Trending may be represented in decimal form or as a percentage. For example, when half as much content of a content is read than expected, the trending trajectory may be represented as \u22120.5 or \u221250%; when twice as many users read the content as expected, the trending trajectory may be represented as 1.0 or 100%.","RSVP trending can produce more relevant results, for example, in a case where a famous company announces its intention to acquire another company. Many people flock to all of the news stories to learn about the details of the acquisition plans. The news content and pages start with a handful of visitors and the number continues to increase. This results in an increased upward trending trajectory for the content. Even though the news stories do not mention the name of the company more often than old content, such as the company home page itself, those pages would still rank higher in the search results due to their strongly upward trending trajectory. Furthermore, even though the TACR may not be as high for the news content as compared to the company homepage itself, the upward increase in TACR may result in a higher rank for the news results.","As another example, the initial content rank can be normalized by the RSVP ranking program implementing method  for a given content to lie within zero (0) and one (1). One tenth (0.1) of the content's trending score (\u22120.05 or +0.1, from the examples above) and one hundredth (0.01) of the content's TACR score are added to the initial content ranking to obtain the RSVP enriched content ranking for that content.","Accordingly, RSVP tracking and trending data can be used to adjust an estimate of how relevant a content is (its ranking) based on the actual reading of content (not just clicks where it is not known if the content has been read), and such ranking adjustments can be made in real time. This gives the ranking method described herein an advantage in that it can react quickly to the fluid nature of content on the Internet.","Table 13 shows an example of an initial search ranking result prior to applying enrichment using RSVP content tracking data.

Similarly, graph  shows black circles for the y2 data points corresponding to the first word of a sentence and the last word of a sentence. Straight lines connect those data points. It can be empirically demonstrated that users are more likely to select to end RSVP display between sentences than mid-sentence. Moreover, a preferred RSVP implementation inserts short pauses between the last word of one sentence and the first word of a next sentence. Because users are more likely to stop display between sentences than mid-sentence, it will generally be efficient to determine user drops by only plotting data at the end of one sentence and the beginning of another.

For example, as shown in , the keyword \u201cOn Tour\u201d appears four words into the content, \u201cNeon Trees\u201d appears seven words into the content, etc. In this example, one set of opportunities is identified by identifying the portions of the content associated with the most significant drops in the number of sessions. Identifying opportunities in this way is most relevant for RSPV content that does not have sub-content items, particularly RSVP content that does not have sponsored sub-content items. The drops are visible in, for example, graph  () of Total Sessions versus RSVP Read %. The line connecting the data points typically drops after each sentence in the RSVP content.","A second set of opportunities, particularly applicable to content with sponsored sub-content items (for which obtaining a \u201cclick-through\u201d is particularly important), is identified by determining the portions of the content associated with the smallest increases in Cumulative Click-throughs. This can be seen, for example, by analyzing graph  (). The line connecting the data points typically rises after each sentence in the RSVP content.","In some embodiments, at least a portion of step may be performed manually by inspecting graphs generated on a user device screen that is part of a computer system implementing method . For example, as shown in , visual inspection makes clear that particularly steep drops in Total Sessions occur at drops , , and . Therefore, a content-providing user might decide to alter the portion of the content that precedes each drop to determine if more content-consuming users can be retained, further into the content. Similarly, with respect to graph , visual inspection shows that only small increases in cumulative click-throughs occur at rises , , and . Therefore, a content-providing user might decide to alter the portion of the content that immediately precedes each of the smallest rises in click-throughs to determine if click-throughs can be increased.","Alternatively, this portion of step could be performed automatically using an algorithm executed by the computer system. In some cases, the locations of the most significant drops on a graph like , or the smallest rises on a graph like , might not be visually clear on the graph, in which case, such automation identifying relevant content portions may be useful or necessary. An automated process for identifying drops and ranking is described further below in the context of step ","A drop in Total Sessions along graph  is not necessarily a negative event in terms of enhancing RSVP content consumption (particularly with respect to content that has sponsored sub-content items) if the reason for the drop is that consuming user(s) clicked on an RSPV sub-content item at a point during consumption of the main RSVP content item corresponding to the drop. Therefore, step computes a numerical index with respect to certain drops in Total Sessions and certain rises in Cumulative Click-throughs.

All the drops in Total Sessions occurring between the end of one sentence and the start of another can then be ranked in descending order of the value of their Relative Drop Ratios. The process then proceeds to step ","Step identifies the keywords closely preceding the top ranked drop identified in step . The following process can be used by a computer performing step : Using the RSVP Word Number (call it RSVP Word Number) for the word immediately preceding the drop identified in , attempt a lookup of RSVP Word Numberto determine if it is present in keywords sequence information ; if yes, then return corresponding Keyword Name value (see Table 16 showing the relevant relations of data values); if the user has not requested to obtain additional keywords, then stop; if no, or if yes but the user has requested additional keywords, then decrement n and repeat until the desired quantity of keywords have been returned.","In step , the process of improving the RSVP content identified in step or Step is conducted manually by the content creator.

In this example, the manual analysis includes modifying and repositioning content at the beginning of the content item, including the content associated with the drops  and , e.g., the first and third sentences, which immediately precede those drops. Associations between other keywords and the click-through options can also guide the analysis. For example, the keywords \u201chomepage,\u201d \u201ctickets\u201d and \u201cwin backstage passes\u201d are also used after RSVP display stops to represent the click-through options (\u201chomepage\u201d is linked to www.maroon5.com and \u201cwin backstage passes\u201d and \u201ctickets\u201d are linked to www.vipnation.com\/backstagepasses).
