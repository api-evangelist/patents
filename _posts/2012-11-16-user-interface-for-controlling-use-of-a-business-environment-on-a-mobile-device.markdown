{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61\/562,979 filed on Nov. 22, 2011 and entitled \u201cProvisioning Work Environments on Personal Mobile Devices\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference. This application is also related to the patent applications entitled \u201cProvisioning Work Environments on Personal Mobile Devices\u201d Ser. No. 13\/678,964 and \u201cControlling Use of a Business Environment on a Mobile Device\u201d Ser. No. 13\/678,966, all of which are assigned to the assignee of this application and have been filed on the same day as this application.","Over the past decade, enterprises have experienced a substantial increase in the productivity of its workforce when providing them with business mobile devices. In the past, given their high cost, business mobile devices were mainly allocated to management and focused on providing employees with email access and cellular phone capabilities. However, recent improvements in the computing power, mobile display technologies and connection speeds of mobile devices, combined with the continued decreases in hardware costs, have made powerful mobile devices available even to the general public for personal use. More and more individuals personally own powerful mobile devices, such as smartphones, that, in addition to serving as a cellular phone, can be used in many of the same ways as a desktop or a laptop, such as accessing emails, browsing documents or the internet, game playing, listening to audio or viewing a video, and personal information management (PIM).","Due to the above trends in mobile devices, enterprises are currently experiencing an \u201cinvasion\u201d of personal devices into the workplace. Given the sophisticated capabilities of their personal mobile devices, employees no longer desire possessing a separate personal and business mobile device and continually pressure information technology (IT) departments to support personal devices brought into the workplace. As such, IT departments struggle to maintain a proper balance between enabling a certain level of access to enterprise data (e.g., such as access to email, contacts, documents, and the like) on personal devices and ensuring adequate security measures to protect corporate intellectual property in such enterprise data. This phenomenon has led enterprises to investigate the viability of a \u201cBring Your Own Device\u201d (BYOD) strategy to IT, where a personal mobile device is provisioned by IT departments with the capability of operating as a complete business mobile device in a secure fashion.","Such a BYOD strategy could significantly decrease IT costs (e.g., by eliminating or reducing the need to purchase and provision hardware devices) and provide mobile enterprise access to many more employees than was previously possible (e.g., due to cost concerns), thereby achieving greater increases in productivity than before. However, significant challenges arise in provisioning \u201cwork environment\u201d on a personal mobile device that maintains adequate security and data partitioning between the employee's \u201cpersonal world\u201d and the employer's \u201cbusiness world.\u201d","One or more embodiments of the invention provide virtualization as the solution for consolidating personal and business uses in a single mobile device. One feature of virtualization is that it preserves isolation of the personal and work environments. As a result, the user need not provide enterprise IT departments any control of the user's personal environment and the enterprise IT departments can retain strict control of the user's work environment. Another feature of virtualization is that the user's work environment will be platform independent. In other words, regardless of the type of personal mobile device the user chooses, the resulting business mobile device through virtualization will be identical. Therefore, enterprise IT departments need to support only one type of business mobile device.","One method for providing a graphical user interface to provision business environments on mobile devices, according to one or more embodiments of the invention, comprises presenting a navigation panel that displays a virtual phone template menu item and a policy setting menu item. Upon selection of the virtual phone template menu item, a template user interface is presented in a display panel that enables an administrator to customize virtual phone image templates for users in an enterprise to be delivered to mobile devices that are configured to run the virtual phone image templates as virtual machines on the mobile devices in order to provide a business environment. Upon selection of the policy setting menu item by the administrator, a policy user interface is presented in the display panel that enables the administrator to set security policies corresponding to the virtual phone image templates, wherein each of the security policies specifies a time interval within which a mobile device running a virtual machine corresponding to one of the virtual phone image templates should communicate with an enterprise server to comply with the security policy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["115","110","105","100","105","100","120","105","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["115","100","200","115","205","210","105","100","210","215","100","105","100","220","100","105","100","105","105","210","225","225"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3E","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3C"],"b":["205","210","205","210","210","205","200","110","105","210","200","215","105","100","105","110","105","100","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3D","FIG. 3D","FIG. 3D","FIG. 3D"],"b":["210","220","100","220","100","105","105","105","110","220","220","105","100","105","105","105","105","105","100","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3E","FIG. 3A"],"b":["210","110","100","225","225","115"]},"It should be recognized that the views of  are merely exemplary and that alternative embodiments of admin user interface  and admin service  may implement different user interfaces with different design decisions that offer different management functions than those depicted in . For example, embodiments of administration service  may further provide an administrator a capability to maintain a menu of \u201ca la carte\u201d mobile applications that can be separately provisioned to a particular user's business mobile device , for example, upon request of such user and separate from any default mobile applications that are included in virtual phone images.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","100","400","405","400","400","405","400","105","100","405","105","100","105","105","405","400","105","405","415","400","105","105","405","400","430","100","405"]},"A personal mobile device  having firmware OS  that includes enabler component  is able support a mobile application package  that comprises a variety of functional components such as a hypervisor , a provisioning tool  and a management service . In one embodiment, a user may download mobile application package  from a mobile application store  such as the Android Market, Apple App Store, Amazon Appstore, etc. For example, such a mobile application package  may take the form of a .apk file if downloaded from the Android Market. Once downloaded and installed on the host OS of personal mobile device , mobile application package  authenticates and binds itself to enabler component , thereby enabling the various functional components of mobile application package to execute in higher privileged and\/or secured modes. Hypervisor  is a virtualization layer running on top of firmware OS  which provides necessary services to enable execution of a virtual machine for business mobile device . In one embodiment, the guest OS included in a virtual phone image  for business mobile device  includes \u201cparavirtualized\u201d guest drivers for each device of personal mobile device  that enables a virtual hardware layer (or virtual machine monitor) of the virtual machine to intercept hypercalls for device specific behavior and forward such hypercall requests as needed to hypervisor , which in turn facilitates communication with the actual hardware devices of personal mobile device . It should be recognized that alternative embodiments may utilize a non-paravirtualized implementation where guest drivers and the guest OS of virtual phone image  may be unaware that they are running on top of a virtualization layer. As further depicted in , mobile application package  also includes a provisioning tool  that may, for example, provide a user interface and other support services to assist a user in retrieving virtual phone image  and other configuration information (e.g., policy configurations, additional mobile applications, etc.) from virtual phone provisioning service  of mobile management server  in IT department . Mobile application  further includes a management service  that once installed, continuously runs as a service on the host OS and periodically communicates with virtual phone leasing service, for example, in order to comply with various security policy settings for business mobile device  or to provide various updates (e.g., OS updates, customizations, new applications, etc.) to virtual phone image  of business mobile device . In one embodiment, because management service  is able to run in a higher privilege or security level due to its binding to enabler component , it cannot be manually terminated by the user of personal mobile device  (e.g., without such user obtaining root access, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["425","105","100","500","100","400","405","505","100","410","100","410","510","420","410","420","420","420","215","240","200","215","425","420","420","100","420","215","425","215","100","420","100","215","420","215","215","425","420","100"]},"In step , provisioning tool , as described above, establishes a connection (e.g., wireless) with virtual phone provisioning service  and provides the unique identifying information to virtual phone provisioning service  to identify a virtual phone image  corresponding to the user. In step , virtual phone provisioning service  receives the unique identifying information and, in step , dynamically generates or otherwise identifies a previously stored default virtual phone image  corresponding to the unique identifying information (and thus, the user). For example, in one embodiment, virtual phone provisioning service  determines an identity of the user from the received unique identifying information and is able to identify a default virtual phone image  stored in a file system repository of mobile management database  that corresponds to the business group of the user (see, e.g., ). In step , virtual phone provisioning service  transmits virtual phone image  to provisioning tool . In one embodiment, such virtual phone image  is transmitted as a zip file. In step , virtual phone provisioning service  similarly identifies policy settings corresponding to the user's business group (see, e.g., ) as well as any additional mobile applications requested by the user (and supported by IT department ) that are not included in virtual phone image , and in step , transmits the policy setting and additional mobile applications to provisioning tool . In one embodiment, communication between virtual phone provisioning service  and provisioning tool  during transmission of virtual phone image , business group policy settings, and additional mobile applications occurs through RESTful APIs (representational state transfer application programming interface). In steps  and , provisioning tool  receives virtual phone image , group policy settings and additional mobile applications, respectively. In one embodiment, provisioning tool  receives and stores virtual phone image , due to its size (e.g., 3 GBs or higher in some embodiments), on an external storage card of personal mobile device , such as an external microSD card or other similar small form factor mass storage devices. Alternative embodiments may store virtual phone image  in the internal memory (e.g., NAND flash memory or embedded eMMC\/eSD memory chips) of personal mobile device . In step , provisioning tool  initializes business mobile device . For example, in one embodiment, during such initialization, provisioning tool  provides certain group policy settings received in step , such as lease settings, to management service  to initiate a periodic \u201cleasing\u201d communication with virtual phone leasing service  in accordance with the lease settings for the user's business group (see, e.g., ). Similarly, provisioning tool  may provide other group policy settings, such as password settings, to hypervisor  to enable hypervisor  to properly control password access to business mobile device . The initialization process may additionally install any additional mobile applications into virtual phone image . Once initialized, in step , the user may launch business mobile device  in a virtual machine supported by hypervisor  using virtual phone image . Similarly, once virtual phone image  has been delivered and installed on personal mobile device , at step , mobile management platform  may update a user profile corresponding to the user (see, e.g., ) to indicate that the user's business mobile device  has now been activated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3D"],"b":["200","100","425","422","410","220","200","422","100","422","600","422","605","422","220","610","615","422","220","105","425","415","105","422","105","100","115","105","105","105","105","200","205","105","422","220","422","620","422","605"]},"If, however, in step , a connection is not successfully established (e.g., due to a malicious user who has stolen personal mobile device  and turned off its wireless network capabilities), then in step , if a time period for an auto-wipe setting (e.g., 4 days in ) has elapsed, then in step , management service  will permanently delete or otherwise remove virtual phone image  from personal mobile device  thereby permanently wiping the existence of business mobile device  from personal mobile device  for security purposes. It should be recognized that the wiping of business mobile device  from personal mobile device  does not affect a user's ability to use personal mobile device . If, the time period for auto-wipe has not elapsed, then, in step , if a time period for an auto-disable setting (e.g., 1 day in ) has elapsed, then, in step , management service  will temporarily disable access by the user to business mobile device  until a connection with virtual phone leasing service has been re-established in step . It should be recognized that the flow of  for lease communications is merely exemplary and various alternatives may be made consistent with the teachings herein. For example, while  describes a \u201cpolling\u201d technique in which management service  running on personal mobile device  initiates an attempt to establish communications with virtual phone leasing service  of mobile management platform , alternative embodiments may employ a push model, whereby virtual phone leasing service  utilizes a periodic timer to transmit push messages to management service  on personal mobile device  to request management service  to connect back to virtual phone leasing service .","Although one or more embodiments of the present invention have been described in some detail for clarity of understanding, it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the claims.
