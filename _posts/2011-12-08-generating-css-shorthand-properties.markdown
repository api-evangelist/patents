title: Generating CSS shorthand properties
abstract: An authoring tool for CSS retains original user syntax and generates CSS markup that minimizes a total number of properties in the markup. A directed graph is generated from the original user markup. Nodes in the graph can be collapsed and expanded to convert between longhand and shorthand properties. User input updating property values can result in the generation of compact CSS code that retains syntactical features of the original user syntax.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) refers to formatting rules developed by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) for web page content. The word \u201ccascading\u201d refers to the way CSS determines how a particular element is ultimately displayed in the web page. The style (color, font and spacing) in which the element is displayed is affected by the style sheet created by the author of the page, by the user's customized style selections (if any), by the default styles of the browser that displays the page, by CSS specificity (a methodology that gives different weight to particular kinds of CSS rules), and by the order of CSS rules, creating a complex \u201ccascade\u201d of potentially conflicting rules in which determinations that have higher priority override those with lower priorities.","CSS separates content (e.g., HTML code) from the CSS rules that define how the content looks (referred to as \u201cthe presentation\u201d of the content). HTML code resides in an HTML file and the CSS rules that define how the content looks reside in an external style sheet file with a .css extension or in a particular part of an HTML document. In addition to controlling the appearance of text on the web site, CSS can be used to control the format and positioning of block-level elements. Block-level elements are produced by using tags such as the h1, p and div tags to delimit blocks of content that are treated as a single element.","A CSS formatting rule is composed of a selector and the declaration or block of declarations. The selector can be a tag such as h1, p, a class name or an identifier that identifies the formatted element. The declaration block defines the style properties to be applied to the indicated content. For example, in the following rule:","p {","font-size: 12 pt;","font-family: Arial;","font-weight: bold;","}","selector p indicates that the content of a paragraph will be displayed in a 12 point bold Arial font. The font-size, font-family and font-weight tags denote properties of the paragraph content and 12 points, Arial and bold are values of the respective properties. Because one rule can apply to many tags (e.g., in the example rule above, the rule can apply to the content of many different paragraphs), changing the appearance of all the block elements using the same rule can be effected by changing a single rule.","CSS statements can specify a value for each separate property explicitly in a longhand declaration for that particular property. CSS also allows for the creation of shorthand declarations, an abbreviated way to specify the values of several properties using a single declaration, by using shorthand property names. The use of shorthand property names has the effect of combining several associated properties into a single declaration by replacing all the individual property names with the shorthand property name. The values for the properties can be specified in a comma separated list. For example, the border property is a conceptual perimeter line around an element, between the inner padding and outer margin space. The border keyword is a shorthand property name composed of a border-style property, border-width property and border-color property. Each of these properties can be set individually. Each of these properties can be set for the top, right, bottom and left side of the element. A shorthand definition of the border property can omit values for some of the properties that make up the shorthand property. Shorthand CSS rules assign default values to omitted property values.","An authoring tool can convert between longhand and shorthand CSS properties. CSS properties can be edited in a code editor or in a more graphical form such as a property grid. Existing CSS syntax and placement of CSS statements can be preserved. Conversion between longhand and shorthand properties can be implemented by creating a directed graph and walking nodes within the directed graph.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Overview","Web authors are often particular about how their markup code looks. Typically, web authors prefer to minimize the amount of CSS code they produce. They often have individual preferences with respect to code placement and other conventions (such as but not limited to capitalization preferences). Known web page authoring tools can change the appearance of a web author's code when the code is changed. Authoring tools that are presently available produce wordy syntax and do not reliably maintain the existing syntax and code placement. In accordance with aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein an authoring tool generates compact CSS syntax that preserves as much of the existing syntax as possible by expanding and contracting portions of a directed graph built from a group of CSS statements based on walking the nodes of a second directed graph built from features of the CSS language. The directed graph created based on the features of the CSS language acts as a template, as described more fully below.","A CSS property is a semantic entity which determines how CSS styles an HTML element. A CSS property declaration is a syntactical construct which allows an author to specify the values of CSS properties within CSS markup. CSS properties can also be specified in non-declarative ways that do not use CSS property declarations, such as for example, by calling APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) within a DOM (Document Object Model). There is often a direct 1:1 correspondence between CSS properties and CSS property declarations. A 1:1 correspondence between CSS properties and CSS property declarations exists for a longhand CSS statement. Known authoring tools can display and update the values of longhand CSS properties by finding a CSS property declaration with the same name as the CSS property and honoring rules about ordering. Shorthand CSS property declarations sever the 1:1 relationship between properties and their declarations. When the 1:1 correspondence does not exist, known authoring tools can still determine the value of a CSS property but are not able to allow a user to change the values of CSS properties while outputting CSS syntax with CSS shorthand property declarations that follow the existing pattern in the CSS created by a user.","In accordance with aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein, the grammar of CSS property declarations is modeled as a directed graph. The directed graph can exist independently of any actual CSS markup. That is, the directed graph can apply statically to the grammar of CSS itself, instead of applying to any particular string within the CSS grammar. Such a graph is illustrated in which shows the directed graph for the border property , having components width , style  and color . The width  component of the border property  points to the border-width property . The border-width property  has components top , right , bottom  and left  that point respectively to the border-top-width property , border-right-width property  and so on. The edges described are all outgoing edges but it will be appreciated that for each outgoing edge an incoming edge also exists. For example, the width  component of the border property  has an incoming edge from border-width property  and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"c ","b":"180"},"#element {\n\n","}","The arrows in directed graph  show pieces of text that are connected by edges. For example, in directed graph , border-left-style  has a value \u201cdotted\u201d (value ). Border-left-style  is connected by an edge  to the style component of border, style . The value (\u201csolid\u201d) of the style component of border, style  conflicts with the value of border-left-style  \u201cdotted\u201d. To determine which value takes precedence, the template (e.g., ) is examined to determine all the possible incoming edges for border-left-style. The incoming edges for border-left-style  are border-left.style , border-style.left  and because border-style  has an incoming edge from the style component of the border property, style , border-left-style  has an indirect incoming edge from the style component of the border property, style . Because the border-left-style: dotted statement comes later in the markup, the style of the left border will be dotted.","Similarly, to determine the color of the top border, three possible incoming edges for border-top-color  are border-top.color , border-color.top  and indirectly border.color . In the directed graph  for the markup, the value for border-top.color (which is yellow)  conflicts with the value for border-color.top (which is red) . The top border will be red because of the !important indicator in the","border-color: red blue green aqua !important;","line. This property group cannot be collapsed because all the sides of the border are not the same color and because border-color has an !important indicator attached and the other properties in the property group do not have an !important indicator.","The directed graph can include internal and external nodes where internal and external nodes can represent shorthand or terminal property components and\/or shorthand or terminal CSS properties. A terminal property is a property defined using CSS where the definition does not include any symbols that can be replaced by other properties. A shorthand property is a property defined using CSS whose definition includes one or more symbols that can be replaced by other properties. A shorthand property component is a non-terminal symbol within the definition of a shorthand property which can be replaced by other properties. Thus a parent property is a shorthand property.","For example, consider a property named \u201cwidth\u201d, labeled here for clarity as [width], and a property component named \u201cwidth\u201d, a component of a property named \u201cborder\u201d, labeled here as [border].[width]. Edges in the graph originate from shorthand property components and point towards other CSS properties. An outgoing edge therefore can indicate that a shorthand property component can specify the value of the CSS properties to which a path exists in the graph. Hence, a shorthand property can be viewed as any property including a component with outgoing edges, while a terminal property is any property without any outgoing edges. All terminal properties can have a single component named [value], but instead of pointing to another property declaration in the grammar, each terminal property can instead have an outgoing edge to the semantic property with the same name as its parent terminal property.","The directed graphs described above can be used to determine the value of a CSS property as defined in a group of CSS statements. A dictionary implemented by walking the nodes of the directed graph created from the grammar of the CSS property declarations and extracting values from the group of CSS statements can map labeled nodes within the graph to the syntactical values that are associated with the nodes in the markup. For example, the CSS statements:","body","{","outline: 4px solid red;","margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px;","width: 10px;","}","results in a mapping of component name [outline].[width] to the syntactical value 4px. Component [outline].[style] is mapped to the syntactical value solid. Component [outline].[color] is mapped to the syntactical value red. Component [margin].[top] is mapped to the syntactical value 1px. Component [margin].[right] is mapped to the syntactical value 2px. Component [margin].[bottom] is mapped to the syntactical value 3px. Component [margin].[left] is mapped to the syntactical value 4px. Component [width].[value] is mapped to the syntactical value 10px. It will be appreciated there no direct 1:1 correspondence between property components and the syntax used to create the mappings in the dictionary.","The CSS statements:","body","{","outline: 4px solid;","margin: 1px;","}","results in a mapping of component name [outline].[width] to the syntactical value 4px. Component [outline].[style] is mapped to the syntactical value solid. Component [outline].[color] is mapped to the syntactical value initial. Component [margin].[top] is mapped to the syntactical value 1px. Component [margin].[right] is mapped to the syntactical value 1px. Component [margin].[bottom] is mapped to the syntactical value 1px. Component [margin].[left] is mapped to the syntactical value 1px. Component [width] [value] is mapped to the syntactical value 10px. It will be appreciated that the value of [outline].[color] does not appear in the markup. Its value is implied by the rules of CSS. Similarly, the values of the margin components other than [top] do not appear in markup\u2014instead their values are made equal to the value for [margin].[top], in accordance with the rules of CSS.","A parser capable of understanding the grammar of CSS can be used to create a dictionary. The parser can also understand the semantics implied by the grammar, so that missing values, values for nodes in the directed graph for which a literal representation in the markup is not found, can be filled in. The dictionary can be examined to find entries within it for all nodes within the graph from which a path exists to the semantic property in question. For example, suppose the value of the semantic \u201cmargin-left\u201d property is desired. Two nodes in the graph: [margin-left].[value] and [margin].[left] can be examined. The [margin-left].[value] node has an outgoing edge in the graph to the [margin].[left] node. If neither node exists in the dictionary, the property is unspecified in the markup. If neither node exists in the dictionary, the value of the node which conies last in the markup (or the one which has an !important keyword specified for it and which comes last in markup is used to determine the value, thereby determining the value of the semantic shorthand property.","The CSS graph can be comprised primarily of terminal property nodes with out any incoming edges. A shorthand property group is a subgraph of connected nodes within the larger graph comprising shorthand properties which may or may not have incoming edges, along with terminal properties which have at least one (but may have more) incoming edges originating from the components of these shorthand properties. Terminal properties without any incoming edges are not a part of any shorthand property group.","In accordance with aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein, to set the value of a semantic property, the shorthand property group to which a terminal property belongs is determined. If the terminal property does not belong to a shorthand group, a 1:1 mapping between semantic properties and syntactical property declarations exists and the last declaration whose name matches the semantic property is selected. If no declaration is found for the matching property, anew declaration can be created.","The directed graph representing a shorthand property group can include multiple nodes that point to the same terminal node. In accordance with aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein, the node that minimizes the number of property declarations needed to simultaneously specify all of the semantic properties within the shorthand group specified by the style declaration is selected.","A set of terminal properties can be collapsed into a shorthand property if all of the following conditions are met:","1. All of the terminal properties to which the shorthand property has outgoing edges are specified within the CSS markup. Because a shorthand property specifies a value for all of its constituent terminals, a shorthand notation cannot be used if one of the terminals of the shorthand notation is unspecified, although a terminal value can be specified by the implicit initial value implied by a missing component.\n\n2. The importance of all the terminals match. The \u201c!important\u201d syntax can be applied to a shorthand property as a whole. It cannot be applied to a subset of the components of the shorthand property.\n\n3. All the terminals of the shorthand property are specified as inherit, or none of the terminals of the shorthand property are specified as inherit. A shorthand property declaration that is specified as inherit creates the implication that its constituent terminals have the same value.\n\n4. All the terminals of the shorthand property are specified as initial, or none of the terminals of the shorthand property are specified as initial. The shorthand property allows for implicit initial specification of values using a syntax which omits the component in question (i.e. [outline].[border], etc.)\n\n5. The specified values are the same for all the terminals of each component of the shorthand property having outgoing edges within the graph to more than one terminal property.\n","The conditions described above can be implemented using the lookup dictionary by:","1. Finding all terminal properties to which the shorthand property has an outgoing edge in the graph (either directly or through a larger path). If any of these nodes are not present in the lookup dictionary the shorthand property cannot be collapsed.","2. The specified value and the importance of the property within which the terminal property is specified is stored in the lookup dictionary. If the importances of the terminal properties do not agree, the shorthand property cannot be collapsed. If the importances of the terminal properties agree, the shorthand property can be collapsed. The importance of the shorthand property declaration generated is set to the importance shared by the terminals.\n\n3. If the values of all of the terminals in the lookup dictionary for inherit do not match, the shorthand property cannot be collapsed. If the inherit values agree, the shorthand property can be collapsed.\n\n4. If the values of all of the terminals in the lookup dictionary for initial do not match, the shorthand property cannot be collapsed. If the initial values agree, the shorthand property can be collapsed.\n\n5. For each component of the shorthand property, the paths in the graph along its outgoing edges can be walked to find all the terminal properties specified by the component. If the values of the terminal properties do not agree, the shorthand property cannot be collapsed. If the values of agree the shorthand property is collapsed to the value shared by all of the terminals.\n","Some shorthand groups include more than one shorthand property within the group. A path exists within the directed graph between a shorthand collapse group and every shorthand property within the parent shorthand group. The set of terminal properties specified by each shorthand property within the shorthand collapse group is disjoint. Thus while there is a path from the shorthand collapse group to every shorthand property, there is only a single path for each terminal property.","The list of shorthand collapse groups within each shorthand group can be computed by walking the graph and grouping together the disjoint shorthand properties. Each shorthand collapse group can be assigned a theoretical minimum score comprising the number of shorthand properties within the collapse group, representing the case in which each of the shorthand properties in the group can be collapsed. The list of collapse groups can be iterated over in ascending order of their minimum scores. An attempt can be made to attempt to collapse each shorthand property within each collapse group. Because each shorthand property is disjoint in the terminals that it specifies, the order in which the attempt to collapse properties within the collapse group is immaterial. The number of properties to which a particular shorthand group can be collapsed to is determined, ranging between 0 and N, where N is the total number of terminals specified by the shorthand.","That is, 0 represents the case in which of the shorthand's constituent terminals have a specified value. 1 represents the case in which all of the constituent terminals are specified and they are collapsible to the shorthand using the process described above, N represents the case in which all of the constituent terminals are specified, but they are not collapsible to the shorthand. In this case the shorthand can be expanded out to the terminal properties. Other values n can represent that n terminals are specified. In this case the shorthand can be expanded out for the n terminal properties. The total number of property declarations that each of the shorthand properties within the collapse group collapse to can be summed. If the sum is less than the theoretical minimum of the next shorthand collapse group in the list, the most compact format possible has been found. Otherwise, the current result can be saved and the next group can be processed. These acts can be repeated until the iteration that generates the fewest property declarations is found.","To edit CSS properties preserving existing CSS syntax and placement of CSS statements, a dictionary mapping can be built between nodes in the graph to the values specified in the markup. The graph can include nodes whose value is checked for equality against other values, regardless of syntax (needed to generate the most compact CSS output), and the actual syntactical representation of the value in markup, the importance of the parent property within which the value is currently specified. When anew value is set for a semantic terminal property the existing value for the terminal property can be accessed in the dictionary. If the terminal property is not found in the dictionary and the user wants to \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cunset\u201d the value, no action is taken because the terminal property already has the requested value. If the new value matches the existing value, no action is taken because the terminal property already has the requested value. Otherwise the terminal property's value in the dictionary can be updated in accordance with user input.","A list of new property declarations and their values can be created from the dictionary. Because the actual syntactical representation of these values is stored in the directed graph, when a shorthand property is expanded, values can be copied from other components of the shorthand property using the existing syntactical representation. The list of property declarations in the parent style declaration can be iterated through to build a dictionary mapping existing property declaration names to their corresponding property declarations. The last property declaration within the style declaration which is a member of the shorthand group for the terminal property that is being updated can be stored. The list of new property declarations can be iterated through to write them out. The order in which the property declarations are added to the style declaration is immaterial because the declarations generated are optimal and will have the same semantic effect enabling preservation and ordering of the existing syntax as follows. When a new properly declaration is created, the dictionary can be examined. If an existing property declaration with the same name as the new one exists, the declaration can be updated in place to match the new version of the declaration. Only the nodes that have changed will need to be updated, thereby preserving both the syntax and the ordering of the property declaration within its parent style declaration.","If an existing property declaration with the same name as the new one does not exist, a new declaration can be created and can be added to the parent style declaration. Because most web authors place similar properties near each other in a style declaration, instead of adding the created property declaration to the end of the style declaration, it can be added after the last property declaration from the shorthand group, and the last property declaration can be updated to the created property declaration. All the property declarations in the style declaration can be iterated over again. If the property declaration is a member of the current shorthand group, and is not a property declaration that was updated or created, then this is an outdated property declaration can be removed it from the style declaration.","Generating CSS Shorthand Properties",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":"a ","b":["100","100","100","100","104","100"]},"System  may include one or more computers or computing devices such as a computer  comprising: one or more processors such as processor , etc., a memory such as memory , and a CSS authoring tool such as CSS authoring tool .

Thus, the methods and apparatus described herein, or certain aspects or portions thereof, may take the form of program code (i.e., instructions) embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other machine-readable storage medium, wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein. As used herein, the term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall be taken to exclude any mechanism that provides (i.e., stores and\/or transmits) any form of propagated signals. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the computing device will generally include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. One or more programs that may utilize the creation and\/or implementation of domain-specific programming models aspects, through the use of a data processing API or the like, may be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language, and combined with hardware implementations.","Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above. Rather, the specific features and acts described above are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"a ","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"b ","b":"150"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"c ","b":"180"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
