{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This Application is a Continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 09\/112,750, filed on Jul. 10, 1998, now Issued U.S. Pat. No. 6,727,948.","The present invention relates to an image processing method and apparatus and, in particular, discloses a process for utilising autofocus information in a digital image camera.","Recently, digital cameras have become increasingly popular. These cameras normally operate by means of imaging a desired image utilizing a charge coupled device (CCD) array and storing the imaged scene on an electronic storage medium for later down loading onto a computer system for subsequent manipulation and printing out. Normally, when utilizing a computer system to print out an image, sophisticated software may be available to manipulate the image in accordance with requirements.","Unfortunately such systems require significant post processing of a captured image and normally present the image in an orientation in which is was taken, relying on the post processing process to perform any necessary or required modifications of the captured image.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for enhanced processing of images captured by a digital camera utilising autofocus settings.","In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of generating a manipulated output image by means of a digital camera, the method comprising the steps of:\n\n","Preferably the focus settings include a current position of a zoom motor of the digital camera.","In a preferred embodiment the digital image manipulating process includes a step of locating an object within the focused image utilizing the focus settings.","The method may include the step of printing out the manipulated image by means of a printing mechanism incorporated into the digital camera.","It is preferred that the digital image manipulating process selectively applies techniques to the focused image on the basis of the focus settings.","The preferred embodiment is preferably implemented through suitable programming of a hand held camera device such as that described in the concurrently filed application, Applicant's reference ART01, U.S. Ser. No. 09\/113,060 entitled \u201cA Digital Camera with Image Processing Capability\u201d filed concurrently herewith by the present applicant the content of which is hereby specifically incorporated by cross reference and the details of which, and other related applications are set out in the tables below.  shows a block diagram thereof.","The aforementioned patent specification discloses a camera system, hereinafter known as an \u201cArtcam\u201d type camera, wherein sensed images can be directly printed out by an Artcam portable camera unit such as illustrated in . Further, the aforementioned specification discloses means and methods for performing various manipulations on images captured by the camera sensing device  leading to the production of various effects in any output image . The manipulations are disclosed to be highly flexible in nature and can be implemented through the insertion into the Artcam of cards having encoded thereon various instructions for the manipulation of images, the cards  hereinafter being known as Artcards. The Artcam further has significant onboard processing power by an Artcam Central Processor unit (ACP)  which is interconnected to a memory device  for the storage of important data and images.","In the preferred embodiment, autofocus is achieved by processing of a CCD data stream to ensure maximum contrast. Techniques for determining a focus position based on a CCD data stream are known. For example, reference is made to \u201cThe Encyclopedia of Photography\u201d editors Leslie Stroebel and Richard Zakia, published 1993 by Butterworth-Heinemann and \u201cApplied Photographic Optics\u201d by London & Boston, Focal Press, 1988. These techniques primarily rely on measurements of contrast between adjacent pixels over portions of an input image. The image is initially processed by the ACP in order to determine a correct autofocus setting.","This autofocus information is then utilized by the ACP  in certain modes, for example, when attempting to locate faces within the image, as a guide to the likely size of any face within the image, thereby simplifying the face location process.","Turning now to , there is illustrated an example of the method utilized to determine likely image characteristics for examination by a face detection algorithm .","Various images eg. ,  and  are imaged by the camera device . As a by product of the operation of the auto-focusing the details of the focusing settings of the autofocus unit  are stored by the ACP . Additionally, a current position of the zoom motor  is also utilized as zoom setting . Both of these settings are determined by the ACP . Subsequently, the ACP  applies analysis techniques in heuristic system  to the detected values before producing an output  having a magnitude corresponding to the likely depth location of objects of interest ,  or  within the image ,  or  respectively.","Next, the depth value is utilised in a face detection algorithm  running on the ACP  in addition to the inputted sensed image  so as to locate objects within the image. A close output  corresponding to a range value indicates a high probability of a portrait image, a medium range indicates a high probability of a group photograph and a further range indicates a higher probability of a landscape image. This probability information can be utilized as an aid for the face detection algorithm and also can be utilised for selecting between various parameters when producing \u201cpainting\u201d effects within the image or painting the image with clip arts or the like, with different techniques or clip arts being applied depending on the distance to an object.","It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and\/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiment without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiment is, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.","The present invention is further best utilized in the Artcam device, the details of which are set out in the following paragraphs although it is not restricted thereto.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal inkjet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal inkjet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric inkjet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of page width print heads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the inkjet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new inkjet technologies have been created. The target features include:","low power (less than 10 Watts)","high resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)","photographic quality output","low manufacturing cost","small size (page width times minimum cross section)","high speed (<2 seconds per page).","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the inkjet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty five different inkjet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table below.","The inkjet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems","For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the print head is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the inkjet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.","Cross-Referenced Applications","The following table is a guide to cross-referenced patent applications filed
