title: Platform with cooling circuit
abstract: A turbine engine component has an airfoil portion, which airfoil portion is bounded by a platform at one end. The platform has an as-cast open cavity bordered by at least one as-cast landing. A plate is welded to the at least one as-cast landing to cover and close the as-cast open cavity. A process for forming the turbine engine component is described.

The government of the United States of America may have rights to the subject matter described herein.","The present disclosure is directed to a turbine engine component having a platform with a cooling circuit and a process for forming same.","Currently, a high level of cooling technology for turbine airfoil platforms involves the placement of a miniature core within the wall of the platform. This core is suspended between the hot side of the wall, or gas path, and the cold side of the wall. This technology pulls air from the cold non-gas path side through a number of cooling fins, i.e. trip strips protruding from the gas path side, and pins or pedestals spanning between the hot and cold walls. The air is evacuated out onto the gas path surface where the air spreads out on the surface to create a thin film of cooler air to help further protect the surface from hot gas path air.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","20","22","24","26","28","16","18","30","32","16","12","34","32","12","12","30","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["16","36","38","22","24","14","14","40"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["16","36","38","22","24","12","14","14","40","14","42","14","44"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["12","16","46","34","48"]},"This technology works extraordinarily well; however, it is complicated to implement in turbine vanes. It requires a four piece wax assembly for a turbine doublet which is not production friendly. The technology is expensive.","An inexpensive approach to forming a turbine engine component with a platform cavity is described herein.","In accordance with the present disclosure, a turbine engine component broadly comprises an airfoil portion, said airfoil portion being bounded by a platform at one end, said platform having an as-cast open cavity bordered by at least one as-cast landing, and a plate welded to said at least one as-cast landing to cover said as-cast open cavity.","Further in accordance with the present disclosure, there is provided a process for forming a turbine engine component comprising the steps of casting a turbine engine component having an airfoil portion with a pressure side and a suction side and a platform with an open cavity and a landing positioned on a periphery of said cavity, positioning a plate over an opening in said open cavity, and welding said plate to said landing to close said cavity.","Other details of the platform with cooling circuit are set forth in the following detailed description in which like reference numerals depict like elements.","Referring now to , there is shown a turbine vane  with a covered platform cavity . The vane  has outer  and inner  platforms with an airfoil  spanning between them. The airfoil  has multiple internal cavities  and  and has both a pressure or concave side  and a suction or convex side . The outer and inner platforms  and  respectively have both a hot gas path side  and a cooler non-gas path side . The outer platform  has a platform cavity  which is formed by welding a plate  onto the vane . The entrance  to the cavity  is a hole extending through the plate . This hole allows the cooler air on the non-gas path side  to enter the platform cavity  and flow through the cavity  to exit onto the hot gas path side  of the outer platform  where this air creates a thin film of cooler air on the surface which protects that surface from the hot gas path air.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["104","130","132","110","112","102","122","102","110","112","114","108","102","134","136","102","104","104","138","140","134"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIGS. 7 and 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["104","130","132","110","112","102","122","122","142","102","102","122","134","122","142","122","104"]},"The hole  in the plate  is positioned over an entrance area  of the casting . The hole  allows cooling fluid from the non-hot gas side of the platform  to enter the cavity . Holes  are drilled into or otherwise formed in the exit area  of the cavity  so that the air can flow out of the cavity  into the hot air gas path.  shows the arduous paths  the air must travel from the entrance  of the cavity to the holes  to exit onto the gas path side of the platform . It should be noted that the plate  does not add any appreciable structural member to the platform  as its cored counterpart.","As can be seen from , the airfoil  has a chord line . The cavity  may be located on either the pressure side or the suction side of the chord line .","The process for forming the turbine engine component involves positioning the cores  and  in a mold (not shown). The turbine engine component  is then formed by a casting technique wherein molten metal is poured into the mold (not shown). As a result of the casting process and subsequent solidification of the molten metal, there is formed a component  having the airfoil  with the pressure side  and the suction side , the platforms  and , the open cavity  in the platform , the protrusions , the at least one trip strip, , the entrance area , the exit area , and the peripheral landing . Following solidification, the cores  and  may be removed using any suitable technique, such as leaching, known in the art. The plate  may then be attached to the outer platform  using any suitable welding or brazing technique known in the art. The exit holes  may be formed either before or after the plate  is installed. The exit holes may be formed using a drilling technique such as EDM.","One significant advantage to the technique described herein is that it is inexpensive. Another advantage is that while the entrance  may be located at the leading edge of the cavity  and the exit holes  may be located at the trailing edge of the cavity , it is entirely feasible to reverse the structure as shown in . This means that the same air which is used to cool the back side of the platform  flowing forward can be used to create a protective cooling air film on the gas path side flowing aftward over the same region. This reverse flow is not possible using a mini core configuration due to the shape of the exits. The present technique may provide a distinct advantage in areas that can not be cooled by enhanced back side cooling alone.","There has been provided in accordance with the present disclosure a platform with a cooling circuit. While the present disclosure has been made in the context of one or more embodiments, it should be apparent that unforeseen alternatives, modifications, and variations may become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. It is therefore intended to embrace those alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["8","8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
