The criteria of the Association of European Psychiatrists (ICD) and the American Psychiatric Association (DSM) for the diagnosis of schizophrenia require two or more characteristic symptoms to be present: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior (positive symptoms), or negative symptoms (alogia, affective flattening, lack of motivation, anhedonia). As a group, people with schizophrenia have functional impairments that may begin in childhood, continue throughout adult life and make most patients unable to maintain normal employment or otherwise have normal social function. They also have a shortened lifespan compared to the general population, and suffer from an increased prevalence of a wide variety of other neuropsychiatric syndromes, including substance abuse, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and abnormal involuntary movements prior to antipsychotic treatment. Schizophrenia is also associated with a wide range of cognitive impairments, bipolar disorders, major depression and anxiety disorders, the severity of which limits the functioning of patients, even when psychotic symptoms are well controlled. The primary treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications. Antipsychotics, for example risperidone, olanzapine, however, fail to significantly ameliorate the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. Antipsychotic drugs have shown clinical efficacy for the treatment of the following diseases:","Fibromyalgia, which is a syndrome characterized by chronic generalized pain associated with different somatic symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, stiffness, balance problems, hypersensitivity to physical and psychological environmental stimuli, depression and anxiety (2012, 26(2): 135-53);","Schizoaffective disorders: includes psychotic and affective symptoms, this disorder falls on a spectrum between bipolar disorders (with depressive and manic episodes, alcohol and drug addiction, substance abuse) and schizophrenia. 2010, 712, 14-92011, 13 (5), 291-302;","Major depression: 2011, 11, 86;","Treatment resistant depression: 0(0) 1-16;","Anxiety: 2011, 21, 429-449;","Bipolar disorders: 2011, 14, 1029-1042012, pages 1-122011, 0(0), 1-15;","Mood disorders: 2012, January 112010, February 24(2), 131-61;","Autism: 2011, 23:621-627; J.

The described compounds have been shown to reverse the L-687,414 ((3R,4R)-3 amino-1-hydroxy-4-methyl-pyrrolidin-2-one, a NMDA glycine site antagonist) induced hyperlocomotion, a behavioral pharmacodynamic mouse model for schizophrenia, described by D. Alberati et al. in 97 (2010), 185-191. The authors described that hyperlocomotion induced by L-687,414 was inhibited by a series of known antipsychotic drugs. The compounds of formula I demonstrate marked activity in this model. The results are shown in Table 1. These findings predict antipsychotic activity for the present compounds, making them useful for the treatment of positive (psychosis) and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, substance abuse, alcohol and drug addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorders, cognitive impairment, bipolar disorders, mood disorders, major depression, resistant depression, anxiety disorders, Alzheimer's disease, autism, Parkinson's disease, chronic pain, borderline personality disorder, sleep disturbances, chronic fatigue syndrome, stiffness, antiinflammatory effects in arthritis and balance problems.","In addition to the reversal of L-687,414 induced hyperlocomotion experiment as described above, some compounds of the present invention have been tested in SmartCube\u00ae, an automated system in which the behaviors of compound-treated mice in response to multiple challenges are captured by digital video and analyzed with computer algorithms (Roberds et al., Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2011, Vol. 5, Art. 103, 1-4). In this way, the neuro-pharmacological effects of a test compound can be predicted by similarity to major classes of compounds, such as antipsychotics, anxiolytics and antidepressants. Examples 13, 54, 58, 71 show similarity to atypical antipsychotics. The results are shown in Table 2.","WO9106545 describes a very close structure containing a phenyl substituted imidazole moiety for Ar for prevention of clumping of both erythrocytes and thrombocytes.

This was assessed by using a computerized Digiscan 16 Animal Activity Monitoring System (Omnitech Electronics, Columbus, Ohio) to quantify locomotor activity. Animals were kept under a 12 h light\/dark cycle and experiments were performed during the light period. Each activity monitoring chamber consisted of a Plexiglas box (41\u00d741\u00d728 cm; W\u00d7L\u00d7H) with sawdust bedding on the floor surrounded by invisible horizontal and vertical infrared sensor beams. The test boxes were divided by a Plexiglas cross providing each mouse with 20\u00d720 cm of moving space. Cages were connected to a Digiscan Analyzer linked to a computer that constantly collected the beam status information. Records of photocell beam interruptions for individual animals were taken every 5 min over the duration of the experimental session and the sum of the first 6 periods was used as the final parameter. Compounds were administered either p.o. 15 min before a s.c. injection of 50 mg\/kg of L-687,414, or i.p. at the same time as a s.c. injection of 50 mg\/kg of L-687,414. Mice were then transferred from their home cage to the recording chambers for a 15-min habituation phase allowing free exploration of the new environment. Horizontal activity was then recorded for a 30-min time period. The % inhibition of L-687,414-induced hyperlocomotion was calculated according to the equation:\n\n((-687,414 horizontal activity\u2212drug+-687,414 horizontal activity)-687,414 horizontal activity)\u00d7100\n","IDvalues, defined as doses of each compound producing 50% inhibition of L-687,414-induced hyperlocomotion, were calculated by linear regression analysis of a dose-response data using an Excel-based computer-fitting program.","As data was not presupposed to be normally distributed, groups treated with test compounds were statistically compared with the control (vehicle-treated) group using one-tailed Mann Whitney U tests. In statistics, the Mann-Whitney Utest (also called the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test for assessing whether one of two samples of independent observations tends to have larger values than the other. It is one of the most well-known non-parametric significance tests. A p value gives the probability that two groups are significantly different from each other and the value of <0.05 is generally accepted as a criterion, it implies that there is >95% chance that two groups are really different from each other.

above, some compounds have been tested in SmartCube\u00ae, an analytical system developed by PsychoGenics Inc.","SmartCube\u00ae was used to compare the behavioral signature of a test compound to a database of behavioral signatures obtained from a large set of clinically approved reference drugs, grouped per indications. In this way, the neuro-pharmacological effects of a test compound can be predicted by similarity to major classes of compounds, such as antipsychotics, anxiolytics and antidepressants. This approach is ideally suited to screen collections of existing drugs or drug candidates with previously unknown neuropharmacology, which could expedite the development of new and unexpected treatments for psychiatric disorders.","Some compounds of the present invention were injected i.p. at different doses 15 minutes before the test. At least 8 mice were used in each treatment group. Digital videos of the subjects were processed with computer vision algorithms to extract over 2000 dependent measures including frequency and duration of many different behavioral states. The results of the classifications are presented as bar charts for each compound and dose (mg\/kg), the Y-axis indicates the relative probability that the test compound will show efficacy in the specific CNS indication.","The bar charts of example compounds 13, 54, 58 and 71 at a dose of 25 mg\/kg are shown in . For comparison, the behavioral signatures of the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone are shown in . Compounds of the present invention show similar signatures to those of atypical antipsychotics. An independent analysis was performed on the unclassified data to determine the similarity of the example compounds to active doses of known atypical antipsychotics. For this analysis, we use discrimination rate as the measure of separability between the two drugs, i.e. one drug's \u201cdistinguishability\u201d from another. A rate equal to 50% (or 0.5) corresponds to zero distinguishability. Empirical data has shown that a threshold rate for reliable separation lies above 70% i.e., two drugs showing a discrimination rate of 70% or lower are considered similar, whereas a discrimination rate higher than 70% indicates that two drugs are dissimilar. The table below shows the similarity analysis of selected compounds of the present invention to several atypical antipsychotics. In most cases, the example compounds show a similarity to risperidone, clozapine and olanzapine with a discrimination rate of \u22660.70.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0996","num":"1204"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Similarity analysis of compounds of formula I (at 25"},{"entry":"mg\/kg) showing effects in SmartCube\u2009\u00ae"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Clozapine","Olanzapine","Risperidone"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Example 13","0.69","0.70","0.72"]},{"entry":[{},"Example 54","0.69","0.61","0.63"]},{"entry":[{},"Example 58","0.63","0.69","0.66"]},{"entry":[{},"Example 71","0.79","0.66","0.63"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Therefore, it can be assumed that the present compounds have similar efficacies as known atypical antipsychotics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0998","num":"1206"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0999","num":"1207"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations.
