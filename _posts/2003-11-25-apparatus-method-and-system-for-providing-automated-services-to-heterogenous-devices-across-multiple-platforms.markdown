{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND INFORMATION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application relates to an apparatus, method and system for providing automated services to heterogeneous devices across multiple platforms, including while maintaining a consistent synchronized state.","As computing technology advances, the number of personal devices, communications protocols, and diversity of connectivity choices may increase. In particular, these devices may include, for example, a desktop personal computer (PC), a laptop computer, a personal data assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a GPS in-car navigation system, a digital camera, a MP3 player, and other devices. The choice of protocol may include, for example, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) in Common Object Request Broken Architecture (CORBA), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) with Extension Markup Language (XML), or any other appropriate protocol. The choice of connectivity may include, for example, Ethernet, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 a\/b\/g (WiFi), ZigBee, Infrared Detection and Acquisition (IrDA), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Code Division Multiplexed Access (CDMA), and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM).","These devices, however, may not communicate directly with each other, because, for example, they may not support a common communication protocol or they may be implemented in different programming languages. As devices become smaller, less expensive, prolific, and more focused on a single application, device interoperability may pose a greater challenge. Even if a device can communicate via multiple protocols, the ability to move to new standards may remain problematic and difficult to achieve.","Each of the devices may have different computation power, screen sizes, computation power, and connection capabilities, and hence connecting these devices to each other and other networks, such as, for example, the Internet or any other network, may require a significant amount of programming and manual synchronization to achieve consistent states. Providing services to these devices may be difficult and may demand a significant programming effort and infrastructure.","For rapid application development, a standard platform may be desired so that programmers may focus on application development rather than dealing with multiple languages and\/or multiple connectivity issues. In this regard, the underlying operating system and system libraries of the standard platform may provide an abstraction or simplified interface to shield the multiple connection protocols and hardware-specific details. However, a suitable standard platform for devices may be lacking in that for each new software application written, a significant amount of programming effort may be required to deal with device-specific details, which may prolong application development and limit the deployment of the application to other devices.","Other challenges may exist as well to provide services to devices. In particular, providing services to mobile devices via a wireless network may also pose a challenge, due to delay and availability constraints, for example. In particular, delay constraints may arise due to limited bandwidth, packet loss, and backbone delay, which may present difficult challenges to engineers who may have limited or no control over these constraints. Public backbones, such as, for example, the Internet or cellular networks, may be highly latent and may provide only limited coverage. Hence, mobile applications may be required to work in a not-always-on environment, using a network only when it's available.","An exemplary embodiment and\/or exemplary method of the present invention may provide Automated Services to heterogeneous devices Across multiple Platforms (ASAP) while maintaining a consistent synchronized state. The heterogeneous devices may include, for example, a personal data assistance (PDA), a wireless device, a mobile telephone, a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) unit, an in-car navigation system, a digital camera, a MP3 player, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a printer, a digital video recording device, a home appliance, or any other heterogeneous device. In this regard, an exemplary ASAP system may deliver software (applications), services (transactions) and data (personal profiles and application data) over wide and local area networks, and may provide transparent device-to-device and device-to-services connections without actively initiating connections to services providers. Moreover, the exemplary ASAP system may better address the issues of delay and latency, and may provide asynchronous messaging to update with server when the network is available.","An exemplary ASAP method and\/or system may provide automatic registration of devices.","An exemplary ASAP method and\/or system may provide automatic synchronization between devices so that data may be kept as current or up-to-date as possible.","An exemplary ASAP method and\/or system may provide automatic discovery of device capabilities.","An exemplary ASAP method and\/or system may provide a simplified application programming interface (API) to hide much of the protocol and connectivity details required to access services so that the burden of programming may be reduced. In this regard, the ASAP system may use a markup language (such as, for example, the Extension Markup Language (XML)) or a reduced\/compressed version thereof.","An exemplary ASAP method and\/or system may use a platform for deploying and managing applications in a coordinated fashion, such as, for example, the Open Systems Gateway interface (OSGi). In this regard, the use of OSGi may provide enhanced exchange services, such as bundles. In particular, OSGi may be utilized to provide, for example, a well-defined and protected execution environment for bundles, additional life cycle management, persistent data storage, version management, etc.","An exemplary ASAP method and\/or system may also provide anonymous services through a web portal (which may act as a proxy for the user to consume other web services) to devices of interest using, for example, a message oriented architecture.","An exemplary ASAP method and\/or system may also provide a mechanism to connect distributed services in a peer-to-peer network. In this regard, an exemplary ASAP system may use a markup language (such as, for example, the Extention Markup Language (XML)) as an underlying messaging interface format and may define a set of protocols for data exchange and service request\/response. ASAP is intended, however, to be implementable in any language.","An exemplary ASAP method and\/or system may utilize, for example, Jini network technology to connect distributed services within a Java network. In particular, the exemplary ASAP system may use a centralized service location broker.","An exemplary embodiment is directed to a system to provide automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment, in which the system includes a device agent residing on each of the heterogeneous devices, a device communicator to register and synchronize the devices via each of the device agents, and a portal server to interface multiple content sources on behalf of the devices, wherein the devices communicate with the portal server via each of the device agents and the device communicator.","Another exemplary embodiment is directed to a system to provide automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment, in which at least two of the devices support different protocols and connectivities.","Yet another exemplary embodiment is directed to a system to provide automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment, in which the devices

system to provide automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment, in which the single unified messaging interface allows future expansion capabilities without a fixed binding of a function call for an application programming interface.","Yet another exemplary embodiment is directed to a system to provide automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment, in which the device communicator is configured to store device capabilities during a registration of the devices.","Still another exemplary embodiment is directed to a system to provide automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment, in which the device capabilities include a connectivity capability.","Yet another exemplary embodiment is directed to a system to provide

a video capability.","Yet another exemplary embodiment is directed to a system to provide automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment, in which the device communicator is configured to deliver software updates to the devices via the device agent.","Still another exemplary embodiment is directed to a system to provide automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment, in which the device communicator is configured to deliver the software updates when the device is available.","Yet another exemplary embodiment is directed to a system to provide automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment, in which the portal server is configured to at least one of aggregate and cache data from the multiple content sources.","Still another exemplary embodiment is directed to a system to provide automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment, in which the portal server is configured to maintain data persistency so that devices that are not always on have access to a most recent snapshot.","Yet another exemplary embodiment is directed to a system to provide automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment, in which at least one of the multiple content sources resides on a wide area network.","Still another exemplary embodiment is directed to a system to provide automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment, in which the at least one of the multiple content sources resides on the Internet.","An exemplary method is directed to providing automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment across multiple platforms, including providing a single messaging interface on each device via a device agent which communicates with a device communicator via a device-specific connectivity and communication protocol, registering each of the devices via the device communicator to record device capabilities of each of the devices, aggregating data from multiple content sources via a portal server, caching the data, and downloading and synchronizing the data via the device communicator.","An exemplary method is directed to providing automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment across multiple platforms includes issuing a service request via the single messaging interface, sending the request from the device agent to the device communicator, modifying the request to conform to the network environment, forwarding the request to a service provider via the portal server, and receiving a reply from the service provider via the portal server.","Another exemplary embodiment is directed to providing automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment across multiple platforms, in which the system includes a single messaging interface on each device via a device agent which communicates with a device communicator via a device-specific connectivity and communication protocol, an arrangement to register each of the devices via the device communicator to record device capabilities of each of the devices, an arrangement to aggregate data from multiple content sources via a portal server, an arrangement to cache the data, and an arrangement to download and synchronize the data via the device communicator.","Yet another exemplary embodiment is directed to providing automated services to heterogeneous devices in a network environment across multiple platforms, in which the system includes an arrangement to issue a service request via the single messaging interface, an arrangement to send the request from the device agent to the device communicator, an arrangement to modify the request to conform to the network environment, an arrangement to forward the request to a service provider via the portal server, and an arrangement to receive a reply from the service provider via the portal server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","101","102","103","104","105","106","107"]},"The devices , , and  include a layer of device-specific software, the so-called device agent, which supports a common language (such as, for example, the Extension Markup Language (XML)) to interface with the device communicator . The device communicator  acts as a gateway or moderator to coordinate the devices , , and  in a local network neighborhood. The device communicator  supports multiple communication protocols and connectivity standards so that it may talk to other devices in one language (e.g., XML) but using different protocols and\/or connectivity standards (such as, for example, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) in Common Object Request Broken Architecture (CORBA), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) with Extension Markup Language (XML), Ethernet, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 a\/b\/g (WiFi), ZigBee, Infrared Detection and Acquisition (IrDA), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Code Division Multiplexed Access (CDMA), and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), or any other appropriate communications protocol or connectivity standard). The device communicator  also performs device registration, synchronization, and user authentication and authorization. The device agent provides the application programmer with a \u201csimplified\u201d way of communicating with the device communicator . The device communicator  provides a seamless integration and synchronization among the devices , , and  in the local area network. Hence, instead of connecting individual devices directly (point-to-point) to a network, such as, for example, the Internet, to obtain services, the device communicator  provides a \u201cmiddleware\u201d solution that hides protocol and connectivity details from the device. Consequently, services from the Internet, for example, may be provided without being concerned about future development of new protocols, services, and connectivity.","To obtain services from external sources, the device communicator  makes a request based on the information collected from the multiple devices , , and  via the device agent and issues the request to the portal server . In this regard, it may be assumed that the device communicator  has a better capability in making the request to obtain web services. The portal server  acts as a proxy\/gateway to request, consume, and\/or distribute web services from a variety of content sources. In this regard, the identity of the person may be protected because the portal server  issues the service request on the behalf of the user via a service agent . Also, a variety of services may be aggregated and cached, thus providing a faster response time and better use of network bandwidth. For example, if user A requests today's weather at a certain zip code and user B within the same zip happens to make the same request, the result may be immediately be returned.","The portal server  may store information regarding the devices and\/or service providers. In this regard, the portal server  may include a user profile database  that maintains an updated copy of the user profile and application data so that intelligent content services and synchronization among different devices may be provided. In a wireless network environment, availability may not always be guaranteed so that another mechanism, such as, for example, a queue structure, may be required to save the data, profiles, and results for later retrieval.","According to an exemplary embodiment of the ASAP system, a PDA device equipped with, for example, an IEEE 802.11b compliant interface may check and send Short Message Service (SMS) messages via the device communicator  without the need to connect it to or line up infrared ports with a cellular telephone. In this regard, the device communicator  may communicate with the cellular telephone on behalf of the PDA device.","According to another exemplary embodiment, the device communicator  supports both the IEEE 802.11b and Bluetooth standards.","According to another exemplary embodiment the communication messages between devices , , , the device communicator , and\/or the portal server  may be compressed to increase the data transfer rate. In particular, the data compression may be required to meet bandwidth constraints.","According to another exemplary embodiment the communication between devices , , , the device communicator , and\/or the portal server  may be encrypted so that security of the exchanged data may be increased.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["150","105","151","152","105"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["200","11","101","102","103","104","12","104","101","102","103","104","106","151","154","151","154","106","104","101","102","103","104","13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["201","21","104","22","104","104","23","104","104","24","104","104","25","104","104","26","104","104"]},"The exemplary method  may be applied to document printing. For example, suppose a document is desired to be printed from a PDA to a network printer. Rather than downloading the document to a personal computer (PC) and triggering the print operation from the PC, a print request may alternatively be sent (using, for example, the IEEE 802.11b standard) to the device communicator  which may be installed in a local access point (a so-called \u201cHot Spot\u201d). The device communicator  may then parse the input request and forward the document directly (e.g., via a wired network) to the network printer without going through the PC, thus providing anonymous services in a user transparent manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","301","302","303","303","300","300","302","303"]},"The exemplary ASAP system may be based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture rather than a client-server approach. In this exemplary architecture, each participating device, that is, each peer, belongs to a peer group, such as, for example, a local area impromptu network neighborhood formed by nearby devices through authentication and authorization. Each device has a device agent capable of communicating to a device communicator, residing, for example, on another device. The device communicator may also function as a device agent except that it may be additionally responsible for device synchronization, device registration, authentication, authorization, and obtaining services from service providers. The device communicator may aggregate the service requests from each device to form a single query and may be required to have a suitable connectivity\/bandwidth to the service provider to obtain responses. To accommodate unreliable networks, the device communicator may also cache the requests and results so that if the devices become disconnected a reconnection and resend of the request may be performed. According to an exemplary embodiment, at least one device communicator should exist in the peer group. As devices join and leave the network, their roles may change. For example, a more capable (e.g., faster connectivity or higher computation power) device may become the device communicator and replace the existing one (see, for example, ). The \u201chands-off\u201d protocol should be transparent to other peers (devices). Hence, a flexible and dynamic network topology may be provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["401","402","401","402"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","501","502","503","504","501","502","503","504"]},"Some of the services\/standards\/protocols associated with the layers may be supported only in the device communicator due to bandwidth and computational constraints. The device communicator  is responsible for connecting to the service provider. Thus, for example, the device communicator  may be required to support the HTTP or SOAP protocol while the device agent may support XML or CORBA. The core layer services are mainly components of device communicator as it manages the local device neighborhood, maintains a list of connections, and performs synchronization among the devices. Security is a core component in the core layer , as each device may be required to register with the device communicator through authentication and authorization.","Interprocess communication in a heterogeneous distributed environment may require support for different language bindings (e.g., C, C++, Java, etc.), different protocols (e.g., HTTP, IIOP, RMI, HTTPS, SOAP, XML, XML-RPC, etc.) and different frameworks (e.g., CORBA, OS sockets, JMS, Java object serialization, etc). To alleviate the burden of application programmers, who may write components for the system, a lightweight layer is provided which abstracts or simplifies the networking and system issues for efficient communication. Instead of producing wrappers\/adapters for each module for each protocol to communicate to other modules, which may be tedious and prone to errors, a simplified application programming interface (API) may be provided to make all this communication transparent. To support the requirements mentioned above, a Message Oriented Middleware (MoM) may be provided in the protocol layer .","The Message Oriented Middleware (MoM) may be implemented as software that runs continuously (e.g., acting as a server middleware) to regulate and facilitate the exchange of messages between publishers (those who \u201cannounce\u201d) and subscribers (those who \u201clisten\u201d). The message may be described with XML-encoded Meta information. Message data may include simple ASCII text, GIF images, XML data, Java objects, or any binary-encoded data. Other protocols, such as, for example, E-mail or SOAP may be plugged in later without making any changes in the client code. The MoM may hide much of the networking protocol and operating system issues, which should alleviate the burden of maintaining socket communication and session management from programmers.","The service layer  may allow applications to be written quickly by leveraging the ASAP platform. The discovery service module allows a device agent to discover a device communicator and setup a connection for service request\/response and synchronization. A device information service provides information regarding device capabilities so that a service request from multiple devices may be aggregated. In this regard, application developers may focus on service-oriented business logic rather than setting up\/maintaining network connections and synchronizing devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["71","72","73","74","75","76","77"]},"The exemplary ASAP system may provide publishing services. For example, when a device agent requests a service, it may publish a service request to the device communicator, which is thereafter referred to as a token. The token is a container that may be passed from a device agent to the device communicator and vice versa. To provide a generalized format, XML may be used to provide an easily expandable and hierarchical representation. XML may also be used to aggregate information from other agents and send back results from service providers to device agents via device communicator.","An exemplary ASAP system may aggregate the requests of the multiple devices. For example, to serve a service request, aggregate information may be required to be provided by the devices. Since each device may have different capabilities, a new request may be required to be constructed on behalf of the device that initiated the service. As explained in the PDA example, the cellular telephone capabilities and PDA functions may be combined to complete the request. Unlike a client-server model, which may require users to perform all the steps above to acquire different information from each device, type them in the web browser, and read the results back, an exemplary ASAP system uses a peer-to-peer approach where each device is coordinated by the device communicator and thus facilitates the service-oriented architecture.","An exemplary ASAP system may also provide subscription services. For example, in a publish\/subscribe model, multiple devices may subscribe to an interested event (e.g., calendar event) even when only one device makes the request. In this regard, the devices that demonstrate their interest in certain events may be updated without overwhelming the network with redundant packets. During the subscription, the device may also mention the priority that provides more efficient access (e.g., the device communicator may batch up the results in a single send rather than updating each device for each request). This may provide the benefit of optimizing the network usage as well as reducing the latency.","As mentioned in the subscribing events description, when the results come back, the device communicator may also synchronize the devices in the network neighborhood to keep them up-to-date. In this regard, users may not need to synchronize devices explicitly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","80","81","82","83","84","85","86","87"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","90","91","92","93","84"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIGS. 10","i":["a ","b "],"b":["10","1","2","3","4","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","104","106","105"]}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A","b":["1","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 10B","b":["4","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
