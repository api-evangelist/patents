Description of the Related Art","(Note: This application references a number of different publications as indicated throughout the specification by one or more reference numbers in superscript . A list of these different publications ordered according to these reference numbers can be found below in the section entitled \u201cReferences.\u201d Each of these publications is incorporated by reference herein.)","Realizing high-resolution fluorescence imaging within scattering biological tissues is a central goal in biomedical imaging. Considerable efforts have been made to extend the imaging depth of optical methods, but focal excitation of fluorescence has so far been fundamentally limited to a depth of one transport mean free path, or approximately one millimeter in most biological samples. This is because conventional focusing approaches treat scattered light as noise and select for the ballistic light component, which exponentially decreases with depth. However, scattered light contains important information about the sample, which can in fact be utilized. When light passes through scattering samples, its wavefront is seemingly randomized, but the randomization occurs in a deterministic and time-symmetric way. These properties of elastic light scattering have recently been used to focus light through turbid samples by iterative wavefront optimizationand by time-reversal using optical phase conjugation. These methods are, in many ways, analogous to adaptive optics methods used in astronomy to cancel out the effect of atmospheric scattering. However, in contrast to astronomy where it is sufficient to image through a turbid medium (the atmosphere), the goal of biomedical imaging is to image inside.","To achieve focusing inside tissues, Xu et. al.proposed a scheme termed time-reversal of ultrasound encoded light (TRUE), which combines optical phase conjugationwith ultrasound encoding. They used focused ultrasound, which is much less scattered than light in biological tissues, to create a virtual source of light frequency-shifted by the acousto-optic effect. Scattered light emanating from this source was then time-reversed by a photorefractive crystal acting as a phase conjugate mirror. Xu et. al.inferred the formation of a time-reversed optical focus from a line-scan across millimeter-scale absorbers embedded in tissue-mimicking phantoms.","While promising improved absorption contrast, the use of this technique for high-resolution fluorescence imaging in biological tissues remains fundamentally challenging. Because of the low ultrasound modulation efficiency, the phase conjugate mirror has to provide orders of magnitude higher than unity gain to excite detectable fluorescence. This requirement cannot be met by traditional phase conjugate mirrors based on photorefractive crystals whose gain is typically much less than one.","Moreover, the significant challenge of undesired background illumination due to partial phase conjugation needs to be addressed. With complete time-reversal, the TRUE focusing technique can be conceptually represented as photons retracing their paths back to the location of the virtual source. However, this view disregards the wave-nature of light: complete time reversal requires full control over phase, amplitude and polarization of the entire scattered field over the full solid angle\u2014which is fundamentally unfeasible (see Section I.1). As a result, even with perfectly aligned optics and noise-free recording of the scattered wavefront, the time-reversed focus is necessarily accompanied by a backgroundwhich would obscure the fluorescence signal originating at the desired optical focus.","One or more embodiments of the present invention present a new strategy to overcome these challenges by combining digital phase conjugationwith dynamic wavefront manipulation. The formation of an optical focus can be directly visualized, exciting fluorescence between layers of highly scattering tissue. This provides confirmation of the presence of the accompanying background, predicted by theory, that can be dynamically reproduced and subtracted. This digital background cancellation procedure, along with the high phase conjugate gain and resolution of one or more embodiments of the technique, enable the first demonstration of focused fluorescence imaging 2.5 millimeters deep inside biological tissue.","Fluorescence imaging is one of the most important research tools in biomedical sciences. However, scattering of light severely impedes imaging of thick biological samples beyond the ballistic regime.","One or more embodiments of the invention directly show focusing and high-resolution fluorescence imaging deep inside biological tissues, by digitally time-reversing ultrasound-tagged light with high optical gain (\u02dc5\u00b710). We confirm the presence of a time-reversed optical focus along with a diffuse background\u2014a corollary of partial phase conjugation\u2014and develop an approach for dynamic background cancellation.","To illustrate the potential of our method, one or more embodiments image complex fluorescent objects and tumor microtissues at an unprecedented depth of 2.5 mm in biological tissues, at a lateral resolution of 36 \u03bcm by 52 \u03bcm, and at an axial resolution of 657 \u03bcm.","The results set the stage for a range of deep tissue imaging applications in biomedical research and medical diagnostics.","For example, one or more embodiments of the present invention include a method for irradiating a scattering medium, comprising:","(a) encoding light, in one or more regions of a scattering medium, with a signal (e.g., ultrasound);","(b) collecting a portion of the encoded light, comprising one or more encoded fields, in a digital optical phase conjugation (DOPC) device comprising a spatial light modulator connected to a camera;","(c) producing, in the DOPC device, one or more time reversed fields that are phase conjugates of the encoded fields of the portion of the encoded light;","(d) irradiating the scattering medium with the time reversed fields, wherein the time reversed fields include a desired component that converges back to the one or more regions, and a background component due to incomplete time reversal resulting from only the portion of the encoded light being collected;","(e) detecting, on a detector, output radiation based on an interaction between the time reversed fields and the scattering medium (e.g., fluorescence), to produce a first detected signal;","(f) irradiating the scattering medium with one or more background fields that at least approximate the background component;","(g) detecting, on the detector, output radiation based on an interaction between the background fields and the scattering medium (e.g., fluorescence), to produce a second detected signal; and","(d) subtracting, in a computer, the second detected signal from the first detected signal, to obtain an output that at least approximates an interaction between a complete time reversed field, of all of the encoded light's fields, and the scattering medium.

To further confine the ultrasound-modulated volume along the axis of ultrasound propagation, both the ultrasound source and the laser are operated in pulsed modesuch that light only enters the sample when the ultrasound pulse has reached the target modulation volume (calculated resolution along the axis of ultrasound propagation: 54 \u03bcm).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 1()","FIGS. 2-4","FIG. 1()"],"sub":"0","sup":["2","2"]},"Inside the sample, a fraction of the light was frequency-shifted to f+fby an ultrasound transducer (element size: 6.35 mm, focal length: 6 mm; V3330, Olympus NDT, USA) operated at f=45 MHz. To achieve maximal resolution along the axis of ultrasound propagation, the transducer was driven with short pulses (pulse length: 1 cycle at 45 MHz, 55 V peak-to-peak) triggered by the laser Q-switch signal at a fixed delay such that the ultrasound pulses coincided with the laser pulses at the ultrasound focus(the trigger delay was jittered by \u00b15.5 ns to minimize the detection of coherent effects between ultrasound-tagged and untagged light, see Section II.3).","To scan the ultrasound focus, the transducer was mounted on a three axis computer-controlled micromanipulator (Sutter Instruments, USA). After passing through the sample, the scattered beam was recombined with the reference beam (horizontally polarized), which had also been frequency shifted by fby an acousto-optic modulator (AFM-502-A1, IntraAction, USA). After passing a horizontally aligned polarizer and another beamsplitter, the combined beams reached the surface of a phase only spatial light modulator (SLM; vis-PLUTO, Holoeye, Germany), carefully aligned (1:1 pixel-to-pixel match) to the image plane of a high dynamic range sCMOS camera (pco.edge, PCO AG, Germany). The lens used to image the SLM onto the sCMOS camera was a commercial compound lens (Nikon Micro-Nikkor 105 mm f\/2.8).","Compared to the digital optical phase conjugation system first described by Cui and Yang, one or more embodiments of our improved digital optical phase conjugation (DOPC) system directly imaged SLM pixels onto CCD pixels and thus enabled reliable alignment and day-to-day quality assurance (see below). Since the image in this embodiment had to be reflected by a beamsplitter, we chose a plate beamsplitter (High-Energy Nd:YAG 50\/50, Newport Corporation, CA) whose reflective surface faced both SLM and camera, to avoid image aberrations and ensure precise alignment.","2. Gain","With traditional phase conjugate mirrors, the power in the phase conjugated beam (P) is proportional to the power in the signal beam (P). This proportionality is referred to as the gain of the phase conjugate mirror:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0087"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"G","mo":"=","mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["P","OPC"]},{"mi":["P","S"]}]}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"Because of the low ultrasound modulation efficiency and the small area ratio between ultrasound focus and scattered wavefront, the scattered light field reaching the phase conjugate mirror consists mostly of light that is not frequency-shifted (f) and a minute fraction (in the setup of , 10-10of the total power) of frequency-shifted, ultrasound-tagged light (f\u00b1f). Therefore, to excite detectable fluorescence at the optical phase conjugate focus, a phase conjugate mirror with a gain orders of magnitude larger than unity is required. This is currently not achievable by traditional phase conjugate mirrors, even with advanced phase conjugation schemes.","To selectively phase conjugate only the frequency-shifted light with high gain, the setup of implements an improved digital optical phase conjugation scheme (DOPC) that consists of a high dynamic range sCMOS camera and a high-resolution phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM). The scattered, ultrasound-tagged light field interferes with an equally frequency-shifted reference beam (f+f) and is imaged onto the sCMOS camera. Using digital phase-shifting holography, the phase of the frequency-shifted wavefront (\u03a6(x,y)) with respect to the reference beam is measured. By reflecting off a phase-only spatial light modulator displaying a phase conjugate map (\u2212\u03a6(x,y)) at the image plane of the camera, the same reference beam is modulated to become a phase-conjugate beam that is sent back into the sample (). The phase-conjugate beam traverses back through the tissue sample to converge at the location of the ultrasound focus resulting in an optical focus deep inside the tissue sample.","In the DOPC setup of , the power in the phase conjugate light that leaves the DOPC setup is only dependent on the power in the reference beam that reflects off the SLM displaying the phase conjugate map; thus, the DOPC is fundamentally not limited in terms of gain (Eq. 1). One or more embodiments have adjusted the intensity of the reference beam during playback to achieve a gain of \u02dc5\u00d710, such that the phase conjugate focus contains sufficient energy to excite fluorescence that can be collected and detected outside of the tissue by a photomultiplier tube (PMT).","Theoretically, with complete phase-conjugation, the light field within the ultrasound focus can be reconstructed without error (see Section II.1 below). However, the assumption of complete phase-conjugation breaks down in practice\u2014real phase-conjugate mirrors, whether based on photorefractive crystals or spatial light modulators, have finite etendue and can only intercept a fraction of the output wavefront. As a result, a background always exists in the case of partial phase conjugation. In a random scattering medium, the ratio of the peak intensity of the phase conjugate focus to the average intensity of the accompanying background, the peak-to-background ratio (PBR), can be analytically derived. Following the framework of Vellekoop et. al., we find that the peak-to-background ratio is determined by the number of optical modes intercepted and time-reversed by the phase conjugate mirror, N, and the number of input modes in the ultrasound focus, M (see Section II.2 below). When both phase and amplitude of the scattered field are time-reversed, a case similar to the use of traditional phase conjugate mirrors, the peak-to-background ratio is:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0092"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"PBR","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"phase","mo":["\u2062","&"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},"mi":"amplitude"}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":"+","mn":"1"},"mi":"M"}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"When only the phase of the scattered field is time-reversed, a case similar to our technique employing the DOPC, the peak-to-background ratio for large N is:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0094"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"PBR","mrow":{"mi":["phase","only"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"4"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}},"mo":"+","mn":"1"},"mi":"M"},"mo":"\u2248","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"4"},"mo":"\u00b7","msub":{"mi":"PBR","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"phase","mo":["\u2062","&"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},"mi":"amplitude"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"Since N is finite in a real phase conjugation setup, a phase conjugate background is inevitable.

The diffuse background that inevitably results can excite fluorophores outside of the focus, contributing to noise in the detected fluorescence signal. Because of its spatial extent, the total background excitation can drown the desired focal fluorescence signal detected by a single channel PMT outside the sample. Our experiments show that this background, though indeed significant, can be dynamically subtracted by digital manipulation of the measured phase conjugate map, allowing us to realize high-resolution focal fluorescence imaging in biological tissues.","3.

Background Subtraction","As discussed in the above, the diffuse background seen in is to be expected because of the lack of complete control of the entire light field in a phase conjugation experiment. We further observed that the diffuse background was concentrated around the focus, an effect that was also reported by Vellekoop and colleagues when focusing light through a layer of highly scattering zinc oxide particles. As the number of speckles in the focus increases (see Section I.1), the presence of this background drastically reduces the contrast at the focus and poses a critical challenge to optical focusing using time-reversal. With the DOPC system, however, the ability to digitally manipulate the phase conjugate field allows for the possibility of playing back a light field that closely mimics the background, thus enabling background subtraction.","Accurate background subtraction requires better understanding of the cause of its spatial localization. One possible explanation of this effect is that it is caused by correlations in the scattering transmission matrix. Thus, like the fidelity of the optical phase conjugate focus, the presence of a concentrated background would depend on the precise alignment of the sample with the phase conjugated beam. Alternatively, the observed background could be caused by the macroscopic concentration of diffuse light around the target area\u2014an effect that would be expected to be more prominent in highly forward-scattering samples such as biological tissues, and that would be invariant to microscopic misalignments of the sample.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0102"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"sup":"40,41"},"Performing time-reversal and subtracting the background in this manner for each location of the focus, we scanned the position of the ultrasound transducer and confirmed that the optical focus followed the locations of the ultrasound focus, as shown in -, which are successive frames of a movie.","5.

The microtissues are arranged in a 500 \u03bcm thin patch of polyacrylamide gel, embedded between two pieces of chicken tissue, each 2.5 mm thick. shows an epifluorescence image of the tumors. The tumors embedded between ex vivo tissue are not resolved with epifluorescence imaging (). In contrast, the tumors imaged with the method of  are well resolved and the differential fluorescence intensities of the tumors are also reflected in the image ().","8. Sample Preparation for the Samples Measured in ","Frozen ex vivo chicken breast tissue was cut into 2.5 mm thick slices and embedded in 10% polyacrylamide gel inside an open-top quartz glass sample cuvette with four polished sides (Starna Cells, CA). The tissue slices had a measured scattering coefficient of \u03bc=30 mm(see also). Using the previously published anisotropyof g=0.965, we calculated the reduced scattering coefficient as \u03bc\u2032=\u03bc\u00b7(1\u2212g)=30\/mm\u00b7(1-0.965)=1.05\/mm. This is in agreement with the widely referenced approximate value of \u02dc1\/mm (see e.g.).","The fluorescent beads measured in  were fabricated as follows. Polyacrylamide gel (PAA) was polymerized using 4 ml phosphate buffered saline, 1.5 ml Acrylamide, 0.4 ml Bis-acrylamide, 62.5 \u03bcl Ammonium persulfate and 25 \u03bcl Tetramethylethylenediamine. Polyacrylamide beads containing quantum dots (Qtracker 655 Non-targeted Quantum Dots, Invitrogen), were made using a reverse micelle protocol modified from Beningo and Wangwith a starting concentration of 200 nM quantum dots in the aqueous phase. The beads obtained varied in size and were strained through a 40 \u03bcm cell strainer (Biologix, USA). The actual sizes of the beads used in all experiments were determined by observation under a fluorescence microscope.","The \u201cCIT\u201d feature of  was made by polymerizing clear PAA (500 \u03bcm thick) on a SU-8 mold (designed in-house, manufactured by the Stanford Microfluidics Foundry). The patterned depression in the clear PAA gel was then filled with PAA containing quantum dots (Qtracker 705 Non-targeted Quantum Dots, Invitrogen) with a starting concentration of 1 \u03bcM in the aqueous phase.","Cancer microtissues, obtained by the hanging-drop technique using HepG2 cells, were custom ordered from InSphero AG (Switzerland). The spheroids were fixed with 2% PFA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), washed with 50 mM borate buffer saline (Thermo Scientific, USA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and stained with DY-521XL long stokes shift NHS-ester dye (Dyomics, Germany) that binds to the proteins in the cancer microtissues. The concentration of the staining solution was 14 nM. Based on calibration with known fluorophore concentrations, we estimated the resulting stain concentration in the tumor to be \u02dc5 \u03bcM. The tumor microtissues were arranged and embedded in a 500 \u03bcm thin PAA gel patch.","9. Measurement of Sample Scattering Coefficient","The scattering coefficient of the chicken tissue was measured interferometrically with a Mach Zehnder interferometer. Since only ballistic light will significantly interfere with the reference beam, the reduction in amplitude of the fringes with and without a sample in the sample beam path can be used to find the scattering coefficient.","10. SLM Curvature Compensation","The reliability of digital optical phase conjugation critically depends not only on the precise alignment of SLM and camera, but also on the SLM curvature and reference beam aberrations. Both of these effects can be compensated for digitally by finding a compensation phase map for the SLM that, when displayed, time-reverses the reference beam. Because a time-reversed beam would trace its path back through the spatial filter (the SM fiber), the compensation map was optimized by maximizing the power of the light that returned back through the single mode fiber (measured by a photodiode).","11. Phase Recording","In one or more embodiments, at each scan position, phase recording was achieved in a phase-shifting digital holography setup: the ultrasound pulse was cycled through four phases (0, \u03c0\/2, \u03c0, \u03c0\/2\u00b7\u03c0). 10-30 frames were recorded (at 30 frames\/second) for each phase and averaged, resulting in four intensity maps (I, I, I and I), which were used to reconstruct the complex field according to E=(I\u2212I)+i\u00b7(I\u2212I). The phase map was calculated as \u03a6=tan(Re(E)\/Im(E)) (or \u03a6=Arg(E)). To minimize artifacts introduced by slow phase fluctuations of the reference beam, the acquisition of the intensity maps was interleaved by cycling through all four phases for each block of four sequential frames acquired by the sCMOS camera (exposure time: 28 ms, frame rate: 30 Hz). To achieve sufficiently fast cycling and between-frame switching, an arbitrary function generator (AFG 3252, Tektronix, USA) generated two output signals (one 45 MHz sinusoidal cycle with phase-shift of 0 or \u03c0\/2), which were each inverted by a RF 180\u00b0 power splitter (Mini-circuits, USA) to obtain the four phase-shifted signals. A microcontroller board (Arduino, Italy; obtained from SparkFun Electronics, USA) connected to an RF switch (Mini-circuits, USA) was programmed to select the appropriate phase for each frame acquired by the sCMOS camera. Throughout the phase recording, the SLM displayed a flat (all 0) phase map. An acquisition cycle took 6.7 s\/pixel. For complete timing information, see .","In  abbreviations are: Spatial light modulator (SLM), Ultrasound Transducer in sample beam path (UST), Acousto-optic modulator in reference beam path (AOM), Photomultiplier (PMT), Data acquisition device (DAQ), (2) for sequential camera exposures (from frame to frame), the phase is cycled between 0, \u03c0, \u03c0\/2 and 3\u03c0\/2. Frames corresponding to each respective phase are averaged. The averaged data for each phase shift is used for the calculation of the phase maps. The total duration for acquisition of each data point is 6.7 seconds.","For an analysis the coherence length limits detection of scattered photons, see . The Effects of coherence length: Only those scattered photons whose path lengths have not spread beyond the laser coherence length (in the case of 7 mm) will be detected by the phase-shifting holography scheme. To confirm that most of the scattered photons fall within this window, we ran a single layer Monte Carlo simulation of photon transport [], where a 0.8 mm wide (FWHM) collimated gaussian beam was incident on a (5 mm)3 cube of tissue, mimicking the two 2.5 mm thick slabs in our experiments (\u03bcs=30\/mm, g=0.965). We launched 106 photons in this simulation. (a) shows a 2D projection of the normalized photon flux. The path length distribution of the photons leaving the exit face is plotted in (b). We find that 79% of the scattered photons fall within a 7 mm window, thus confirming that the majority of the photons will be detected and time-reversed. Scale bar: 500 \u03bcm.","A typical ultrasound tagged phase map recorded on the CCD contained N=8\u00d710modes (area of the sensor divided by speckle autocorrelation area). Together with an estimated M of the ultrasound focus of 1-2\u00d710we obtained an upper bound for the peak-to-background ratio of \u02dc60 (Eq. 3).","12. Detection of Fluorescence Excitation by Time-Reversed Light","The time-reversed beam was obtained by reflecting the blank reference beam off the spatial light modulator displaying the measured phase conjugate map. The backscattered fluorescence excited by the time-reversed optical focus was reflected off a dichroic mirror and detected by a single channel PMT fitted with the appropriate bandpass filters (Semrock 650-40, 710-40 or 675-67, for Qtracker 655, Qtracker 705 or DY-521XL long stokes shift NHS-ester dye respectively).","13. Quality Assurance of Digital Optical Phase Conjugation","Because of the dependence of our system on precise alignment, mechanical stability and low drift, we included a parallel sample beam path to asses and assure the performance of our setup on a day-to-day basis. Consisting of ground glass diffusers and an additional observing camera, it was analogous to the setups previously used by our group to demonstrate turbidity suppression by phase conjugation.","14. Speckle Decorrelation Time","With the sample beam turned on, we acquired images of the speckle field on the sCMOS camera at a rate of 1 frame\/second for 180 seconds. We measured the correlation of the first frame with each subsequent frame and defined the decorrelation time as the time after which the correlation fell below 1-1\/e.","II. Theoretical Analysis","1. Description of Complete Time-Reversal","We represent the ultrasound-modulated speckles in the plane of the Ultrasound (US) focus (A) by the electric field E. Upon further propagation through scattering tissue and free space, the ultrasound-modulated field at the detection plane (B) is\n\n\u2003\u2003Eq 4.\n","where Tis the complete transmission matrix (with complex transmission values) describing the propagation of Efrom the plane containing the US focus (A) to the detection plane (B). In the case of perfect phase conjugation, where the full solid angle of the scattered wavefront is intercepted and time-reversed, Tis unitary, lossless and time-symmetric. Thus, the phase conjugated field back at plane A, E\u2032, is described by\n\n()*=\u2003\u2003Eq 5\n","recovering the ultrasound-modulated field at plane A (where * denotes complex conjugate and \u2020 denotes the complex transpose of a matrix). Therefore, theoretically, the electric field of the speckles in the ultrasound focus can be faithfully reconstructed without error when the scattered field is completely time-reversed.","2. Derivation of Peak-to-Background Ratio in Partial Phase Conjugation","Because of the finite etendue of real phase-conjugate mirrors, only a fraction of the scattered wavefront intercepted is time-reversed. As a result, the transmission matrix is no longer unitary. In a random scattering medium, the transmission matrix can instead be approximated by a random matrix with elements independently drawn from a circular complex Gaussian distribution, with \u03bc=0 and \u03c3=\u03c3=\u03c3. Using the framework and methods developed by Vellekoop et. al., we show that a background always exists in the case of partial phase conjugation.","Furthermore, the expected ratio of the peak intensity of the phase conjugate focus and its background can be found. We consider two cases\u2014phase and amplitude time-reversal and phase only time-reversal. The former is relevant to the general case of phase conjugation using photorefractive crystals and digital phase conjugate mirrors with phase and amplitude controls; the latter is specific for the embodiment our system illustrated in where only the phase of the scattered field is time-reversed.","In both cases, we describe M input channels (speckles) in the ultrasound focus at plane A as a vector with elements, \u00ca. We let tbe the complex elements of the transmission matrix mapping each of the M input channels (speckles) to the N possible output modes intercepted by the finite area phase conjugate mirror at plane B, where the output channels are represented by the a vector with elements \u00ca. We consider first a system with only one non-zero input mode (corresponding to a single-mode source). Without the loss of generality, we let this non-zero input mode be \u00ca. Thus, we obtain",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0142"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mover":{"mi":"E","mo":"^"},"mi":["n","B"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":["m","M"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["t","mn","AB"]},{"mover":{"mi":"E","mo":"^"},"mi":["m","A"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"msubsup":[{"mi":["t","AB"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"n"}},{"mover":{"mi":"E","mo":"^"},"mn":"1","mi":"A"}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"6"}}]}}}}},"Case 1: Phase and Amplitude Time-Reversal","Assuming the phase conjugate mirror has unit reflectivity and invoking the time-symmetric property of the transmission matrix, the phase conjugate, \u00ca\u2032 is",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0145"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msup":{"msubsup":{"mover":{"mi":"E","mo":"^"},"mn":"1","mi":"A"},"mi":"\u2032"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":["n","N"]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["t","BA"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"n"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["t","AB"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"n"}},{"mover":{"mi":"E","mo":"^"},"mn":"1","mi":"A"}],"mo":"\u2062"}}},"mo":"*"}},{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msubsup":{"mover":{"mi":"E","mo":"^"},"mn":"1","mi":"A"}},"mo":"*"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mover":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"n"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msubsup":{"mi":["t","AB"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"n"}}},"mn":"2"}}}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"7"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0139","num":"0146"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msup":{"msubsup":{"mover":{"mi":"I","mo":"^"},"mn":"1","mi":"A"},"mi":"\u2032"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msubsup":{"mover":{"mi":"E","mo":"^"},"mn":"1","mi":"A"}},{"mover":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"n"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msubsup":{"mi":["t","AB"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"n"}}},"mn":"2"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mover":{"mi":"I","mo":"^"},"mn":"1","mi":"A"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mover":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"n"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msubsup":{"mi":["t","AB"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"n"}}},"mn":"2"}}}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mover":{"mi":"I","mo":"^"},"mn":"1","mi":"A"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u03b1","mn":"2"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"8"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"sup":["2","N","AB","2","2"],"sub":["n","1n"],"i":"|t"},"determined by the transmission properties of the turbid medium.

Phase Jitter in Acoustic Wave","The technique illustrated in relies on the detection of 45 MHz ultrasound frequency-shifted light in the presence of a large background of non-shifted light. While the reference beam (equally frequency shifted by 45 MHz) interferes with US-tagged light, interference of the reference beam with the non-shifted light occurs at a beating frequency of 45 MHz (cycle time: 22.2 ns). This beating usually averages out during the much longer integration time of a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) camera. But if the illumination is pulsed, the pulse duration approaches one beating cycle or less and the phase of the beating is locked to the laser trigger output, the interference between the non-shifted beam and the shifted beam may nevertheless be detected. This wouldn't be desirable in the embodiment of , since a small phase drift between the non-shifted beam and the reference beam would lead to an added artificial signal on the phase map we measure. To ensure that such coherent effects between the non-shifted beam and the frequency-shifted beam are not detected on our camera, we randomly alternate between two trigger delays of a time difference that corresponds to half a 45 MHz beating cycle (11.1 ns or +5.5 ns). A microcontroller randomly chooses a jitter for each laser sync output pulse (at a rate of 20 kHz) and the jitter is added to the trigger delay of ultrasound transducer as well as reference beam AOM. The relative phase between ultrasound-shifted light and the reference beam therefore remains unaffected.","III.

In this study, we provide the first demonstration of focal fluorescence imaging in the diffusive regime with time-reversal of ultrasound-tagged light. We implemented a digital optical phase conjugation (DOPC) system with high gain to directly observe the time-reversed optical focus and the accompanying phase-conjugate background. We took advantage of the capabilities of the DOPC to digitally manipulate the phase conjugate map to dynamically estimate and subtract the fluorescence contribution of the phase-conjugate background that would otherwise obscure the focal fluorescence signal. Using this technique, we characterized the point-spread function of the system of as having an anisotropic lateral resolution of 34 \u03bcm by 52 \u03bcm and an axial resolution of 657 \u03bcm. Furthermore, we illustrated the capabilities of our method by successfully imaging fluorescent objects 2.5 mm deep in er vivo tissue, equivalent to about 75 scattering mean free paths.","As confirmed by our results, the imaging resolution perpendicular to the axis of light propagation is determined by the ultrasound focal volume. The system's resolution can therefore be improved by utilizing an ultrasound transducer with a higher central frequency and a higher numerical aperture. However, some expected tradeoffs should be noted. Higher frequency ultrasound is more strongly attenuated in biological tissues, thus reducing the practical focusing depth of the ultrasound. Additionally, a smaller modulation volume would further diminish the population of the frequency-shifted light and increase the challenge of detecting a small signal on top of a large background during phase measurement. However, these issues can be addressed by the development of faster, higher dynamic-range cameras, and with advanced filtering methods. The point-spread-function along the axis of light propagation is limited by the angular spread of the focused light cone. Since the angular spread is a function of illumination geometry and tissue scattering, the resolution could be improved by using high numerical aperture illumination or\u2014counter-intuitively\u2014by imaging thicker, more scattering samples. Finally, the resolution along the axis of light propagation could further be improved by taking advantage of multiphoton excitation.","We estimate that at the plane of the time-reversed focus, less than 1% of the energy is within the focus. This means that 99% of the remaining energy is spread over the diffuse background, which if uncorrected can obscure focal fluorescence signal. In inhomogeneous fluorescent samples, we showed that dynamic background subtraction effectively uncouples the focal fluorescence signal from that excited by the background. In some applications like photodynamic therapy, where the goal is to deliver more light into the focus, a further increase in peak-to-background ratio may be desirable. There are two ways to achieve a higher peak-to-background ratio. First, the number of optical modes (N) intercepted by the DOPC can be increased by increasing the number of pixels on the SLM. Second, the number of optical modes in the ultrasound focus (M) can be decreased by decreasing the size of the ultrasound focus.","Because our methods are based on optical time-reversal, it relies on mechanical stability of the sample. The acquisition cycle per pixel should therefore be faster or on the same order of magnitude as the speckle decorrelation of the tissue. This condition is easily met in er vivo experiments: our current pixel acquisition time (6.7 s) was shorter than the decorrelation time of the sample (41 s). For in vivo applications, decorrelation times are typically much faster: published values range from millisecond scaleto second scale, depending on tissue type and immobilization strategies. For such applications, the pixel acquisition time would have to be reduced accordingly. We anticipate that this will ultimately be possible with the use of faster spatial light modulators, and the continuing development of faster, higher dynamic range cameras. In all our experiments, the irradiance of the laser beam at the sample was less than 10 mW\/mm. The laser power would have to be decreased, or the diameter of the beam increased, to meet clinical safety standards (2 mW\/mm). Taken together, such improvements would ultimately enable a wide range of in vivo applications, including molecular imaging, early cancer diagnosis, photodynamic therapy and targeted excitation of optogenetic tools in deep tissues.","Further information on one or more embodiments of the invention can be found Wang, Y.
