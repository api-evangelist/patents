{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","The subject matter discussed herein relates generally to software applications and, more particularly, to user settings management using external sources.","2. Related Background","Most, if not all, web-based applications and device-based applications (e.g., applications executing on mobile devices and non-mobile devices, such as computers, machines, etc.) are designed to allow users to configure the applications using parameters or settings. For example, an application may use a setting (e.g., \u201cAuto Connect to Wi-Fi Network\u201d) to allow a user Alice to configure or \u201ctell\u201d the application whether Alice prefers the application to automatically connect to a Wi-Fi network if one is available (e.g., by check a box or entering \u201cYes\u201d) or let Alice manually initiate a connection (e.g., by leaving a box unchecked or entering \u201cNo\u201d). The application or another application may use a setting (e.g., \u201cAnonymous Commenter\u201d) to allow Alice to indicate her privacy preference, such as whether to provide comments to an online platform as \u201cAlice\u201d or as \u201cAnonymous.\u201d","A user typically uses many applications or products on more than one device, and many of the applications are connected to the Internet. Many users may not be aware of an application and its functions at a level that allows them to meaningfully configure the settings of the application. Yet, users must make decisions to configure settings of many applications that span across multiple domains. These decisions may have both short and long term impacts.","Often, there are dozens of different options for user settings in an application or product. Each of these settings changes the way a product works in a unique way. Some users, particularly those without experience in software programming, may have a very difficult time knowing which options to choose for one or more given settings, in order for the settings to have their desired experience. Additionally, many of these setting options are added and removed ad-hoc (e.g., by application updates). As a result, users must continuously \u201cwatch\u201d their settings to ensure their desired settings remain in effect.","The subject matter includes methods for user settings management using external sources, including providing a user interface for a user to configure one or more settings that affect functions of an application; the user interface allows the one or more settings to be manipulated by the user, and allows the one or more settings to be configured based on setting data from a third-party entity; receiving input from the user to configure at least a portion of the one or more settings based on the setting data from the entity; identifying that the setting data from the entity includes the at least the portion of the one or more settings; and configuring the at least the portion of the one or more settings based on the setting data from the entity.","The methods are implemented using one or more computing devices and\/or systems. The methods may be stored in computer-readable media.","The subject matter described herein is taught by way of example implementations. Various details have been omitted for the sake of clarity and to avoid obscuring the subject matter. The examples shown below are directed to structures and functions for implementing user settings management using external sources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","110"]},"An \u201capplication\u201d or \u201capp\u201d can be any software executing computer readable instructions on a device (device-based application) or an online product or service provided from a system or server (e.g., an app server or web server) and accessed using a device. An application or app may also be referred to as a \u201cproduct\u201d or \u201cservice\u201d. The underlying support for an application is hardware, which includes at least one processor of any kind, memory, and\/or storage, e.g., non-transitory computer-readable medium.","A setting-using application  can be configured manually by users. In addition to and\/or in place of manual configuration, a SUA  can be configured using a third-party service and\/or data. Environment  may include any number of third party entities that provide setting services and\/or data (e.g., setting providers ).","As used herein, a \u201cthird party\u201d or \u201cthird-party entity\u201d refers to a person, organization, company (collectively referred to as entity) that is not the user of a SUA and not the provider of the SUA. For example, if setting provider A  also provides SUA A  but does not provide SUA B , setting provider A  is considered a third party with respect to SUA B . Setting provider A  is considered a second party but not a third party with respect to SUA A .","In environment , a user (a first party) of SUA B  may configure some or all settings of SUA B  (the provider of the SUA B  being a second party) using service and\/or data provided by a setting provider  (a third party or third-party entity).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["200","200","200"]},"Each user may use one or more settings to configure or customize the application for the user. For example, users Alice and Bob may be users of SUA  on the same device or a website. Alice may use settings to configure the functions and\/or operations of SUA , such as configuring the appearance of SUA  (e.g., \u201cskin\u201d of an application), how SUA  notifies Alice of the occurrence of an event or condition (e.g., by playing a sound or popping up a message), how long to store usage data and\/or history, etc. Alice may also use settings to set the parameters of her privacy preferences. These settings may be referred to as privacy settings.","A privacy setting is any setting that is relating to or affecting Alice as a user. Some examples of privacy settings, which are not limited to the examples discussed herein, include settings that allow users to seclude themselves from other users; control their exposure to online communities or environments; control their information about themselves; control what information the they want to receive and\/or what information the they want to share or send out; control who can contact them, see their presence; send them information, and\/or share information with them.","According to an example implementation, Bob may use settings to configure SUA  to customize the application according to Bob's preferences. A user (e.g., Alice or Bob) may have an \u201caccount,\u201d which identifies the user. When SUA  detects or identifies which user is using the application, settings of that user are used to \u201ccustomize\u201d the application according to the user's preferences.","Some or all of the settings may be configured using an external source, such as a setting provider that may be a third-party entity. For example, as shown in , Alice may be provided a user interface with an \u201cUpload Settings\u201d option  to identify an external source and upload settings provided by the external source. Upload Settings  may provide a list of external sources (not shown) or provide an input box for Alice to enter the external source (e.g., a Universal Resource Locator (URL) of an external source). The external source may provide setting data or information used by SUA  to automatically configure its settings based on the setting data. For example, the setting data from an external source (e.g., in Extensible Markup Language (XML) format) may identify which setting is set to which value, parameter, or option. , which are discussed in greater detail below, show examples of setting data.","Continuing to refer to , after identifying an external source or uploading setting data from an external source, the external source may be kept as a history or for future reference, such as external sources  and . A timestamp of date may be presented to show when an external source was last uploaded, updated, or used. SUA  may include an option  for Alice to use SUA 's default settings. Alice may select, for example, to configures her privacy settings using setting data provided by external source  (e.g., version 2.0 of privacy setting data from setting provider EFG). Alice's selection may be indicated, for example, by showing a checkmark to near the selected source. Alice's privacy settings may be configured by, for example, SUA  copying the setting data from external source  to the privacy settings of SUA .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 3"],"b":["250","250","200","250","200","250","200","200","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","110","120","330"]},"A marketplace  allows for users and organizations to import and export their settings (e.g., as setting data). For example, a marketplace  enables organizations or users trusted by various groups of individuals to upload their suggested setting data (e.g., as setting files or configuration files). These trusted organizations or users, as setting providers , may provide or upload setting data to one or more marketplaces . A marketplace helps users to rely on the expertise of organizations and\/or user they trust for the configuration of their application settings, such as privacy settings.","In some example implementations, a marketplace allows for users, as setting commentators , to review settings or configurations in the marketplace and provide comments and\/or grades for those settings or configurations. Setting commentators  may provide comments and\/or any feedback to setting configurations or data provided through the marketplace. In some implementations, commentators  may rate or grade setting data. A commentator  may be any user or organization.","In some example implementations, a commentator may choose to hide his or her identity. In other implementations, a commentator cannot hide his or her identity to ensure that the comment, feedback, rating, etc. is transparent.","Users of SUAs  may connect to one or more marketplaces  to select setting data from one or more setting providers , taking into consideration the comments and rating provided by the commentators . For example, Alice may select privacy setting data provided by an organization known for protecting user privacy and\/or having received good rating and comments from commentators . Setting data may be downloaded to a SUA  or a SUA  may subscribe to setting data, as described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","200","400","420","422","424","422","400"]},"If the user chooses the \u201cSubscribe to Settings\u201d  option, the user may select one of the external sources  and - available in SUA  to use to configure some or all of the settings of SUA . The external sources  and - may have been previously identified, selected, subscribed to, or download from by the user (e.g., Alice) or another user (e.g., Bob) of SUA .","When a user subscribes to a setting provider, the user may subscribe to all the setting data provided by the setting provider or one or more portions of the setting data provided by the setting provider. A setting provider may provide different versions or \u201cflavors\u201d of setting data, such as a \u201csafe browsing\u201d version, a \u201chigh performance\u201d version, a \u201chigh privacy protection\u201d version, a \u201cpublic library\u201d version, etc. Versions or flavors may be indicate in any manner, such as using numbers (e.g., v1.2, v2.0, v5.5, 300, etc.). The user may subscribe to one or more versions (e.g., different versions for different sections or groups of application settings).","When a user subscribes to a setting provider, the user subscribes to setting data or one or more versions of setting data for some or all the settings of an application. In an effect, the user is telling or configuring the application to use the subscribed setting data to set the associated settings. For example, Alice subscribes to the setting data of setting provider  to configure the privacy settings of application . After the subscription, application  will automatically use the portion of the setting data of setting provider  that are for privacy settings (e.g., the portion is identifiable in some way, such as using setting identifiers) to configure the privacy settings of the application  (e.g., copy the setting options of the portion of the setting data to the privacy settings of application ).","In some example implementations, application  may periodically or on demand (e.g., triggered by a user) to check a setting provider to determine whether the subscribed to setting data has been changed or updated. If so, application  may automatically update its associated settings accordingly, based on the configuration selected by the user, as described above. A setting provider or a marketplace may also be implemented to notify subscribers of its setting data when updated setting data is available (e.g., the provider or marketplace may keep a record of it subscribers).","The user is not limited to use the external sources  and - available in SUA . The user may, for example, visited another setting provider to down its setting data or visit one of the available setting providers (e.g., setting provider ) to download its latest or updated setting data. The user may identify another setting provider and\/or retrieve its setting data from a marketplace (e.g., marketplace , ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","426","426","410"]},"As shown and described, many implementations are possible. The example implementations are: (1) allowing a user to manually set or update some or all settings (any portion of the settings) of an application; (2) allowing a user to configure any portion of the settings an application once using setting data from one or more setting providers, and the user may repeat this process any number of times with any setting providers; (3) allowing a user to configure any portion of the settings of an application by subscribing to the setting data of one or more setting providers; the user may be given an option (e.g., in the form of a user interface widget) to indicate that the user wants to be notified when updated setting data is available and\/or an option (e.g., in the form of a user interface widget) to indicate that the user confirm or consent to the update, after which application  updates the associated settings using the updated setting data; and (4) same as example (3), which is allowing a user to configure any portion of the settings of an application by subscribing to the setting data of one or more setting providers; however, an option (e.g., in the form of a user interface widget) allows the user to indicate that whenever updated setting data is available and detected, automatically update the associated setting in application  without notifying the user and without prompting a confirmation or consent from the user. Another variation of example (4) is to just notify the user but without prompting a confirmation or consent from the user. Implementations are not limited to the examples shown and described, and one skilled in the art would appreciate other possible implementations. The example implementations may even be configurable or selectable by using settings (e.g., settings that can only be set manually by a user or an administrator of application ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["500","400","4","500","400","510","520","530","540"]},"Settings of an application may be mapped to zero, one, or more sources. Different sections of settings or different settings in a section may be mapped to different sources. Mapping one or more settings (mapped settings) to a source (mapped source) means using the mapped source to configure the mapped settings. In the example of UI , each section of settings may be mapped to a source. For example, section  may be mapped to a source  selectable by the user. Settings in sections , , and  may be mapped to sources , , and , respectively; each is selectable by the user.","If the user selects the \u201cManage Myself\u201d option, such as for source , the user is the source (i.e., the user manually sets the settings in section  by, in this case, placing checkboxes on selected settings). For the settings in section , the user may select the \u201cCopy from\u201d option and identify a setting provider \u201c5.ABC\u201d as the source, from which setting data is copy to the settings in the section. An example of setting data is shown in . For illustration, sections  and  show that the user may elect to configure the settings in these sections by subscription (e.g., using the two subscription models described above). The user may select the same setting provider or different setting providers to subscribe to (e.g., \u201cLarry\u201d and \u201cEFG\u201d for sections  and , respectively). An example of setting data from setting provider \u201cLarry\u201d is shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["550","520","521","523","520","400","521","523","400","552","554","556","550","521","523","552","521","552","400","521","521","552","400","554","556","522","523","522","523","554","556"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 5C","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5C"],"b":["500","550","531","533","530","531","533","562","566","560","560","562","566","531","533","532","564","533","566"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","605","610","610","620"]},"In some implementations, process  may be implemented with different, fewer, or more blocks.
