title: Thermo-optical switch using coated microsphere resonators
abstract: An all-optical switch includes a microsphere optical resonator coated with a conjugated polymer. A signal light beam propagating along a first SPARROW waveguide defining a throughput channel is evanescently coupled into the resonant whispering gallery modes (WGM) of the microsphere, and out of the microsphere onto a second SPARROW waveguide defining a drop channel. A secondary switching light beam is used to heat the microsphere resonator, thereby shifting its resonant frequency so that it no longer overlaps with the signal beam frequency. Light coupling into the microsphere and onto the drop channel is thus eliminated, and the signal beam is switched from the drop channel to the throughput channel. The time constant for the WGM resonant frequency shifting was about 165 ms, indicating thermo-optic switching capabilities at speeds on the order of 100 microseconds for high-Q modes. Multiple frequencies or channels can be routed using a switch configuration with multiple microspheres and drop channels.

WDM (wavelength-division-multiplexing) systems provide a method for increasing the channel capacity of existing fiber optic links without physically modifying the optical fiber, by allowing multiple wavelengths to be transmitted and received over a single optical fiber. Dense WDM (DWDM) systems can be utilized to further increase information transmission capacity. DWDM systems increase the capacity of an embedded fiber by first assigning incoming optical signals to specific wavelengths within a designated wavelength band, and then multiplexing the resulting signals onto one fiber. DWDM systems combine multiple optical signals so that they can be amplified as a group, and transported over a single fiber to increase capacity. Each signal can be carried at a different rate, and in a different format. DWDM systems can multiplex and demultiplex large numbers of discrete communication channels onto a single optical fiber, and transmit these channels over long distances.","Channel routing and switching is an important function performed by DWDM network components, and allows service providers to have optical access to data at desired nodes on the network. Optical switches direct one or more wavelengths of light from an input port to an output port. All-optical switches can steer light pulses among different fiber spans without converting them into electrical signals at any point, and can therefore eliminate the need for repeated optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions in the network. Channel routing involves extracting and inserting of optical signals, i.e. add\/drop multiplexing. For example, selected channels may be extracted or \u201cdropped\u201d from a multiplexed signal, and routed to desired nodes. Alternatively, extracted signals, or newly generated signals, may be inserted or \u201cadded\u201d into the multiplexed signal.","Currently, many techniques are being developed, in the pursuit of all-optical channel switching configurations, such as switchable optical cross-connects and all-optical add-drop multiplexers. These techniques include opto-mechanical, opto-magnetic, electro-optic, acousto-optic, thermo-optic, liquid crystal, and electro-holographic devices, and bubblejet devices. Each of these techniques possess advantages and disadvantages, depending on factors such as speed, size, scalability, reliability, and integrability. None of the techniques currently under development, however, offer the potential for an optical network with increased wavelength channel density. At present, the available channel spacings (i.e. the minimum frequency separation between two different multiplexed signals) are as large as about 50 GHz.","In recent years, micro-resonators have generated significant interest for application to optical switching and channel multiplexing. In particular, optical microcavity resonators show great promise for optical communication applications such as filtering, multiplexing, and switching. Most investigations have used ring and disk-type whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonator fabricated from silica or silicon-based materials by chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) and photolithographic methods. The small size of these devices (\u02dc10 um diameter) allows for mass-production efficiency and high device density. However, the methods used to prepare microrings and microdisks, combined with bending losses for such small resonators, limit the cavity quality factor (Q) of these resonators. Sidewall roughness in wafer-processed integrated-optics resonator elements is very significant due to required etching. Such resonators typically have Q-factors of 10to 10in the 1550 nm wavelength region.","Silica microsphere resonators are an especially promising type of micro-optical cavity. Silica microsphere resonators have quality factors that are several orders of magnitude better than typical surface etched resonators, because these microcavities can be shaped by natural surface tension forces during a liquid state fabrication. Silica microspheres are three-dimensional WGM resonators, typically 50-500 \u03bcm in diameter, which can be fabricated by simply melting the tip of an optical fiber. Surface tension shapes the molten silica into a near-perfect sphere before it hardens. The result is a clean, smooth silica surface with low optical loss and negligible scattering. These microcavities are inexpensive, simple to fabricate, and are compatible with integrated optics.","For these optical microcavity resonators, measured Qs as large at 10have been reported. The high-Q resonances encountered in these microcavities are due to optical whispering-gallery-modes (WGM) that are supported within the microcavities. The fabrication process creates an extremely smooth surface, which contributes directly to low optical WGM propagation losses. Furthermore, the spherical curvature perpendicular to the optical path in microspheres focuses the WGMs, reduces the mode volume, and thus increases the cavity Q. The total optical loss experienced in microsphere resonators is exceptionally low and Q-factors as high as 10to 10have been demonstrated.","Because the ultra-high Q values of microcavities are the result of energy that is tightly bound inside the cavity, optical energy must be coupled in and out of the high Q cavities, without negatively affecting the Q. The use of SPARROW waveguides for efficiently coupling light into the microcavity resonant modes is described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/893,954 (hereinafter the \u201c'954 application\u201d), entitled \u201cOptical Microcavity Resonator System,\u201d which is commonly owned by the present assignee and which is incorporated herein by reference.","Using microsphere optical resonators coupled to SPARROW waveguides, channel spacings of approximately 100 MHz or less can be readily obtained. The high Q-factor translates directly into resonant optical linewidths of several MHz or less. This provides the potential for ultra-dense wavelength division multiplexing optical channel networks.","There is currently a need for optical switches that can be used in dense all-optical communications networks. In particular, there is a need for an improved system for performing all-optical channel switching, as part of ultra-dense wavelength division multiplexing optical communications networks having very narrow channel spacings. Because of the properties of optical microsphere resonators, described above, optical microsphere resonators have the potential to provide superior performance in numerous applications, including applications such as all-optical switches in DWDM communications systems that call for ultra-narrow linewidths.","The present invention provides an all-optical switch, using a high-Q, coated silica microsphere optical resonator onto which light is coupled using SPARROW waveguides. In particular, the present invention introduces the concept of thermo-optically switching the resonant frequencies of the high-Q microsphere, by using a secondary switching beam to heat the microcavity and shift its resonant frequency. The optical switch of the present invention can perform all-optical wavelength switching as part of ultra-dense wavelength division multiplexed optical communications networks.","An optical switch, constructed in accordance with the present invention, includes a substrate, and a first optical waveguide and a second optical waveguide disposed on the substrate. The first and second optical waveguides are SPARROWs (stripline-pedestal anti-resonant reflecting optical waveguides), which are highly reflective, multilayer dielectric stacks that include alternating high and low refractive index dielectric layers. In one embodiment, the first optical waveguide defines a throughput channel, and the second optical waveguide defines a drop channel.","At least one optical microcavity resonator, for example an optical microsphere, is constructed and arranged so as to optically interact with an input optical beam propagating through the first waveguide. The microcavity resonator is coated with a polymer layer, for example poly 2,5(dioctyloxy-1,4-phenylenevinylene)(DOO-PPV). In one embodiment, the input optical beam is generated by a diode laser tuned to a telecommunications wavelength channel near 1.55 \u03bcm. The microcavity resonator interacts with the input beam in such a way that one or more frequency components of the beam that substantially matches a resonant mode of the microcavity are evanescently coupled onto the whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of the microcavity, and out of the microcavity onto the second optical waveguide.","Thermo-optic means are activated to produce a temperature gradient in the microcavity resonator. In one embodiment, a switching beam generated by a 405 nm diode pump laser is used to heat the microcavity resonator. As light from the pump laser is absorbed by the coated microsphere, the temperature of the microcavity resonator rises. The temperature rise causes the resonant mode of the microcavity to undergo a frequency shift, so that the resonant frequency no longer overlaps with the frequency component of the input beam that matched the resonant mode prior to the temperature rise. Resonant frequency shifts of about 3.2 GHz have been observed for small input heating powers of \u02dc1 mW. These resonant frequency shifts are much larger than typical WGM linewidths of several MHz. Because of the frequency shift, light is no longer coupled into the microcavity and onto the second waveguide, but rather is transmitted through the first waveguide onto an output end thereof, thereby switching the input light from the drop channel (second waveguide) to the throughput channel (first waveguide). Using a test configuration, the time constant for the WGM resonant frequency shifting process was measured to be 165 ms, indicating that an optical switch constructed in accordance with the present invention can be used for thermo-optical switching at speeds on the order of 100 microseconds for high-Q modes. Switching speeds as fast as 1 \u03bcsec can be obtained using an optimized configuration consisting of a smaller microsphere and a shorter fiber stem.","In one embodiment of the invention, multiple channels can be accomodated by using a plurality of microcavity resonators, and a corresponding plurality of switching beams for heating each resonator.","A method is provided for all-optical wavelength switching in ultra-dense wavelength division multiplexed optical communications networks. The method includes coating an optical microcavity resonator with a polymer layer, and positioning the coated microcavity resonator within evanescent coupling distance of a first and a second optical waveguide. Preferably, the optical waveguides are SPARROW waveguides. The method includes directing a signal light beam onto the first optical waveguide so that a matching frequency component of the signal beam propagating through the first waveguide can be evanescently coupled onto a resonant mode of the coated microcavity resonator, and out of the microcavity onto the second waveguide. The method includes heating the coated microcavity resonator so as to shift its resonant frequency. In this way, coupling of the signal beam into the microcavity and out of the microcavity onto the second waveguide is eliminated, and the signal beam is switched from the second waveguide onto the first waveguide.","The present invention features a method and system for all-optical switching that involves thermo-optically switching the resonance modes of high-Q microcavity resonators. A secondary switching laser beam is used to heat a coated microsphere resonator, so that its resonant frequency is shifted. The technique of the present invention provides all-optical switching capacity at speeds up to 1 microsecond, in ultra-dense wavelength division multiplexed optical communications networks having channel spacings as narrow as 10 MHz or less.","An optical switch directs one or more wavelengths of incoming light from an input port to one or more output ports. Conventional switches switch light signals by detecting an incoming light signal, converting it to an electrical signal, and then converting the electrical signal back to a laser light signal, which is then directed to the desired output port. All-optical switches are switches that can direct optical signals from an input port to an output port of the network, without any optical\/electronic conversions. Implementation of all-optical switches is therefore very desirable, and is much sought after, especially in dense optical communications networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","11","12","14","16","16","12","14","18","21","19","24","30","18","12","30","16","16","16","14","24","14"]},"Thermo-optic means are provided to shift the resonant frequency of the microcavity , so that the output light beam is switched from the drop channel  to the throughput channel , and is directed to the output port  of the throughput channel .

The nascent microsphere was rotated during formation so as to inhibit formation of a teardrop shape. The same processing scheme can be used for multiple spheres, resulting in reproducible linewidths of less than 5 MHz. In the illustrated embodiment, the optical microcavity has a diameter of about 250 micrometers, although other sizes are also within the scope of the present invention.","The greatest impediment to the use of microsphere resonators, at present, has been the difficulty of coupling light into and out of the spheres. A coupler should have the following characteristics: efficient WGM excitation, easy alignment of the sphere and coupler, clearly defined ports, a robust and integrable structure, and a consistent fabrication process. A microsphere cannot be coupled to a conventional silica waveguide, because the guide would have to be clad with a material of significantly lower refractive index to avoid leakage into the cladding and substrate. This basic coupling scheme is frustrated since materials of index much less than silica are not readily available for CVD (chemical vapor deposition) processing. Efficient evanescent coupling has thus required fragile or large devices such as thin tapered fibers, fiber half-block couplers, angle-polished fibers, and bulk prisms that are impractical for integrated optics.","Use of a stripline pedestal antiresonant reflecting optical waveguide (SPARROW) coupler solves the problem of coupling to microspheres using a wafer-fabricated integrated-optical structure. As explained in further detail below, the SPARROW concept avoids cladding difficulties by isolating the waveguide core with a high-reflectivity dielectric stack. The optical coupling scheme utilized for the present invention is the only reported technique which provides high coupling efficiency, together with robust packaging potential.","In a preferred embodiment illustrated in , the optical waveguides  and  are SPARROW waveguides.  illustrates a SPARROW optical waveguide , constructed in accordance with the present invention. The SPARROW waveguide  provides an efficient and robust coupling mechanism for exciting whispering-gallery-modes in an optical microcavity . The SPARROW waveguide  provides isolation of the waveguide core from the substrate using a highly reflective set of dielectric layers, thus allowing efficient, low-leakage coupling between the core mode and the resonant modes of the microcavity.","The SPARROW  includes a multi-layer, high-reflectivity dielectric stack  disposed on the substrate , and a waveguide core . The dielectric stack  is composed of alternating high (n) and low (n) refractive index layers  and , made of a dielectric material. As a result, the dielectric stack  functions as a high reflectivity dielectric mirror. The larger the number of layers  and , the higher the reflectivity of the stack  becomes. While the illustrated embodiment includes only one low index layer  disposed between two high index layers , the number of the layers  and  can be increased in order to increase the reflectivity of the stack . The alternating layers  and  forming the dielectric stack  provide a cladding for the SPARROW waveguide core , i.e. the layers forming the stack  may be regarded as cladding layers.","The high reflectivity of the dielectric stack  permits isolation of the optical modes of the microcavity  and the waveguide core  from the waveguide cladding and the substrate. By isolating the waveguide core  using the high-reflectivity dielectric stack , the SPARROW  circumvents the need for obtaining low refractive index cladding materials. As shown in , one of the high refractive index layers  is in contact with the substrate .","In one embodiment, the high refractive index layer  is made of Si (silicon), while the low refractive index layer  is made of SiO(silica). In one embodiment, the high refractive index nis about 3.5, and the low refractive index nis about 1.45, although other refractive indices are also within the scope of the present invention. The refractive indices required for efficiently guiding light within the waveguide depend on the wavelength of optical radiation. In the illustrated embodiment, the stack is composed of alternating high- and low-index layers of Si and SiO, the thickness of which are defined as a quarter of the vertically directed guide wavelength. With this configuration, more than 99% reflection can be obtained at the first interface.","The waveguide core  is disposed on top of the dielectric stack , and is in contact with another one of the high refractive index layers . The waveguide core  includes an input end  and an output end , and is adapted for transmitting optical radiation incident on the input end  to the output end . In one embodiment, the waveguide core is made of silica, and is characterized by the low refractive index n. In a SPARROW waveguide, the waveguide mode field is essentially entirely contained within the waveguide core  on top of the dielectric stack , and is isolated from the substrate . The successful elimination of both the microcavity mode and the waveguide mode leakage into the substrate results in extremely high coupling efficiencies. Coupling efficiencies approaching 100% have been observed. In general, the coupling efficiency of evanescent field may be from about 90% to about 99%.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["12","16","16"]},"Evanescent coupling occurs between the waveguide and the microcavity  when the wavelength of the evanescent field of the waveguide mode field matches the wavelength of a resonant WGM supported within the microcavity .

The Q-factor of the microcavity is a measure of the frequency selectivity of the microcavity . The Q is given by the time averaged stored energy per optical cycle, divided by the power coupled or scattered out of the resonator, and is limited by radiation loss.

Photoexcitations of DOO-PPV exhibit excited state absorption at 1550 nm. A change in the imaginary component of the refractive index at the probe wavelength would both reduce the microsphere cavity Q, and shift the frequencies of the WGMs. The excited state lifetimes of singlet excitons in PPV have been measured to be less than 1 ns (nanosecond), while the excite state lifetimes of polarons and triplet excitons have been measured to be less than 1 ms. The excitation lifetimes are orders of magnitude too low to account for the 165 ms time constant of the frequency shift. Therefore, the frequency shifts observed in  can be attributed to thermo-optical effects, including enhanced pump laser absorption by the microsphere due to the polymer coating, thermal expansion of the polymer coating upon heating by the pump laser, and change of microsphere refractive index upon heating by the pump laser.

In general, the frequency shift may be characterized by a time constant in the range of about 1 millisecond to about 200 milliseconds. In order to increase the switching speed, system parameters such as microsphere size, microsphere material, coating thickness, and pump laser wavelength may be optimized. By optimizing one or more of these parameters, even higher switching speeds may be attained. For example, using an optimized configuration consisting of a smaller microsphere and a shorter fiber stem, switching speeds as fast as 1 \u03bcsec, and in the range of about 1 \u03bcsec to about 10 milliseconds, can be obtained.","Other potential applications utilizing thermo-optic resonance shifting of coated microsphere resonator WGMs, featured in the present invention, include environmental sensing, infrared light detection. Potential commercial applications, other than optical channel routing and switching, include remote monitoring of multi-channel, high-Q resonator-based sensing devices and components.","While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific preferred embodiments, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
