{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/272,740, titled \u201cAPPLICATION OF MULTIPLE CONTENT ITEMS AND FUNCTIONALITY TO AN ELECTRONIC CONTENT ITEM\u201d, filed Oct. 13, 2011, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Since the advent of computers and computer systems, a variety of software applications have been developed to allow users to generate a multitude of content and content types. Users may generate word processing documents, spreadsheet documents, slide presentation documents, notes documents, electronic mail documents (and email threads), and the like. Systems have been developed to allow users to insert comments into content items as content items are reviewed to assist in a process of revising or otherwise improving the content items. In a typical case, inserted comments are appended to the end of a content item (e.g., end of a document), or comments are exposed in a \u201cbubble\u201d or \u201cpop-up\u201d user interface component display to a side or at a bottom of the content item. In addition, where a second user provides a follow-up comment to a preceding or previous comment, the follow-up comment typically is displayed in a second user interface component and may not be readily associated with the previous or preceding comment. Such comments may be helpful, but utilization of such comments in a content item review or revision process can be cumbersome and often do not lead to efficient content review, revision and management.","In some cases, users resort to crude methods of commenting by using different text color or other markup (e.g., boldface or italics) to indicate a comment-like remark or statement in-line in a document. For example, in an electronic mail (email) thread, users often apply color, boldface, italics and the like to text inserted in a an email thread to create the look of an in-line comment for conveying a remark or other information to other users\/reviewers of the email thread.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","Embodiments of the present invention solve the above and other problems by providing application of comments to a variety of application functionality content. According to embodiments, comments may be entered and displayed in a comments user interface component directly in line in the text or other objects of a document or other content item. A comment conversation thread may be generated and likewise may be displayed in line in a document or other content item in an easy-to-read, full text size configuration that allows for efficient review of comments and for provision of responsive comments associated with one or more components or portions of a given document or content item. According to one embodiment, the document\/comments display configuration may be \u201cflipped\u201d or pivoted such that the comments are the primary display feature and the associated document text or other objects become a secondary display feature.","According to embodiments, displayed comments may be collapsed to a simplified comments tab that may remain displayed in the associated document or content item. Selection of the comments tab may allow for expansion of the comments user interface component to full size. The comments tab may likewise be collapsed to an icon or other image displayed next to the associated content, and the icon or other image may be configured to provide an indication of the length of an associated comments conversation thread. An indication of one or more comments applied to a given document may also be displayed in a scroll bar deployed in proximity to a displayed document.","According to other embodiments, one or more social feedback mechanisms may be employed to show feedback on a given component or portion of a document or content item. For example, according to one social feedback mechanism, a visual image may be displayed next to a component or portion of a document or content item, such as a \u201cthumbs up\u201d or \u201cthumbs down\u201d image, to allow a reviewing user to express approval or disapproval with a given component or portion of a document or content item. For another example, according to another social feedback mechanism, a heat map display meter may be displayed next to a component or portion of a document or content item to provide a visual indication of how various reviewers approve or disapprove of an associated component or portion of a document or content item.","The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that the following detailed description is explanatory only and is not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to application of computer-enabled comments in a multi-application functionality document or other content item. Comments applied to a computer-generated document or other content item, for example, a word processing application document, a spreadsheet application document, a slide presentation application document, a notes application document, and the like may be entered into a comments user interface component in line, between lines, between paragraphs, between images, or in association with other objects contained in a given document or content item.","Responsive comments entered in response to a previous or preceding comment may be entered directly into the user interface component beneath a previous or preceding comment, and the comments user interface component may be displayed in full size (i.e., same or similar margins as the associated document or other content item and same or similar text font and\/or size) for allowing the comments to be read in an efficient and comfortable manner in association with the components or portions of the associated document or content item to which the comments are directed. For example, a list of comments may be threaded together, as described below with reference to , and a user may interact with the entire comments conversation thread as a whole, or the user may interact with individual comment items in the conversation.","If desired, a comments user interface component may be collapsed to a comments tab that may remain displayed in the associated document or content item in a position in the document or content item at which text, images, or other objects being comment on are positioned. In addition, the comments tab may be collapsed to a selectable icon or image that may be disposed along a side of an associated document component or portion to indicate the presence and nature of comments that may be displayed in association with the content component or portion. In addition, one or more social feedback mechanisms may be employed to allow reviewing users to provide feedback expressing approval or disapproval of a given component or portion of a document or other content item.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawing and the following description to refer to the same or similar elements. While embodiments of the invention may be described, modifications, adaptations, and other implementations are possible. For example, substitutions, additions, or modifications may be made to the elements illustrated in the drawings, and the methods described herein may be modified by substituting, reordering, or adding stages to the disclosed methods. Accordingly, the following detailed description does not limit the invention, but instead, the proper scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["105","110","100","100"]},"According to embodiments, content ,  may be entered, edited, or otherwise interacted with according to a variety of input means. Suitable input means include, but are not limited to, keyboard\/mouse entry\/interaction, touch screen interaction, for example, where a user writes, draws, or otherwise interacts with software application functionality through touching the display screen of the computing device , electronic pen\/stylus interaction, voice command, wherein for example, a user issues commands to software application functionality or issues voice-based content entry, gesture commands, photographic input, wherein for example, photographs may be taken and entered into a document or comment, and the like. According to an embodiment, for purposes of receiving voice-based and gesture-based input, the device  may be coupled a microphone operative to capture voice commands, and the device  may be coupled a camera operative to record and capture motions and\/or gestures made by a user. Such a camera may be operative to provide motion detection capable of detecting movement from users for interpreting the movements as commands for causing changes in application functionality. For example, a camera may comprise a Microsoft\u00ae Kinect\u00ae motion capture device comprising a plurality of cameras and a plurality of microphones for capturing both motion and voice or other audio information.","The document  illustrated on the display screen of the computing device  is illustrative of a variety of electronic computer-generated or computer-enabled content items, for example, text-based word processing documents, spreadsheet documents, slide presentation slides, Internet-based web pages, and the like, enabled according to a variety of suitable software applications, for example, word processing applications, spreadsheet applications, slide presentation applications, Internet-based web browsing applications, and the like. Similarly, the chart  illustrated in the document  may be generated by and displayed according to one or more software applications suitable for generating and displaying charts or other images.","According to embodiments, as will be described below, a comments application , illustrated below with respect to , B and , may be utilized in association with the computing device  for allowing input and display of comments associated with one or more portions or components of a given content item , . According to embodiments, the comments application  is a software application operative to provide the comments interfaces and indicators and feedback mechanisms described herein in association with a variety of content item types (as described above). The comments application may be a component software application module of another software application, for example, a word processing application document, a spreadsheet application document, a slide presentation application document, a notes application document, an Internet-based web page document, and the like. Alternatively, the comments application  may be a standalone software application that may be called by such other software applications via one or more application programming interfaces for obtaining from the comments application  the comments and feedback functionality described herein.","According to another alternative embodiment, the comments application  may be operated as a service (e.g., a cloud-based service) where the functionality of the comments application  is operated remotely from any given computing device. In such an operation, client-side comments applications  may communicate with the remotely operated comments application  for comments functionality, including storage of comments and retrieval of previously stored comments. For example, in a collaborative working environment, a first user may comment on a document from her slate or tablet-style computer, and her comments may be reflected in real time to another user reviewing the same document from his laptop computer and to yet another user reviewing the same document from her desktop computer. In such a case the comments application  operating on the remote server may act as a service point for coordinating central comments application and collection and for corresponding the comments to various remote users. Thus a multi-device synchronization of comments application and review is enabled. For another example, all comments ever made by an individual user in association with a document or group of documents may be retrieved for review, ratings or other feedback provided by other users about a given user or about his\/her comments may be retrieved for review, application of one or more comments to remotely stored documents may be accomplished, and the like. Operation of a service-oriented or distributed computing environment is described in more detail below with reference to .","Referring still to , a comments tab  is displayed underneath a portion of text contained in the document  to indicate the presence of a prescribed number of comments entered in association with the text or other content component or portion to which the comments tab is associated. For example, the comments tab  may be displayed underneath a portion of text, as illustrated in , or the comments tab  may be displayed underneath a displayed object, for example, a chart , a table, an image, a photograph, or any other computer-enabled component or portion of a document or other content item for which one or more users may wish to provide comments.","Referring to the comments tab , information concerning the nature of the comments associated with the comments tab  may be displayed in the comments tab . For example, if a single comment is associated with the comments tab  a label such as \u201ccomments\u201d or \u201cone comment\u201d may be included in the comments tab . On the other hand, if multiple comments are associated with the displayed comments tab , then a number followed by the label \u201ccomments\u201d may be displayed as illustrated in . For example, in  the label \u201ctwo comments\u201d is displayed in the comments tab  to alert users that two comments may be reviewed by expanding the comments user interface component, as illustrated and describe below with reference to . A chevron  may be provided in the comments tab  to indicate that the comments user interface component may be expanded underneath the comments tab  for exposing the comments associated with the comments tab , as described below with reference to .","According to embodiments, additional information may be provided in the comments tab . For example, an identification of the person commenting may be provided in the comments tab . If more than one comment is available having more than one comment author, a scrolling feature may be provided in the tab  to allow a user to scroll through information provided in the tab without actually opening the underlying comments, as described below with reference to . Other information that may be provided in the comments tab may include priority of comments (e.g., high, medium, and low), whether comments have been read\/unread, resolved\/unresolved, and the like.","As should be appreciated, the display of the comments tab  along the left side of the document , as illustrated in , is for purposes of illustration only and is not limiting of other display orientations that may be utilized for the comments tab . For example, comments associated with the chart  may be provided, and the comments tab  may be displayed underneath the chart  if desired. Similarly, one comments tab  may be displayed underneath a portion of text, as illustrated in , and a second comments tab may be displayed under another object, for example, the chart  to indicate that comments have been entered with respect to the chart .","Referring now to , upon selection of the comments tab , a comments user interface  may be automatically expanded in line in the associated document or other content item . As illustrated in , the comments user interface expanded underneath the comments tab  includes two example comments ,  that comprise a comments conversation thread associated with an example text portion of the document . As should be appreciated, in addition to entering one or more text-based comments into the comments user interface component , other content, for example, images, spreadsheet application charts, slide presentation application slides, photographs, links, music files, and the like may be inserted into the comments user interface component  for review by other users or comment providers in association with the document or content item to which comments are directed. As should be appreciated, content may be entered and edited in the comments user interface  via all the input means described above for entry and editing of content items , .","Referring to the example comments , , a first comment is received from a reviewer  of the document  in which the reviewer provides a comment to the author of the document  as to suggested changes or revisions to the document . The author may select the \u201cAdd a comment\u201d button  to add the responsive comment , and the author and reviewer may thus engage in a comment conversation directly in line, between lines, between paragraphs, between images, between objects, or in association with other content items to make the review and editing process more efficient. Additional comments functionality may be provided in a comments editing user interface component, as described below with reference to .","Such a comment process is particularly helpful where the document  may be accessed by multiple users and\/or reviewers as part of a collaborative workspace where the document  may be displayed on computing device display screens of multiple users who may engage in a live comments conversation in line with the document, as illustrated in . As should be appreciated, if a third comment provider would like to add a comment for the comment conversation, the third comment provider may select the \u201cAdd a comment\u201d button  for adding yet another comment on the associated text item or other object, or for adding a responsive comment to one of the comments ,  already provided. Indeed, a comments conversation thread may run through the entire document where a number of comments are threaded together owing to their commentary and responsive commentary in association with a given aspect of the document. As should be appreciated, multiple comments threads may exist in a given document where one thread is associated with one aspect of a document, another thread is associated with a second aspect of the document, and so on.","As illustrated in , the expanded comment user interface component  is illustrated as a full size user interface component where the user interface component may be displayed in a size that is similar to content in which it is displayed in an \u201cin line\u201d manner where the comments user interface flows with the other content contained in the document or other content item. That is, the comments user interface  may be displayed in a display configuration and display size such that the displayed comments user interface and such that comments received and displayed in the comments user interface match a display configuration and display size of the displayed first content item. Thus, the comments displayed in the comments user interface component  may be easily entered, edited, submitted, displayed, or responded to. As should be appreciated, if desired, a text style or font associated with comments entered in and displayed in the comments user interface component  may be utilized to distinguish comments from the text of an associated document or other content item. For example, the text font of comments may be changed from a text font of the associated document or other content item to a different text font to allow a comment provider to easily distinguish comments from the associated text or other content items. As should be appreciated, the comments user interface component  and the example comments , , illustrated in , are shown in relation to a text-based document, for example, a word processing document. According to embodiments, the comments user interface component and associated functionality may similarly be applied to other types of content, for example, slide presentation application slides, spreadsheet documents, and the like.","According to embodiments, the document content and associated comments described herein may be entered, edited and reviewed across multiple computing devices, such as a general purpose computing device, a personal computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a slate-type computer, a mobile computer, a hand-held telephonic computer (e.g., mobile telephone or smart phone), and the like. Document content and comments accessible by such devices may be interacted with across such devices. For example, a document  may be stored at a remote server as part of a collaborative workspace. Various members of the collaborative workspace may comment on the document, and all members of the workspace may access the document and comments from their respective computing devices.","Referring now to , according to another embodiment, the document\/comments display configuration may be \u201cflipped\u201d or pivoted such that the comments are the primary display feature and the associated document text or other objects become a secondary display feature. According to one embodiment, a display formatting for the text or other objects may be changed to remove or alter the view of the text or other objects such that they become secondary to the display of the comments. As illustrated in , the text or other objects  of a given document may be removed from view or \u201cgreyed out\u201d such that the primary display in the document becomes the comments. In addition, such text or other objects may be collapsed from view altogether or into a selectable control or icon, which when selected, may cause the collapsed text or objects to be replaced back into view. Thus, the only content displayed to a reviewing user may be one or more running comments conversation threads. A \u201cshow text\u201d button  is provided for flipping or pivoting the display orientation back to a view showing the text and other objects, as illustrated in . According to this embodiment, a user may consider the comments running through a document to be of particular interest and would like to review the comments as a document of their own before returning to a review of the document text and other objects. As should be appreciated a variety of comments-only views may be generated, for example, a comments only view showing comments from one set of reviewers, a comments-only view showing comments from a second set of reviewers, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 2C and 2D","FIG. 2C"],"b":["920","225","225","205","210"]},"Alternatively, selection of the \u201cAuthor\/Edit Comments\u201d button  may cause a launching of a comments user interface component , as illustrated in , in which may be contained one or more comments functionality buttons and controls provided by the comments application  for interacting with one or more comments. For example, a \u201cNew\u201d button  is provided for allowing a user to start and enter a new comment. A \u201cReply\u201d button  allows for the entry of a responsive comment . A \u201cDelete\u201d button  allows for the deletion of a selected comment.","A \u201cRead\u201d button  allows for the marking of a given comment by a given user as having been read so that other users will know that the first user has reviewed the given comment. An \u201cUnread\u201d button  may allow a user to mark a comment as unread so that the comment will not be deleted or altered by other users. A \u201cClose\u201d button  may allow a user to close a comment from view, and a \u201cFeedback\u201d button  may allow a user to provide feedback on the comments of other users. Such feedback may be provided in a comment or may be assembled for review via a separate feedback document or medium. The \u201cClose\u201d button  may be used for collapsing the comments user interface component out of view as illustrated in . As should be appreciated, the user interface components illustrated and described herein are for purposes of example and are not limiting of the vast numbers of display styles and orientations that may be used, nor is the listing of functionality controls limiting of other functionality controls that may be included in such user interface components.","According to an embodiment, the buttons or controls - may allow for creating, modifying and annotating comments that will be reviewed by others, as described above. Alternatively, such functionality controls may also be utilized for creating, modifying and annotating comments for the primary user of the associated document. That is, a user may utilize such functionality controls to help him\/her in a review or editing of the document where, for example, the user might mark a comment as \u201cread\u201d to remind himself\/herself that he\/she has read the comment, or the user might mark a comment as \u201cunread\u201d to remind himself\/herself that he\/she has not read the comment.","Referring now to , the comments tab , illustrated in , may be collapsed and may be replaced by an image or icon ,  that may be displayed in a side margin of a document  or other content item adjacent to a location at which a comment has been entered. Collapsing the comments tab  out of view may allow users to review a given document  or other content item without any clutter caused by the addition of any non-document\/content item material, including the comments tab . According to an embodiment, an example icon or image that may be used to indicate the presence of an embedded comment may take the form of a \u201cpaint splotch\u201d type image ,  that may provide a pleasant, unobtrusive indication that one or more embedded comments exists in the associated document or content item near the displayed image , . As should be appreciated, the use of \u201cpaint splotch\u201d images to indicate the presence of embedded comments is for purposes of illustration and example only. Any acceptable image or icon may be used for indicating the presence of an embedded comment. For example, a star-shaped image, a ball-shaped image, an avatar-shaped image, an animal-shaped image, and the like may be used to indicate the presence of an embedded comment. According to one embodiment, users may select the comment indicating images ,  from a variety of available images that may be used for displaying and for indicating the presence of associated embedded comments, as desired.","According to an embodiment, the number of \u201cpaint splotch\u201d images or icons ,  displayed in the margin of the document or other content item may correspond to the number of comments that are embedded at the associated location. For example, the image  includes two example paint splotches grouped together which may be used to indicate that two comments are embedded in the document or other content item at that location. The paint splotch grouping  includes a number of paint splotch images (e.g., eight or more) which may indicate that a number of comments are embedded in the associated document or content item at that location. Alternatively, the display of such \u201cpaint splotch\u201d type images may be displayed in relative terms. For example, 500 comments applied to one portion of a document versus 50 comments applied to a second portion of the document would not require the display of 500 \u201cpaint splotches\u201d and 50 \u201cpaint splotches\u201d to show a comparison of the numbers of comments applied to the two document portions.","Referring now to , a scroll bar  is disposed along one side of the document interface for scrolling document content upward and downward for navigating from one portion of the document to another. According to embodiments, comments indicators , may be displayed in the scroll bar at positions relative to comments applied to the corresponding document content. For example, a first comments indicator  is displayed as a \u201cC\u201d indicator and indicates that two comments are included in the associated document at a point in the document corresponding to that point in the scroll bar. The use of the indicator \u201cC\u201d is only an example and is not limiting of other types of indicators that may be displayed in the scroll bar . Thus, according to this embodiment, as a user scrolls through a document, comments indicators appearing in the scroll bar at various points will give the user a quick and easy understanding as to the locations and numbers of comments that have been applied to the document at various points in the document.","According to one embodiment, the comments indicators (e.g., \u201cC\u201d) , displayed in the scroll bar  may be active functionality controls which when selected cause an automatic \u201cjump\u201d to the associated comment(s). Selection of the comments indicators , may also be used to cause an automatic opening of the associated comment in-line in the document  if the comment is not already open for review and editing. In addition, focusing on the comments indicators, for example, mouse-over or hover over the comments indicators, may cause a display of a pop-up, bubble, tooltip or other user interface component in which may be displayed a portion or all of the associated comment(s).","Referring now to , when a user focuses on one of the comment indicating images ,  by a suitable input means, for example, by hovering a mouse cursor over the image , by touching the image , by gesturing to the image , by an associated key stroke, or by voice command, the comments tab  may be expanded to expose the comments tab for use as described above with reference to . As illustrated in , selection of the expanded comments tab  then may cause expansion of the comments user interface component  to show embedded comments and to allow a user to enter new comments, responsive comments, and the like, as described above with reference to .","According to embodiments, one or more social feedback mechanisms may be employed for allowing users to provide feedback on a document , content item, or a component or portion of a document or content item without the requirement of entering text or other content in the comments user interface component , as described above. Referring now to , according to one embodiment a social feedback component  may be provided with which a user may provide a quick social feedback item  for applying a user feedback level to a portion or component of a content item. For example, a \u201cthumbs up\u201d image may be applied to indicate approval or satisfaction with an associated content item component or portion or a \u201cthumbs down\u201d image may be applied to provide a quick disapproval or dissatisfaction indication for an associated content item component or portion. For example, a reviewer may read a document offered by another user, and if the reviewer is particularly satisfied with a given paragraph in the document, the reviewer may selectively enter a \u201cthumbs up\u201d image  next to the associated paragraph to indicate his\/her satisfaction with the example paragraph. Likewise, if the reviewer is not satisfied with the associated paragraph or otherwise disapproves of the associated paragraph, the reviewer may selectively display a \u201cthumbs down\u201d image  to visually indicate the reviewer's disapproval or dissatisfaction with the associated example paragraph.","The entered images  may remain displayed next to the reviewed content portion or component for other users to see. According to one embodiment, identification information, such as the initials of the reviewer, may be displayed with the image  to provide other users information about the feedback. Other information that may be displayed with the image  may include a date and\/or time of the entry of the image .","As should be appreciated, a variety of other acceptable images  may be used for this feedback purpose, for example, a smiley face for approval, a frowning face for disapproval, a happy avatar for approval, an unhappy avatar for disapproval, and the like. As should be appreciated, almost a limitless number of such images may be employed for allowing a reviewer to quickly indicate satisfaction, dissatisfaction, approval, disapproval, and the like in association with a component or portion of a given document or content item. In addition to many different images that may be used, many different forms of rating likewise may be used, for example, a number of stars to indicate varying levels of satisfaction or a simple \u201clike\u201d tag applied to indicate basic satisfaction, and the like.","Referring still to , adjacent to the social feedback image  is a comments icon  that may be selected from the feedback interface component  for launching the comments user interface component , described above with reference to , to allow the reviewer to enter text or other content as a comment for the associated document or content item component or portion. For example, a given user may indicate dissatisfaction or disapproval with a given paragraph of a document , followed by selection of the comments icon  to launch the comments user interface component , and followed by entry of a comment expressing the reasons for the reviewer's disapproval or dissatisfaction with the associated content.","According to an embodiment, the feedback interface component  may be launched according to a variety of suitable input means or functionalities. For example, a user may hover a mouse cursor along a side margin of a document  followed by a right click at which the user may be provided a variety of options including an option to enter comments. Selection of an option for entering comments may cause a display of the feedback interface component  to allow the user to provide a feedback image  or to allow the user to launch the comments user interface component , as described above.","As illustrated in , according to an alternative embodiment, a meter\/indicator  may be displayed adjacent to portions of a document  or content item, for example, adjacent to a paragraph, page, or section of a given document, to allow various users to indicate approval, disapproval, satisfaction or dissatisfaction with adjacently displayed components or portions of a document or other content item. As should be appreciated, illustration of the indicator  adjacent to portions of a document or content item is for purposes of example. For another example, a high level view of the entire document may be displayed, and an indicator  may be shown in proximity to the high level display of the document or in a table of contents, or in a document or content navigation map, or in any other suitable location.","According to one embodiment, the meter\/indicator  may be in the form of a \u201cheat map\u201d meter where a level of approval, disapproval, satisfaction or dissatisfaction may be displayed in terms of colors to show temperatures associated with feedback (e.g., red is hot or highly approved, white is cool or highly disapproved). As illustrated in , the meter\/indicator  may employ a variety of means for indicating approval, disapproval, satisfaction or dissatisfaction according to an associated scale. For example, high satisfaction with a displayed portion of a document or other content item  may be indicated by a color, such as the color red . A medium satisfaction may be indicated with a color, such as the color pink , a low satisfaction may be indicated with a color, such as the color gray , a very low satisfaction may be indicated with a color such as the color white, and so on. As should be appreciated, other feedback indications may be employed, including numeric indications, for example, a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is high satisfaction and 1 is low satisfaction, or any other appropriate visual means for indicating varying levels of approval, disapproval, satisfaction, dissatisfaction.","Consider, for example, that the document  is comprised of two pages  and , as illustrated in . Upon command, for example, by right clicking in the left margin followed by selecting a feedback meter\/indicator, the feedback meters\/indicators  may be displayed adjacent to the pages , , as illustrated in . As a reviewer reads through the text or other content items  contained in the pages , , the reviewer may provide input to the meters\/indicators  to indicate approval, disapproval, satisfaction, dissatisfaction.
