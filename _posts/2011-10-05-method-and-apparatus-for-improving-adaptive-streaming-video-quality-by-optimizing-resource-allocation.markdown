{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field","Example embodiments of relate generally to resource allocation in wireless networks.","2. Description of Related Art","HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) is emerging as a popular approach to streaming video on demand and real-time content. HAS is adaptive in the sense that the quality of the video can be adjusted based on the bandwidth or data rate available between the server and the client. However, each client individually adapts its video quality independent of other video users sharing the same resources.","In conventional systems, HAS streaming over mobile wireless is based on a best effort allocation of resources. The base station typically employs a proportional fair scheduler that is unaware of the HAS flow and treats HAS and other flows the same. Additionally a guaranteed bit rate (GBR) can be set and throughput for a particular flow can be guaranteed. A guaranteed bit rate (GBR) set equal to the fixed source codec rate of traditional streaming (RTP\/UDP or HTTP\/TCP progressive download) is known to improve quality of experience (QoE) through steady offered rate as channel and load vary.","Example embodiments are directed to a method and apparatus for improving adaptive streaming video quality by optimizing resource allocation.","According to at least one example embodiment, a method of allocating resources for transmitting content from a network element in a communications network to one or more mobile devices each in communication with the network element may include receiving, at the network element, characteristic information corresponding to each of the one or more mobile devices; and generating one or more adaptive guaranteed bit rate (AGBR) values at the network element corresponding to each of the one or more mobile devices, respectively. The AGBR values may be GBR values generated for each of the one or more mobile devices based on the corresponding characteristic information. A first scheduling algorithm may be executed at the network element based on the one or more AGBR values; and resources may be allocated to the one or more mobile devices based on an output of the scheduling algorithm.","According to at least one example embodiment, a network apparatus may be configured to allocate resources for transmitting content from the network apparatus to one or more mobile devices each in communication with the network apparatus. The network apparatus may include a receiver unit configured to receive data; a transmitting unit configured to transmit data; a memory unit configured to store parameters corresponding with characteristics of the one or more mobile devices; and a processing unit coupled to the transmitting unit, the receiving unit, and the memory unit and configured to control operations associated with allocating resources to the one more mobile devices. The operations may include receiving, at the network element, characteristic information corresponding to each of the one or more mobile devices, generating one or more adaptive guaranteed bit rate (AGBR) values at the network element corresponding to each of the one or more mobile devices, respectively, the AGBR values being GBR values generated for each of the one or more mobile devices based on the corresponding characteristic information, executing at the network element a first scheduling algorithm based on the one or more AGBR values, and allocating resources to the one or more mobile devices based on an output of the scheduling algorithm.","Various example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some example embodiments.","Detailed illustrative embodiments are disclosed herein.

Generally, program modules or functional processes include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that performs particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.

As such, it will be understood that such acts and operations, which are at times referred to as being computer-executed, include the manipulation by the processor of electrical signals representing data in a structured form.

Examples include, but are not limited to, LTE and EVDO radio access technology.","The BS  may include a real scheduler  which includes software and\/or hardware capable of implementing a scheduling algorithm for allocating resources to users connected to the BS . Users connected to the BS , for example any of the first through fourth mobile devices mobile devices \u02dc, may each be using applications which employ rate-adaptive streaming where each user analyzes the amount of bandwidth allocated to the user by the BS  and requests a certain coding rate of the content being streamed based on the bandwidth. One example of this rate adaptive streaming is HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) used to stream video data, where the video data has a quality level which can be varied. For example, if the real scheduler  allocates a relatively high amount of bandwidth over a bearer between the user and the BS , the user can detect the high level of bandwidth and request video of a high quality level by, for example, requesting video encoded with a high resolution. If the real scheduler  lowers the amount of bandwidth allocated to the user, the user can request video of a lower quality level by, for example, requesting video encoded with a lower resolution. Though variable video rate data is discussed above, according to example embodiments, users within the communications network  may stream any type of rate-adaptive data including, for example, variable quality audio.","Communications network  may include both premium and best effort (BE) users. Premium users may each have an associated guaranteed bit rate (GBR) while best effort users may not have a GBR. Premium users generally enjoy a certain amount of priority over BE users with respect to resource allocation by the BS . In the example illustrated in , first through fourth mobile devices \u02dc represent premium users.","The scheduling algorithm implemented by the real scheduler  may be, for example, any known proportional fair (PF) scheduler which is capable of using guaranteed bit rates (GBR) to make scheduling decisions. One example of the scheduling algorithm implemented by the real scheduler is the known Proportional Fair with Minimum Rate (PFMR) algorithm. For example, the real scheduler  may receive GBR values for each of one or more users connected to the BS  from, for example, a corresponding application programming interface (API). According to known methods, the scheduler  can run a scheduling algorithm continuously over each of a plurality of slots and, for each slot, allocate resources to the users based on information including, for example, an achievable data rate, an average data rate and a GBR value of each user.","As is discussed above, according to example embodiments, in addition to the real scheduler , the BS  includes a virtual scheduler . The virtual scheduler  is capable of determining adaptive GBR values for use by the real scheduler  in making resource allocation decisions for users connected to the BS . As will be discussed in greater detail below, the virtual scheduler  determines adaptive GBR values by executing a GBR setting algorithm according to example embodiments. The virtual scheduler  may execute the GBR setting algorithm based on information regarding network and\/or user-specific characteristics.","Overview of Method and Apparatus for Improving Resource Allocation for Use with Adaptive Streaming","With respect to conventional methods for handling adaptive streaming in wireless communications networks, having each client adapt its video quality individually, independent of other video users sharing the same resources, can result in uneven quality of experience across a set of users watching video of different complexity over devices experiencing different user-specific factors such as different screen sizes, radio conditions, or locations relative to the base station serving the video. Employing a proportional fair scheduler that uses GBR values but is unaware of HAS flows and treats HAS and other flows the same, as in conventional systems, may not provide an optimal solution to this issue because the user-specific factors discussed above may still not be taken into account in a manner suitable for obtaining improved or optimal aggregate quality among multiple users.","Furthermore, conventional resource allocation schemes do not specifically take into account that HAS may experience degraded content quality when there is rapid or substantial amount of data rate variations introduced by load variations in the network or because of channel quality.","In view of the above, it may be beneficial to ensure that there is fair allocation of resources across the different users that will result in maximization of aggregate quality of experience across the users, while also ensuring that rapid or substantial data rate variations which may degrade quality, are reduced or prevented.","By taking into account network factors like attached cell loading (e.g., competing users) and capacity; and user-specific factors such as location of a user (e.g., good vs. bad average SINR); class of service (e.g., premium vs. best effort (BE)); video complexity (low: \u2018talking head\u2019 vs. high: action); screen size\/image resolution (e.g., 1024\u00d7768 iPad vs. 480\u00d7320 iPhone), resources may be allocated in a way that increases or optimizes aggregate quality of experience between multiple users.","In addition, resources may be allocated in such a manner that quality degradation resulting from an excessive frequency or magnitude of data rate changes is prevented. A method and apparatus for improving resource allocation for use with adaptive streaming will now be discussed in greater detail below with respect to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["151","105","151","151","159","152","154","156","158"]},"The transmitting unit , receiving unit , memory unit , and processing unit  may send data to and\/or receive data from one another using the data bus .

For example, GBR=A* subject to GBR>=GBR, where GBRis the base GBR value negotiated for the user or bearer and obtained from, for example, the API. The base GBR may be obtained by the BS  using know methods. The BS  may obtain the base GBR associated with a particular user or bearer i based on a signaling message received at the BS  including a quality of service (QoS) class identifier (QCI) or other signaling message field referencing the user or bearer i.","Step sizes or incremental resources (in virtual scheduling approaches described in the sequel) should be small enough that the adaptive GBR response is slow enough to filter out spiky inputs (e.g., competing flow(s), premium or BE, turning on and off rapidly) and fast enough to adapt to longer term variations. Still there may be a window of input variations that could cause the adaptive GBR response to oscillate significantly enough to adversely affect QoE. Thus, according to at least some example embodiments, in order to provide reduced variations in quality in the face of load changes in the network , a maximum bit rate (MBR) may be enforced. But setting MBR=GBR may be too restrictive. Alternatively, a more relaxed approach may be taken by setting the MBR such that MBR>=GBRensuring MBR<=MBR, where MBRmay be obtained, for example, from the AE API. According to example embodiments, MBRmay be adjusted based on a quality score derived from mapping the observed rate variations of a particular premium user to a formula computed mean opinion score (MOS). It may be desirable to implement the MBR (in a premium HAS video application specific manner) by throttling the flow of packets locally (as the MBR is adaptive) in the scheduler. For example, the MBR may be set to a highest possible value initially and adapted depending on the level of download rate variations observed.","It should be noted that if an application specifies a GBR (denoted by GBR) and MBR (denoted by MBR) then this shall be taken into account by ensuring that\n\n\u2003\u2003(6)\n","The algorithm above needs to take into account any caps imposed by the scheduler that prevents achieving the GBR value set. An indication such as that can be taken into account by not increasing the GBR of such users any more.","According to at least one example embodiment of the general approach outline above, we will assume that \u03a9(A)=\u03c9A for all i. In other words, the amount of resources that will be needed to achieve an average rate is linear in the rate, with the proportionality factor given by the user geometry. In particular, we will invoke ideal Shannon capacity for adaptive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, \u03c9=[log(1+SINR)]. The general optimization problem can then be solved using one of the two online optimization approaches discussed below.","Virtual Scheduling Approach I","In this approach, the virtual scheduler  updates the rates Ain each step as though actual scheduling is being performed similar to a proportional fair scheduler like that implemented by the real scheduler . Based on the values Agenerated by the virtual scheduler , the GBR values for the real scheduler  are periodically updated based on how the rates Aevolve in the virtual scheduler. According to at least one example embodiment, one modification to the virtual scheduling algorithm used by the virtual scheduler  relative to that used by a standard scheduler is that the virtual scheduler  takes into account the constraint on resources.

In cases where users arrive and depart and\/or SNRs vary slowly in time due to user mobility, the cumulative cap approach may result in a different set of adaptive GBRs.","Virtual scheduling approach I will now be explained in greater detail with reference to an example in which the objective function explained above with reference to expressions (4) and (5) is applied to expression (7).

Further, the characteristic information for each of each of the first through fourth mobile devices \u02dc may include information regarding location\/signal quality of the mobile device (e.g., good vs. bad average SINR); a class of service of the mobile device (e.g., premium vs. best effort (BE)); a complexity of content associated with the mobile device (e.g., for video content, low: \u2018talking head\u2019 video vs. high: action video); and screen size\/image resolution of the mobile device (e.g., 1024\u00d7768 smart phone vs. 480\u00d7320 tablet device). The characteristic information may be provided to the BS , for example, by way of the SGW .","For example, the characteristic information may be provided to the BS  in accordance with an example system and method described in A METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR RATE ADAPTIVE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES, by C. Kahn, H. Viswanathan, M. Clougherty, and Andre Beck, U.S., Ser. No. 13\/253,393, filed on Oct. 5, 2011, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The characteristic information may be used by the BS  to generate quality mapping information for each corresponding bearer of the first through fourth mobile devices -. The quality mapping information may be of the same type described above with reference to expression (2). The quality mapping information may define quality-to-rate relationships and constant values for each of bearers -. Using bearer  between the first mobile device  and BS  as an example, the quality mapping information may define a quality-to-rate relationship between a quality value Qand a rate Afor the bearer ; the quality mapping information may define constant values including c, and maximum and minimum rate values Aand Afor the bearer .","In step S, the BS  generates adaptive GBR values by running a GBR setting algorithm at the virtual scheduler . For example, the virtual scheduler  may implement the algorithm described above with reference to partial algorithms (9) and (12) by updating, in accordance with expression (11), adaptive GBRs A(where i=1, 2, 3, 4) at each time slot n.","In step S, adaptive GBR values are provided from the virtual scheduler  to the real scheduler . For example, as is described above with reference to partial algorithm (12), after each set of slots equal to the value NumVirtualSlotsBlocks, which may be, for example, 2000 slots, adaptive GBRs A, A, Aand A(corresponding to bearers , ,  and  of first thorough fourth mobile units \u02dc) generated by the virtual scheduler  may be provided to the real scheduler . Further, in accordance with at least one example, embodiment, before the adaptive GBRs A, A, Aand Aare provided to the real scheduler , the virtual scheduler  may quantize the adaptive GBRs A, A, Aand Ain the manner discussed above with reference to expressions (16) and (17).","In step S, the BS  may allocate resources to the plurality of bearers - by running a PF scheduling algorithm at the real scheduler  where the PF algorithm uses, as GBR values for bearers -, the adaptive GBR values provided by the virtual scheduler  in step S.","Once the resources have been allocated to the plurality of bearers -, the data may be transmitted to the first through fourth mobile devices -, via the bearers -, in accordance with the allocation of resources.","According to example embodiments, resources may be allocated to a plurality of users including users executing application that use HAS flows. Bit rates may be guaranteed in the face of contention for resources from other users in order to keep video quality stable. Further, variations in quality due to load changes in the network caused by events such as users coming into or leaving the system may be reduced by slow adaptation of the delivered bit rate. Further, if quality indicators are available, then an aggregate quality across the different users can be optimized. Additionally, according to at least one example embodiment, equal resource allocation can be achieved.","Example embodiments being thus described, it will be obvious that embodiments may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from example embodiments, and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of example embodiments."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Example embodiments will become more fully understood from the detailed description provided below and the accompanying drawings, wherein like elements are represented by like reference numerals, which are given by way of illustration only and thus are not limiting of example embodiments and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
