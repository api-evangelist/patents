Technical Field","Agents that inhibit urea transport activity are needed as therapeutic agents for increasing solute clearance in states of fluid overload and for treating diseases and conditions such as hypertension. Agents that inhibit urea transporters and methods for using these agents are described herein.","2. Description of the Related Art","Urea is generated by the liver as the major end product of nitrogen metabolism, released into the blood, and excreted by the kidneys. The processing of urea by the kidney is complex, involving countercurrent multiplication and exchange mechanisms that greatly increase urea concentration in the renal medulla compared to serum. In the maximally concentrating (antidiuretic) kidney, urea concentration in the urine can reach >1000 mM in mammals (see, e.g., Bankir et al., \u201cUrea and the kidney\u201d In: 6th ed., edited by Brenner B M, Philadelphia, (WB Saunders, 2000), 637-679; Sands et al., 29:178-95, 2009) much greater than the serum urea concentration of 4-10 mM. The renal countercurrent mechanisms involve intrarenal urea recycling facilitated by urea transporters (UTs) expressed in renal tubule epithelial cells (UT-A, encoded by the SLc14A2 gene) and renal vasa recta microvessels (UT-B, encoded by the SLc14A1 gene) (see, e.g., Bagnasco, 284: F3-F10, 2003; Sands, 13:525-32, 2004; Shayakul et al., 447: 603-609, 2004; Stewart, 2011 Mar. 30, doi:10.1111\/j.1476-5381.2011.01377.x Epub ahead of print; Tsukaguchi et al., 99:1506-15, 1997. Phenotype analysis of knockout mice lacking UT-B (see, e.g., Bankir et al., 286:F144-F151, 2004; Yang et al., 277:10633-37, 2002) or various UT-A isoforms (see, e.g., Fenton et al., 101:7469-74, 2004; Fenton et al., 16:1583-92, 2005; Uchida et al., 25: 7357-63, 2005) has provided evidence for the involvement of UTs in the urinary concentrating mechanism, subject to the caveat that gene knockout may produce off-target effects such as compensatory changes in the expression of non-UT transport proteins (see, e.g., Fenton, 17:513-18, 2008; Klein et al., 15:1161-67, 2004). Though UT function has been studied mainly in kidney, UTs are also expressed in erythrocytes, testis, brain, heart and urinary bladder (see, e.g., Doran et al., 290:R1446-R1459, 2006) where their physiological functions are not clear.","Phenotype analysis of mice separately lacking vasa recta UT-B or inner medullary collecting duct UT-A1\/3 implicated UT involvement in the formation of concentrated urine and in renal urea clearance (see, e.g., Yang et al., 277:10633-37 (2002); Fenton et al., 101:7469-74 (2004); Fenton et al., 16, 1583-92 (2005)). The UT-B knock-out mice that were generated manifested a urea-selective urinary concentrating defect associated with urinary hypoosmolality and increased renal urea clearance (Yang et al., supra). UT-B is also expressed outside of the kidney, most notably and in highest abundance in red blood cell (RBC) membranes. Loss-of-function human UT-B mutations result in greatly reduced urea permeability in RBC and a mild urinary concentrating defect (Sands et al., 2:1689-96 (1992); Lucien et al., 273:12973-80 (1998)).","Diuretics are administered widely in humans to increase renal salt and water clearance in a variety of conditions that are associated with total body fluid overload, such as congestive heart failure and cirrhosis, as well in normovolemic states such as hypertension and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Most diuretics are inhibitors of salt absorption by kidney tubules, such as a furosemide block of Na\/K\/2Cl co-transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle and a thiazide block of Na\/Cl co-transport in the distal tubule. Recently, a new type of diuretic, called an \u201caquaretic,\u201d has been developed to increase renal water clearance in hyponatremia associated with fluid overload or SIADH (see, e.g., Goldsmith, 95:14B-23B (2005); Miller, 54:345-53 (2006)). Vasopressin-2 receptor (V2R) antagonist aquaretics have been approved for clinical use in some countries, though not yet in the United States, and aquaporin inhibitor aquaretics are under development.","Functional studies in knock-out mice indicate a critical role for urea transporters (UTs) in the urinary concentrating mechanism and in renal urea clearance. However, potent and specific urea transport blockers have not been available. Accordingly, a third type of diuretic is needed: one that targets renal urea clearance mechanisms. Because urea is of at least equal importance to NaCl in the renal countercurrent mechanism for urinary concentration (see, e.g., Bankir et al., supra; Masilamani et al., In (6), Brenner, ed. Philadelphia, Pa.; WB Saunders Company; pages 595-35; (2000)), such diuretics are needed for increasing solute clearance in states of fluid overload, hypertension, and may also be useful in prolonging dialysis-free survival in chronic renal insufficiency.","Urea transporter inhibitors identified to date have included non-selective membrane intercalating agents, urea analogs with insufficient potency, and specific urea transporter inhibitors with lower than desired potency. A need exists in the medical art for compounds that inhibit urea transporter and that exhibit nanomolar potency for increasing solute clearance and free water excretion in states of fluid overload, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency.","Provided herein are triazolothienopyrimidine compounds that inhibit the urea transport activity of urea transporters, such as urea transporter-B (UT-B), and thereby reduce urine concentration in a host receiving the compound.

As found in mice, humans lacking UT-B manifest a modest urinary concentrating defect (see, e.g., Lucien et al., 273:12973-80 (1998); Sands et al., 2:1689-96 (1992)), supporting the potential urearetic efficacy of UT-B inhibitors. Previously available UT inhibitors included compounds that are nonspecific and exhibit moderate or low activity such as the non-specific membrane intercalating agent phloretin (exhibiting activity at >0.5 mM); urea analogs such as thiourea, methylurea, and dimethylurea (exhibiting activity at 50-100 mM); (see, e.g., Mayrand et al., supra), and chemically modified urea analogs (exhibiting irreversible activity at 30-100 \u03bcM) (Martial et al., 423:51-58 (1993)). By high-throughput screening of 50,000 compounds, phenylsulfoxyoxozole inhibitors of human UT-B were identified that exhibited ICof less than 100 nM (see, e.g., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 08\/061248; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US-2010-0305105; Levin et al., 21:551-63, 2007).

Other compounds having a triazolothienopyrimidine scaffold were described by Westerlund (17: 1765-69 (1980)), the synthesis of which involved cycloaddition chemistry to generate the core heterocycle. Generation of lactam 5 (see ) was based on this cycloaddition methodology. Recently, this general scaffold has been reported to show antagonist activity against 5-HTreceptors in vitro (see, e.g., Ivachtchenko et al., 18:5282-90 (2010)), though no pharmacology or in vivo data were reported. The synthesis of triazolthienopyrimidine UTB-14 can be accomplished in five steps with an overall yield of approximately 16%. The synthesis is designed to be modular, allowing diversification of the scaffold to improve physico-chemical properties. Notably, the phosphonium-mediated amidine forming conditions previously reported (see, e.g., Wan et al., 8:2425-28 (2006)) was unsuccessful. The conditions described herein are adapted to employ microwave irradiation to effect conversion, and a workup that gave highly pure UTB-14 by NMR and HPLC criteria.","Synthesis of other triazolothieneopyrimidine compounds described herein may be performed according to the following synthesis procedures and methods.","As shown in General Scheme 1, aryl or heteroaryl sulfonyl acetonitriles (6) may be prepared by reacting a thiol starting material (4), e.g., an appropriately substituted arylthiol or heteroarylthiol, with bromoacetonitrile (a) to provide an intermediate sulfide acetonitrile (5).

An exemplary cell that may be used in the methods described herein and that expresses a urea transporter is a red blood cell (i.e., erythrocyte), which endogenously expresses the urea transporter UT-B (also referred to as the Kidd blood group antigen).","Alternatively, the cells (which may be any one of a renal cell, a brain cell, a red blood cell, a liver cell, or a testis cell or other cell) may comprise an exogenous polynucleotide that encodes a urea transporter polypeptide. The cell may be transfected, transformed, or transduced with a recombinant expression vector, which comprises a polynucleotide that is capable of directing expression of at least one urea transporter. To direct expression of at least one transporter, the polynucleotide comprises a nucleotide sequence that encodes at least one urea transporter, which nucleotide sequence is operatively linked to at least one expression control sequence (e.g., a promoter, enhancer, transcriptional control element, and the like). Recombinant expression vectors may be prepared according to methods and techniques with which a person skilled in the molecular biology art is familiar. An exemplary cell line that may be transfected with a recombinant expression vector comprising a polynucleotide that directs expression of a urea transporter or other transport includes Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK).","Cells may be obtained or derived from any one of a number of animals, including mammals. Mammalian cells may be obtained or may have originated from humans; non-human primates; rodents such as mice, rats, or rabbits; cats (feline); dogs (canine); cattle (bovine); sheep (ovine); pigs (porcine); llamas; and camels, for example.","Methods that may be used to identify and to characterize urea transporter inhibitors, such as the compounds described herein, include red blood cell lysis methods and a stopped flow light scattering methods (see also, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2010\/0305105 and 2010\/0190796; Levin et al., supra). Such assays may be used to determine the effective concentrations of a particular compound and thus are useful for predicting the capability of the compound to effectively treat a disease, disorder, or condition treatable by inhibiting urea transporter activity in a subject.","Other methods for characterizing compounds include stopped-flow light scattering to measure solute and water permeabilities of a cell (see, e.g., Yang et al., 277:36782-86 (2002; 2002 Jul. 19); Macey et al., 134(3):241-50 (1993)). For example, to determine the urea permeability of a cell, dilutions of indicator cells, such as red blood cells, may be incubated with an agent and then subjected to an inwardly directed gradient of urea. After the cells osmotically shrink (i.e., the cell volume decreases), the kinetics of increasing cell volume caused by urea influx can be measured over a time course during which the cells are exposed to 90\u00b0 scattered light intensity at 530 nm. As the volume of the cell increases, scattered light intensity is reduced. Stopped flow light scattering may also be used to determine values for inhibition by a urea transporter and may also be used to determine the sideness of the inhibitor action (i.e., whether the inhibitor alters a solute transporter activity by preventing or inhibiting entry of a solute into the cell or whether the inhibitor alters a solute transport activity by preventing or inhibiting efflux of the inhibitor from the cell).","A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the methods and techniques described herein may include appropriate control samples to evaluate and ensure the robustness, accuracy, and precision of the method. Statistical methods may be applied to the determinations of the particular assay in the absence and presence of a candidate agent to evaluate and compare the different candidate agents tested.","Treatment of Urea Clearance Disorders","A composition comprising at least one of the triazolothienopyrimidine compounds described herein may be used for treating a disease, disorder, or condition in a subject. In one embodiment, methods are provided for treating a disease, disorder, or condition that is treatable by inhibiting transport of urea wherein the method comprises administering a composition comprising at least one compound as described herein.","UT inhibitors have a fundamentally different mechanism-of-action from conventional diuretics, which target kidney tubule salt transporters, and so may act in synergy. Diuretics are used widely to increase renal salt and water excretion in fluid overload conditions such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome, and when vasopressin levels are inappropriately high such as in syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). By disrupting countercurrent mechanisms, UT inhibitors alone or in combination with loop diuretics, may induce a diuresis in states of refractory edema where conventional diuretics are not effective (see, e.g., Zhang 285: F731-F747 (2003); Fenton et al., 458:169-177, (2009); Smith, 94:180-185 (2009)).","A disease, condition, or disorder treatable by inhibiting transport of urea includes a fluid retention imbalance, for example, urea clearance insufficiency. In certain instances, the urea clearance insufficiency is a renal urea clearance insufficiency. Triazolothienopyrimidines may be useful for therapy of diuretic-refractory edema in heart and liver failure. The compounds of structures (I), (II), (III), and substructures described herein may be used to treat a refractory edema associated with or caused by a cardiovascular, renal, or metabolic disease, disorder, or condition, such as cirrhosis, nephritic syndrome, acute renal failure, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. In certain other embodiments, the disease, disorder, or condition to be treated is syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), azotemia, fluid retention, and abnormal uresis. In other certain embodiments, at least one of the triazolothienopyrimidines compounds described herein may also be used in combination with a loop diuretic.","In a particular embodiment, methods are provided for treating such a disease, disorder, or condition by inhibiting the capability of at least one urea transporter to transport urea. In one embodiment, at least one of the compounds described herein inhibits the capability of a UT-B transporter to transport urea. A triazolothienopyrimidine compound described herein may be used as a type of diuretic, an \u201curearetic,\u201d that affects renal urea clearance mechanisms.","Methods are also provided for using the compounds described herein for treating a disease, disorder, or condition treatable by inhibiting transport of urea in a subject by administering to the subject in need thereof a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one of the compounds having the structure and substructures described above. The disease, disorder, or condition that may be treated using the compounds and compositions described herein may be associated with a fluid retention imbalance such as urea clearance insufficiency. Urea is a by-product of protein metabolism that is formed in the liver. Because urea contains ammonia, which is toxic to an animal body, urea must be quickly filtered from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. Also as described herein, conservation of water in mammals depends significantly on the transport of urea, particularly in the kidney. Urea is generated as the major end product of hepatic nitrogen metabolism and is excreted primarily by the kidney. In a particular embodiment the disease, disorder, or condition to be treated is renal urea clearance insufficiency.","As understood by a person skilled in the medical art, the terms, \u201ctreat\u201d and \u201ctreatment,\u201d refer to medical management of a disease, disorder, or condition of a subject (i.e., patient) (see, e.g., Stedman's Medical Dictionary). In general, an appropriate dose and treatment regimen provide at least one compound of structures (I), (II), (III), and substructures described herein in an amount sufficient to provide therapeutic and\/or prophylactic benefit. Therapeutic and\/or prophylactic benefit includes, for example, an improved clinical outcome, both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow or retard (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, or to prevent or slow or retard (lessen) the expansion or severity of such disorder. As discussed herein, beneficial or desired clinical results from treating a subject include, but are not limited to, abatement, lessening, or alleviation of symptoms that result from or are associated the disease, condition, or disorder to be treated; decreased occurrence of symptoms; improved quality of life; longer disease-free status (i.e., decreasing the likelihood or the propensity that a subject will present symptoms on the basis of which a diagnosis of a disease is made); diminishment of extent of disease; stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease; delay or slowing of disease progression; amelioration or palliation of the disease state; and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable; and\/or overall survival. \u201cTreatment\u201d can also mean prolonging survival when compared to expected survival if a subject were not receiving treatment. Subjects in need of treatment include those who already have the condition or disorder as well as subjects prone to have or at risk of developing the disease, condition, or disorder, and those in which the disease, condition, or disorder is to be prevented (i.e., decreasing the likelihood of occurrence of the disease, disorder, or condition).","In particular embodiments of the methods described herein, the subject is a human or non-human animal. A subject in need of the treatments described herein may exhibit symptoms or sequelae of a disease, disorder, or condition described herein or may be at risk of developing the disease, disorder, or condition. Non-human animals that may be treated include mammals, for example, non-human primates (e.g., monkey, chimpanzee, gorilla, and the like), rodents (e.g., rats, mice, gerbils, hamsters, ferrets, rabbits), lagomorphs, swine (e.g., pig, miniature pig), equine, dogs (canine); cats (feline), cattle (bovine); sheep (ovine); pigs (porcine); llamas; and camels; and other domestic, farm, and zoo animals.","In one embodiment, treating any one of the aforementioned diseases or conditions comprises inhibiting (i.e., preventing, decreasing, reducing, abrogating, or inhibiting in a statistically significant or biologically significant manner) the capability of at least one urea transporter (e.g., UT-B) to transport urea by administering a composition comprising any one or more of the compounds of the structure (I), (II), (III), and substructures. The subject, and thus the source of the urea transporter, may be a human or non-human mammal.","To evaluate and to monitor the effectiveness of any one of the compounds described herein to treat a disease, disorder, or condition, one or more of several clinical assay methods may be performed that are familiar to a person skilled in the clinical art. For example, a clinical method called a urea clearance test may be performed. By way of example, a blood sample is obtained from a subject to whom the compound is being administered so that the amount of urea in the bloodstream can be determined. In addition, a first urine sample may be collected from the subject and additional samples may be collected over time (for example, at least one hour later). The amount of urea quantified in the urine indicates the amount of urea that is filtered, or cleared by the kidneys into the urine. Another clinical assay method measures urine osmolality (i.e., the amount of dissolved solute particles in the urine). Inability of the kidneys to concentrate the urine in response to restricted fluid intake, or to dilute the urine in response to increased fluid intake during osmolality testing may indicate decreased kidney function.","Urea is a by-product of protein metabolism and is formed in the liver. Urea is then filtered from the blood and excreted in the urine by the kidneys. The BUN (blood urea nitrogen) test measures the amount of nitrogen contained in the urea. High BUN levels may indicate kidney dysfunction, but because blood urea nitrogen is also affected by protein intake and liver function, the test is usually performed in conjunction with determination of blood creatinine, which is considered a more specific indicator of kidney function. Low clearance values for creatinine and urea indicate diminished ability of the kidneys to filter these waste products from the blood and excrete them in the urine. As clearance levels decrease, blood levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen increase. An abnormally elevated blood creatinine, a more specific and sensitive indicator of kidney disease than the BUN, is diagnostic of impaired kidney function.","Pharmaceutical Compositions","Also provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions that comprise any one or more of the triazolothienopyrimidine compounds of structures I, II, and III (and substructures and specific structures thereof). The compounds described herein may be formulated in a pharmaceutical composition for use in treatment or preventive (or prophylactic) treatment (e.g., reducing the likelihood of occurrence or exacerbation of disease or of one or more symptoms of the disease).","As used herein, a subject may be any mammal, including a human, that may have or be afflicted with a disease, condition, or disorder described herein. A pharmaceutical composition may be a sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solution, suspension or emulsion, which additionally comprises at least one physiologically acceptable excipient (i.e., a physiologically and pharmaceutically suitable non-toxic and inactive material or ingredient that does not interfere with the activity of the active ingredient; an excipient also may be called a carrier). Such compositions may be in the form of a solid, liquid, or gas (aerosol). Alternatively, compositions described herein may be formulated as a lyophilizate, or compounds may be encapsulated within liposomes using technology known in the art.

The methods and excipients described herein are exemplary and are in no way limiting. An effective amount or therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount of a compound or a composition comprising one or more compounds that when administered to a subject, either as a single dose or as part of a series of doses, is effective to produce a desired therapeutic effect.","Optimal doses may generally be determined using experimental models and\/or clinical trials.

The use of the minimum dose that is sufficient to provide effective therapy is usually preferred. Subjects may generally be monitored for therapeutic effectiveness using assays suitable for the condition being treated or prevented, which assays will be familiar to those having ordinary skill in the art and are described herein. The level of a compound that is administered to a subject may be monitored by determining the level of the compound in a biological fluid, for example, in the blood, blood fraction (e.g., serum), and\/or in the urine, and\/or other biological sample from the subject. Any method practiced in the art to detect the compound may be used to measure the level of compound during the course of a therapeutic regimen.","The dose of a composition comprising at least one of the compounds described herein for treating a disease or condition may depend upon the subject's condition, that is, stage of the disease, severity of symptoms caused by the disease, general health status, as well as age, gender, and weight, and other factors apparent to a person skilled in the medical art. Similarly, the dose of the compound for treating a disease or disorder treatable by inhibiting urea transporters as described herein may be determined according to parameters understood by a person skilled in the medical art.","Pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one triazolothienopyrimidine compound may be administered in a manner appropriate to the disease or disorder to be treated as determined by persons skilled in the medical arts. An appropriate dose and a suitable duration and frequency of administration will be determined by such factors as the condition of the patient, the type and severity of the patient's disease, the particular form of the active ingredient, and the method of administration. In general, an appropriate dose (or effective dose) and treatment regimen provides the composition(s) comprising at least one compound as described herein in an amount sufficient to provide therapeutic and\/or prophylactic benefit (for example, an improved clinical outcome, such as more frequent complete or partial remissions, or longer disease-free and\/or overall survival, or a lessening of symptom severity or other benefit as described in detail above).","The pharmaceutical compositions described herein that comprise at least one of the triazolothienopyrimidine compounds described herein may be administered to a subject in need by any one of several routes that effectively deliver an effective amount of the compound.

Materials and methods are also described in Example 13, which provide certain experimental details for methods and techniques described in Examples 14 and 15.","Collection of Mouse and Human Blood","Whole blood was collected from 8-12 week-old (25-35 g) wild-type or UT-B-null mice (see, e.g., Yang et al., ., supra (2002)) or AQP1-null mice (see, e.g., Ma et al., 273:4296-99 (1998)) in a CD1 genetic background by orbital puncture following subcutaneous injection of sodium heparin. Procedures were approved by the UCSF Committee on Animal Research. Human venous blood was collected into heparinized tubes, stored at 4\u00b0 C., and used within 48 h.","Stopped-Flow Measurement of Erythrocyte Urea and Osmotic Water Permeabilities","Erythrocyte urea and water permeabilities were measured by stopped-flow light scattering using a Hi-Tech Sf-51 instrument (Wiltshire, UK). For measurement of urea permeability, dilutions of whole blood (mouse or human) in PBS (hematocrit \u02dc0.5%) were incubated with test compounds for 5 min and then subjected to a 100-mM inwardly directed urea gradient. After an initial osmotic shrinking phase, the kinetics of increasing cell volume caused by urea influx was measured as the time-course of 90\u00b0 scattered light intensity at 530 nm, with increasing cell volume producing reduced scattered light intensity. Urea permeability and percentage inhibition were computed as described (see, e.g., Levin et al., . supra, 2007)). In some experiments, different urea gradients (25-200 mM) were used, or inhibitor was added only to the erythrocyte-containing or urea-containing solutions. In some experiments an outwardly directed urea gradient was used in which erythrocytes were incubated for 30 min with PBS containing specified urea and mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with PBS. In reversibility experiments, erythrocytes were incubated for 30 min with inhibitor, washed three times to remove inhibitor, and urea transport assayed. Osmotic water permeability was measured using a 100 mM gradient of sucrose.","UTB-14 Influx Kinetics in Erythrocytes","UTB-14 (2 \u03bcM) was added to 2% suspension of erythrocytes in PBS. At specified times 600-\u03bcL aliquots were removed and layered over 350 \u03bcL of silicone oil (density 1.05 g\/mL) overlying 100 \u03bcL of 0.55 M sucrose in PBS (density 1.075 g\/mL). Samples were spun for 30 s at 12,000 rpm to rapidly separate cells from supernatant. UTB-14 was assayed in the cell pellet by liquid chromatography\/mass spectrometry following ethyl acetate extraction as described herein.","One hundred thousand chemically diverse small molecules were screened in order to identify potent and selective inhibitors of UT-B that were suitable for efficacy studies in mice. Screening was performed using mouse erythrocytes, which strongly express UT-B and are highly water permeable because the cells also express aquaporin-1 (AQP1) water channels. The screening method involved assay of erythrocyte lysis in response to a large, outwardly directed gradient of acetamide, a urea analog that is transported efficiently by UT-B. A large, outwardly directed gradient of acetamide causes transient cell swelling, but little cell lysis, because UT-B-facilitated acetamide efflux limits water influx (see ). UT-B inhibition prevents acetamide efflux, allowing unopposed cell swelling and consequent cell lysis, which was recorded by reduced near-infrared light absorption at 710 nm. Acetamide, rather than urea or other urea analogs, was selected because its efflux occurs over a comparable time as osmotic equilibration in mouse erythrocytes, which increases assay sensitivity. The acetamide loading concentration to best resolve UT-B inhibition was determined empirically as 1.25 M, giving a Z\u2032-factor for UT-B inhibitor screening of >0.6. Screening was done at a 25 \u03bcM concentration of test compounds based on initial studies showing a low percentage of active compounds.","Screening was carried out using a Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, Calif.) integrated system equipped with liquid handling robot (Biomek FX) and plate readers (FLUOstar Optima; BMG; Durham, N.C.), as described (see, e.g., Ma et al., 277:37235-41 (2002)). Primary screening was done using a collection of 100,000 diverse, drug-like compounds from commercial sources (ChemDiv, San Diego, Calif.; Asinex, Winston-Salem, N.C.). For assay of UT-B inhibition, whole blood was diluted to a hematocrit of approximately 1% in PBS containing 1.25 M acetamide and 5 mM glucose. 100 \u03bcL of the erythrocyte suspension was added to each well of a 96-well round-bottom microplate to which test compounds were added (1 \u03bcL, 25 \u03bcM compound concentration, 1% final DMSO). After 10 min incubation, 20 \u03bcL of the erythrocyte suspension was added rapidly to each well of a 96-well black-walled plate (Costar, Corning, N.Y.) containing 180 \u03bcL isosmolar buffer (PBS containing 1% DMSO). Vigorous mixing was achieved by repeated pipetting. Erythrocyte lysis was quantified by absorbance at 710 nm wavelength, made within 5 min after hypo-osmolar shock.

A related benzenesulfonanilide (UTB-201) was identified in a prior screen of 50,000 compounds (unrelated to the 100,000 compounds screened as described herein) for inhibitors of human UT-B (see, e.g., Levin et al., . supra, 2007)). Screening of \u02dc900 commercially available analogs of the three chemical classes revealed triazlothienopyrimidines with nanomolar potency for inhibition of UT-B. One compound, UTB-14, was selected for further in vitro and in vivo characterization because of its low nanomolar potency for inhibition of mouse and human UT-B, and its high UT-B vs. UT-A selectivity.","UTB-14 (also called compound 1 herein) was synthesized as a highly pure (>99% by HPLC) crystalline powder according to a synthesis scheme illustrated in  and described in greater detail below. The synthesis involved reaction of 3-bromothiophene-2-carbaldehyde 11a with sodium azide in DMSO to generate an azidothiophene carbaldehyde (Gronowitz et al., 29:224-32 (1975)), which was oxidized using the Lindgren reaction (see, e.g., Lindgren et al., 27:888-90 (1973)) to generate 3-azidothiophene-2-carboxylic acid 13a Steglich esterification (Neises et al., 17:522-24 (1978)) gave the azido ester intermediate 14a. Arylsulfonylacetonitrile intermediate 6m, was generated by alkylation of 4-ethylbenzenethiol with bromoacetonitrile followed by oxidation with mCPBA. Lactam 15m was then synthesized by base-mediated [2+3] cycloaddition of 14a and 6m, and converted to UTB-14 using the PyBOP coupling reagent in the presence of thiophene-2-methylamine (see, e.g., Wan et al., 8:2425-28 (2006)) by microwave irradiation.","3-Bromothiophene-2-carbaldehyde (1) (2000 mg, 10.47 mmol) was treated with sodium azide (1994 mg, 30.7 mmol) in DMSO (27 ml). The reaction was heated to 65\u00b0 C. for 48 h in a sealed 40 mL vial. The reaction mixture was then taken up into HO (35 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (3\u00d720 mL).

Rapid mixing of an erythrocyte suspension with an equal volume of a hyperosmolar, urea-containing solution to give a 100 mM inwardly directly urea gradient produced rapid cell shrinking due to osmotic water efflux, followed by cell swelling as a consequence of urea (and water) influx.  shows light scattering kinetics at different UTB-14 concentrations, which was present in both the erythrocyte- and urea-containing solutions. Increasing UTB-14 concentration greatly slowed the kinetics of erythrocyte swelling. UTB-14 at 1 \u03bcM produced near 100% inhibition, as evidenced by the comparable swelling kinetics to that measured in erythrocytes from UT-B knockout mice (lower curves). UTB-14 did not inhibit urea transport in UT-B null erythrocytes, which is mediated by transport across the lipid bilayer by a solubility-diffusion mechanism. Concentration-inhibition data gave an ICof 25.1 nM for mouse UT-B and 10.3 nM for human UT-B (see ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0269","num":"0388"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"sub":["inh","inh","inh","inh","inh","inh","inh","inh","inh"]},"To investigate whether UTB-14 competes with urea at a common binding site on the UT-B transporter, UTB-14 inhibition efficacy was measured as a function of urea gradient.

To study transport inhibition symmetry, urea efflux was induced by pre-loading erythrocytes with 100 mM urea, which were then mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with urea-free PBS.  shows slowed kinetics of urea efflux with increasing UTB-14 concentration, with ICof 26.7 nM, similar to that of 25.1 for UTB-14 inhibition urea influx as shown in .","A homology model of human UT-B was generated using the SWISS MODEL online utility (see Internet web site: swissmodel.expasy.org) in automated mode, using the sequence of the full human UT-B1 protein (see, e.g., GenBank Accession No. CAB60834). Residues 43 to 378 were modeled, based a urea transporter from (PDB code 3M6E) (see, e.g., Levin et al., , supra (2009)). UTB-14 was drawn in ChemDraw (Cambridge Software, Cambridge, Mass.), converted to a SMILES strings, transformed to a 3D conformation, and minimized using PIPELINE PILOT (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.). The single conformation was passed through MOLCHARGE (OpenEyes, Santa Fe, N. Mex.) to apply AM1BCC charges, and through OMEGA (OpenEyes) to generate a multi-conformational library for UTB-14. The UT-B protein was prepared for docking using the FRED-RECEPTOR (OpenEyes) utility, employing the homology model of human UT-B. The receptor site was generated using a 12 cubic \u212b box. Docking was performed using FRED (v2.2.5) (OpenEyes), which was configured to employ consensus scoring functions ChemGauss3, OEChemScore, ScreenScore, PLP, and ZapBind. Docking of the inhibitor was carried out free of pharmacophore restraint. Each final pose was minimized by FRED by molecular dynamics using the MMFF94 force field within the active site. The final protein-ligand complex was visualized using PYMOL (Schr\u00f6dinger, San Diego, Calif.).","The putative site of UTB-14 binding to the UT-B protein was determined by docking computations following homology modeling of the human UT-B structure based on crystal structure data for a bacterial urea transporter homolog as shown in  (see, e.g., Levin, , supra). The predicted UTB-14 binding site was in a centrally located groove in the channel used for urea transport (see ). This location is consistent with the data above (see Example 4) showing urea competition and an intracellular site of action of UTB-14.  summarizes the key interactions predicted by the model. Most of the interactions involve hydrophobic and neutral-polar amino acids in the binding pocket: Leu-121, Leu-364, Phe-71, Thr-368, Leu-116, Asn-165, Ser-169 and Ser-365.","UT-B selectivity and cytotoxicity were studied. Because of sequence similarities between UT-B and UT-A isoforms, UT-A inhibition was measured. Transepithelial urea transport was measured in MDCK cells stably expressing UT-A1, UT-A3, and UT-B. UT-A1 and UT-A3 are cAMP-regulated urea transporters expressed in kidney tubule epithelia (see, e.g., Frohlich et al., 291:C600-606 (2006); Tickle et al., 0.297: R323-329 (2009); Stewart et al., 292:F1157-63 (2006)).

However, UTB-14 inhibited water transport significantly in AQP1-null erythrocytes (, right), supporting a prior conclusion that erythrocyte water transport is mediated, in part, by UT-B (see, e.g., Levin et al. , supra; Meng et al., 52:474-78 (2009)).  shows no significant inhibition of CFTR or TMEM16A chloride conductance by 10 \u03bcM UTB-14, as measured by short-circuit current. Last, by MTT assay, incubation of MDCK cells with UTB-14 up to 10 \u03bcM for 24 h (where it remains soluble) showed no cytotoxicity ().","Chloride Conductance and Cytotoxicity.","CFTR chloride conductance was measured by short-circuit current analysis in Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cells stably expressing CFTR, as described (see, e.g., Ma et al., . (2002), supra). CFTR chloride conductance was stimulated by forskolin and inhibited by a thiazolidinone compound that inhibits CFTR (CFTR-172). TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride conductance was measured by short-circuit current analysis in FRT cells stably expressing TMEM16A, as described (see, e.g., Namkung et al., 286:2365-2374, 2011. TMEM16A was stimulated by ATP and inhibited by tannic acid (100 \u03bcM).

Male mice (wild type or UT-B knockout) in a CD1 genetic background (age 8-10 weeks, 25-35 g) were administered 300 \u03bcL of the UTB-14 formulation or formulation alone by intraperitoneal injection. Urine samples were collected by placing mice on a wire mesh platform in a clean glass beaker during food and water deprivation. dDAVP ([1-deamino-8-D-arginine]-vasopressin, 1 \u03bcg\/kg) was given 1 h after UTB-14. In some studies, mice were placed on low, normal or low-protein diets (4%, 20% or 40% casein, Harlan Labs.) for 1 week prior study of dDAVP effects. Urine osmolality was measured in water-diluted urine samples by freezing-point osmometry (Micro-osmometer; Precision Systems, Natick, Mass.). Urea concentration was determined by a colorimetric enzymatic assay as described above. Measurements were also done in the absence of dDAVP in which urine was collected during free access to food and water.","To investigate the efficacy of UTB-14 in reducing maximum urinary concentration in mice in vivo, a formulation to deliver UTB-14 was established that gave predicted therapeutic concentration of UTB-14 in mouse kidneys for several hours following a single administration. Several vehicles and administration routes were tested; intraperitoneal administration of UTB-14 in 5% DMSO, 2.5% Tween-80 and 2.5% PEG-400 gave target UTB-14 concentration in kidneys and urine.","Liquid Chromatography\/Mass Spectrometry.","A quantitative LC\/MS assay was developed to measure [UTB-14] in kidney homogenates in which UTB-14 was extracted in an organic phase, concentrated, separated by reverse-phase HPLC, and detected by gated electrospray mass spectrometry.

Twelve compounds had IC<500 nM, with ICof 22 nM for UTBi-14.  shows concentration-inhibition data for selected inhibitors. The data fitted well to a single-site inhibition model with near 100% inhibition at high concentration. Table 1 provides ICand metabolic stability data for 75 compounds (2aa-2cw).","SAR analysis indicated greatest potency for thiophene-2-methylamine at the Rgroup. Replacing the heteroaryl sulfur atom by oxygen (thiophene\u2192furan) increased ICapproximately 10 fold from 22 to 239 nM (compare UTB-14 and 2 bp, Table 1). Bulky Rgroups constrained cyclic rings such as morpholine (2bq, IC5.6 mM) and piperidine (IC>25 mM, not shown) greatly reduced activity. The reduced activity with inclusion of a bulky group is consistent with our previous docking model of UTB-14 to a homology model of UT-B (described above) showing a sterically tight fit near the amidine linkage. Analogs containing a flexible chain with a terminal ether group (2cb, IC212 nM) showed moderate potency. At R, only compounds with alkyl- and halide-substituted aryl sulfonyl ring were available. 4-Methylphenyl and 2,5-dimethylphenyl reduced inhibition potency, whereas 3,4-dimethyl, 4-isopropyl and 4-ethyl increased potency (compare 2 bp and 2cs). Halide-substitution also reduced potency (2bi). Having a two or three carbon hydrophobic group at the meta- and para-position of the aryl ring might increase potency due to a tighter binding into hydrophobic binding pocket of UT-B.  summarizes the major findings of SAR analysis of commercially available analogues of UTB-14.","In vitro analysis of metabolic stability was done using LC\/ESI-MS following compound incubation with hepatic microsomes in the presence of NADPH.  shows kinetics of the microsomal degradation of selected compounds. UTB-14 showed rapid degradation with tapproximately 2.8 min, with appearance of metabolic products at 16 AMU (1\u00d7 oxygen) or 32 (2\u00d7 oxygen) as determined (). As observed by the relative growth of the peaks at m\/z=472 versus 488, the first oxidation event appears to be more rapid than the second. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, UTB-14 may undergo rapid hydroxylation at either the benzylic (see, e.g., Khojasteh-Bakht et al., 2003, 33:1201-1210) or thiophene-2-methylamine linking carbons, positions that are thought to stabilize radical intermediates (). Metabolic stability was measured of several analogues of UTB-14 (Table 1). Analogues with Rsubstituted with para-chlorophenyl showed greater stability (2bg-2bi), likely because of absence of the benzylic hydroxylation site, and also due to occupation of the para position, which is a known site in P450 metabolism (see, e.g., Baldwin et al., 1999, 48:424-32). Analogs with Rbearing electron-rich benzylamine (2ad, 2aj, 2bc, 2bt) also showed improved metabolic stability; however, these analogs have poorer UT-B inhibition potency when compared to UTB-14.","SAR of commercial analogs of UTB-14 indicated thiophene-2-methylamine as the optimal Rsubstituent for inhibition potency. The optimal Rsubstituent was not identified. A library of focused analogs was prepared to identify aspects of the SAR that were missing from the commercially available inhibitor set (Table 1), with the aim of maintaining or improving UT-B inhibition potency and improving metabolic stability. Most of the synthesized compounds were designed to maintain the Rsubstituent as thiophene-2-methylamine, while investigating a small number of alkyl (3a, 3c), alkoxy (3d, 3f), halo (3h, 3i), and heteroaryl (3g) substituents at R(see Table 2). A small number of additional inhibitors with variation of R(substitutions for thiophene-2-methylamine) was also explored (3b, 3e, and 3j) to confirm the importance of this heterocycle. One novel compound (3k), the 1,1-difluoroethyl analog of UTB-14, was synthesized to be bioisosteric with ethyl but lacking the benzylic hydrogens that are likely involved in the poor metabolic stability of UTB-14.","The general synthetic approach begins with the synthesis of aryl sulfonyl acetonitrile building blocks (General Scheme 1 described herein). More specifically, as shown in Scheme 1a, commercially available substituted arylthiols (4a-4g) were alkylated with bromoacetonitrile to generate the corresponding sulfides (5a-5g), which were then oxidized with mCPBA to give the desired aryl sulfonyl acetonitriles 6a-6g. An additional variation of this building block (4-difluoroethylphenyl) was prepared by a multi-step approach (General Scheme 2 and Scheme 2a described herein) due to unavailability of the precursor benzenethiol. As such, 1-bromo-4-(1,1-difluoroethyl)benzene (7) was transformed under Pd-catalyzed conditions with the Xanthphos ligand, analogous to the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction, to generate sulfide ester 7. This was oxidized to sulfone 9, converted to primary amide 10, and dehydrated using phosphorous pentoxide to the desired 4-difluoroethyl aryl sulfone acetonitrile (6 or 6h).","The second key synthetic precursor is a 3-azidothiophene ester (General Scheme 3 and Scheme 3a). 3-Bromothiophene-2-carboxaldehyde (11a) was azidated by nucleophilic aromatic substitution to generate 3-azidothiophene 12a. This aldehyde was oxidized with the Lindgren reaction (see, e.g., Lindgren et al., 27:888 (1973)) to generate carboxylic acid 13a, which was alkylated with isobutyl bromide to 2-azidothiophene-1-isobutyl ester (14a). (Note that the reactants and intermediates in Scheme 3 are also described in  for the synthesis of UT-14. No difference in these reactants and intermediates is intended by differences in numbering of same. For example, reactant 1 in  is the same as reactant 11 in Scheme 3.) The attachment of the building blocks is illustrated in Scheme 4 described herein. The aryl sulfonyl acetonitriles 6a-6h were reacted with base to form the nitrile enolates, and coupled with the azidothiophene ester 14a, followed by in situ lactamation to generate the core heterocycles (15a-15h). The conversion of this intermediate to the final library of amidine-containing compounds (3a-3k) was affected with PyBOP with microwave irradiation. The use of PyBOP with microwave irradiation was based on conditions using the related reagent BOP without heating (see, e.g., Wan et al., 8:2425-28 (2006): Wan et al., 72:10194-210 (2007)); however, the low-temperature conditions were not successful with triazolothienopyrimidines for BOP or PyBOP. With microwave-assistance, PyBOP readily caused quantitative conversion to the desired amidine products, and was chosen over BOP due to its carcinogenic byproduct hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA).","The experimental detail for biological assays used for characterizing compounds shown in Tables 1 and 2 is provided below.","Blood Collection.","Whole blood was collected from 8-12 week-old (25-35 g) wild-type mice in a CD1 genetic background by orbital puncture following subcutaneous injection of sodium heparin.

Reverse-phase HPLC separations were carried out using a Waters C18 column (2.1\u00d7100 mm, 3.5 mm particle size) equipped with a solvent delivery system (Waters model 2690, Milford, Mass.). The solvent system consisted of a linear gradient from 5 to 95% acetonitrile run over 16 min (0.2 mL\/min flow rate).","Mouse Studies.","Compound 3k (described herein) was formulated in 5% DMSO, 2.5% Tween-80 and 2.5% PEG400 in HO, as described above in Example 7. Mice (age 8-10 weeks, 25-35 g) were administered 300 \u03bcL of formulation (without or with 3k) by intraperitoneal injection. Urine, blood and kidney samples were collected and processed (see Example 7). dDAVP ([1-deamino-8-D-arginine]-vasopressin, 1 \u03bcg\/kg) was given 1 h after formulation. Urine osmolality was measured in water-diluted urine samples by freezing-point osmometry. Kidneys were homogenized in acetic acid (100 \u03bcL per 1 g tissue) and ethyl acetate (10 mL per 1 g tissue). The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 min. Calibration standards were prepared in kidney homogenates from untreated mice to which was added known amounts of 3k. The ethyl acetate-containing supernatant was dried under nitrogen and the residue dissolved in acetonitrile:HO (3:1) containing 0.1% formic acid. HPLC was done on a XTERRA MS C18 column (2.1\u00d7100 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm particle size; Waters, Milford, Mass.) connected to a solvent delivery system (model 2690; Waters). The solvent system consisted of a linear gradient from 5% to 95% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid over 16 min (0.2 mL\/min flow). 3k was detected by absorbance at 262 nm. Mass spectra were acquired on a mass spectrometer (Alliance HT 2790+ZQ; Waters) using positive ion detection. For analysis of blood and urine, fluids were diluted with equal volume of water and extracted with ethyl acetate.","The ICand in vitro metabolic stability of synthesized analogs were determined (Table 2). In general, analogs lacking stabilized benzylic carbon for hydroxylation showed improved metabolic stability (3c, 3d, 3i). The compound 3k showed both excellent inhibition potency and metabolic stability, and was further characterized. UT-B inhibition by 3k was measured by stopped-flow light scattering, which provides a definitive measure of compound potency. The assay measures the kinetics of cell volume following rapid mixing of an erythrocyte suspension with a urea-containing solution.  shows representative light scattering data for inhibition of UT-B urea transport in mouse erythrocytes. Each curve consists of a rapid upward phase, representing osmotic cell shrinkage, followed by a slower downward phase, representing urea (and water) influx. The kinetics of the downward phase was greatly slowed by 3k in a concentration-dependent manner.  summarizes concentration-inhibition data for mouse and human UT-B. Deduced ICwere 23 and 15 nM, respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0341","num":"0460"},"figref":"FIG. 10C","sub":["1\/2 ","1\/2 ","inh ","inh "]},"The pharmacokinetics and renal accumulation of compound 3k was measured in mice following intraperitoneal bolus administration of 400 \u03bcg 3k in a suitable formulation chosen for efficient dissolution and absorption. Blood, urine, and kidney tissues were obtained at different times, and 3k was assayed by LC\/MS after organic extraction, comparing with appropriate standards.  shows the LC\/MS calibration for blood measurements (left), and the kinetics of 3k concentration (right);  shows the kinetics of 3k concentration in kidney and urine. These data show high concentrations (<1 \u03bcM) of 3k for many hours, well above its ICapproximately 25 nM for inhibition of UT-B urea transport. In a separate comparative study, mice received 200 \u03bcg of 3k and UTB14 at the same time by intraperitoneal injection. At 6 h, 3k concentration was approximately 3-fold greater than UTB14 in blood ().","The urearetic activity of 3k was assayed by measurement of urine osmolality in mice under maximal antidiuretic stimulation by the vasopressin analog dDAVP. dDAVP was administrated 1 h after intraperitoneal injection of formulation without or with 3k.  shows that dDAVP increased urine osmolality to >3 Osm\/kg HO in control (formulation alone) mice, which was reduced by approximately 0.5 Osm\/kg HO in mice receiving 3k. This reduction in urine osmolality is similar to that produced by UT-B gene knockout (see, e.g., Yang et al., 277:10633-137 (2002)).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0344","num":"0463"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"315pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
