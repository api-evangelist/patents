{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Technical Field","This invention relates to a communication device and to a communication method. The device and method derive relevant context information for intelligent sentence selection, using location and other qualifiers.","2. Description of Related Art","Communication is everywhere, for example, \u201cI would like a hamburger please,\u201d or \u201cI would like a single ticket to London please.\u201d The use of such simple phrases is taken for granted by most people most of the time, as it forms an essential part of our lives. However, for some people, simple communication does not come so easily. One reason for such problems in simple communication is disability, being deaf, blind or mute, each of which can be a major barrier to easy communication and in combination can make everyday situations very challenging. Another reason that communication can be difficult is simply a language barrier, which occurs when attempting to communicate with someone who does not speak your language.","Two known solutions to these problems exist. Firstly, an individual who has difficulty communicating through disability or language problems can get someone who is fluent in the desired language to act as a middleman. This solution has a number of problems, notably, that such an intermediary is not always available, it is inconvenient, sometimes awkward, and can be annoying and\/or embarrassing for all of the parties involved in such an exchange.","A second solution is the use of a voice synthesizer. A synthesizer allows a user to type in a language component as desired, and the synthesizer will then output, in audio, the typed language component. This solution also has problems, because it requires a perfect knowledge of the desired language, and the use of a synthesizer requires the time and effort in typing the language component, which can be, again, annoying and\/or embarrassing for both parties. This also does nothing to address communication back in the other direction.","It is therefore an object of the invention to improve upon the known art.","According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a communication device comprising processing means and storage means for storing a database of language components, wherein the processing means is arranged to determine at least one qualifier, to access the database, and to select at least one language component according to the or each determined qualifier.","According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for execution by a communication device, the method comprising the steps of determining at least one qualifier, accessing a database of language components, and selecting at least one language component according to the or each determined qualifier.","According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a computer program product on a computer readable medium comprising instructions for determining at least one qualifier, accessing a database of language components, and for selecting at least one language component according to the or each determined qualifier.","Owing to the invention, it is possible to provide a device that will automatically provide a user with a selection of language components (usually sentences) that are appropriate to the context in which the user is placed. No input is required from the user. This invention provides solutions with a common foundation to address situations covering a broad range of people in this world of globalization, including workers from abroad, tourists, the deaf and hard of hearing, and people with speech difficulty.","An embodiments of the present invention provides a method and system for generating a list of context-relevant sentences based on available qualifiers, information, and user preferences. By intelligently producing a targeted list of \u2018context relevant\u2019 choices, the system provides the user with an instant method of selecting sentences that are appropriate to their current situation. Where necessary a similar set of context relevant responses that the other party can select can also be provided.","Preferably the device is provided with display means, the display means being arranged to display at least one selected language component. The user can see the selected language components and can review them and choose one to speak. The output of the communication device need not be displayed directly by the device, but may be transferred for use by another device that a user has access to, such as a mobile phone, or a Braille device that can represent the list of selected language components.","Advantageously, the device further comprises location determining means, the processing means being arranged to define a qualifier according to the output of the location determining means. By determining the location of the communication device, and thereby the user, a qualifier can be constructed for filtering the language components that will provide a very good chance of matching the selected components to the environment and situation that the user is presently experiencing.","Similarly, the communication device preferably further comprises a clock, the processing means being arranged to define a qualifier according to the output of the clock. The determination of a qualifier according to the present time will increase the likelihood of selecting one or more language components that the user will wish to use.","Ideally, the device further comprises audio output means, the audio output means arranged to output an audio signal corresponding to a language component, in response to a user input at user interface means. If the device is equipped with an audio capability, then the user, via the user interface, which may be a keypad or touch screen, can select one of the language components that are displayed, and this can be outputted as an audio signal.","Advantageously, the communication device further comprises wireless transmitting means, the wireless transmitting means arranged to output a wireless signal corresponding to a language component, in response to a user input at the user interface means. The wireless functionality of the device supports the device bypassing any need for the user to interact with another person. For example, the device could be used in an environment where a signal sent via a short range wireless communication link can be received and understood by another device. This might be used for ordering in a restaurant or buying a travel ticket or the like.","Preferably, the processing means is further arranged, when selecting a plurality of language components, to order the language components according to at least one predetermined parameter. The ordering of the language components assists the user to make their choice from all of the displayed language components. The ordering may be according to most used components, or most used components at a particular location or any such similar ordering that will present the user with the components that they are most likely to want to use at that particular time, with the most likely presented first in a suitably short list of, for example, five possible language components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","22","24","26","28"]},"The purpose of the device  is to assist a user in communicating, when they are in a situation where communication is difficult. As discussed above, this could be because the user has traveled to a country where they are not familiar with the spoken language of that country, or could be because the user has a disability that makes communication in some situations difficult. The device  will provide the user, via the display means , with a selection of language components that the device believes are relevant to the present environment in which the user is placed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","20","22","36"]},"The device  can provide the user with a list of suitable language components  on demand, or can be continually providing a changing list of sentences that the user can look at, as and when they feel that they need assistance. The processor  has to filter the very long list of language components  down to a small number of suitable components appropriate to the user's context, which may be indoors at a restaurant or retail outlet, or outdoors at a transport terminus such as a railway station or bus stop.","In order to create the list of components  (which may comprise only a single selected component) the processing means  is arranged to determine at least one qualifier . The qualifier(s)  is\/are used to subsequently filter the database  of language components . The location determining means , shown in  as a GPS (Global Positioning System) unit, can identify accurately the location of the user, and the processing means  is arranged to define a qualifier  according to the output of the location determining means . Likewise, the clock  can be used by the processing means  to define a qualifier  according to the output of the clock .","In , the outputs of the various sensing devices are summarised by the inputs , which provide varied and detailed information to the processor , for the processor  to define the various qualifiers . The qualifiers  need not be especially complicated. For example, the processor , from the output of the GPS unit  may define the location qualifier as \u201cA\u201d for food outlet, with \u201cA1\u201d being fast food restaurant, \u201cA2\u201d being sandwich shop etc. \u201cB\u201d could be retail outlet, \u201cB1\u201d being clothes shop and \u201cC\u201d could be transport terminus etc.","Once the processor  has defined one or more qualifiers , the processor  is arranged to access the database , and to select at least one language component  according to the determined qualifier(s) . The language components  are organised within the database  with associated data that defines the possible contexts in which the corresponding component may be used. For example, the language component \u201cI would like a ham sandwich please.\u201d would have the data \u201cA2\u201d attached in respect of location.","The processor  will filter the database , in a preferred embodiment, using all of the qualifiers  that are available, as this will produce the shortest list of possible language components . However, other qualifier strategies are possible, for example using a single qualifier  such as location, or having an adaptive determination of qualifiers according to a user profile stored by the device .","Following selection of the language components  that the processor  has determined are most likely to be relevant to a user, then the display means  is arranged to display each selected language component , or just the single selected component  if there is only one returned by the processor .","The processing means  is further arranged, advantageously, when selecting the plurality of language components  for display, to order the language components . The ordering is according to at least one predetermined parameter. The ordering may be based upon prior selection by a user, or a user profile, or the device  may itself decide which is the most likely sentence for the user to wish to use based upon the comparison of the qualifiers  with the data associated with the selected components .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["10","40","24","42","34","44","22","36","46","32","48","32"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["10","24","20","34","32","10","10","14","32"]},"The audio output means  can output an audio signal corresponding to the specific language component  chosen by the user, in response to the user input at the user interface means . Alternatively, or in addition, the wireless transmitting means  can output a wireless signal corresponding to the chosen language component  in response to the user input at the user interface means . When the wireless capability is used, the user choice may correspond to an order for food (in this context), and the chosen sentence will be transmitted to a till  provided by the fast food establishment as the appropriate food order. This facilitates the communication from the user.","The storing of the language components  in the database  can be organised in terms of \u2018zones\u2019 where a zone can be a location or a set of related locations. For example, a user can step onto a bus, faced with the bus driver. The device , with its GPS device , can locate the user at a bus stop in Westminster. The device  accesses the bus stop zone and narrows the list of relevant language components  down to bus-related generic ones: \u201cDoes this bus goes to {x}?\u201d and \u201cA single to {y} please,\u201d. The device  generates the list using place names around Westminster, for example \u201cDoes this bus goes to Hammersmith?\u201d. The user is able to select the sentence using the user interface  on the device . The device  asks the bus driver in perfect spoken English for a ticket.","The database  can be divided into \u2018zones\u2019 (tables), each zone is for a relevant place and inside it are relevant qualifiers and possible sentences that are appropriate to that zone. New zones can be added easily by users through manual input or application of provided table updates. A set of zones could include such things as; TAXI_RANK, RESTAURANT, TRAIN_STATION, BUS_STOP, SUPER_MARKET. A zone may have many possibly language components. Each component (sentence) includes a link to a location, based upon association, which effects the positioning in any list of components provided to a user. This association can be learned over time, based on where a component is used. The frequency of use raises the level of association with the location in which it is used.","The list of relevant sentences can be narrowed further, for example, by the device  identifying that the user is standing on the side of the road that heads into, not away from, Hammersmith, and narrows the list of relevant sentences to only places in Hammersmith. Equally the device , via the wireless interface, can contact and download from an external provider either a list of relevant sentences from the provider, or the necessary information and generates relevant sentences.","Any external provider can send a list of any required qualifiers, which the device  gathers and sends back to the provider, the provider can then calculate the list of relevant sentences using the qualifiers, and send them back to the device . For example, the bus company provider can send a list of required qualifiers (for example, location, time, direction) which the device  returns and, then, with the qualifiers, the bus company provider looks up the timetable in real time and returns relevant sentences.","This can be extended further. The device  can send, alongside with qualifier data, the sets of qualifiers that the device  wants back from the external provider. For example, as above, but the device  tells the provider that it wants just the location qualifier, which is the places to which the bus goes. The provider looks up the timetable, gathers all the place names, and then sends them back. The device  then produces sentences of its own. Alternatively the device  could ask for times as well as places, in order to produce sentences like \u201cWill we arrive in Hammersmith at 10.34 pm?\u201d where 10.34 pm is gathered from the timetables.","In other situations, the device  can interface with data drawn from third parties in other ways. For example, when a user walks into a take away establishment, the GPS component  compares the location with a map provided by an independent party (for example by accessing data on a yellow pages style website), and learns that the user is in a fast food restaurant. Consequently the device  looks up for relevant sentences relating to a fast food restaurant and other qualifiers (for example, summer means ice cream). \u201cA fast food restaurant\u201d is a generic zone, but for specific brands and large companies they can be defined as separate zones. The database  can have information about specific branded products, and accordingly generate sentences that are brand specific to assist the user.","The database  can be provided by an independent party, such as a public body such as a council, or provided through the Internet by a user community, where algorithms, rules, and information can be downloaded as packs. The database  can also be provided by the commercial organisations. This has the advantage that the chain is made accessible to those who are unable to speak English, and therefore address the problems of non-native language speakers.","The wireless capability of the device  can also be utilised locally to receive information from service providers. For example, a user walks into a restaurant, one of a big chain, and this restaurant provides data through a wireless access point. My device  is told it is inside a specific brand of restaurant and is uploaded with the menu, each menu item links to a suitable set of sentences that can be used to order that item. The user can show the screen  of the device  to the person behind the till who reads the order. Alternatively, the store provides a fast service till that takes orders directly from the device . The user walks up, having made a selection, and presses \u2018order\u2019 resulting in the order being communicated directly to the till.","The same technology can be used to provide information to a Braille device that can be used by the blind to easily find\/pick context relevant information such as menus\/special offers etc. The output from the device  can be either directly from the display  of the device , or can be passed to another device such as a Braille device, or a combination of these two outputs can be used.","The device  can also be used as a language learning tool; a personal teacher. This means that a student can go anywhere, and get a list of things they're likely to want to say or ask\u2014the device  gives the student a list of sentences they would normally use using the information the device  has stored, in a similar manner to the examples above.","These examples show that by using easily available context information about location and time of day, some intelligent choices can be processed to grant a significant improvement of independence to those that would otherwise struggle to communicate in every day situations.","This technology helps both those who a) do not know what to say (can't speak the native language, can't see the options) b) know what to say but can't say it, allowing them to quickly and efficiently get the message across either visually or audibly with the use of the device  in combination with technology like voice synthesizer and text display.","The processor  can operate the method of  in a wide variety of different ways. Below are described implementations of the working of the device  including pseudocode logic for the processing that would need to be executed to narrow the possibilities to a manageable and navigable set of options.","Algorithms","Algorithm A","1. Get qualifiers.","2. Run the qualifiers through a function, which returns a list of zones that are prioritized. For example: Specific brand->fast-food restaurant->restaurant->business property->building->town.","This produces a prioritized list representing aspects of standing outside a specific place, the top of the list are specific things to do with interacting inside the specific brand of restaurant. The context, however, maybe that it's just a recognizable landmark and the user is lost, such that \u2018building\u2019 would allow the device  to produce questions like \u201cwhere is <to select>?\u201d for when the user is presumably lost. Likewise for town, the device  can produce questions like \u201cwhere is <to select>?\u201d for a list of important places in the town when the user is in town, and when the user is in the countryside, the device  would be referring to landmark places in the countryside (like walk routes, picnic areas, nearest pub, and towns in the locality).","3. For each of the zones, starting with the highest prioritized one (the restaurant brand in the above example), run brand (qualifiers) where list of brand-related sentences would be generated using the qualifiers. Such a function can be as simple as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u2003sentences brand(qualifiers) {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003sentences = select all from database where zone=brand and"]},{"entry":[{},"qualifiers"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003return sentences"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003}"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The remaining qualifiers are passed for the purpose of narrowing down the sentences returned. For example, the database  would return nothing if the device  knows that the time is 4 am. Of course, the next zone can be tried for any relevant sentences, for example, down to building when you get language components such as \u201cwhere's the station?\u201d and so on being returned.","Algorithm B","Step 3 above is a \u201csimple\u201d system using the foundation as explained above. The same foundation can be used by advanced systems utilizing more intelligent algorithms like the following generic algorithm:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"if qualifers.time >= 3am and <= 4am AND zones.list( ).contains(office) {"},{"entry":"\u2003\/\/ being at the office at 4am would restrict\/cause additional"},{"entry":"scenarios to become likely so add them"},{"entry":"\u2003add to language component list:"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u201cWhere is the police?\u201d"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u201cWhere is the taxi zone?\u201d"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003etc."},{"entry":"}"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Algorithm C","The device  can produce \u201czones=branded establishment->fastfood restaurant . . . \u201d (a prioritised list) as one of the qualifiers, so removing the need for a separate function for each zone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"sentences getSentences(qualifiers) {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003sentences = select all from database where qualifiers"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003return sentences"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"This would also allow more advanced selecting, using two or more zones in the list\u2014for example, \u201ccar park-> . . . ->town\u201d and \u201ccar park-> . . . ->countryside\u201d where the \u201ctown\u201d and \u201ccountryside\u201d information would help the function dealing with \u201ccar park\u201d. The resultant query would produce a hierarchical list of options, that would start at the level of zones, allowing the user to select the one most relevant, then moving to a selection of actual sentences most applicable to that zone. This provides a two-step navigation to reach context relevant options.","The qualifiers  used by the processor  can be, amongst many others:","CURRENT_TIME","DATE\u2014on Saturdays, the user will most likely not want to go to work locations or offices as they would be closed. Similar considerations would apply on bank holidays, personal holiday and so on.","MOBILE_CELL_LOCATION\u2014fairly accurate location determination.","GPS_LOCATION\u2014very accurate determination of location.","KNOWN_PREFERNCES","SELECTION_HISTORY\u2014what the user did last and what the user did last time they were at a specific location or at this time.","FREQUENCE_OF_USE","CHARACTERISTICS\u2014the user is a vegetarian and therefore doesn't want meat options listed in a restaurant.","WHO_YOU'RE_WITH\u2014by using a short range wireless link such as Bluetooth or similar, the device  can identify a person accompanying the user, and thus narrow the list based upon activities undertaken with this person.","DIRECTION_OF_TRAVEL","LAST USE_for example, if a user has just used the device to give a taxi driver instructions, then it is likely that the next need will be to communicate payment.","The database  also contains a list of specific places, locations and the zone they apply to. These can be pre-programmed, downloaded or the user can program them manually. As an example of the latter possibility, if a user were, for example, standing at a local taxi rank, the user can select \u2018store location\u2019 following prompts. The user is able to give it a name, for example \u201cWestminster station taxi rank\u201d and define it as zone of the type \u2018TAXI_RANK\u2019 (selectable from a menu), and give it a time relevance of ANY. Utilizing GPS, or similar location technology, the device  stores the coordinates of this location.","Similarly, in a favourite restaurant the user can mark that location, attach to the location the zone \u2018RESTAURANT\u2019, and define a time relevance of 12 pm to 11 pm (it's opening hours) and KEY_TIMES of 12 pm to 2 pm and 7 pm to 10 pm (lunch and dinner). Other \u2018locations\u2019 can be added by third parties, such as the local council, or a business. For example, a user can enter a train station and via Bluetooth\/wireless scan for location information. Such information is available and the device  downloads the details for this location, and it's \u2018ZONE\u2019. The device  can also at the same time update the zone of TRAIN_STATION with any language components relevant to this location.","The language components  stored by the database  can also include associated information about the specific relevance of the component. Included in this information is a list of related selections that would naturally follow from the specific component. For example, the component \u201cPlease could you take me to Hammersmith\u201d in the TAXI_RANK table could link to the component \u201cHow much do I owe you?\u201d.","Selections can also have time relevance associated with them (for example between 9 am and 5 pm). Historical usage, such as a list of the times\/places that this selection has been used before can also be accumulated and stored for each and all components. This helps to build a profile over time to aid prioritization based on personal use. Likewise, the frequency of use to aid relative positioning with other selections under the same qualifiers can be monitored to improve performance of the selection of the language components by the processor  of the communication device ."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
