The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/321,914, filed Apr. 8, 2010. This application is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.","The invention relates to DC Bias evaluation, and more particularly, to a system and method for monitoring DC Bias in an AC coupled circuit via transient gain response.","In a digital signal processing circuit the later gain stages are typically alternating current (AC) coupled to maximize the signal dynamic range at the analog to digital converter (ADC). There are situations where the direct current (DC) signal level after the first gain stage needs to be evaluated. If that DC bias is allowed to reach the limits of the circuit (voltage rail) it will result in signal corruption and the AC response will not be valid. Typically gain transients are not useful since the circuit is settling from one quiescent state to another and need to be ignored. Using gain characteristics of the first gain stage allows a transition from high to low gain to generate a bias change (known transient behavior). This transition is seen as a step response to the AC circuit and the AC response can be evaluated to determine the bias present at the input to the AC coupled circuitry (verify no signal corruption).","What is needed, therefore, are techniques for determining that the input bias levels are not close to the voltage rails at the input to an AC coupled system to avoid signal corruption. Typical solutions involve the addition of monitoring circuitry that measures the DC bias directly. This requires additional circuitry and ADC inputs which are not cost effective in a product that is already in production or applications that have limited board area.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for the monitoring of direct current bias, the system comprising: switching an amplifier of known scale factor from low to high; monitoring a step change in bias generated by the gain change; measuring, the response to the bias change via appropriate peak detection logic; and determining the amount of bias present at an input based on AC response and the amplifier scale factor","Another embodiment of the present invention provides such method wherein the amplifier is a trans-impedance amplifier.","A further embodiment of the present invention provides such method wherein the amplifier has a scaling factor of 23\u00d7.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for detecting output bias levels of a sensor, the method comprising: receiving a output bias level from the sensor; amplifying the output of the sensor with an amplifier with high and low gain options with a known amplifier scale factor; switching the amplifier from a low gain state to a high gain state; monitoring an AC response to the change in DC level that results from the switching of the gain state; and computing a DC bias based on the AC response and the amplifier scale factor","Another embodiment of the present invention provides such method wherein the output bias level is from background noise in the environment.","A further embodiment of the present invention provides such method wherein the output bias level is from the sun in a field of view of the sensor","Still another embodiment of the present invention provides such method wherein the sensor comprises at least one avalanche photodiode.","A still further embodiment of the present invention provides such method wherein the amplifier comprises at least one trans-impedance amplifier.","Yet another embodiment of the present invention provides such method wherein the amplifier has a scaling factor of 23\u00d7.","A yet further embodiment of the present invention provides such method, further comprising where the AC signal exceeds a desired value, decreasing an operating voltage to a bandwidth value.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a system for the monitoring of sun in field of view of an avalanche photodiode unit, the system comprising: an avalanche photo diode receiving optical signals from an optical lens; an amplifier configured for operation at least a high gain and a low gain; peak detectors identifying the peaks in an AC signal generated by transition of the DC signal between high and low gain.","Another embodiment of the present invention provides such system wherein the amplifier is a variable gain amplifier.","A further embodiment of the present invention provides such system wherein the amplifier is a trans-impedance amplifier.","Still another embodiment of the present invention provides such system further comprising a second amplifier.","A still further embodiment of the present invention provides such system wherein the second amplifier is a variable gain amplifier.","The features and advantages described herein are not all-inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.","As illustrated in , a method for DC bias evaluation in an AC coupled circuit via transient gain response, configured according to one embodiment of the present invention, is provided. In such a method, avalanche photodiodes (APDs)  receive photonic energy  and generate an output current . The avalanche photo diode generates a DC current level  based on the amount of background energy received by the avalanche photodiode . A trans-impedance amplifier  is used to convert the DC current level  into a voltage level. The trans-impedance amplifier (TIA)  of one embodiment of the present invention had high and low gain options and a 23\u00d7 scale factor between the two settings. The TIA may then be transitioned from low to high gain via the appropriate control circuitry. The output from the TIA  is, in one embodiment may be further amplified with variable gain amplifiers  and converted from analog to digital by an analog to digital converter .","In one embodiment of the present invention the TIA gain stage was transitioned from a LOW to HIGH gain configuration to generate a DC bias shift with a known 23\u00d7 scale factor. This bias shift is viewed as a step response to the AC coupled circuitry and peak detection logic was used to find the maximum value from the resulting waveform. The magnitude of the waveform is directly related to the amount of DC bias voltage and can be used to avoid operating conditions (like Sun in FOV for APDs) that would damage performance. In some embodiments of the present invention, this involves determine a maximum level of DC bias at which the AC signals will not reach the voltage rail at the input to the AC coupled circuitry. Identification of a high bias level allows the first gain stage to be adjusted back to a level to avoid corruption and\/or the reporting of the error.","One embodiment of the present invention was implemented in an optical system to detect the presence of high background noise\/Sun in field of view. Avalanche photo-diodes (APDs)  received the photonic energy from lens optics  and generated an output current. The APD  generates a DC current level based on the amount of background energy received by the APD . The trans-impedance amplifier (TIA)  converted the current from the APD  into a voltage level. The TIA  had two gain options (High and Low) which had a 23\u00d7 scale factor. Transitioning the TIA  from low to high gain generates a step response as illustrated in . The gains of the later stages were then applied to the measured response to determine the amount of DC bias at the output of the TIA.\n\n","As illustrated in Table 1, a test was performed wherein a spot light was used to simulate the effect of sun in the field of view of the detector. Different DC bias levels were generated. Bias levels for 7 channels were reported, allowing for evaluation of the measurements provided by the system and systemic reaction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0034"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"12"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"12","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Mode","Flags","TIA","Gain","Bias1","Bias2","Bias3","Bias4","Bias5","Bias6","Bias7","Spot Light"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"12","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"12"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Night","0x20","High","204","447","250","291","810","66","308","216","Off"]},{"entry":["Day","0x00","High","76","3842","605","1130","942","1089","586","518","Dim, 4 feet"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"away"]},{"entry":["SFOV","0x10","Low","180","7940","1500","2574","2113","2465","1401","1288","Bright, 4"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"feet away"]},{"entry":["SFOV","0x10","Low","184","4588","862","1628","1257","1266","655","651","Dim, 3"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"feet away"]},{"entry":["SFOV","0x10","Low","188","4485","880","1530","1101","1158","653","693","Dim, 3.2"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"feet away"]},{"entry":["Partial","0X00","High","112","4345","764","1424","1094","1177","633","628","Dim, 3.4"]},{"entry":["SFOV",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"feet away"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"12","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"As illustrated in  a signal is received by the avalanche photodiode system .
