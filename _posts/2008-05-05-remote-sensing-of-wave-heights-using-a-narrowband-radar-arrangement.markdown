title: Remote sensing of wave heights using a narrowband radar arrangement
abstract: A narrowband radar arrangement having a radar transmitter and a radar receiver mounted above a targeted water surface to monitor and determine a sea state of the targeted water surface. Fixed frequency signals are transmitted by the transmitter and received by the receiver, via a direct path and via a forward scattered path off the targeted water surface. An interference pattern of interfering direct path signals and forward scattered signals is used to determine an instantaneous height of the water surface and also to determine the sea state of the targeted water surface.

No. 12\/152,124, filed on May 5, 2008, U.S. Pat. No. 7,808,426, hereby incorporated by reference, entitled \u201cRemote Sensing of Wave Heights Using a Broadband Radar Arrangement,\u201d by inventor Jerry Rosson Smith Jr.","The following description relates generally to a system and a method for detecting and monitoring a sea state, more particularly, a system and method for calculating an instantaneous water height and generating a surface water profile using a narrowband radar arrangement positioned above a targeted surface.","Surface conditions in open water are monitored for various oceanographic and maritime reasons. The ability to monitor surface conditions from remote locations is particularly advantageous. Various methods of measuring surface conditions such as wave heights and the like are currently available. In terms of remote analysis, most methods involve measuring the wind speed remotely or counting transient anomalies, such as sea spike statistics to estimate the sea state. It is desired to have an economical system that remotely and accurately measures wave heights and open water surface profiles. It is also desired to have a wave height and surface profile detecting system that is operable and provides accurate reading in different environmental conditions.","In one aspect, the invention is a method of remotely monitoring and determining a sea state. The method includes the positioning of a narrowband radar arrangement above a targeted water surface. In this aspect, the narrowband radar arrangement includes a transmitter and a receiver, wherein the transmitter and the receiver are spatially arranged with respect to each other, at extreme ends of the targeted water surface. The method includes the transmitting fixed frequency signals from the transmitter during a predetermined period. The method further includes the receiving of received signals at the receiver, during the predetermined period. In this aspect, the received signals are a combination of waves transmitted directly from the transmitter to the receiver and forward scattered signals reflected off the targeted water surface. The method further includes the mapping of an interference pattern tracking energy changes over the predetermined period, based on received signals. In this aspect, the method further includes the determining of an instantaneous surface water height of the targeted water surface based on the interference pattern.","In another aspect, the invention is a system for monitoring and determining a sea state. The system includes a narrowband radar arrangement above a targeted water surface in which the narrowband radar arrangement includes a transmitter for transmitting fixed frequency signals. The narrowband radar arrangement further includes a receiver for receiving received signals at the receiver. In this aspect, the received signals are a combination of signals transmitted directly from the transmitter, as well as forward scattered signals reflected from the targeted water surface. The transmitter and the receiver are spatially arranged with respect to each other at extreme ends of the targeted water surface. The system further includes a computer-readable medium bearing a program code for monitoring and determining a sea state.

The radio waves are received via a direct path  and also by a forward scattered path  off the water surface. The radar arrangement (, ) may be a system that operates in at a desired fixed frequency within the X-band frequency range. As stated above, the fixed frequency at which the signals are transmitted may be adjusted using a modulation device. In one embodiment, the transmitter  transmits narrowband signals at a fixed frequency between 8 GHz and 12 GHz. The distance R may be about 50 m to about 70 m, and the radar transmitter  may be positioned at a height Habove the water surface  of about 1 m to about 5.5 m above the targeted water surface , and the radar receiver  may be positioned at height Habove the water surface  of about 0.7 m to about 1.8 m. In another embodiment the distance R may be about 1 km to about 2 km. It should be noted that the distance R between the transmitter  and the receiver  may be any desired distance, provided that the direct path  is maintained. Thus R may several kilometers long, up to about 16 km. When R is about 16 km, the heights (H, H) of the transmitter  and receiver  would be in the order of about 7.5 m to about 30.5 m.","As stated above, the signals received by the receiver  are then transmitted to the computer . As shown in , the received signals at the receiver are a combination of the direct path signals  and the forward scattered signals . When the computer  receives the signals from the radar receiver , the signals are mapped into an interference pattern . The interference pattern  tracks energy changes at the fixed frequency for a predetermined time. An exemplary interference pattern  is shown in , illustrating the interference between the direct path signals  and the forward scattered signals . Because the interference pattern  is completed for a fixed frequency value, the pattern  essentially tracks the time changes in the received energy at the given frequency, which in this exemplary embodiment is about 10 GHz. As will be outlined below, based on the interference pattern the computer  determines an instantaneous surface water height of the targeted water surface, and a surface water profile.","Using a geometric optics scattering model for received field, the instantaneous wave height is given by equation (1):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b4","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["H","X"]},"mo":"+","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["H","R"]},"mo":"\u00b1","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"\u03ba"},"mo":"\u2062","msqrt":{"mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"arccos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mi":["E","C"]}}},"mo":"-","mn":"1"}}},{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["\u03c0","n"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mi":"\u03ba","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["R","DP"]}}],"mo":["+","+"]}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"-","mrow":{"msup":[{"mi":"\u03ba","mn":"2"},{"mi":"R","mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}}},"mn":"2"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{}],"b":["105","105","105","120","125","125","200"],"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIGS. 1A and 1B"],"sub":["X ","R ","DP ","DP","X","R","C "],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{}],"i":["R","R","H","\u2212H"],"sup":["2","2"]},"As stated above, the computer  includes a computer-readable medium bearing a program code for monitoring and determining an instantaneous water height and the prevailing sea state.
