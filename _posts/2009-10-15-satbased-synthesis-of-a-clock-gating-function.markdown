title: SAT-based synthesis of a clock gating function
abstract: Clock gating circuit is determined by transforming a clock gating opportunity function to a non-Boolean function and constraining inputs of the non-Boolean function. The non-Boolean function may be a ternary function. Constraining the inputs may be achieved by introducing control variables and a cardinality constraint associated with their values. The non-Boolean function may be utilized to approximate universal quantification of an input assigned with a non-Boolean value, such as “don't care” value. The non-Boolean function may be utilized to provide an ALL SAT solution of a Boolean function using a SAT solver.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to satisfiability (SAT) solvers in general, and to utilizing formal methods in chip design and verification in particular.","One of the most challenging tasks in chip design is to reduce power consumption in electronic chip designs. Among the many techniques for power reduction, clock gating is one of the most known and widely used. Clock gating reduces the power consumption by partially disabling portions of the circuitry not required for the operation of the circuitry at a given cycle. A latch of a circuitry consumes power when it receives a clock signal, indicating a new cycle, and re-computes its value. Using clock gating technique, the clock signal to the latch is blocked when the recomputed value of the latch is not required in order for the circuitry to behave according to its designated purpose.","In order to provide for a clock gating function the chip design is inspected for clock gating opportunities. It is preferred that the clock gating function will not violate a timing constraint or consume more power than the power consumption reduced by gating the clock. The timing requirement may stipulate that the logic depth of the generated circuitry should not exceed some constant. To reduce the leakage overhead of a clock gating circuitry, latches with similar functions are grouped together and gated with a single function.","It will be noted that in the present application, latches refer to any form of state storage devices, such as for example flip-flops.","One exemplary embodiment of the disclosed subject matter is A computerized apparatus comprising: a processor;

It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create a device for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable medium that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","One technical problem dealt with by the disclosed subject matter is to determine a clock gating opportunity that may be utilized in clock gating.

Yet another technical effect is providing a configurable amount of abstraction by controlling a number of injected non-Boolean values as inputs to the ternary function. Yet another technical effect is to utilize a SAT solver to determine a partial satisfying assignment.","Referring now to  showing a computerized environment in which the disclosed subject matter is used, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the subject matter. A computerized environment  comprises a clock gating function determinator  and a computerized clock gater . The clock gating function determinator  may be configured to receive or otherwise obtain a circuit . The clock gating function determinator  may determine a clock gating function (not shown) representing clock gating opportunities associated with the circuit . The clock gating function determinator  may be a computerized device configured to automatically determine the clock gating function. The clock gating function determinator  may be a person such as an engineer that is responsible for manually determining the clock gating function. In some exemplary embodiment, the clock gating function determinator  may utilize methods such as feedback loop elimination, unobservability don't cares or the like.","In some exemplary embodiments, the circuit  may be defined using a descriptive language such as VHDL, Verilog, SystemC, System Verilog, PSL, EDL or the like.","In some exemplary embodiments, the computerized clock gater  may be configured to determine a clock gater circuit  based upon the clock gating function. The clock gater circuit  may be configured to block a clock signal to a clock of the circuit  depending on a state of the circuit . The clock signal may be blocked in a state of the circuit  in which the clock gating function is evaluated to ONE or a different predetermined number.","In some exemplary embodiments, the clock gating function determinator  may determine a clock gating function associated with a portion of the circuit , such as for example a latch or a set of latches. The computerized clock gater  may determine a clock gater circuit  associated with the portion of the circuit . In some exemplary embodiments, the disclosed subject matter may be utilized iteratively to provide several clock gater circuits, such as , each associated with a possibly different portion of the circuit .","Referring now to  showing a diagram of a function, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the subject matter. A function  may comprise an abstracted function .","In some exemplary embodiments, the abstracted function  may be a non-Boolean abstraction of a Boolean clock gating function, such as determined by a clock gating function determinator  of . The abstracted function  may be configured to receive either a Boolean input (i.e., ZERO or ONE) or a non-Boolean input. The non-Boolean input may be utilized to abstract a set of Boolean values. For example, in case the abstracted function  is a ternary function, the abstracted function  may be defined over {ZERO, ONE, X} where X represents an \u201cunknown\u201d value. An \u201cunknown\u201d value may be considered as possibly both ZERO and ONE. Operators may be defined over the non-Boolean domain, such as for example an output of the conjunction operator may be defined as ZERO in case a ZERO is conjuncted with any value, a ONE in case a ONE is conjuncted with ONE, or an X in case an X is conjuncted with either a ONE or an X. In other exemplary embodiments, other non-Boolean domains may be employed to abstract the Boolean function.","It will be noted that in a ternary domain, also referred to as a three-valued domain, in case a ternary function is provided with an X value as an input, and the function evaluates to ONE (i.e., TRUE), any value the input may receive does not affect the value of the function. For example, the function evaluates to ONE if the input receives the value ONE or the value ZERO. The function evaluates to ONE based on other inputs. Therefore, the abstracted function which is given an X value to an input, may be considered as approximation to determining a second function by universally quantifying the input.","In an exemplary embodiment, the abstracted function  is provided with three inputs , , . The input  may have an I , or an X value . The I  value may be a nondeterministic value defined over a Boolean domain. The I  value may be nondeterministically chosen from the Boolean domain, so that it may be either ZERO or ONE.","In an exemplary embodiment, a multiplexer  is utilized to determine whether the input  may receive the X value  or the I  value. The multiplexer  may be configured to provide the X value  in case a control variable C  has a first value. The multiplexer  may be configured to provide the I  value in case the control variable C  has a second value. The control variable C  may have a value of either ZERO or ONE that is nondeterministically chosen or otherwise determined.","In some exemplary embodiments, other inputs such as the inputs  and  may have other associated multiplexers such as  and  which select between a nondeterministic value such as I  and I , and between the X value . The other associated multiplexers  and  may be associated with other control variables such as C  and C .","In some exemplary embodiments, a cardinality constraint  may be utilized to enforce a limitation on the control variables, such as C , C  and C . For example, the cardinality constraint  may require that a sum of the control variables C , C  and C  may be at most a predetermined number, such as for example two. In some exemplary embodiments, a ZERO value of a control variable, such as C , induces an associated input, such as , to be assigned with a Boolean value. The cardinality constraint  may limit a number of inputs that are assigned with a Boolean value, by limiting a number of control variables having a ONE value. For example, by limiting a summation of the control variables C , C , C  to be at most two, at most two control variables are assigned a ONE value and therefore at most two inputs of the abstracted function  are assigned a Boolean value. The other inputs may be assigned with the X value .","In some exemplary embodiments, utilizing the cardinality constraint  and allowing the control variables C , C , C  to be assigned each with a nondeterministic value, enables an automatic solver, such as a SAT solver, a theorem prover, a CSP solver or the like, to automatically select which inputs will be assigned the X value  and which will be assigned with a Boolean value.","In some exemplary embodiment, the function  comprises a conjunction gate , such as an AND gate. The conjunction gate  may be configured to conjunct an output value of the abstracted function  and an output value of the cardinality constraint . An output  of the function  may be indicative that the abstracted function  is satisfied by the inputs ,  and  and that the control variables C , C  and C  satisfy the cardinality constraint .","In some exemplary embodiments, the cardinality constraint  may be configured to limit a number of inputs to the abstracted function  that are utilized in satisfying the abstracted function . For example, the cardinality constraint  may limit the number of inputs to be at most one input, such that any satisfying assignment to the function  comprises at most one input of the abstracted function  which receives a Boolean value. A satisfying assignment in which a value of one or more inputs is the X value  or other non-Boolean value, may be considered a partial satisfying assignment also referred to as a partial satisfactory assignment.","Referring now to  showing a diagram of a computerized clock gater, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. A computerized clock gater , such as for example  of , may comprise a processor . The processor  may be a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a microprocessor, an electronic circuit, an Integrated Circuit (IC) or the like. The processor  may be utilized to perform computations required by the computerized clock gater  or any of it subcomponents.","In some exemplary embodiments, the computerized clock gater  may comprise an I\/O module . The I\/O module  may be an interface utilized to receive or otherwise obtain a Boolean function .","In some exemplary embodiments, the computerized clock gater  may comprise a non-Boolean abstraction module . The non-Boolean abstraction module  may generate or otherwise determine an abstracted function, such as  of , in respect to the Boolean function . The abstracted function may be a non-Boolean function, such as a ternary function. The Boolean function  may be a clock gating function, such as determined by the clock gating function determinator  of .","In some exemplary embodiments, the computerized clock gater  may comprise an input controller module . The input controller module  may be configured to limit a number of inputs of the abstracted function that are assigned a Boolean value.","In some exemplary embodiments, the input controller module  may comprise a control variable definer  for defining or otherwise introducing a control variable, such as  of , to control an input of the abstracted function. In some exemplary embodiments, a control variable may control more than one input of the abstracted function.","The control variable definer  may comprise a multiplexer definer module  that may be configured to define or otherwise introduce to the abstracted function a determination logic, such as for example the multiplexer  of . The determination logic may be configured to limit the input of the abstracted function in accordance with a value of an associated control variable. In some exemplary embodiment, a determination logic is a multiplexer configured to output an X value in case the control variable is ZERO and a nondeterministically chosen Boolean value in case the control variable is ONE. An output of the determination logic may be connected to an input of the abstracted function. It will be noted that the determination logic may be a circuitry element, such as a multiplexer, a representation of a circuitry element, such as a VHDL definition, a mathematical representation, such as may be achieved by using an implication operator, or the like.","In some exemplary embodiments, the input controller module  may comprise a cardinality constraint module . The cardinality constraint module  may be configured to define or otherwise introduce to the abstracted function a cardinality constraint, such as  of . In some exemplary embodiments, the cardinality constraint may be a circuit which provides a ONE output if and only if a summarization of one or more control variables is less than or equal to a predetermined number. In other exemplary embodiments, the cardinality constraint may be a formula, a logical representation of a circuit or the like. In other exemplary embodiments, other cardinality constraints may be utilized such that an output of the cardinality constraint is indicative of a number of constraint variables having a predetermined value, such as for example ONE or ZERO. A value of a constraint variable may be indicative of an input of the abstracted function having a Boolean value.","In one exemplary embodiment, each control variable is associated with an input of the abstracted function. A control variable has a ONE value only in case the input has a Boolean value. The cardinality constraint may be a constraint that a summarization of the control variables is less than a predetermined number, such as for example five. The cardinality constraint may provide a ONE output only in case at most five (or other predetermined number) of inputs have Boolean values. The rest of the inputs may have a non-Boolean value such as for example an X value. The predetermined number combined with the cardinality constraint may induce a number of inputs in a partial satisfying assignment to the abstracted function. Any input having an X value may be omitted from the partial satisfying assignment.","In some exemplary embodiments, the cardinality constraint module  may be utilized to determine more than one cardinality constraint. In some exemplary embodiments, a different cardinality constraint may be determined at different times, such as for example initially starting with a first predetermined number, such as for example ten, and proceeding with a second predetermined number, such as for example five. In some exemplary embodiments, a predetermined number may be iteratively increased in order to first obtain partial satisfying assignments with a minimal number of inputs and later obtain partial satisfying assignments with bigger number of inputs.","In some exemplary embodiments, the computerized clock gater  may further comprise an assignment size determination unit . The assignment size determination unit  may be configured to determine a number of inputs in a partial satisfying assignment. The number of inputs may be utilized by the cardinality constraint module . The number of inputs may be determined based on rules, preferences, user input or the like. The number of inputs may be determined based on previously determined number of inputs. In some exemplary embodiments, the number of inputs may not exceed a predetermined number. The predetermined number may be a number of inputs in a satisfying assignment that is not a partial assignment. The predetermined number may be a maximal number of a clock gating circuit. The predetermined number may be higher than the maximal number of a clock gating circuit, such as for example in case a number of inputs in a partial satisfactory assignment may be reduced by utilizing other techniques. In some exemplary embodiments, the predetermined number may be associated with a logic depth that a clock gating circuit should not exceed, such as for example stipulated by a timing requirement, a power consumption requirement or the like.","In some exemplary embodiments, the computerized clock gater  may comprise a clock gating synthesizer . The clock gating synthesizer  may be configured to determine a clock gating function based on a satisfying assignment to the abstracted function. The satisfying assignment may be a partial satisfying assignment, which may be considered as representing a set of non-partial satisfying assignment. A satisfying assignment may be associated with one or more states of a circuit, such as  of . The clock gating synthesizer  may be configured to synthesize a circuitry or a descriptive definition thereof, such as for example using VHDL, such that the circuitry may gate a clock signal to a one or more latch or other element receptive to clock signals. The gating function may be evaluated to ONE in case a state of the circuit, such as  of , is not affected by a blocking of the clock signal. It will be noted that the circuitry may be considered not affected in case a value of the latch is unchanged, in case a design functionality of the circuit is not changed or the like. It will be noted that the disclosed subject matter may be utilized in combinational clock gating, in sequential clock gating and the like.","In some exemplary embodiments, the clock gating synthesizer  may create a clock gater circuit, such as  of . The clock gater circuit may be associated to the clock gating function.","In some exemplary embodiments, the computerized clock gater  comprises a Boolean encoding module . The Boolean encoding module  may encode a non-Boolean function, such as for example the function  of , in a Boolean domain. In some exemplary embodiments, a dual-rail encoding may be utilized to encode a non-Boolean function over the Boolean domain.","In some exemplary embodiments, the computerized clock gater  may comprise the I\/O module . The I\/O module  may an interface, such as an Application Programming Interface (API) to a SAT solver .","In some exemplary embodiments, the SAT solver  may be comprised by the computerized clock gater .

The SAT solver  may be configured to provide a satisfying assignment to a non-Boolean function, such as the function  of . The SAT solver  may determine a satisfying assignment comprising one or more X values to inputs of a function. The satisfying assignment may be considered as a partial satisfying assignment. The SAT solver  may provide an indication that the function is not satisfiable, such as by indicating an UNSAT output.","In some exemplary embodiments, the computerized clock gater  comprises an assignment reduction module . The assignment reduction module  may be configured to transform a first function, such as the function  of  or a Boolean representation of such function, to a second function. The second function may be satisfied by the same satisfying assignments as the first function except for an at least one predetermined satisfied assignment. In some exemplary embodiments, the computerized clock gater  may utilize the SAT solver  to determine a first satisfying assignment to the first function. The computerized clock gater  may further utilize the assignment reduction module  to transform the first function to a second function such that the first satisfying assignment is excluded from satisfying the second function. The computerized clock gater  may further utilize the SAT solver  to determine a second satisfying assignment which may be different than the first satisfying assignment.","In some exemplary embodiments, the assignment reduction module  may reduce a satisfying assignment by adding to a function, such as  of , an element excluding the satisfying assignment, such as for example a comparator element that compares inputs to the satisfying assignment.","It will be noted that the computerized clock gater  may utilize the disclosed subject matter using functions instead of circuits. Furthermore, in some exemplary embodiments, the functions may represent computerized devices other than circuitry such as for example software, firmware or the like.

The determination may be made by a SAT solver, such as  of . The determination may be that a module, such as the SAT solver is unable to determine a satisfying assignment, such as for example, due to lack of resources or the like.","In case the ternary abstracted function is satisfiable, step  may be performed.

The determination may be based upon some of the following considerations: whether the ternary abstracted function was satisfiable, whether the limitation in step  may be relaxed, elapsed time, utilization of resources, resources availability and the like. The determination may be affected by rules, preferences, user input, commands or the like. In case the determination is to perform another iteration, step  may be performed. In some cases, in step  a same limitation may be determined as before. In some cases, in step  a different limitation than before may be determined. In some cases, in response to determining in step  that the ternary abstracted function is not satisfiable given a first limitation, in step  a second limitation may be determined which may be less restrictive than the second limitation.
