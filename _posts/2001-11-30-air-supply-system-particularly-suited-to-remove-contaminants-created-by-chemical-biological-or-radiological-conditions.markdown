No. 09\/504,396, which was filed on Feb. 15, 2000, and which is now abandoned.","The invention described herein made be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without any payment of any royalities thereon or therefor.","1.0 Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to air filtering systems and, more particularly, to an air supply system that is particularly suited to filter and remove contaminants created by chemical, biological or radiological conditions.","2.0 Description of the Related Art","Tactical locations, such as naval warships and land based buildings used for command information centers, have long been pressurized to protect against airborne intrusion therein of chemical, biological and radiological contaminations. Such a system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,962,371, which is incorporated herein by reference. Although the existing systems that provide for a pressurized environment serve well their intended purpose, it is desired that further improvements be provided thereto.","The filters used in such pressurized systems are commonly placed in relatively small environments, such as air ducts. It is desired that a compact filtering apparatus be provided wherein all the filtering required to purge the air of contaminants is located in one compact structure.","The pressurized environment provided by the air filtering systems needs to be maintained at a predetermined positive pressure. It is desired that a system be provided that monitors for the pressure within the enclosed environment and maintains the pressure therein within a desired limit.","It is a primary object of the present invention to provide an air filtering system that is particularly suited to filter and remove contaminants created by chemical, biological or radiological conditions.","Another object of the present invention is to provide an air supply system that has a single air filtering apparatus, which houses all of the necessary filtering devices needed to purge the supplied air of contaminants.","It is another object of the present invention to provide for a system that monitors the positive pressure within an enclosed environment or zone protected by the system so as to be within a desired range.","The invention is directed to an air supply system that is particularly suited to filter out contaminants created by chemical, biological or radiological conditions.","The system comprises a three-stage air filter apparatus and a supply fan. The three-stage air filter apparatus has an input and an outlet, with the input fluidly coupled to the inlet of the air supply system. The three-stage air filter apparatus has first, second and third coaxially arranged annular filters, with the first filter being disposed within the second filter and the second filter being disposed within the third filter. The first filter is located closest to the input of the three-stage air filter apparatus and the third filter is located closest to the output of the three-stage air filter apparatus. The third filter filters and removes particles of at least a first size. The second filter filters and removes aerosols and particles of a size which is less than the first size. The third filter comprises a gas adsorber for removing gases. The air supply system has an input fluidly coupled to the output of a three-stage air filter apparatus and an output fluidly coupled to the air intake means of the protected zone. The supply fan supplies a sufficient flow of air so as to provide the protected zone with a positive pressure.","Referring to the drawings, wherein the same reference number indicates the same element throughout, there is shown in  a block diagram showing the interrelationship of the essential elements making up the air supply system  of the present invention.","The system  supplies an enclosed protected zone , having an air intake means , with an air supply having an inlet  that is coupled to the external environment. The system  is particularly suited to provide filtering to remove contaminants created by chemical, biological or radiological conditions.","The protected zone  is defined by enclosed boundaries and is airtight. The practice of this invention frees the personnel in this zone from wearing protective masks or clothing, otherwise required to prevent the detrimental effects by the chemical, biological and radiological contamination.","The protected zone  is pressurized by supplying air at a sufficient flow and maintaining the positive pressure by providing air tightness of the protected zone  itself and by the use of air locks. Maintaining a positive pressure with the protected zone  prevents the infiltration therein of the chemical and biological contaminants. The contaminants are removed from the air flowing into the pressurized zone  by a three-stage air filter apparatus .","The three-stage air filter apparatus  has a first filter , a second filter , and a third filter , all of which are annular coaxially arranged filters. The first filter  is disposed within the second filter , and the second filter  is disposed within a third filter  in a manner to be further described herein described herein after with reference to FIG. . The first filter  is physically located closest to the input of the three-stage air filter apparatus , and the third filter  is physically located closest to the output of the three-stage air filter apparatus .","A differential pressure gage  is connected between the input and the output of the three-stage air filter apparatus  and develops an output proportional to the differences between the pressure sensed therebetween. The differential pressure gauge  may be used as a means for verifying the operation of the three-stage air filter apparatus , that is, a relatively low value indicated by the gauge  is representative that the filters therein are not clogged and that the three-stage air filter apparatus  is performing correctly.","The air supply system  further comprises a supply fan  which preferably is a centrifugal type fan and is also preferably shock-mounted to a structural foundation. The supply fan  is selected, in a manner known in the art, so as to supply a sufficient amount of air at a sufficient flow so as to provide the protected zone  with a positive pressure of 1.0 inches wg. The supply fan  is located on the downstream side of the three-stage filter apparatus  and cooling coils .","The cooling coils  are installed downstream of the three-stage filtering system  so as to condition (cool if warm) the supplied air before distributing it to the supply fan .","The protected zone  further cooperates with air locks  known in the art. The air locks  are used for the ingress and egress of personnel to and from the protected zone  so as to prevent accident contamination of the protected zone  during periods of chemical and biological threats.","The protected zone  further utilizes fan\/natural exhaust equipment  known in the art. The exhaust system  removes air from the protected zone  the amount of which is balanced with the air supplied by system  to the protected zone  so as to provide and maintain the desired amount of positive pressure within the protected zone .","The protected zone  further utilizes zone pressure gages , which are monitored to ensure that the protected zone  is supplied with a positive pressure within a desired range typically from about 0.5 inches (in) wg to about 1.5 (in) wg. The zone pressure gages  operatively cooperate with an alarm system .","The alarm system  monitors the pressure in the protected zone  indicated by the zone pressure gauges  and provides an audible alarm to alert personnel of low pressure conditions therein. The alarm may be generated when the pressure within the protected zone  falls below 0.5 inches wg. Alarm systems are known and one such system is described in the previously incorporated by reference U.S. Pat. No. 4,962,371.","The protected zone  further preferably includes an opening with an input and an output, wherein a pressure control valve (PCV)  is installed. The pressure control valve (PCV)  provides fluid communication between the input and output of the opening and is dimensioned, in a manner known in the art, so as to allow for fluid communication therebetween when the positive pressure within a protective zone is greater than about 1.5 inches wg. Preferably the protected zone  includes the use of one pressure control valve , which is used to relieve excess air from the protected zone  and, thus, prevents excessive pressure therein from creating undesired air leaks.","The air supplied into the protected zone  originates from inlet , that is preferably directed into a coarse-filter . The coarse-filter  typically uses a metal mesh to prevent large particles from entering the air supply system . The output of the coarse-filter  is directed into a preheater .","The preheater  conditions the air before it enters the three-stage air filter apparatus , which may be further described with reference to FIG. . As seen in , the three filters , , and  of the three-stage air filter apparatus , already discussed with reference to , are annular in shape and coaxially arranged, with filter  being dimensioned to be insertable into filter  which, in turn, is dimensioned so as to be insertable into filter . The filters , , and  are radial flow types, wherein air enters the inner (filter ) diameter area and flows radially outward through the larger (filter ) diameter surface. It will be appreciated from  that filters , , and  are free-standing filters. The first filter  has a typical outer diameter of twelve (12) inches and has a typical length of 10 inches. The first filter is a pleated-medium which filters and removes particles of at least a first or relatively small size. The second filter  filters and removes aerosols and particulates of a size which is less than the first size of the particles being removed by the first filter . The second filter  is selected of a material, known in the art, for removing solid and aerosol chemical, biological and radiological contaminates. The third filter  comprises a gas adsorber which removes gases. The third filter  contains activated charcoal (aszm-teda charcoal (chromium free)) selected, in a manner known in the art, for removing chemical warfare gases. The placement of the three-stage air filter apparatus  and further details thereof within a system, such as that of system , may be further described in reference to FIG. .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["18","46","24","48","22","52","20","46","48","50","20","52","54","22","24","46","48","20"]},"The system  preferably includes five three-stage air filter apparatuses , but only one is shown in  for the sake of clarity. The five three-staged air filter apparatuses  are each housed in an opening  with each of the filters ,  and  disposed inside each opening . The openings  open into an outlet plenum  which has curved upper portions (shown in ) that provide an air flow which is directed toward the air supply  (not shown).","The input air originally from inlet  of  is indicated in  by directional arrow , and a watertight access door , similar to those used for the air locks , is generally indicated by reference number  and forms part of a bulkhead . The support for the openings  is provided by the bulkhead  and the structural support of the outer plenum  is provided by a deck . The output air exiting from the outer plenum  is indicated in  by directional arrow .

The three paths are preferably first intercepted by the coarse-filter .","The coarse-filter  has typical dimensions of 19.5 by 29.5 inches. The coarse-filter  filters out large particulates and then directs the paths ,  and  onward to the preheater .","The preheater  elevates the air passing thereover to a temperature of at least 42\u00b0 F. and having a relative humidity of about 70%. The preheater  is preferably controlled by a thermostat . The preheater  directs the three paths ,  and  onward to the first filter .","The first filter  removes relatively large particles and then directs the paths ,  and  onward to the second filter .","The second filter  removes fine particulates and aerosols of 0.3 microns or greater with efficiencies of greater than 99.97 from its received air and delivers an output which only comprises gases that are directed to the third filter .","The third filter  removes the gas by an adsorbtion operation and passes air free, indicated by directional arrow , from the contaminants, especially those created by unwanted chemical, biological and radiological conditions, that is directed to the outlet plenum  which, in turn, direct the air , free from contaminants, onward to the cooling coils .","The cooling coils , in response to the thermostat , supplies the same air  free from contaminants to the supply fan  which, in turn, provides filtered air  free of contaminants into the protected zone .","The protected zone  is maintained by means of the pressure transducers  and its related alarm system  as well as the pressure control valves  and is supplied with a continuous flow air  free from contaminants.","It should now be appreciated that the practice of the present invention provides for an air supply system that is particularly suited to filter out contaminants created by chemical, biological or radiological conditions.","It should be further appreciated that the air supply system utilizes a three-stage air filter apparatus that contains all of the necessary filtering element, and because of its single structure, is conveniently mounted into bulkheads related to the system  of the present invention.","Still further is should be appreciated that the present transducer in cooperation with the alarm circuits allows for the monitoring of the protected zone so as to maintain its filtered air within a desired limit, such as 0.5-1.5 inches wg.","While the invention has been described with reference to the specific embodiments, this description is illustrative and is not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.","Various modifications will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A better understanding of the present invention may be realized when considered in view of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
