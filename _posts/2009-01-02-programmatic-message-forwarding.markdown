Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to an improved data processing system, and, more specifically, to a computer-implemented method, a data processing system, and a computer program product for programmatic message forwarding.","2. Description of the Related Art","Instant messaging or instant message (IM) tools are widely used by many people today. Instant message tools offer a variety of features and are available as products from many vendors, such as IBM\u00ae Lotus\u00ae Sametime\u00ae, available from International Business Machines Corporation, Yahoo! \u00aeMessenger, available from Yahoo Incorporated and AOL Instant Messenger\u00ae (AIM), available from AOL LLC. Some of the services are available on mobile devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs).","Currently, when a user is logged on to a computer using an instant message service and the user steps away from the computer, the instant message is displayed on the display screen, but is not seen by the user until the user returns. AOL Instant Messenger has a feature enabling instant message forwarding to be manually selected by the user. The drawback of this feature is that when the user steps away in a hurry, the user is not likely to select instant message forwarding. While the feature is available, the feature must be manually initiated which reduces the appeal and usefulness of the feature.","When the instant message is displayed without the user being at the display, an issue of privacy and security may result. Further, the user does not have the benefit of seeing the message when intended, which may have been the very purpose of the message.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a computer-implemented method for programmatic message forwarding is presented. The computer-implemented method initiates a messaging session on a primary device and identifies device priority preferences for a set of secondary devices. The computer-implemented method further monitors for a presence of the mobile device, wherein the presence of the mobile device is indicated as a heartbeat, and responsive to a determination that no heartbeat is detected, identifies one of the set of secondary devices as a target device, and responsive to locating the target device, forwards a message to the target device.","In another illustrative embodiment, a data processing system for programmatic message forwarding is presented. The data processing system comprises a bus, a memory connected to the bus, wherein the memory contains computer-executable instructions, a communications unit connected to the bus, a processor unit connected to the bus. The processor unit executes the computer-executable instructions to direct the data processing system to initiate a messaging session on a primary device, identify device priority preferences for a set of secondary devices, wherein the set of secondary devices includes a mobile device, monitor for a presence of the mobile device, wherein the presence of the mobile device is indicated as a heartbeat, responsive to a determination of the absence of the heartbeat, identify one of the set of secondary devices as a target device, and responsive to locating the target device, forward a message to the target device.","In another illustrative embodiment, a computer program product for programmatic message forwarding is provided. The computer program product comprises a computer usable medium having computer-executable instructions stored thereon. The computer-executable instructions comprises computer-executable instructions for initiating a messaging session on a primary device, computer-executable instructions for identifying device priority preferences for a set of secondary devices, wherein the set of secondary devices includes a mobile device, computer-executable instructions for monitoring for a presence of the mobile device, wherein the presence of the mobile device is indicated as a heartbeat, computer-executable instructions responsive to a determination of the absence of the heartbeat, for identifying one of the set of secondary devices as a target device, and computer-executable instructions responsive to locating the target device, for forwarding a message to the target device.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.

In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","The present invention is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products, according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions.","These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks. These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable medium that can direct a computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus, to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus, to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, or other programmable apparatus, to produce a computer-implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer, or other programmable apparatus, provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","With reference now to the figures and in particular, , exemplary diagrams of data processing environments are provided in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. It should be appreciated that  are only exemplary and are not intended to assert or imply any limitation with regard to the environments in which different embodiments may be implemented. Many modifications to the depicted environments may be made.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","100","102"]},"In the depicted example, server  and server  connect to network  along with storage unit . In addition, clients , , and  connect to network . Clients , , and  may be, for example, personal computers or network computers. In the depicted example, server  provides data, such as boot files, operating system images, and applications to clients , , and . Clients , , and  are clients to server  in this example. Network data processing system  may include additional servers, clients, and other devices not shown.","Program code located in network data processing system  may be stored on a computer-recordable storage medium and downloaded to a data processing system, or other device, for use. For example, program code may be stored on a computer-recordable storage medium on server  and downloaded to client  over network  for use on client .","In the depicted example, network data processing system  is the Internet with network  representing a worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) suite of protocols to communicate with one another. At the heart of the Internet is a backbone of high-speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers, consisting of thousands of commercial, governmental, educational and other computer systems that route data and messages. Of course, network data processing system  also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks, such as for example, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), or a wide area network (WAN).  is intended as an example, and not as an architectural limitation for the different illustrative embodiments.","The instant message client and the mobile phone of the user use Bluetooth\u00ae wireless specification support, available from Bluetooth SIG, Inc., to communicate with each other. For example, using system  of , a mobile phone of a user of client  is known to the personal computer of client , which is running the instant message client, the number of the phone and potentially, an approved list of instant message recipients created by the user, whose messages should be forwarded. The message recipients may be those such as client  and client . Server  may be an instant message server supporting clients on network . A heartbeat exchange takes place on a defined, configurable interval, for example 10 seconds. If the personal computer of client  tries to reach the cell phone during one of the heartbeats and doesn't receive an answer, the instant message client on the personal computer of client  assumes the user has stepped away. Any instant messages that are received from a user on the approved list, such as client , would be automatically forwarded to the mobile device, such as the phone, via a standard short message system (SMS) message. The capability allows the user to leave the user's desk in a hurry and still have the instant messages forwarded.","Once the user returns to the user's desk, the instant message client on the personal computer of client  and the user's phone can detect each other again. Upon detection the instant message service on the personal computer of client  automatically stops forwarding instant messages. The method allows the user to stay logged in on the personal computer and see the less important messages once the user returns, while the important messages are automatically forwarded to the user's phone.","With reference now to , a block diagram of a data processing system is shown, in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented.

Processor unit  may be a set of one or more processors, or may be a multi-processor core, depending on the particular implementation. Further, processor unit  may be implemented using one or more heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example, processor unit  may be a symmetric multi-processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.","Memory  and persistent storage  are examples of storage devices. A storage device is any piece of hardware that is capable of storing information either on a temporary basis and\/or a permanent basis.

Program code  and computer-readable media  form computer program product  in these examples. In one example, computer-readable media  may be in a tangible form, such as, for example, an optical or magnetic disc that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of persistent storage  for transfer onto a storage device, such as a hard drive that is part of persistent storage . In a tangible form, computer-readable media  also may take the form of a persistent storage, such as a hard drive, a thumb drive, or a flash memory that is connected to data processing system . The tangible form of computer-readable media  is also referred to as computer-recordable storage media. In some instances, computer-readable media  may not be removable.","Alternatively, program code  may be transferred to data processing system  from computer-readable media  through a communications link to communications unit  and\/or through a connection to input\/output unit .

For example, a storage device may be comprised of an organic semiconductor.","As another example, a storage device in data processing system  is any hardware apparatus that may store data. Memory , persistent storage , and computer-readable media  are examples of storage devices in a tangible form.","In another example, a bus system may be used to implement communications fabric  and may be comprised of one or more buses, such as a system bus or an input\/output bus. Of course, the bus system may be implemented using any suitable type of architecture that provides for a transfer of data between different components or devices attached to the bus system. Additionally, a communications unit may include one or more devices used to transmit and receive data, such as a modem or a network adapter. Further, a memory may be, for example, memory  or a cache such as found in an interface and memory controller hub that may be present in communications fabric .","With reference to , a block diagram of components of a forward manager, in accordance with illustrative embodiments, is shown. Forward manager  is shown within memory  of system  of , but may reside in other storage locations until required for use, such as storage  of system  of , or as program code  of system  of , prior to installation.","Forward manager  is a set of services, utilities or modules that may be implemented as a large block or as separate callable services as required. For example, each of the components listed may reside in separate memory locations ready for use or may be co-located within the memory of forward manager , and still provide the same level of function. Forward manager  provides a convenient package to support the services of the other components and provides a common focus for installation and maintenance operations, as well as common user interface support. Forward manager  may be implemented as an extension to an existing messaging service via application programming interfaces or as part of an enhanced messaging service.","Messaging application  is an instant messaging application as currently available. The application will be extended with addition of forward manager  services.","Proximity monitor  is a presence detector service. The service determines an awareness of the presence or absence of the user mobile devices, such as a mobile phone. For example, proximity monitor  may be configured to a specific user device, such as a Bluetooth signal of the user device. The presence of the user device causes a signal to be detected. The signal is referred to as a \u201cheartbeat\u201d informing proximity monitor  that the user is within a defined distance of the user workstation. The absence of such a \u201cheartbeat\u201d indicates the user has left the area of the workstation. When a user chooses not to use presence detection, such as when a mobile phone device is turned off, the service may be configured to stop presence detection.","Registered list of devices  comprises a defined set of devices to which instant messages should be forwarded. The list is configurable to allow specification of the target devices in a priority sequence. The capability allows a user to select only messages intended for specific devices, according to preference or capability.","Message filter  provides a capability to determine which messages to forward rather than have all or none forwarded. Filtering is typically applied based on sender, device, size and other typical parameters.","Forwarder  provides the capability to send the message to a desired target device, or another user. The other user may be a substitute for the original user when the original user has left the workstation. Forwarder  redirects the instant message according to the settings of message filter  and registered list of devices .","With reference to  is a block diagram of a primary and secondary operation view using the forward manager of , in accordance with illustrative embodiments; is shown. The sequence provides an overview of the operation of detecting the presence and absence of the user at the workstation.","Primary device , which is typically a personal computer (PC), is depicted with an instant message IM  which has been received and displayed on primary device . Primary device  is further enhanced with additional components of proximity monitor  and registered list of devices . IM  is received from messaging application  over link  on primary device .","Another user device, such as a mobile device in the form of secondary device , is in communication with primary device  as noted by communication link . A \u201cpairing\u201d activity has occurred between the Bluetooth enabled mobile secondary device  and primary device , forming a \u201cpresence.\u201d Presence is detected between the pair of primary device  and secondary device  by proximity monitor . Proximity monitor  continuously monitors for a signal from secondary device . The signal may be referred to as a heartbeat. The absence of a heartbeat indicates the secondary device is no longer in the vicinity, as when the user has left primary device . One or more secondary devices may comprise a set of secondary devices from which one device is selected as an alternate for the primary device. Device selection is made from the registered list of devices .","In the illustrated scenario when communication between primary device  and the mobile device of secondary device  is maintained a message session may be referred to as a normal session on primary device . IM  will be displayed on primary device .","When there is no communication link  between primary device  and mobile secondary device . There is no instant message, IM  on workstation . A \u201cheartbeat\u201d is missing for the pairing of workstation  and mobile device . Therefore, the instant message (IM ) has been transferred to mobile device  by forward manager  of  over link .","Instant message IM  is directed to the mobile device of secondary device . Forward manager  uses message filter  to determine whether the instant message should be forwarded. Not all messages are required to be forwarded. The user may request messages that meet specified criteria as having certain attributes such as priority, author, subject and other descriptive attributes be transferred.","In scenario , communication link  has been restored and proximity has been detected in the form of the \u201cheartbeat.\u201d The instant message service has reverted to initial status with IM  now appearing on the personal computer, workstation . Presence detection of mobile device  caused forward manager  of  to revert to initial behavior and allow IM  to display on workstation .","With reference to , a flowchart of a process of initial setup and monitoring using the forward manager of , in accordance with illustrative embodiments is presented. Process  describes the initial primary and secondary device pairing operation as well as the presence detection of the secondary device.","Process  starts (step ) and pairs the primary and secondary devices (step ). The pairing in the example shown represents a Bluetooth pairing operation. A determination is made as to whether the pairing was successful (step ). When the pairing is successful a \u201cyes\u201d result is obtained. When a pairing fails to occur, a \u201cno\u201d result is obtained. When a \u201cno\u201d is obtained in step , a retry occurs (step ). A determination is made as to whether the retry was successful (step ). When the retry is successful a \u201cyes\u201d result is obtained. When the retry is not successful a \u201cno\u201d result is obtained. When a \u201cno\u201d result is obtained in step , select another device is performed (step ) with process  looping back to step . Another device may be used to attempt to pair with the primary device. The pairing is performed in the example with a Bluetooth protocol but other short range wireless protocols may also be used. When a \u201cyes\u201d is obtained in step , process  skips to step . Send message to primary device (step ) makes the instant message available on the primary device. The display of the message on the primary device is the typical mode of operation. Monitor presence of the mobile secondary device (step ) is performed in a continuous manner to detect the presence or absence of the mobile device.","A determination is made as to whether an acknowledgement is received from the secondary device (step ). When an acknowledgement is received, a \u201cyes\u201d result is obtained. When an acknowledgement is not received, a \u201cno\u201d result is obtained. When a \u201cyes\u201d is received in step , the secondary device is in close proximity with the primary device. When the devices are in close proximity the user is located within view of the primary device and messages are routed to the primary device. When a \u201cno\u201d result is obtained in step , send message to target mobile secondary device (step ) is performed, with process  terminating thereafter (step ).","In the illustrative example described, a pair of devices establishes a communication link. The communication link is used by the primary device to monitor for the presence of the mobile, secondary device. The presence when detected is referred to as a heartbeat.","With reference to  is a flowchart of a message re-directing process using the forward manager of , in accordance with illustrative embodiments, is shown. Process  is an example of using forward manager  of .","Process  starts (step ) and performs a pairing operation to pair the primary device and the mobile device that is one of a set of secondary devices (step ). The pairing, for example, occurs when Bluetooth enabled devices are used, acknowledging the existence of the devices. If another short-range wireless protocol is used, the announcement and recognition of the device pairs must be handled in accordance with that protocol to allow presence detection of the mobile device to occur without user intervention. The set of secondary devices comprises one or more devices, including the mobile device. The mobile device is typically a cellular phone or a personal digital assistant.","Initiate instant message (IM) session on primary device occurs (step ). In the normal mode of operation, the instant message appears on the display of the primary device during the instant message session. A user may be requested to provide input to define device priority preferences (step ). Preferences may also be provided by a configuration file, property file or system defaults as required. Define preferences establishes a set of devices that may be used in the event a message is forwarded. The set of devices comprise an alternate selection of secondary devices as target devices to receive a message when the user is not located at the primary device.","Monitor heartbeat of mobile devices (step ) occurs in which the mobile devices are polled to detect presence or absence of the mobile devices. A determination is made as to whether the heartbeat of the mobile device is detected (step ). Responsive to a determination that a heartbeat is detected, a \u201cyes\u201d is obtained. When no heartbeat is obtained, a \u201cno\u201d results. When a \u201cyes\u201d is obtained in step , process  loops back to repeat step . When a \u201cno\u201d is obtained, identify target mobile device for forwarding is performed (step ). A \u201cno\u201d result in step  indicates the user of the mobile device has left the proximity of the primary device.","A determination is made as to whether the target device is located (step ). Responsive to the determination the target device is located; a \u201cyes\u201d result is obtained. Responsive to the determination the target device is not located, a \u201cno\u201d result is obtained. When a \u201cyes\u201d is obtained in step , forward message to target device is performed to re-direct the instant message to the alternate location (step ). The instant message is forwarded based on filtering precedence of the primary device user. Process  loops back to step .","When a \u201cno\u201d is obtained in step , a determination is made as to whether there are other devices to try (step ). When there are other devices to try, a \u201cyes\u201d is obtained. When there are no other devices to try, a \u201cno\u201d result is obtained. When a \u201cyes\u201d is obtained in step , process  loops back to step  to identify target mobile device for forwarding. When a \u201cno\u201d is obtained in step , process  loops back to step  to monitor again with the message displaying on the primary device.","Thus, illustrative embodiments present, by way of example, the capability of programmatic forwarding of messages intended for a primary device to a secondary device. In one illustrative embodiment, the method monitors the presence of a \u201cheartbeat\u201d of a mobile device. When the \u201cheartbeat\u201d is no longer detected, the method programmatically re-directs the message to the recipient user's mobile device. The mobile device may be one of a set of devices in a preferred order. Further, the method provides a capability to filter the messages to permit forwarding of a subset of original messages. The subset may be determined based on user defined preference including message sender, size of message, type of message or priority.","The flowchart and block diagrams in the figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products, according to various embodiments of the present invention.
