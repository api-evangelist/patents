title: Shared item account selection
abstract: Techniques for sharing of items from online storage (e.g., cloud storage) are described herein. In at least some embodiments, sharing links can be configured as one-time sharing links that provide recipients with limited, one-time access to a shared item for the purpose of selecting or registering an account to use for subsequent access to the item. Recipients are able to select accounts they find most convenient for accessing a shared item without the owner/sharer of the item necessarily having contact information for those accounts or sending a link to the accounts. Selection of a one-time link initiates an authentication sequence that selectively provides an option to select a particular account. Once the one-time sharing link is redeemed, the one-time sharing link is invalidated for subsequent access to the item.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Overview","CONCLUSION"],"p":["The availability and popularity of web-based content and services is ever increasing. For example, users are increasingly using online storage services that provide storage \u201cin the cloud\u201d for content items (e.g., documents, application files, photos, mobile uploads, audio\/video files, etc.). Storage in the cloud makes it convenient for users to access their files over a network from anywhere using various different kinds of devices (e.g., computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc.). Due in part to this convenience, users may also seek ways in which to share content items from their online storage with others.","Traditionally, though, online storage services provide limited tools for sharing items particularly in the case of sharing items to multiple sites, groups, and\/or individuals. For instance, a user may have to individually configure an email or message for each intended recipient of a shared item and\/or may have to manually provide a shared item as an attachment. In some cases, a user may even have to download a stored item locally before they can share the item through email or another messaging system. Thus, traditional techniques for sharing items from online storage may be quite inconvenient.","Techniques for sharing of items from online storage (e.g., cloud storage) are described herein. Sharing links for items maintained in online storage available from a service provider can be generated and distributed in various ways. The sharing links may provide recipients with access to shared items online from storage associated with the sender. The sender is able to manage permissions associated with different sharing links sent to different recipients on an individual basis.","In one or more implementations, sharing links can be configured as one-time sharing links that provide recipients with limited, one-time access to a shared item for the purpose of selecting or registering an account to use for subsequent access to the item. In this manner, recipients are able to select accounts they find most convenient for accessing a shared item without the owner\/sharer of the item necessarily having contact information for those accounts or sending a link to the accounts. Selection of a one-time link may initiate an authentication sequence that incorporates an option to select a particular account if appropriate. Once the one-time sharing link is redeemed, the one-time sharing link is invalidated for subsequent access to the item.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Traditionally, online storage services provide limited tools for sharing items particularly in the case of sharing items to multiple sites, groups, and\/or individuals. For instance, a user may have to manually attach items to messages and\/or publish an item to multiple different services\/sites that the user wants to receive the item. Thus, traditional techniques for sharing items from online storage may be inconvenient.","Techniques for sharing of items from online storage (e.g., cloud storage) are described herein. In one approach, distinct sharing links to an item can be generated for multiple different publish targets through a single publishing user interface exposed to a user. Through the publishing user interface, a user may submit a request having a selection of different social networks and\/or other sites\/targets to receive a sharing link for an item. In response to the request, a distinct sharing link is generated for each selected recipient and the generated sharing links are published to appropriate targets. Thus, a user is able to easily send links for a shared item to multiple targets through a single request and can separately manage permissions associated with each distinct sharing link.","In another approach, sharing links can be configured as group opt-in links designed to provide recipients with an option to join a group having permissions on a corresponding shared item. An owner of an item may distribute a group opt-in link publicly and does not have to predetermine the group size or individual members. Recipients of the link can choose whether to join the group or not. The group opt-in link may provide limited access to join the group and then members who join the group may gain enhanced permissions to the shared item. The owner of the item is able to see individuals who have opted-in and manage corresponding permissions on an individual basis.","In another approach, sharing links can be configured as one-time sharing links that provide recipients with limited, one-time access to a shared item for the purpose of selecting or registering an account to use for subsequent access to the item. The owner\/sharer of the item may use any available contact information to send one-time sharing links. A recipient is then able to use the link to select an account the recipient would like to use to access the shared item. The owner\/sharer does not need to send the link to the selected account or even have contact information for the account. Once the one-time sharing link is redeemed to select an account, the link may be invalidated for subsequently gaining enhanced permission to the item.","In the following discussion, an example operating environment is first described that may employ the techniques described herein. The discussion of the example operating environment includes a discussion of an example user interface to facilitate interaction with online storage. Next, example details and techniques are described which may be implemented in the example environment as well as other environments. Consequently, performance of the techniques is not limited to the example environment and the example environment is not limited to performance of the example techniques. Lastly, example systems and devices are described that may be employed to implement one or more embodiments.","Example Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","110","102","104","106","108","108","106","106"]},"A computing device may be configured in a variety of ways. For example, a computing device may be configured as a computer that is capable of communicating over the network , such as a desktop computer, a mobile station, an entertainment appliance, a set-top box communicatively coupled to a display device, a wireless phone, a game console, and so forth. Thus, the computing device may range from full resource devices with substantial memory and processor resources (e.g., personal computers, game consoles) to a low-resource device with limited memory and\/or processing resources (e.g., traditional set-top boxes, hand-held game consoles). Additionally, although a single computing device is shown in some instances, the computing device may be representative of a plurality of different devices, such as multiple servers utilized by a business to perform operations such as by the service provider  and\/or social network service , and so on.","Although the network  is illustrated as the Internet, the network may assume a wide variety of configurations. For example, the network  may include a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless network, a public telephone network, an intranet, and so on. Further, although a single network  is shown, the network  may be configured to include multiple networks.","The client device  is further illustrated as including an operating system . The operating system  is configured to abstract underlying functionality of the underlying device to applications  that are executable on the client device . For example, the operating system  may abstract processing, memory, network, and\/or display functionality such that the applications  may be written without knowing \u201chow\u201d this underlying functionality is implemented. The application , for instance, may provide data to the operating system  to be rendered and displayed by a display device as illustrated without understanding how this rendering will be performed.","The client device  is also illustrated as including a communication module . The communication module  represents functionality to enable various communications over the network . For example, the communication module  may be implemented as a browser or other suitable application to obtain and output webpages and\/or other user interfaces from the service provider  over the network . The communication module  may also represent a component of another application used to obtain one or more resources from the service provider .","The service provider  is depicted as storing a resource manager  that represents functionality operable by the service provider  to manage various resources  that may be made available over the network . For example, various resources  may be provided via webpages or other user interfaces  that are communicated over the network for output by one or more clients via a communication module  or other client application. The resource manager  may manage access to the resources , performance of the resources, and configuration of user interfaces  to provide the resources , and so on. The service provider  may represent one or more server devices used to provide the various resources .","Generally, resources  made accessible by a service provider  may include any suitable combination of services and\/or content typically made available over a network by one or more providers. Some examples of services include, but are not limited to, a search service, an email service, an instant messaging service, an online productivity suite, and an authentication service to control access of clients to the resources . Content may include various combinations of text, multi-media streams, documents, application files, photos, audio\/video files animations, images, web pages, web applications, device applications, content for display by a browser or other client application, and the like.","One particular example of a resource  that may be provided by a service provider  is a collaboration service  as depicted in . The collaboration service  is representative of functionality operable to provide and manage online storage  that may be allocated to user accounts associated with the service provider . The online storage  provides users with storage \u201cin the cloud\u201d for content items such as documents, application files, photos, mobile uploads, and audio\/video files so user may access their content items from anywhere over the network , and share content to collaborate with others. The collaboration service  enables users to share files with other individuals and\/or groups through sharing links  that can be created and distributed for particular content items in various ways. The sharing links  are configured to implement permissions that may be set to control who is able to view, edit, or otherwise interact with corresponding content items, as discussed in greater detail in relation to .","Clients may access the collaboration service  and other resources  provided by a service provider  through user accounts represented by client account data  of . The client account data  may include account identifiers, credentials, access permissions, profile data and other data typically associated with user accounts. The resource manager  may implement or otherwise make use of an authentication service operable to authenticate clients to access various resources  including the collaboration service . The authentication service may be provided as a component of the service provider , as a standalone service, by a third party provider, or otherwise. To access resources , a client device  may provide a username and password that is authenticated by the authentication service. When the authentication is successful (e.g., the client \u201cis who they say they are\u201d), the authentication service may pass a token to enable access to corresponding resources. A single authentication may correspond to one or more resources, such that authentication to a single account by a \u201csingle sign-on\u201d may provide access to individual resources, resources from multiple service providers , and\/or to an entire suite of resources available from a service provider .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["128","200","128","202","204","202","202","204","128","204","128"]},"Additionally, the sharing link  can encode data that defines or references permissions for a corresponding item. The permissions designate access levels and corresponding actions for content items. For instance, different access levels may be established to control who is able to perform actions such as read-only, print, publish, view, edit, one-time access, move, and\/or copy, to name a few examples. In one approach, the service provider  maintains a table or other database that can be used to match a sharing key  to corresponding permissions on content items. Such permission data may be maintained as part of the file structure for online storage  along with individual files. This may include maintaining access control lists (ACLs) that may be referenced by or otherwise mapped to sharing keys . Additionally or alternatively, permissions can be encoded directly within a sharing link using an access parameter or other suitable field that is indicative of a corresponding permission level. The collaboration service  may be configured to reference and interpret the access parameter in a sharing link  and enforce corresponding permissions when the sharing link  is used to gain access to an item.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","122","122","302","116","116","302","106","120","122","124"]},"To provide the interaction with online storage, the user interface  may expose a file management portion  to enable navigation, viewing, and management of content items stored \u201cin the cloud\u201d in association with a user\/account. A file management portion  can be configured in any suitable way to enable the interaction with online storage, such as representing content items in a list, showing different icons or tiles for stored items, using a preview pane, and so forth. In the depicted example, the file management portion  is shown as a \u201cMy Files\u201d list for a logged in user \u201cRobyn.\u201d The list of content items represents files available to Robyn from her online storage  through the collaboration service  including documents, folders, photos, and other types of content mentioned previously. The list of content items shows names for individual files and folders as well as basic information associated with each item, such as the example date and sharing columns depicted in .","An item details portion  is also shown that may be configured to provide more detailed information regarding a selected item, which in this example presents details for a \u201cReunion\u201d folder selected from the list of content items. In addition, the user interface  includes a sharing portion  that represents functionality to review and manage sharing options for content items. In this example, the sharing portion  is incorporated as part of the item detail portion . Alternatively, a sharing portion  may be provided as a separate portion or even a separate page that is accessible via a link, menu item, or other navigation instrumentality exposed in the user interface . The sharing portion  is configured to provide various options for sharing of selected items. This may include creating sharing links , viewing and setting permissions for items, publishing links to a social network service  or other external web service\/site, distributing links using various messaging systems, and so forth.","Thus, a user interface  such as the example just described may be employed to facilitate various interactions to access online storage  and\/or share items. In accordance with sharing link techniques described herein, distinct links to a content item may be generated for different publish targets. In addition, links may be shared to an arbitrary group through a corresponding sharing link . In this case, sharing link  is configured to expose an option for recipients to opt into the group having permissions on the item. Thus, recipients explicitly opt into the group before gaining full permission to the item. In another example, a recipient of a link may be able to choose a particular account to use for access a shared item. This may occur through a one-time link that may be redeemed once to access the item and associate a selected account for subsequent access to the shared item. Further details regarding each of these examples are discussed in turn below in different sections titled \u201cDistinct Links for Publish Targets,\u201d \u201cGroup Opt-In Links,\u201d and \u201cShared Item Account Selection,\u201d respectively.","Thus, having considered the foregoing discussion of an example operating environment and an example user interface for interaction with online storage, consider now details regarding techniques to employ sharing links in accordance with one or more embodiments.","Distinct Links for Publish Targets","This section describes techniques for publishing of sharing links  to different selected publish targets. In portions of the following discussion, reference will be made to the example environment  of  and example user interface of . Generally speaking, a user may access associated online storage  through a collaboration service . The user may be able to select an item to share as well as target recipients to receive a link to the item. The user action to share the item causes the collaboration service  to generate one or more sharing links  to the item. In one approach, the collaboration service  may generate distinct links to the same item for multiple different publish targets selected by the user. Accordingly, different permissions may be associated with the distinct links and the distinct links may be separately presented and managed. Just below, an example procedure is discussed followed by some example user interfaces illustrating further details regarding distinct links.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"A request is obtained to create distinct links for selected publish targets to share an item from online storage associated with a user account (block ). The request, for instance, may be formed via a user interface  output at a client device  for interaction with online storage  associated with a user. Thorough the user interface , an item to share as well as different targets may be selected. This may occur through a publish control or page link provided as part of the user interface . At least some of the targets may be social network services or other partner sites to which the user wishes to publish a link for the selected item.","The request may be formatted in any suitable way to encode information describing the selected item and targets. For example, the request may be configured as a hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP) request using JavaScript, XML, HTML and\/or other scripting languages. The request may include variables, parameters, and\/or other suitable identifiers used to submit the item and targets for handling by a service provider . Thus, the request may be formatted to encode the user selections in some manner and then submitted, which causes the client device  to communicate the request to a service provider . In one example, a collaboration service  implemented by the service provider  is configured to obtain the request and process the request to generate corresponding sharing links . In at least some embodiments, the collaboration service  may expose an application programming interface (API) that can be called with the request via script within a webpage or other user interface  to initiate creation of sharing links . In addition or alternatively, any client-server architecture and\/or communication protocols suitable for passing requests\/responses between a client device  and service provider  may be employed to implement the techniques related to sharing links described herein.","In particular, the request is parsed to identify the selected publish targets (block ). For instance, the collaboration service  is able to interpret the request and extract information contained therein to identify selected publish targets. The collaboration service  also obtains from the request an identifier of the particular item to be shared with the publish targets. This information enables the collaboration service  to construct sharing links  as described previously.","For instance, a distinct sharing link is generated for each publish target identified (block ) and the generated sharing links are added to permissions on the item (block ). Here, the collaboration service  constructs a different link for each identified target. Each link may include a navigation path  to the item and a sharing key  as discussed above. The navigation path  to the item may be the same for each link. The sharing key , though, may be generated as a unique identifier that is different for each link and corresponding target. In one example, the sharing key  is configured as a token that is different for each link.","Permissions to a shared item can also be encoded within the generated sharing links. As mentioned, the token or other sharing key  may be mapped to permissions on the item using ACLs that define the permissions. Thus, to encode permissions the collaboration service  may update the ACLs to reflect respective permissions designated for each of the generated sharing links. Using this technique, the system can store a mapping of permission for a sharing link that may or may not be apparent to the recipient(s) of the sharing link. In another approach, the sharing key  itself can be used to designate the permissions that the corresponding link grants to recipients\/users of the link. In this case, the collaboration service  may be configured to interpret the sharing key  when a link is used to determine and enforce corresponding permissions.","The sharing links are published to the publish targets (block ). For example, the collaboration service , in addition to creating the links, may be configured to publish links to various partner sites. Such partner sites may expose network accessible application programming interface (APIs) that can be invoked to publish information to user accounts. For instance, a post link or post picture API may be provided to post content to a social network service . The collaboration service  may be configured to form calls in appropriate formats designated by different supported partner sites via such APIs or otherwise. This enables a user of the collaboration service  to interact once to select an item and publish target, submit a single request, and then turn over handling to the collaboration service  to create the appropriate links and post the links to corresponding publish targets. Accordingly, the user is able to avoid individual creation and manually post links to different targets.","Representations of the distinct sharing links are presented in association with the item in a user interface for viewing and managing the online storage (block ) and individual management of the distinct sharing links associated with each publish target is enabled (block ). Since distinct sharing links are created for different targets, the links may be used and managed separately from one another. Thus, the collaboration service  may separately represent the distinct sharing links for an item within a user interface presented to review and manage stored items. For example, different sharing links may be listed via a sharing portion  of a user interface  as discussed in relation to . In this way, a user is able to review each of the links generated for a particular item and see associated permissions. Additionally, the collaboration service  is configured to provide various options to separately manage distinct links for an item. This includes, but is not limited to, actions such as associating and changing permissions individually for different links, removing one or more links (e.g., un-publishing links) and\/or invalidating a link without affecting other links on an item. Additional details regarding creating, using, and managing distinct links are provided in relation to example user interfaces of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","122","122","502","116","116","502","106","120","502"]},"In at least some embodiments, the interface  may be accessible by selection of a link, menu item, or other navigation control provided in the example user interface of . For instance, the example interface depicted in  may be presented responsive to selection of the \u201cPublish a Link\u201d object appearing within the sharing portion  in . Thus, the different interfaces in the examples of  may represent different pages available via the collaboration service .","Here, the example user interface  is operable to create distinct sharing links  for the \u201cReunion\u201d folder of . A target selection portion  may be provided to enable input of a selection of publish targets by a user in any suitable way. In the depicted example, a list of available targets is presented along with check boxes to select\/deselect different targets. The list may represent targets that have been pre-associated with a user's account. Other selection controls such as a drop down box, search tool, list box, and\/or other selection tools may also be implemented to enable input of the selection. In addition, an add control  may be provided to enable a user to explicitly search for and\/or add another network\/site as a publish target. It should be noted, that publish targets to which distinct links are provided may also include individual people or contacts. Once added, a site\/network\/individual may automatically appear as a pre-associated option in subsequent publish operations.","The example user interface  of  further includes a message input portion , a permissions portion , and a publish control . The message input portion  enables input of an optional description or message to accompany a published link. The permissions portion  enables selection of permissions to associate with the created links. For instance, the permissions portion  may allow a user to select whether created links may be used to view, edit, move, and\/or grant admin rights to a corresponding item. In the illustrated example, the permissions portion  is configured to apply globally to each of the selected publish targets. In another approach, individual permissions portions  may be associated with each target to enable selection of different permissions for the different links. Again, various selection controls may be employed to implement permissions portions  including for example, check boxes, list boxes, drop down boxes, search tools, and other typical selection tools. The publish control  when selected causes a request having the selection made via the example interface to be submitted for handling by the service provider  and\/or collaboration service as previously described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["600","306","308","602","400","604","604","604","604","604","606","606"]},"Group Opt-In Links","This section describes techniques for sharing links  configured to provide an option to opt-in to a group having permissions on an item. In portions of the following discussion, reference will again be made to the example environment  of  and example user interface of . Generally speaking, a user may access associated online storage  through a collaboration service . The user may be able to select a get a link option that causes a collaboration service  to provide a link for sharing an item. The user may then take action to copy and\/or distribute in various ways. In one approach, the collaboration service  configures the link such that selection of the link causes an option to be exposed to join a group having permissions on a corresponding item. The group is not necessarily predetermined and recipients of the link may be granted limited or no access to the item until the recipients explicitly opt into the corresponding group. Group membership is determined by those that exercise the group opt-in option. Recipients that do opt-in are granted permissions on the item that are established for the group. Subsequently, the owner of the item may view a list of recipients who have opted-in as members of the group, modify the group permissions, and\/or modify permissions for members of the group on an individual basis. Just below, an example procedure is discussed followed by some example user interfaces illustrating details of techniques for group opt-in links.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702","122","102","126"]},"In one approach, the collaboration service  creates a link in response to the request that includes a navigation path  and a sharing key  as previously discussed. After generating the link, the collaboration service  communicates the link back to the client device  for presentation to the user. For instance, the collaboration service  may configure a webpage or other suitable user interface  including the link and return the webpage for output at the client in response to the request.","The collaboration service  may also configure the link to cause a group opt-in option to be exposed when the link is selected (e.g., clicked or navigated to) by recipients. This may occur in a variety of ways. For example, the sharing key  may be used as an identifier that prompts the collaboration service  to present an appropriate option to join a group when a link is used to gain access to the item. ACLs maintained by the collaboration service  may be used to designate that a particular sharing key is configured to cause the group opt-in option. The collaboration service  may use the sharing key  (or an identifier contained therein) to look-up permissions and properties of the corresponding link in the ACLs. Based on this matching of the sharing key  to ACLs, the collaboration service  is able to determine whether the link is a configured for the group opt-in option.","In addition or alternatively, the collaboration service  may examine the sharing key  or another field contained within the link and determine directly from the examination that the link is configured for the group opt-in option. For example, a particular string or value associated with sharing key  may be used as a toggle to selectively indicate whether the group opt-in option is activated. Thus, the collaboration service  may set the toggle to activate the group opt-in option when generating a sharing link, which then prompts the collaboration service  to present the appropriate option when the link is used by a recipient.","The sharing link is distributed to one or more recipients (block ). The sharing link may be communicated to a user and\/or distributed to recipients in various ways. For example, the sharing link  generated per block  may be presented in a user interface  that enables a user to view and\/or copy the link. The user may then distribute the link to selected recipients in any suitable way. For example, the user may copy the link into a message and send the link to selected recipients as an email, instant message, text message, and so forth. Further, the user may take action to post the link to web services\/sites, such as adding the link to a user profile page with a social network service . The link may also be distributed using other techniques such as by word of mouth, in ads, in written communications (electronic and\/or physical), and so forth. In addition to providing a link that can be copied, a user interface  may also be configured to facilitate distribution of the link using one or more techniques as discussed further in relation to  below.","Note that distinct links as discussed above can also be created to activate the group opt-in option. If the user so chooses, the sharing link  generated per block  may be distributed to multiple publish targets using techniques discussed in relation to . For example, the user may select a publish option that exposes an interface for selection of publish targets comparable to the example of . In this case, the distinct links created when the user publishes the link may also be configured to activate the group opt-in options. This may occur by modifying or otherwise employing the sharing link  generated per block  to produce multiple distinct links for the selected targets. Each of the distinct links is configured to include a sharing key or other suitable identifier to indicate that the group opt-in option is active.","Responsive to selection of the sharing link by recipients, an option is exposed for the recipients to opt into a group having permissions on the item (block ). As mentioned above, the collaboration service  may examine a selected link to detect a sharing key  or other identifier that is indicative of the group opt-in option. A determination that the group opt-in option is active prompts the service to present the appropriate option when the link is used by a recipient. In some cases, a comparison is made to ACLs that encode whether the group opt-in option is active or inactive for corresponding links. The collaboration service  may also identify that the group opt-in option is active based on a particular value, string, or toggle field incorporated within a sharing link  when the link is created.","When the group opt-in option is appropriate, the collaboration service  operates to present the option to the recipient. This may occur in a variety of ways. For example, an opt-in interface or dialog may be output for display by a client device . The opt-in interface or dialog presents recipients with the option to join the group and enables a recipient to explicitly opt-in to the group having permissions on the item. Additionally, a recipient may be asked to select an account to associate with the item\/group in accordance with techniques discussed below in relation to .","More generally, note that the different techniques related to sharing links described in different sections herein may be combined in various ways. Thus, techniques described for distinct links, group opt-in links, and one-time sharing links may be implemented individually and\/or may be combined in some scenarios to create sharing links configured for multiple purposes.","Recipients that exercise the option are added to the group having permissions on the items (block ). In particular, permissions defined in an ACL or otherwise for an item are updated to reflect addition of recipients that opted in as members. This may involve associating account identifiers and\/or credentials for the recipients that opt-in with the group, permissions, and\/or corresponding item to make the recipients members of the group.","As noted group membership is determined by those that exercise the group opt-in option and therefore the group is not necessarily predetermined in membership or size. The owner of the item\/group does not have to manually select each member to create the group and does not need to have contact information for individual people. Rather, the owner simply gets a link per block  and can post the link to a public site or otherwise distribute the link. In this case, the link is effectively public and anyone who possesses the link may use the link to gain access to at least the group opt-in option for the item.","The group opt-in option may implement a tiered access level approach in which permissions on the item change from a first level of access before opting-in to a second level of access after opting-in. Initially, a link may be associated with initial, basic permissions on the item. The initial permissions may be set by default and\/or may be designated by the user. In general, the initial permissions available through the sharing link grant limited or no access to the item. For instance, the initial permissions may be set to limit access to viewing of the item or viewing just a preview of the item. Alternatively, access may be limited to obtaining and acting on the group opt-in option for the item. Opting in causes permissions to change from the initial, basic permissions to enhanced permissions on the item that are established for the group. For example, the enhanced permissions available through the group may be set to enable editing in addition to viewing the item. Thus, various different access levels may be associated with an item prior to opting-in through the sharing link and after opting-in through the group.","Representations of recipients that have opted-in are presented in association with the item in a user interface for viewing and managing the online storage (block ) and management of the recipients individually and separate from management of the sharing link is enabled (block ).","As with the distinct sharing links for different targets discussed previously, links configured for group opt-in and members within the group may be managed separately from one another. Thus, the collaboration service  may separately represent a group link and group members for an item within a user interface presented to review and manage stored items. For example, representations of different group members and\/or a group opt-in link may be listed via a sharing portion  of a user interface  as discussed in relation to . In this way, a user is able to review each of the links and members for a particular item, see associated permissions, and\/or separately manage permissions for the group and\/or individual members of the group. This includes but is not limited to actions such as changing permissions individually, removing one or more members, and\/or invalidating a link without affecting the access permissions of members who have already opted-in, and so forth.

In this case, the interface provides the actual link (as opposed to publication of the distinct links in the previous section) that a user may copy and distribute in various ways. In particular, a link portion  is depicted that may return a link generated by a collaboration service  as previously described. As mentioned, the link may be configured to cause a group opt-in option to be presented when the link is selected by a recipient. In one approach, the sharing key  associated with the link is set to cause the option to be exposed when the collaboration service  interprets the link.","The example user interface  of  further includes a permissions portion , a distribute portion , and a done control . As with preceding examples, the permissions portion  enables selection of permissions to associate with the created links. For instance, the permissions portion  may allow a user to select whether the returned linked may be used to view, edit, move, and\/or grant admin rights to a corresponding item. The user may be able to set both initial permissions before opting-in and enhanced permissions after opting-in in accordance with the tiered access level approach discussed in relation to .","The distribute portion  may be included to provide various options to share the link. For example, the example distribute portion  provides options to distribute by email or instant messaging. Selection of these options may be used to automatically create an appropriate message that includes the link through the service provider , a default messaging program, a third party messaging service, and so forth. In addition, a post option is provided that may enable publication of the link to different sites. In at least some cases, the post option may link to an interface similar to the example of  that may enable selection of different publish targets and\/or creation of distinct links for the different publish targets. In this case, the distinct links may be generated to correspond to the particular link returned in the link portion  and may also cause the opt-in option to be exposed when selected. As before, a different sharing key  may be associated with different distinct links.","The done control , when selected, may cause the interface to be closed out and navigation back to a home page or start page for the collaboration service , such as returning to the example interface shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 3","FIG. 6"],"b":["900","306","308","902","904","904","904"]},"In addition, a deactivate control  is provided that is operable to deactivate a distributed link. When deactivated the link is no longer usable to opt-in to the group. In at least some embodiments, deactivating the link or changing permissions associated with the link does not affect users that have already been added to the group. Thus, the individual users may be managed individually and separately from the sharing link itself. In another approach, invalidating the link or changing permissions will populate the changes to any members of the group.","Shared Item Account Selection","This section describes techniques for sharing links  configured to enable a recipient to select a particular account the recipient would like to use to access a corresponding shared item. In portions of the following discussion, reference will again be made to the example environment  of  and example user interface of . Generally speaking, a user may access associated online storage  through a collaboration service . The user may be able to select a send a link option that causes a collaboration service  to provide a link for sharing an item. The user may then take action to send the link to selected individuals. The user may have limited contact information for some individuals and therefore may not address the link to addresses or accounts that some recipients would prefer to use for access to the shared item. As discussed below, the collaboration service  may configure sharing links  generated in response to the send operation as one-time sharing links. In general, the one-time sharing links enable recipients to get limited, one-time access to a shared item for the purpose of selecting or registering an account to use for subsequent access to the item. Once the one-time sharing link is redeemed, the one-time sharing link may be invalidated for subsequent access to gain enhanced permissions to the item. The one-time sharing link may or may not continue remain valid for limited access, such as read-only access. In this manner, recipients are able to select accounts they find most convenient for accessing a shared item without the owner\/sharer of the item necessarily having contact information for those accounts or sending a link to the accounts. Just below, example procedures are discussed followed by some example user interfaces illustrating details of techniques for one-time sharing links.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"1000"},"Selected recipients are determined for a sharing link to an item maintained in online storage (block ). One way this may occur is through a user interface provided to enable sending of a link to one or more recipients. For example, the collaboration service  may output a user interface  accessible by a client device  over a network . The user interface  may be output in response to a selection of a send a link control to share a particular content item. The user interface  enables a user to select one or more recipients, input known contact info, and\/or submit a request to send a link to the one or more recipients. The collaboration service  may receive and process the request to identify intended recipients. This may involve parsing the request to extract contact info for the one or more recipients.","Different one-time sharing links are generated for each of the selected recipients (block ). Here, the collaboration service  may create a different one-time link for each individual recipient. This may occur substantially in the same manner as creating distinct links for different publish targets as discussed in relation to . For instance, links may be formatted to have a navigation path  and a sharing key  as with other links described herein. The one-time sharing links though contain information sufficient to designate the link as a one-time sharing link and\/or enable the collaboration service  to identify and handle the links as one-time sharing links. In one approach, the sharing key  can be mapped to an ACL that designates the link as a one-time sharing links. Additionally the sharing key  or another suitable identifier contained within a link can be used to flag the link as a one-time sharing link. In any case, the collaboration service  is able to examine a link, determine in some manner whether the link is a one-time sharing link, and handle the link accordingly.","Once appropriate one-time sharing links are generated, the collaboration service  may then send notifications having a unique one-time sharing link to each designated recipients. The collaboration service  may send notifications through different messaging service including for example email, instant messaging, text messaging, and so forth. In some cases, the collaboration service  may send notifications through associated partner sites such as social networks, in which case recipient is notified through messaging functionality provided by the partner sites.","As mentioned, links designated in some manner as one-time sharing links enable recipients to get limited, one-time access to a shared item for the purpose of selecting or registering an account to use for subsequent access to the item. In this manner, recipients are able to select accounts they find most convenient for accessing a shared item without the owner\/sharer of the item necessarily having contact information for those accounts or sending a link to the accounts.","To do so, an option for a recipient to select an account to use for access to the item is exposed responsive to a selection of the sharing link by the recipient (block ). An option to select an account may be provided in various ways and at different times. For example, an account selection user interface or dialog may be presented that enables selection of a particular account at an appropriate time during an authentication sequence. Through the dialog, a user may be prompted to select a current account, choose a different account, and\/or create a new account to use for accessing the shared item. An example dialog is discussed below in relation to .","The timing for presenting the account selection option may be dependent upon access permissions associated with the one-time sharing link. For example, a link may be configured to require sign-in before any access to the item is provided. If this is the case, an authentication sequence that incorporates the option to select an account may be initiated right away when a link is used. On the other hand, if some level of access, such as view only access, is granted by a link, then selection of the link does not cause initiation of the authentication sequence right away. Instead, appropriate access to the item is granted and the recipient of the link may view the item. When the recipient attempts an action that requires sign-in and\/or different access privileges, the authentication sequence incorporating the option to select an account may be initiated at that time. One example authentication sequence that can be employed to control access to items and account selection is discussed below in relation to .","Permissions on the item are associated with the selected account (block ) and the link is invalidated for subsequent use to gain permissions on the object (block ). Thus, when an option to select an account is exercised using a one-time sharing link, the selected account is granted permissions on the item. This can occur by associating the account with the item through an ACL or otherwise.","Similar to the tiered access level approach discussed above in relation to the group opt-in option, different access levels may be used in conjunction with one-time sharing links. Here, a first level of access may be associated with a one-time sharing link before the link is redeemed. For instance, an unredeemed link may be associated with initial, basic permissions for unauthenticated users that allow a user simply to view the item. Again, the initial permissions may be set by default and\/or may be designated by the user. In general, the initial permissions grant limited or no access to the item. Redeeming the link by selection of an account causes permissions to change from the initial, basic permissions to enhanced permissions established for authenticated users when the link is created. For example, the enhanced permissions may be set to enable editing in addition to viewing the item. Thus, various different access levels may be associated with an item using the one-time sharing link and granted to a user of the link after redeeming the link.","Once a one-time sharing link is redeemed, the collaboration service  invalidates the link for subsequent access to the item. For instance, an ACL may be updated to reflect that the one-time sharing link has been redeemed. This may occur by revoking the sharing key  associated with the link or in another suitable manner that revokes privileges for the one-time sharing link. The one-time sharing link will no longer be valid to access the item or gain permissions to the item. Instead, permissions are now associated with the selected account, which can be used for subsequent access to the item.","Consider now  that depicts a procedure  for an authentication sequence in which one-time sharing links are employed for selection of an account in accordance with one or more embodiments. Selection of a one-time sharing link for a shared item is detected (block ). A determination is made regarding whether the link involves a sign-in to gain access to the shared item (block ). The determination may be based on tiered access levels assigned to a link as discussed earlier in this document. For example, sign-in may optionally be required by a user when a one-time sharing link for a shared item is created. Effectively, the one-time sharing link will then provide limited access for the purpose of selecting an account to use to access the corresponding shared item.","If the link does not involve a sign-in, access to the item is enabled with unauthenticated permissions (block ). The unauthenticated permissions represent initial, basic permissions set by default or by user selections when the one-time sharing link is created. Thereafter, the system may monitor to detect action that does involve the sign-in (block ). It should be noted that unauthenticated access can be disabled by forcing link redemption. In this case, the owner may designate at the time of link creation that a sharing link be redeemed before permissions are granted. Effectively, the link is configured without unauthenticated permissions and a recipient may be unable to even view an item before redeeming the associated link.","Both when the link requires sign-in per block  and when action requiring sign-in is detected per block , a determination is made as to whether the user is already signed-in (block ). If the user is not already signed-in, the user is redirected to login (block ) and the user is authenticated to a selected account (block ). This may occur through the collaboration service  and\/or an authentication service accessible via the service provider  using any suitable authentication techniques. In general, the user provides credentials (e.g., username and password) to access and account which are verified to ensure that the user is who they claim to be. In at least some embodiments the user may be prompted to log-in to an account the use would like to use for access to the item at this point. In addition or alternatively, an account selection prompt may also occur later within the authentication sequence as described below.","After authenticating the user per block  and also when user is already signed-in per block , a determination is made as regarding whether the user already has authenticated access to the shared item (block ). If so, the one-time sharing link is redeemed (block ) and access to the shared item is provided with authenticated permissions (block ). In this case, an assumption may be made that the user prefers to use the current account that already has permissions on the shared item. As such, access is granted without prompting to select a different account. In an alternate approach, a switch account option may be provided to enable the user to switch accounts even if the user already has authenticated access per block . However, in the depicted example access is granted through the current account already having access and if not already the case, the link is redeemed and invalidated for subsequent use.","Otherwise, if the user does not have authenticated access per block , a determination of the validity of the one-time sharing link is made (block ). Here a check is made to ensure that the link has not been previously redeemed. If the one-time sharing link is not valid, access is denied (block ) and an error message may be presented indicating that the one-time sharing link is not valid to gain access to the shared item.","On the other hand, when the one-time sharing link is determined to be valid, a check is made regarding whether an optional auto-redeem option is set (block ). The auto-redeem option can be selectively set as a design parameter to control whether one-time sharing links are redeemed automatically or through an account selection dialog. In addition or alternatively, a configurable parameter for the auto-redeem option may be associated with items and\/or user accounts. In this example, the configurable parameter may be set by an item owner and\/or individually for accounts of link recipients. If the auto-redeem option is set, the flow proceeds back to blocks  and  where the one-time sharing link is automatically redeemed and access to the shared item is provided with authenticated permissions. This may occur without outputting a prompt to the user.","If the auto-redeem option is not set, though, an account selection dialog (e.g. redeem dialog) prompting the user to select an account is output (block ). Based on input obtained via the account selection dialog, a determination is made regarding whether to use the current account or select another account (block ). If the current account is selected, the flow again proceeds back to blocks  and  where the one-time sharing link is redeemed and access to the shared item is provided with authenticated permissions. Otherwise, the flow proceeds back to block  where the user is redirected to login and authentication to a different account may occur. Blocks - may therefore be repeated for the different account until the current account is selected at block .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12","FIG. 3"],"b":["1200","122","122","1202","116","308"]},"Here the example user interface  is again operable to provide a sharing link  for the \u201cReunion\u201d folder of . In this case, the interface can be used to submit a request that causes the collaboration service  to create and distribute one-time sharing links for selected recipients that may be formatted, distributed, and employed as discussed previously. In particular, an address portion  is depicted that may be used to input email addresses or other contact information for selected recipients. As mentioned, the sender does not necessarily have to send the link to accounts the recipients ultimately choose to access the shared item. A message portion  enables the sender to optionally include a personal message along with the sharing link. Additionally, a require sign-in control  is operable to selectively set whether a sign-in is involved to access the item by the recipients. When require sign-in is set, the one-time sharing links are configured to provide limited access to a shared item for the purpose of selecting an account. Otherwise a default or selected access level established for unauthenticated users may be associated with one-time sharing links created through the dialog. Although not shown in this particular example, the sender may also be able to access a permissions control or menu to designate access levels for both initial permissions before sign-in (e.g., unauthenticated permissions) and enhanced permissions after sign-in (e.g., authenticated permissions) in accordance with techniques discussed in relation to .","The example user interface  of  further includes a send control .
