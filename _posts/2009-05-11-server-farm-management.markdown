{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["In a computing environment, servers are often used to store and manage data. A server may be a typical computing device used by a consumer, for example, or a specialized computing device designed merely for specific data storage and management operations. Often servers can be used individually or linked together to provide services to users, such as a home computer network, an office data storage network, or an online gaming environment.","Servers may also be combined into a very large server farm that manages and stores very large amounts of data. Typical use of very large server farms may include online services systems, such as sites that provide Internet-based search engines, online mapping, document upload and retrieval services, and more. Other uses may include large enterprises, such as multi-national corporations and governmental operations, or large communication services, such as phone companies, Internet-service providers, and Internet-content provider or aggregators. These very-large server farms often comprise many hundreds or thousands of servers linked to appear as a single system to an end-user.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Often, servers in a server farm are accumulated over time to increase capacity as usage grows. Because the computer-based hardware development cycle is progressing rapidly, accumulated hardware for a server farm is typically heterogeneous (e.g., more recently added hardware is of differing types or configurations than previously added hardware). Therefore, a server farm can have hardware of different row power, such as computer processing unit (CPU) and input\/output (I\/O) bandwidth.","Having heterogeneous hardware configurations in a server farm can make it difficult and expensive to benchmark individual server performance, as each server may need to be tested instead of testing one and apply the results to the rest. Further, an aggregated performance of the heterogeneous servers may be quite different from an additive summation of individual performances, which can make it difficult for desired load-balancing, among other things, of the system. Additionally, aggregated performance of a heterogeneous hardware configuration is very complicated and difficult to replicate in a laboratory environment, due to large volumes of traffic in real-life. Combined, these problems provide a complicated task for system administrators to effectively manage a server farm, such as capacity resource management and planning.","Prior solutions focus on benchmarking an application against a few varieties of hardware row power, and derive mathematical models of projected software capacity in non-test hardware configurations. These methods are expensive and typically require extensive testing. Further, prior methods do not produce aggregated performances for heterogeneous hardware configurations in a sever farm, nor can they project resource planning needs.","Techniques and systems are disclosed herein that directly measure capacity of a server farm, and can heuristically project capacity expansion needs based on traffic growth trends. Further, the techniques and systems allow a server farm that comprises heterogeneous hardware configurations to be managed more effectively.","In one embodiment, collecting and analyzing server farm system information for effectively managing a server farm comprises identifying a list of servers that are running in the server farm, for example, by accessing a server farm database that comprises active servers and respective application services running on the servers. Once servers are identified, performance metrics can be collected from the servers, such as hardware metrics (e.g., CPU speed, I\/O bandwidth, storage, memory) and server usage metrics (e.g., applications, traffic counts, response times), and stored in a collection database. The stored performance metrics can then be analyzed in accordance with a server farm management request, such as from an administrator or an automated system request.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104"]},"In one embodiment, a plurality of users  may be connected to the server farm  over a connection network, such as the Internet. As an example, a server farm may be part of an Internet-based services network (e.g., search engine, map service, virtual storage) that allows users  to retrieve information that may be stored on or accessed by the server farm . The server farms can be further connected to other networks , such as the Internet, for updating and retrieving information stored on the servers  in the server farm .","Typically, one or more administrators  are tasked with managing the server farm's operations, which can include ongoing software and hardware maintenance, as well as planning for capacity increases based on user traffic. For example, as more users  access the server farm, and\/or more services are added to the server farm, a corresponding increase in user traffic is likely. Therefore, in this example, an administrator  may wish to plan for adding hardware and\/or software resources to the server farm based on the increase in traffic.","A method may be devised that provides for collecting computing resource consumption information for a server farm, and analyzing that information in association with the server farm's resources to develop capacity planning information, for example.  is a flow chart diagram of an exemplary method  for collecting and analyzing server farm system information for effectively managing a server farm.","The exemplary method  begins at  and involves identifying a list of servers running in the server farm, at . In one embodiment, the list of servers may be retrieved from a database that is used to store hardware and software configurations for the server farm. Some large server farms that are used to provide online services can comprise hundreds or thousands of servers, for example, so an administrator may utilize a database to facilitate management of the multitude of servers and services.","Further, in one embodiment, the hardware configurations for servers in the server farm may be heterogeneous. For example, when a new server is added to the server farm, or a hardware upgrade is undertaken, the newly installed hardware may be different than the existing servers or hardware. Therefore, in this embodiment, when identifying the servers in the server farm, two or more servers may be heterogeneous, comprising different hardware configurations.","At , performance metrics are collected from respective identified servers and stored in a collection database. Respective servers that are identified in the list of servers for the server farm can be probed to determine performance metrics. In one embodiment, collecting performance metrics can comprise collecting hardware configuration metrics for a server, and collecting server usage metrics for the server. For example, in order to develop a resource capacity plan for the server farm, an administrator may wish to identify specific hardware and software configurations for respective servers, along with traffic patterns and resource usage over time.","One embodiment  of hardware configuration metrics and server usage metrics that can be collected is illustrated in . In this embodiment , collecting hardware configuration metrics  can comprise collecting central processing unit (CPU) configuration information for the server , such as CPU type and processing speed. Further, collecting hardware configuration metrics  can comprise collecting memory configuration information for the server , such as size and speed. Additionally, collecting hardware configuration metrics  can comprise collecting storage configuration information for the server , such as disk size and speed. Collecting hardware configuration metrics  can also comprise collecting data traffic routing information for the server , such as bus speed, and amounts and types of connections (e.g., network and database connections).","In this embodiment , collecting server usage metrics  can comprise collecting information for application services installed on the server , such as the types and number of applications running on the server that are utilized by server farm users (e.g.,  from ). Further, collecting server usage metrics  can comprise collecting incoming traffic counts over time to the server , such as a number of requests for data from the server farms (e.g., as sent by users of an online service). Collecting server usage metrics  can comprise collecting server hardware usage data  for the respective hardware units associated with a server, such as CPU, memory, I\/O elements, bandwidth, and\/or database connections, for example. Additionally, collecting server usage metrics  can comprise collecting response counts over time from the server , such as responses to requests sent by the servers in the server farm. Collecting server usage metrics  can also comprise collecting transaction types for the server , such as a type of request and\/or type of response.","In one aspect, collecting hardware configuration metrics and server usage metrics can be based on a type and location of the server in the server farm, and services that it may provide, for example. For example, a server farm may comprise front end web-based services that can be accessed by users to provide the web-based services, such as search engines, mapping, document storage and retrieval. In this example, the front end servers may comprise one or more applications configured to provide services to the users, CPUs that provide faster processing speed, and larger\/faster memory for running multiple applications.","Further, in this aspect, a server farm may comprise backend storage-focused servers that can provide large amounts of data storage for a server farm. For example, where a server farm may be used to provide online services, the backend servers may be used to store indexes for search engine document retrieval, data to provide maps for an online mapping service, and documents stored by users of a document storage and retrieval service. In this example, the servers may comprise large amounts of disk or other non-volatile data storage, along with network connections for database management, and data storage and retrieval operations.","In another aspect, collection of performance metrics for a server farm may be based on a type of analysis that is requested or pre-determined by rules setup by an administrator or automated system manager. In one embodiment, when collecting data for a capacity calculation or forecast, elements of the calculation can be collected by identifying where a bottle neck in the hardware configuration may occur (if at all). For example, during performance metric collection, one may be able to identify that a first bottle neck in the data request\/response stream occurs in the CPU, memory, a database connection, or the I\/O services. In this way, in this example, resource planning may be undertaken based on identifying potential bottlenecks in the hardware configuration.","In one embodiment, the server identification and metric collection can be automated, such that the server farm periodically collects performance metrics for its respective servers and stores the information in the collection database. In this way, in this embodiment, current and historical information may be available for analysis at anytime, for example, by a system administrator or by some automated server farm management tool. In another embodiment, the server identification and metric collection may be in response to a specific command by the system administrator, for example, in response to a specific server farm management request.","It will be appreciated that the methods and systems, described herein, are not limited to the performance metrics embodiments described above. These embodiments are illustrative of typical types of performance metrics that can be utilized by the methods and systems, described herein, however, it is anticipated that those skilled in the art may devise alternate performance metrics that can be collected and utilized in these methods and\/or systems.","Returning to , at  of the exemplary method , the performance metrics stored in the collection database are analyzed in accordance with a server farm management request. In one embodiment, a server farm management request may comprise an automated request sent by a component in the server farm management component. For example, the server farm management component may wish to periodically determine whether the current resources are capable of handling the expected traffic load at a desired response rate, such as for alerting purpose. In another embodiment, a request may be developed by a system administrator for a particular purpose, such as developing a resource capacity plan for adding new hardware.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","208","410","208","412","208","414","208","416"]},"In this embodiment , determining a forecasted server farm resource capacity plan  can be based on one or more factors. Existing server farm hardware  (e.g., types of servers, CPU speed, memory size, storage space, I\/O resources, etc.), server farm resource usage  (e.g., which servers, storage, I\/O, etc. are used more than others), and server farm traffic patterns  (e.g., how many requests for which services) can be utilized for forecasting a resource capacity plan. Further, in this embodiment , forecasted server farm traffic patterns (e.g., as in ) can be used to plan. Additionally, future releases of application services for the server farm, and available hardware upgrades to the server farm can be utilized when developing a resource capacity plan, such as to determine which applications and\/or hardware upgrades can yield an improved response time or resource use per request cost.","It will be appreciated that the methods and systems, described herein, are not limited to the analysis embodiments described above. These embodiments are illustrative of typical types of analysis that can be utilized by the methods and systems, described herein, however, it is anticipated that those skilled in the art may devise alternate analysis that can performed by these methods and systems.","Returning to , having analyzed the data stored in the collection database, the exemplary method  ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","504","506","508"]},"At , it can be determined whether a particular server is actually in service (e.g., operating appropriately) in the server farm. If not, at , a next server can be identified and determined whether it is in service. If the server is in service, at , the particular server can be probed for performance metrics, which can be collected. At , the respective servers are identified and performance metrics are collected for the respective servers, at .","At , the collected performance metrics can be aggregated, such as by server, service, historically, or some other aggregation, and stored in a collection database, at . It will be appreciated that the server farm's topology database and the collection database may be comprised in a same component, distributed over the server farm, or maintained as separate entities.","At , the metrics stored in the collection database can be analyzed in accordance with a server farm management request . A request  may be generated by a server farm management component (e.g., automatically) in response to some activity or occurrence within the server farm, such as an automated resource capacity alert. Further, a request  may be generated by a user interface utilized by a server farm administrator, such as for capacity planning. In this embodiment, , a response report  can be returned from the analysis , for example, to the server farm management component or the system administrator.","In one embodiment, desired historical performance metrics may not be available for a particular server. As an example, when a new server is brought online, and or a new service is introduced on a server, historical metrics for that server would not be available. In this embodiment, corresponding lab derived performance metrics may be used when analyzing performance metrics. For example, while performance metrics may not be available for a particular server that is recently added to service, performance metrics for a comparable server having a comparable hardware configuration may have been collected in lab testing. In this embodiment, if the hardware configuration of the lab tested hardware is comparable to the newly installed hardware, the corresponding lab data can be used for the analysis of the server.","In one embodiment, a lab may utilize fixed hardware to derive a relative hardware cost of requests of different services running in a server farm. In one example, the relative costs between requests of services for the server farm can be derived by applying the relative cost to different physical hardware machines based on performance\/resource usage data that has been collected, and deriving a request per cost on those different sets of physical machines. Further, in one embodiment, traffic cost can be forecast on yet to be added machines, based on a machine's relative characteristics as compared with tested hardware configurations. In one example, a resource cost can be obtained through a request pipe-line (e.g., to determine a front end (FE) service cost, middle tier cost and\/or backend cost). In general, one backend component (e.g., SQL) supports multiple front end components. There could be a bottle neck on a backend component (e.g., SQL) before front end components experience bottle-necks (e.g., related to CPU, Memory etc), such that capacity planning could use the pipe-line cost module when forecasting whether the capacity of the system can provide adequate support, or whether one or more new hardware matrices should be investigated to provide the needed support.","A system may be devised that provides for collecting computing resource consumption information for a server farm, and analyzes the information in association with the server farm's resources to develop capacity planning information, for example.  is a component block diagram of an exemplary system  for collecting and analyzing server farm system information for effectively managing a server farm. For example, the exemplary system may be utilized by a system administrator to develop a resource plan for the server farm based on its capacity and use.","The exemplary system  comprises a topology information repository  (TIR) that is configured to store information for hardware and services running in the server farm. For example, the server farm may comprise a plurality of servers, each having one or more services (e.g., Internet-based services) running on them. In this example, the TIR  can be used to store server configuration information and respective service configuration for the servers. In one embodiment, the TIR may be comprised in its own storage system; however, the system is not limited to this embodiment. For example, the TIR may comprise a distributed database, distributed over a plurality of servers in the server farm. Further, for example, the TIR may be comprised in a shared database that shares resources with one or more other databases for the server farm.","The exemplary system  comprises a capacity collector  that is disposed on one or more servers in the server farm. For example, the capacity collector  may be a component disposed on a specialized server in the server farm, or it may be distributed over a plurality of servers on the server farm. The capacity collector  is configured to collect from the TIR  a list of servers running in the server farm and corresponding services running on the respective servers.","The exemplary system  further comprises a performance collector  that is operably coupled to the capacity collector . The performance collector  is configured to collect performance metrics from the servers and services identified by the capacity collector . In one embodiment, the performance collector  may be distributed over a plurality of servers in the server farm, and may collect performance metrics from respective servers on which it resides. In this embodiment, the capacity collector  may send information to the distributed performance collector , identifying respective servers and services.","In another embodiment, the performance collector  may reside on a specialized server, from which it probes respective identified servers for performance metrics, for example, pulling the metrics from the servers. In this embodiment, for example, a list of servers and services can be retrieved from (or sent from) the capacity collector . In another example, respective servers and their corresponding services may be retrieved from (or sent from) the capacity collector  as needed to complete the metrics retrieval process.","The exemplary system  further comprises a resource consumption repository  (RCR) that is operably coupled to the performance collector . The RCR  is configured to store performance metrics collected by the performance collector . In one embodiment, the RCR may be comprised in its own storage system; however, the system is not limited to this embodiment. For example, the RCR may comprise a distributed database, distributed over a plurality of servers in the server farm. Further, for example, the RCR may be comprised in a shared database that shares resources with one or more other databases for the server farm.","In one embodiment, the RCR  may be utilized to store historical performance metrics for the server farm. For example, the exemplary system  may be devised to automatically perform periodic capacity collection and performance collection operations. The automated data collection information can comprise historical information for particular servers and services running in the server farm, such as traffic counts, response times, etc. Therefore, for example, the RCR  may comprise both historical and current performance metrics for the respective servers and services running in the server farm.","The exemplary system  further comprises a data analyzer  that is operably coupled to the RCR . The data analyzer  is configured to analyze performance metrics stored in the RCR  in accordance with a server farm management request . For example, a request  for analysis may be an automated task from a server farm management component or created by a system administrator. The data analyzer  can facilitate in generating an analysis report  that is responsive to specific request elements (e.g., customized).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","610","610","702","702"]},"In the exemplary embodiment , the data analyzer  further comprises a hardware trend analyzer  that is configured to determine server farm user requests per hardware type trend information. For example, the hardware trend analyzer  may use the user requests that route to a particular server to determine a trend, such as a function that illustrates a how requests may be increasing over time for the server. In this way, in this example, the trend information may be used to forecast a resource plan that identifies a type and configuration of hardware that may handle the request trends.","The data analyzer  further comprises a resource capacity forecaster , which is configured to determine a resource capacity for the server farm based on the trend information. As an example, the trend information generated by the service trend analyzer  and\/or the hardware trend analyzer  may be used by the resource capacity forecaster  to determine when the server farm resources may no longer be capable of handling requests at a desired response rate, or at a desired resource cost per request. In one embodiment, an alert may be generated when the resource capacity forecaster  determines that a threshold for resource capacity is reached by requests. In this way, in this example, an administer may take action to prevent an undesirable response times that could affect user loyalty to an online services site.","The data analyzer  further comprises a resource capacity planner  that is configured to determine planned resource additions for the server farm based on the trend information. For example, by utilizing trend information and existing hardware metrics, the resource capacity planner  may be able to determine what type and amount of hardware and\/or software upgrades may be needed to meet a desired service level, such as response time and\/or resource cost per request. Further, in one embodiment, the resource capacity planner  may be used to compare changes in response time and\/or resource cost per request for alternate hardware and\/or software upgrade configurations. In this way, for example, an administrator may more readily plan for future upgrade costs and scheduling.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","854"]},"In this embodiment, the system comprises a server farm configuration updater  that can be configured to update database information for hardware and services running in the server farm  stored in the TIR . For example, servers, other hardware, and software components may be added (e.g., coming online after a fault, or upgrades), and\/or dropped (e.g., system failure, or upgrades) from the server farm on an ongoing basis. In one embodiment, the server farm configuration updater  can detect when a server is added and\/or dropped from active service in the server farm and update the TIR  accordingly.","In this exemplary embodiment, the capacity collector  comprises a server service determination component  that is configured to determine whether a server identified from the TIR  is in-service in the server farm. While the configuration updater  may be able to provide updated data base information, the server service determination component  can be used to probe a particular server that is identified by the capacity collector  to determine whether it is still active, for example.","Further, in the exemplary embodiment, the system comprises a performance metric aggregator , which is configured to aggregate performance metrics collected by the performance collector  in accordance with pre-determined rules. In one embodiment, an administrator may utilize a user interface  to set up aggregation rules for the performance metric aggregator . As an example, the aggregation rules may provide for aggregating incoming requests for a particular service on a particular server over a desired period of time. In this way, merely the data that is desired can be collected and aggregated in a useful manner, for example.","Additionally, in the exemplary embodiment, the system comprises a user interface  (UI), which can be configured to provide a server farm administrator with an ability to request server farm data analysis. As described above, a request  for data analysis may be automated or can come from a system administrator, for example. In this embodiment, the UI  can be used by the administrator to construct data analysis requests based on particular needs of the administrator. The UI  may be operably coupled with the data analyzer , which can retrieve information needed for the request from the RCR . After the requested analysis is performed, a report can be sent back to the UI  and utilized by the administrator.","Still another embodiment involves a computer-readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions configured to implement one or more of the techniques presented herein. An exemplary computer-readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in , wherein the implementation  comprises a computer-readable medium  (e.g., a CD-R, DVD-R, or a platter of a hard disk drive), on which is encoded computer-readable data .
