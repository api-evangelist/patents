title: Miniature high-resolution multi-spectral objective lens
abstract: A multi-spectral objective lens comprising a primary lens for receiving light reflected from an object, the light including wavelengths in the SWIR and LWIR spectral bands, and optical elements spaced from the receiving means for simultaneously imaging the SWIR light in one focal plane and the LWIR light in another focal plane, thereby allowing real-time image and sensor fusion.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT","TEST RESULTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, sold, imported, and\/or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America.","This invention relates in general to optics, and more particularly, to optical sensing apparatus.","Infrared focal plane sensors sense objects by imaging infrared light reflected from the objects. Because different substances interact with light in different ways, and different atmospheric conditions can uniquely hinder the transmission of several wavelengths, it is desirable to image many different wavelengths or regions of the infrared electromagnetic spectrum.","In the following, the terms SWIR and LWIR light will be used. By SWIR it is meant short-wave infrared, or the region of the electromagnetic spectrum between the wavelengths of 1000 nm and 2000 nm. By LWIR is meant long-wave infrared, or the region of the electromagnetic spectrum between the wavelengths of 8000 nm and 117000 nm.","In the past, different sensors were used for different infrared wavelength regions and the images were fused for display. To do this, a large amount of signal processing was required.","It is therefore an object of this invention to create co-registered images of two different infrared spectral bands that can be fused on a display with very minimal signal processing.","This and other objects of the invention are achieved in one aspect by a multi-spectral objective lens comprising means for receiving light reflected from an object, the light including wavelengths in the SWIR and LWIR spectral bands, and means spaced from the receiving means for simultaneously imaging the SWIR light in one focal plane and the LWIR light in another focal plane, thereby allowing real-time image and sensor fusion.","Another aspect of the invention involves a method of using a multi-spectral objective lens comprising the steps of providing an incoming beam to the lens composed of SWIR and LWIR light reflected from an object, imaging the SWIR light in the incoming beam to one focal plane and simultaneously imaging the LWIR light in the incoming beam to another focal plane, thereby allowing real-time image and sensor fusion.","Recent advancements in focal plane technology allow for the miniaturization of optical sensors by reducing the size of the focal plane itself. These focal planes have small functional elements and low power requirements. Both of these factors allow for smaller, larger format focal planes, with which very high resolution images can be obtained. This invention takes full advantage of this by providing a very high-resolution image in a very small package. It is unique in that it is an extremely lightweight and low profile multi-spectral imager. It may easily be head-mounted and used as a mobility and identification sensor. The invention provides a fast F\/# and wide field of view with relatively no distortion for both SWIR and LWIR spectral bands.","Additional advantages and features will become apparent as the subject invention becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein similarly-referenced numerals designate similarly-referenced parts, and wherein:","Referring to the figures,  shows a layout of the optical components of the multi-spectral objective lens . The lens combines two different optical pathways with a novel beam-splitter prism. The pathways will be described herein as the \u201cSWIR arm\u201d in reference to the Short-Wave Infrared imager, and the \u201cLWIR arm\u201d in reference to the Long-Wave Infrared imager. Both arms are shown integrated in . Note that both arms share the same primary optical lens  and the same prism . Both of these elements are made of Zinc Selenide, which is one of very few optical materials that will transmit both SWIR and LWIR. The common optical path passes through the primary lens  and the prism  to the 45-degree angled face  of the beam splitter. This prism surface of the angled face must be optically coated as hereinafter described to reflect the LWIR and transmit the SWIR.","This optical path description is now continued referring to  and , which respectively depict the separate LWIR and SWIR pathways.  follows the LWIR path after the reflection from the internal surface of the angled face  of prism . The first lens  after the prism  is preferably made of AMTIR-4, which is a moldable LWIR optical material that is manufactured by Amorphous Materials, Inc. It provides most of the focusing power in this arm. After this, a Zinc Sulfide lens  with an aspheric primary surface provides the main aberration correction for the LWIR. The final Zinc Selenide lens  gives chromatic aberration correction and field angle correction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["22","15","15","24","15"]},"To manipulate LWIR and SWIR as disclosed above, the angled face of prism  must be coated. To do this, the prism  is initially provided as half cubes  and . A first coating  is placed on the angled face  of half cube . First coating  comprises an LWIR\/SWIR splitting coating that is caused by vapor deposition of a plurality of layers in a manner known in the art. In similar fashion second coating  is placed on half cube . Second coating, however, comprises a polarization-sensitive SWIR coating, which allows for transmission of SWIR in one direction and reflection of SWIR in the opposite direction.","Once half cubes ,  are coated, the half cubes are held together by a housing (not shown) or other similar means known to the artisan so that the coated surfaces of the half cubes contact each other. In this manner, the aforementioned prism  with angled face  is established. With this configuration, LWIR and SWIR that enters the prism can be manipulated as described above.","The glasses used in the remaining elements denoted collectively by numeral  were chosen specifically for correction of lateral chromatic aberration. An aspheric surface on each of the positively powered Barium-Fluoride lenses gives further aberration correction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"]},"It is obvious that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
