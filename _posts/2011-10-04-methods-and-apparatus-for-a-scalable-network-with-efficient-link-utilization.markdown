These broadcast and\/or flood mechanisms, however, result in a scaling limitation to the enterprise network because as the enterprise network grows, such broadcast and\/or flooded traffic consumes a significant fraction of the overall network capacity. This consumption often makes the enterprise network inefficient for transmitting data traffic.","Accordingly, a need exists for an enterprise network architecture that can eliminate or reduce broadcast and\/or flooded traffic and efficiently use links within the enterprise network.","In some embodiments, an apparatus comprises a core network node configured to be operatively coupled to a set of network nodes. The core network node is configured to receive a broadcast signal from a network node from the set of network nodes, which is originated from a host device operatively coupled to the network node. The broadcast signal is sent via a tunnel from the network node to the core network node, such that other network nodes that are not included in the tunnel do not receive the broadcast signal. The core network node is configured to retrieve control information associated with the broadcast signal without sending another broadcast signal, and then send the control information to the network node.","In some embodiments, an enterprise network includes a core network node operatively coupled to a set of network nodes, which includes a set of wired network nodes and a set of wireless network nodes. A network node from the set of network nodes is configured to receive a broadcast signal from a host device operatively coupled to the network node. The network node is then configured to send the broadcast signal to the core network node via a tunnel such that network nodes from the set of network nodes that are not included in the tunnel do not receive the broadcast signal. The broadcast signal can be sent via a multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) tunnel or an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel that includes an aggregation network node from the set of network nodes operatively coupled between the core network node and the network node. Moreover the broadcast signal can be sent via one path from multiple paths included within the tunnel. In response to receiving the broadcast signal, the core network node is configured to retrieve control information associated with the broadcast signal without sending another broadcast signal, and then send the retrieved control information to the network node.","In some embodiments, the broadcast signal sent from the network node to the core network node can be an address resolution protocol (ARP) signal requesting a media access control (MAC) address associated with an internet protocol (IP) address. In, such embodiments, the core network node is configured to retrieve the control information from a database that includes an association between the MAC address of the host device and the IP address of the host device. In some embodiments, the broadcast signal sent from the network node to the core network node can be a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) request. In such embodiments, the core network node is configured to send a unicast signal to a DHCP server to retrieve an IP address associated with the host device. In some embodiments, the broadcast signal sent from the network node to the core network node can be a multicast signal that causes neighbor discovery (ND) to be performed (also referred to as an ND request). Such ND can be include performing link-layer address resolution. In other words, the multicast signal (or ND request) can request a media access control (MAC) address associated with an internet protocol (IP) address. ND can also be used to perform duplicate address detection (e.g., determine whether any other network node has the same IP address as the IP address included in the multicast signal). In such embodiments, the core network node, in response to the multicast signal (or ND request), retrieves the control information from a database that includes an association between the MAC address of the host device and the IP address of the host device, or information about the IP addresses assigned to other network nodes or host devices. In some embodiments, the host device can be a wired host device and the network node can be an access network node, where the wired host device is directly coupled to the access network node.","In some embodiments, an enterprise network includes a non-transitory processor-readable medium that stores code representing instructions for a processor of a network node that can be included in a set of network nodes. The instructions can cause the processor to receive a broadcast signal from a host device operatively coupled to the network node, which requests control information for the host device. In some embodiments, the host device can be a wired host device and the network node can be an access network node, where the wired host device is directly coupled to the access network node. In some other embodiments, the host device can be a wireless host device and the network node can be a wireless access point, where the wireless host device is wirelessly coupled to the wireless access point.","In response to the network node receiving the broadcast signal, the instructions can cause the processor to send the broadcast signal to a core network node via a tunnel such that the core network node retrieves the control information without sending another broadcast signal. Furthermore, network nodes from the set of network nodes that are not included in the tunnel do not receive the broadcast signal. In some embodiments, the broadcast signal can be sent from the network node to the core network node via a MPLS tunnel or an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel that includes an aggregation network node from the set of network nodes operatively coupled between the core network node and the network node. Next, the instructions can cause the processor to receive the control information from the core network node, and then send the control information to the host device.","In some embodiments, the broadcast signal sent from the network node to the core network node can be a DHCP request, which is configured to cause the core network node to send a unicast signal to a DHCP server to retrieve an IP address associated with the host device. In some embodiments, the broadcast signal sent from the network node to the core network node can be an ARP signal requesting a MAC address associated with an IP address. In such embodiments, the broadcast signal can be configured to cause the core network node to access an association between the MAC address and the IP address. Alternatively, the broadcast signal can be configured to cause the core network node to send a multicast request to each IP address not associated with a MAC address at the core network node to determine the MAC address associated with the IP address. In some embodiments, the broadcast signal sent from the network node to the core network node can be a multicast signal that causes neighbor discovery (ND) to be performed (also referred to as an ND request). Such ND can be include performing link-layer address resolution. In other words, the multicast signal (or ND request) can request a media access control (MAC) address associated with an internet protocol (IP) address. ND can also be used to perform duplicate address detection (e.g., determine whether any other network node has the same IP address as the IP address included in the multicast signal). In such embodiments, the core network node, in response to the multicast signal (or ND request), retrieves the control information from a database that includes an association between the MAC address of the host device and the IP address of the host device, or information about the IP addresses assigned to other network nodes or host devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","151","152","141","144","131","132","121","122","110","100"]},"A core network node (e.g., core network node , core network node ) can be a high-capacity switching device positioned in the physical core, or backbone, of an enterprise network (e.g., the overlay enterprise network ). In some cases, a core network node is also known as a core switch, a tandem switch or a backbone switch. In the overlay enterprise network , core network node  and core network node  are configured to connect the access devices (e.g., access network node -, access point -) and WLAN controller  with network , such that access to information services (e.g., persistent data and applications) located at network  can be provided to users that are coupled to the overlay enterprise network  via wired or wireless host devices (e.g., wired host device , wired host device , wireless host device ). Specifically, core network node  and core network node  operatively connect aggregation network node  and aggregation network node  with network , and forward packets of wired and\/or wireless sessions between aggregation network node , aggregation network node  and network  based on IP routing services. In other words, core network node  and core network node  act as a router working in layer 3 (i.e., network layer) of the open systems interconnection (OSI) model for the overlay enterprise network . In the overlay enterprise network , the access network nodes manage the wired sessions, core network nodes are configured to switch or route wired sessions' traffic received from the aggregation network node(s), while wireless sessions are managed by WLAN controller , as described in detail below.","Shown in , network  can be any network that is directly connected to the overlay enterprise network  through one or more core network nodes. For example, network  can be a data center network including one or more data servers that provide information services. For another example, network  can be a WAN (wide area network) access network that is used to connect the overlay enterprise network  to remote data resources. For yet another example, network  can be the Internet. Typically, the overlay enterprise network  acts as an access network providing, for wired or wireless clients, access to data resources, applications, and information services that are located at or provided from network .","In the overlay enterprise network , the access network nodes (e.g., access network node -) can be any device that can directly connect one or more wired host devices (e.g., wired host device , wired host device ) to the overlay enterprise network , such as a hub, an Ethernet switch, etc. In some cases, an access network node is known as an access switch, a network switch, or a switching hub. Furthermore, as described in detail herein, access network node - is configured to ensure packets are delivered between one or more aggregation network nodes, one or more wired host devices, and\/or one or more access points that are coupled to the access network nodes. In overlay enterprise network , a wired host device can be any device that can receive packets from and\/or send packets to an access network node through a wired connection, such as a desktop computer, a workstation, a printer, etc.","In the overlay enterprise network , the aggregation network nodes (e.g., aggregation network node -) can be any device that is used to aggregate multiple access network nodes and ensure packets are properly switched or routed within the network, such as a router, a layer-3 switch, etc. Furthermore, as described in detail herein, aggregation network node - is configured to route packets received from one or more access network nodes to another access network node or a core network node, based on the routing information provided in the packet and the routing policy implemented at aggregation network node -. In some embodiments, a collection of aggregation network nodes and associated access devices (e.g., access network nodes, access points) having a common connection to a redundant set of core network nodes are referred to as a pod. As shown in , aggregation network nodes - with their associated access network nodes - and access points - comprise a pod.","In the overlay enterprise network , core network node -, aggregation network node -, and access network node - are configured collectively to manage and forward wired traffic for one or more wired host devices that are operatively coupled to one or more access network nodes. Wired network nodes including access network nodes - and aggregation network nodes - are configured to switch or route packets of a wired session that are received from a wired host device, to another wired network node or a core network node, based on a destination address (e.g., a destination IP address, a destination MAC address) included in the packets. More specifically, some wired traffic that is received at an aggregation network node from an access network node may be switched or routed to another access network node from the aggregation network node if the traffic is destined to a destination device within the same pod. In contrast, the wired traffic destined to a destination device located in another pod is forwarded to a core network node, from which the traffic is forwarded into the other pod. For example, if wired host device  sends a packet to access network node  destined to wired host device , the packet can be first forwarded by access network node  to aggregation network node . Then, based on the destination IP address or MAC address included in the packet, the packet is further forwarded by aggregation network node  to access network node , which finally sends the packet to wired host device . For another example, if wired host device  sends a packet to access network node  destined to a device located in network , the packet can be first forwarded by access network node  to aggregation network node . Then, based on the destination IP address or MAC address included in the packet, the packet is further forwarded by aggregation network node  to core network node , which sends the packet into network  for further routing.","In the overlay enterprise network , wireless equipment, including WLAN controller  and access points -, forward wireless traffic that is received from one or more wireless host devices (e.g., wireless host device ). Specifically, WLAN controller  can be any device that can automatically handle the configuration of multiple access points, and act as a centralized controller configured to manage wireless sessions in an overlay of the wired network portion of the overlay enterprise network . An access point can be any device that connects a wireless host device to a wired network (e.g., via an access network node as shown in ) using, for example, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or other wireless communication standards. In some cases, an access point can be located on the same device together with an access network node, such as a wireless Ethernet router equipped with a wireless transceiver. In some other cases, an access point can be a stand-alone device, such as a wireless access point (WAP). Similar to a wired host device, a wireless host device can be any device that can receive packets from and\/or send packets to an access point through a wireless connection, such as, for example, a mobile phone, a Wi-Fi enabled laptop, a Bluetooth earphone, etc.","In the overlay enterprise network , WLAN controller  and access points - are configured collectively to manage and forward wireless traffic through intervening wired network nodes and core network nodes. Specifically, WLAN controller  can be configured to receive encapsulated packets of a wireless session from access point  or access point  via an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel through intervening wired network nodes and core network nodes, decapsulate the packets, and then bridge the decapsulated packets to core network node  or core network node , from which the decapsulated packets are further forwarded to the destination. Similarly, WLAN controller  is configured to receive packets of the wireless session from core network node  or core network node  destined to access point  or access point , encapsulate the packets according to an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling protocol, and then send the encapsulated packets to access point  or access point  via an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel through intervening wired network nodes and core network nodes, where the encapsulated packets are decapsulated and forwarded to a wireless host device. In some cases, an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel can be a control and provisioning of wireless access points (CAPWAP) tunnel, a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel, etc.","In the overlay enterprise network , one or more broadcast signals requesting control information for one or more host devices can be broadcast to all network entities within the overlay enterprise network , including all network nodes (e.g., access points, access network nodes, aggregation network nodes), core network nodes, and WLAN controller , such that the control information associated with the broadcast signals can be retrieved and sent to the host device(s) by the relevant recipient. The broadcast signals can be, for example, DHCP requests, ARP requests, ND requests, etc. The broadcast mechanisms for the broadcast signals, however, are operated in different fashions for the wired portion and the wireless portion of the overlay enterprise network , as described in detail below.","Typically, a DHCP request can be broadcast from a host device to all network entities within the overlay enterprise network , such that control information associated with the DHCP request can be retrieved and sent to the host device. Specifically, after a wired host device is initially directly coupled to an access network node of the overlay enterprise network , the wired host device can originate and send a DHCP request to the access network node directly coupled to the wired host device. In response to receiving the DHCP request, the access network node is configured to send the DHCP request to all network devices (e.g., aggregation network nodes) that are directly coupled to the access network node, which again are configured to send the DHCP request to all other network devices that are directly coupled to them. Thus, the DHCP request is broadcast in the overlay enterprise network , until it is received by a DHCP server operatively coupled to a network device in the overlay enterprise network . As a result, the DHCP server is configured to define control information associated with the DHCP request for the wired host device, and then send the control information to the access network node directly coupled to the wired host device, which is configured to forward the control information to the wired host device. The control information includes at least an IP address for the wired host device, and\/or other IP configuration information, such as a lease (length of time when the allocation of the IP address is valid), a subnet mask, a default gateway IP address, etc. Subsequently, the wired host device is configured accordingly based on the received control information.","For example, after wired host device  is initially directly coupled to access network node , wired host device  can originate and send a DHCP request to access network node . In response to receiving the DHCP request, access network node  is configured to broadcast the DHCP request to all other directly coupled network devices in the overlay enterprise network . That is, access network node  is configured to send the DHCP request to aggregation network node , which is then configured to send the DHCP request to access network node , core network node , and core network node , so on and so forth, until the DHCP request is received by a DHCP server (not shown in ) operatively coupled to a network device in the overlay enterprise network . As a result, the DHCP server is configured to define control information, including an IP address, for wired host device , and then send the control information back to access network node , which is configured to forward the control information to wired host device . Subsequently, wired host device  is configured accordingly based on the received control information.","Similar to a DHCP request, an ARP request can also be broadcast from a wired host device to all network entities within the overlay enterprise network , such that control information associated with the ARP request can be retrieved and sent to the host device. In the wired portion of the overlay enterprise network , similar to a DHCP request, an ARP request can be originated at and sent from a wired host device to an access network node directly coupled to the wired host device. The ARP request can be a signal requesting control information, such as a MAC address associated with an IP address, for the wired host device. The ARP request can then be broadcast from the access network node to other network entities in the overlay enterprise network , and from those network entities to other network entities, until the ARP request is received by a network device that has the control information associated with the ARP request (e.g., a MAC address associated with the IP address), for example, in a cached ARP table stored in the network device. That network device is then configured to send the control information back to the access network node directly coupled to the wired host device, from which the control information is forwarded to and then applied accordingly at the wired host device.","On the other hand, in the wireless portion of the overlay enterprise network , similar to a DHCP request, an ARP request can be originated at and sent from a wireless host device to an access point wirelessly coupled to the wireless host device. The access point can then be configured to send the ARP request to WLAN controller  via a tunnel (e.g., an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel), from which the ARP request is broadcast to other network entities in the overlay enterprise network . When the ARP request is received by a network entity that has the control information associated with the ARP request, that network entity is configured to send the requested control information back to WLAN controller , which is then configured to send the control information to the access point via the tunnel. Subsequently, the control information is forwarded from the access point to the wireless host device and then applied accordingly at the wireless host device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","251","252","241","244","231","232","221","222"]},"A core network node in a homogeneous enterprise network (e.g., core network node  or core network node  in the homogeneous enterprise network ) can be, for example, upgraded from a core network node in an overlay enterprise network (e.g., core network node  or core network node  in overlay enterprise network ). In such an upgrade, the core network node in a homogeneous enterprise network (e.g., core network node , core network node ) is a single device that combines for example a switch, a router, and a controller, which includes a control module (e.g., control module  for core network node  as shown in ) configured to manage wired\/wireless network nodes and\/or wired\/wireless user sessions. In other words, core network node ,  is a consolidation of at least a WLAN controller (e.g., WLAN controller ) and a core network node from an overlay enterprise network. On one hand, similar to a core network node from an overlay enterprise network, core network node ,  is still able to forward packets of wired sessions between an aggregation network node and a network that is operatively coupled to core network node , . On the other hand, unlike a core network node within an overlay enterprise network, core network node ,  can establish a wired session with an access network node, or establish a wireless session with an access point, through intervening wired network nodes, via a tunnel (e.g., the MPLS tunnel, an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel). Detail on tunneling of session data between a core network node and an access network node and\/or an access point within a homogeneous enterprise network is described below. In some embodiments, a core network node in a homogeneous enterprise network is referred to as a core SRC (switch, router, and controller).","Similar to core network nodes -, all other devices in the homogeneous enterprise network , including aggregation network node -, access network node -, and access point -, can be configured to operate in a homogeneous enterprise network. Specifically, the functionality of access network node - and aggregation network node - includes multiplexing client traffic, including packets of wired and wireless sessions, to core network node  or core network node  without any need for local switching or complex forwarding and classification functionality. For example, unlike aggregation network nodes - in overlay enterprise network , aggregation network node  does not need to be configured to switch or route a packet received from access network node  to another access network node based on a destination address included in the packet. Instead, aggregation network node  can be configured to forward the packet, through a portion of a tunnel between access network node  and core network node  (shown as the tunnel represented by  in ), to core network node , from which the packet is further switched or routed to the destination. Similarly stated, access network nodes - are configured to transmit wired traffic to core network node  or core network node  via a tunnel (e.g., the tunnel represented by  in ) through intervening aggregation network nodes -. Access points - are configured to transmit wireless traffic to core network node  or core network node  via a tunnel (e.g., a tunnel represented by  in ) through intervening access network nodes and aggregation network nodes.","In such a homogeneous enterprise network, different from the overlay enterprise network , the broadcast signals requesting control information (e.g., DHCP requests, ARP requests, ND requests) for one or more host devices typically do not need to be broadcast to all network entities within the homogeneous enterprise network , such that the control information associated with the request signals can still be retrieved and sent to the host devices. The non-broadcast mechanisms for the request signals including, for example, DHCP requests, ARP requests or ND requests, are described in detail below. In addition, similar to network  shown in , network  is a network coupled to the homogeneous enterprise network  through core network node  and\/or core network node , which provides access to data resources, applications, and\/or information services, to clients that are operatively coupled to the homogeneous enterprise network . For example, network  can be a data center network, a WAN, the Internet, etc.","In an enterprise network, if every network device included in the enterprise network or a portion of the enterprise network can be controlled by one or more core network nodes, then that enterprise network can be referred to as a homogeneous enterprise network, or that portion of the enterprise network can be referred to as a homogeneous portion of the enterprise network. In such a homogeneous network or portion of the network it is possible to use MPLS tunneling technology to tunnel traffic (e.g., wired or wireless traffic). If not every network node included in a portion of the enterprise network can be controlled by one or more core network nodes, then that portion of the enterprise network is referred to as an overlay enterprise network portion. In some embodiments, one or more network devices included in a homogeneous portion or an overlay enterprise network portion of an enterprise network can tunnel traffic using an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling technology (e.g., CAPWAP, Ethernet-in-GRE). MPLS tunneling technology can be used only in the homogeneous portion.","In a homogeneous enterprise network, a common tunneling technology can be used to forward both the wired traffic and the wireless traffic in any portion of the homogeneous enterprise network. For example, as described in detail herein, the MPLS tunneling technology or an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling technology can be used to forward both the wired traffic and the wireless traffic in any portion of the homogeneous enterprise network . In contrast, as described above with respect to , in an overlay enterprise network (e.g., overlay enterprise network ) an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling technology can be used to forward the wireless traffic in the wireless overlay portion of the overlay enterprise network, while typically no tunneling technology (e.g., an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling technology, the MPLS tunneling technology) is used to forward the wired traffic in the overlay enterprise network.","In an enterprise network, the tunneling technology applied between a core network node and an access device (e.g., an access network node, an access point) depends on the nature and\/or capabilities of the core network node, the access device, and the intermediate network device(s) (e.g., aggregation network node) present between the core network node and the access device. Specifically, in an overlay enterprise network (e.g., overlay enterprise network ), typically no tunneling protocol can be used between a core network node and an access device. In a homogeneous enterprise network (e.g., homogeneous enterprise network ), a tunneling protocol such as MPLS or an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling protocol can be used.","For example, if wireless communication device  sends a packet to access point  destined to wired communication device , the packet is first encapsulated according to MPLS or an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling protocol (e.g., CAPWAP, Ethernet-in-GRE) at access point , and then transmitted to core network node  via a MPLS tunnel or an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel through access network node  and aggregation network node  (shown as the tunnel represented by  in ). Next, the encapsulated packet is decapsulated according to MPLS or the Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling protocol at core network node . Then based on a destination IP address or a destination MAC address included in the packet, the packet is encapsulated again according to MPLS or the Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling protocol at core network node , and the encapsulated packet is forwarded by core network node  to access network node  via another MPLS tunnel or another Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel through aggregation network node  (shown as the tunnel represented by  in ). Finally, the encapsulated packet is decapsulated according to MPLS or the Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling protocol at access network node , from which the decapsulated packet is delivered to wired communication device .","For another example, if wired communication device  sends a packet to access network node  destined to an IP address located in network , the packet is first encapsulated according to MPLS or an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling protocol at access network node , and then transmitted to core network node  via a MPLS tunnel or an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel through aggregation network node  (shown as the tunnel represented by  in ). Next, the encapsulated packet is decapsulated according to MPLS or the Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling protocol at core network node . Finally, based on a destination IP address included in the packet, the decapsulated packet is forwarded by core network node  to network , and further delivered to the destination entity associated with the destination IP address in network .","In some embodiments, a centralized core architecture can be implemented in a homogeneous enterprise network. As described in detail herein, core network nodes of the homogeneous enterprise network can provide a single point of configuration and management for all network services as well as a single logic point of interaction for authentication, visibility and monitoring applications. As a result, various types of service modules can be aggregated and\/or consolidated at one or more core network nodes, such as firewall, intrusion detection policy (IDP), virtual private network (VPN) termination, and\/or load balancing, etc. In such a homogeneous enterprise network, services no longer need to be distributed at various levels in the network, and users can be given consistent policy that is independent of their access mechanism.","Moreover, the core network nodes of the homogenous enterprise network also can provide a single point of session management so that host devices (e.g., wired host devices such as wired host device  in , and wireless host devices such as wireless host device  in ) are authenticated upon entry into the homogenous enterprise network. As discussed herein, tunneled traffic, regardless of its origin, passes through the core network node(s) including for example, tunneled traffic from host devices that is directed through a core network node by the respective access network node (for a wired host device) and access point (for a wireless host device). Because such tunneled traffic passes through the core network nodes, the core network nodes can perform authentication as the host devices enter the homogenous enterprise network, This authentication of host devices allows the core network nodes to establish the location of each of these host devices and its associated MAC address. Thus, no unknown MAC addresses exist within the homogenous enterprise network and no need exists for flooding related to MAC addresses.","In the homogeneous enterprise network , unlike in the overlay enterprise network , the broadcast signals requesting control information (e.g., DHCP requests, ARP requests, ND requests) for one or more host devices typically do not need to be broadcast to all network entities within the homogeneous enterprise network , such that the control information associated with the broadcast signals can still be retrieved and sent to the host devices. Furthermore, the non-broadcast mechanism for broadcast signals is operated in a similar fashion for the wired portion and the wireless portion of the homogeneous enterprise network , as described in detail below.","Specifically, a host device (e.g., a wired host device, a wireless host device) can originate and send a broadcast signal to an access device (e.g., an access network node, an access point) coupled (e.g., directly coupled, wirelessly coupled) to the host device. After receiving the broadcast signal, unlike in an overlay enterprise network, the access device is configured to send the broadcast signal to a core network node operatively coupled to the access device via a tunnel (e.g., an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel, a MPLS tunnel). The tunnel can include one or more wired network nodes (e.g., an access network node, an aggregation network node) operatively coupled between the core network node and the access device. In response to receiving the broadcast signal, the core network node is configured to retrieve control information associated with the broadcast signal without broadcasting any other signal. In some embodiments, the associated control information can be retrieved from a data structure stored in a memory within the core network node itself (e.g., an identifier table such as identifier table  shown in ). In some other embodiments, the associated control information can be retrieved from a server device (e.g., a DHCP server) operatively coupled to the core network node. Thus, the core network node is configured to send the control information back to the access device via the tunnel, from which the control information is further forwarded to and then configured accordingly at the host device.","As an example, a DHCP request does not need to be broadcast from a host device to all network devices within the homogeneous enterprise network , such that control information associated with the DHCP request can be retrieved and sent to the host device. Specifically, after a host device (e.g., a wired host device, a wireless host device) is initially coupled (e.g., directly coupled, wirelessly coupled) to an access device (e.g., an access network node, an access point) of the homogeneous enterprise network , the host device can originate and send a DHCP request to the access device coupled to the host device. After receiving the DHCP request, the access device is configured to send the DHCP request to a core network node operatively coupled to the access device via a tunnel (e.g., an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel, a MPLS tunnel) through one or more intervening wired network nodes (e.g., an access network node, an aggregation network node). In response to receiving the DHCP request via the tunnel, the core network node is configured to send a unicast signal to a DHCP server (not shown in ) coupled to the core network node, such that control information associated with the DHCP request including an IP address assigned to the host device is retrieved from the DHCP server to the core network node. In some embodiments, the DHCP server is directly coupled to the core network node. In some other embodiments, the DHCP server is operatively coupled to the core network node, and the core network node can be configured to communicate with the DHCP server to retrieve the control information without broadcasting any signal. Next, the core network node is configured to send the control information to the access device via the tunnel, from which the control information is forwarded to and then applied accordingly at the host device.","For example, after wired host device  is initially directly coupled to access network node , wired host device  can originate and send a DHCP request to access network node . Access network node  is then configured to send the DHCP request to core network node  via a MPLS tunnel (shown as the tunnel represented by  in ) through aggregation network node .

Core network node  is then configured to send the control information to access point  via the Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunnel, from which the control information is forwarded to and then applied accordingly at wireless host device .","Similarly, an ARP request originated at a host device, which typically requests a MAC address associated with an IP address, does not need to be broadcast to all network entities within the homogeneous enterprise network , such that control information associated with the ARP request can be retrieved and sent to the host device. As described above, core network nodes  and\/or  in the homogeneous enterprise network  can be configured to retrieve control information associated with DHCP requests. Thus, core network nodes  and\/or  can be configured to learn the IP addresses and MAC addresses of at least a portion of the associated host devices, routers and\/or gateways (e.g., other core network nodes) in the homogeneous enterprise network  via DHCP snooping or other IP packet snooping. That is, when core network node  and\/or core network node  retrieves, from a DHCP server, control information associated with a DHCP request originated at a host device, core network node  and\/or  can be configured to learn the IP address and the MAC address of the host device by snooping the retrieved control information.

As described with respect to , in some embodiments, the MAC address of core network node  is associated with one or more IP addresses or a range of IP addresses in network  in an identifier table (e.g., identifier tables  and  shown in , respectively) in core network node . Subsequently, access point  is configured to forward the control information to wireless host device , at which the control information is applied accordingly.

The multicast request queries each of the network entities, such that one network entity having the IP address included in the ARP request can be identified. As a result, control information including the MAC address of an identified network entity may be retrieved and sent to the core network node. Thus, the core network node is configured to send the control information, including the MAC address associated with the IP address included in the ARP request, to the access network node via the tunnel.","Similar to a DHCP request and an ARP request, an Nd request originated at a host device does not need to be broadcast to all network entities within the homogeneous enterprise network , such that control information associated with the ND request can be retrieved and sent to the host device.

As a result, data packets destined to the IP address 192.168.10.1 are delivered to wired host device  based on the MAC address of wired host device  (i.e., MAC address 01:23:45:67:89:ab) being used as the destination MAC address in a header of the data packets.","In some other embodiments, an IP address of a network entity or a range of IP addresses of a group of network entities are associated with a MAC address of a routing device (e.g., core network node) in an entry of identifier table . In such embodiments, the IP address of the routing device may not be included in the IP address(es) in the entry of identifier table . The routing device, however, can be configured to forward data packets, which are destined to the range of IP addresses of the group of network entities, into the group of network entities, from which the data packets can be further forwarded to the destination. In other words, if a data packet destined to one of the group of network entities is received at a core network node that accesses or hosts identifier table , the data packet can be first delivered to the routing device based on the MAC address of the routing device being used as the destination MAC address in a header of the data packet, and then forwarded into the group of network entities by the routing device based on the destination IP address included in a header of the data packet.","For example, as shown in , identifier table  can be an identifier table implemented in or accessed by core network node , the IP address stored in the second entry of identifier table  can be associated with a group of network entities in network , and the MAC address stored in the second entry of identifier table  can be associated with core network node . Said in another way, the group of network entities in network  has a set of IP addresses 192.168.20.x, where \u201cx\u201d represents any integer number from 0 to 255, and core network node  has a MAC address 11:22:33:44:55:66. Furthermore, core network node  is configured to function as a router between the homogeneous enterprise network  and network . In other words, core network node  can forward packets from the homogeneous enterprise network  into network , and vice versa. When core network node  receives an ARP request requesting a MAC address associated with an IP address that falls into the range of 192.168.20.x, core network node  is configured to determine from identifier table  that the MAC address 11:22:33:44:55:66 is associated with such an IP address. Thus, core network node  is configured to send control information including the MAC address 11:22:33:44:55:66 to a network entity that originates the ARP request. As a result, data packets destined to the IP address that falls into the range of 192.168.20.x are first delivered to core network node  based on the MAC address of core network node  (i.e., MAC address 11:22:33:44:55:66) being used as the destination MAC address in a header of the data packets, and then forwarded into network  by core network node  based on the destination IP address in a header of the data packets being within the range of the IP addresses of network  (i.e., IP addresses 192.168.20.x).","In yet some other embodiments, an IP address of a network entity is not associated with any MAC address in identifier table . In such embodiments, as described with respect to , if a data packet destined to the IP address of the network entity is received at a core network node that accesses or hosts identifier table , the core network node can be configured to send a multicast request to a set of network entities whose IP addresses are not associated with any MAC address in identifier table , such that one network entity having the IP address may be identified. As a result, the MAC address of the identified network entity can be associated with the IP address and stored in identifier table . Furthermore, the data packet can be delivered to the network entity based on the MAC address of the network entity being used as the destination MAC address in a header of the data packet. Note that in this example, the core network node sends a multicast request to the set of network entities whose IP addresses are not associated with any MAC address in identifier table  without sending a multicast signal to the remaining network entities in identifier table  that are associated with an IP address.","For example, as shown in , identifier table  can be an identifier table implemented in core network node , and the IP address stored in the third entry of identifier table  can be associated with wireless host device . Said in another way, wireless host device  has an IP address of 192.168.10.100, and its MAC address is unknown to core network node . When core network node  receives an ARP request requesting a MAC address associated with the IP address 192.168.10.100, core network node  is configured to determine that no MAC address is associated with such an IP address in identifier table . Thus, core network node  is configured to send a multicast request to a set of network entities, including wireless host device , whose IP addresses are not associated with any MAC address in identifier table . In response to receiving the multicast request, wireless host device  is configured to send its MAC address to core network node . Thus, core network node  can provide the control information associated with the ARP request, including the MAC address of wireless host device , to a network entity that originates the ARP request. As a result, the MAC address of wireless host device  is inserted in the third entry of identifier table  (not shown in ), and subsequently sent data packets destined to the IP address 192.168.10.100 are delivered to wireless host device  based on the MAC address of wireless host device  being used as the destination MAC address in a header of the data packets.","In some embodiments, a core network node that accesses or hosts identifier table  can be configured to maintain and update identifier table , including inserting a new entry of an IP address and\/or a MAC address, modifying an IP address and\/or a MAC address, deleting an entry, etc. As described with respect to , core network nodes of a homogeneous enterprise network can be configured to learn IP addresses and\/or MAC addresses of associated network entities (e.g., host devices, routers, gateways, etc.) in the homogeneous enterprise network  via DHCP snooping and\/or other IP packet snooping. Particularly, such DHCP snooping and\/or other IP packet snooping is feasible for core network nodes of a homogeneous enterprise network because control traffic associated with DHCP requests and data packets are typically transmitted through core network nodes of the homogeneous enterprise network.","For example, as shown in , core network node  can learn the IP address and the MAC address of wired host device  by snooping the control information associated with a DHCP request originated at wired host device , which is retrieved by core network node  from a DHCP server operatively coupled to core network node . Thus, core network node  can be configured to insert a new entry including the IP address and the MAC address of wired host device  into identifier table  that is stored in or accessed by core network node . For another example, as shown in , core network node  can learn a change of the IP address of wireless host device  by snooping data packets of a session between wireless host device  and a network entity in network , which are transmitted through core network node . Thus, core network node  can be configured to update the IP address of wireless host device  in an entry of identifier table  that is stored in or accessed by core network node .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["791","792","700","791","743","792","751","743","751","721","721","722","700","700","721","751","743"]},"Similar to the host devices in the homogeneous enterprise network  in , host devices in the homogeneous enterprise network  can obtain IP addresses from DHCP server  by communicating through core network node . Specifically, after wired host device  is initially coupled to access network node , wired host device  can originate and send a broadcast signal containing a DHCP request to access network node . After receiving the DHCP request, access network node  is configured to send the DHCP request to core network node  via a tunnel (shown as the tunnel represented by  in ) through one or more intervening wired network nodes (e.g., an aggregation network node) (not shown in ). This DHCP request, however, is not broadcast or sent to other network devices. In response to receiving the DHCP request via the tunnel, core network node  is configured to send a unicast signal to DHCP server  such that control information associated with the DHCP request, including an IP address assigned to wired host device , is retrieved from DHCP server  to core network node . Next, core network node  is configured to send the control information to access network node  via the tunnel, from which the control information is forwarded to wired host device . Thus, wired host device  obtains an IP address assigned from DHCP server .","Similarly, after wireless host device  is initially coupled to access point , wireless host device  can originate and send a broadcast signal containing a DHCP request to access point .

According to such an appropriate routing protocol, each node within the homogeneous enterprise network  can compute all paths from itself to a final destination. In the example of , the core network node  can identify the multi-paths to access network node  (i.e., a path via links  and , and a path via links  and ), and access network node  can identify the multi-paths to core network node  (i.e., a path via links  and , and a path via links  and ). Thus, a packet can be sent, for example, from core network node  to access network node  (or vice versa) via either the path having links  and  or the path having links  and .","In some embodiments, a link between two network devices in a homogeneous enterprise network can be blocked for transmitting non-tunneled traffic (e.g., non-tunneled data traffic, non-tunneled control traffic). For example, as shown in , link  between access network node  and aggregation network node  is blocked (shown as a dashed line in ) for transmitting non-tunneled traffic. In other words, packets sent from aggregation network node  to access network node  and\/or traffic sent from access network node  to aggregation network node  that is not tunneled is blocked for using link . In some embodiments, non-tunneled traffic in both directions (e.g., traffic sent from and traffic sent to access network node ) can be blocked. In some other embodiments, only non-tunneled traffic in one of the two directions (e.g., traffic sent from or traffic sent to access network node ) can be blocked.","A link between two network devices in a homogeneous enterprise network that is blocked for transmitting non-tunneled traffic can be allowed to transmit tunneled traffic (e.g., tunneled data traffic, tunneled control traffic) associated with one or more predetermined tunneling protocols. For example, as shown in , link  between access network node  and aggregation network node  that is blocked for transmitting non-tunneled traffic can be allowed to transmit tunneled traffic associated with the MPLS protocol. Thus, the MPLS tunnel between access network node  and core network node  (shown as the tunnel represented by  in ) includes two separate paths, one path via aggregation network node  and the other path via aggregation network node . Similarly stated, tunneled traffic associated with the MPLS protocol can be transmitted between access network node  and core network node  via aggregation network node  (i.e., through link  and link ) or via aggregation network node  (i.e., through link  and link ).","Because routing protocols used for tunneling within a homogeneous enterprise network do not converge instantly, a possibility exists that forwarding loops could be formed within the network without a mechanism to prevent such forwarding loops. If such forwarding loops were allowed to persist, packets sent within the network could be looped indefinitely. Instead, a mechanism to prevent such forwarding loops can be used to ensure that any transient loops within the network does not result in indefinite packet forwarding. For example, when tunnels are based on the MPLS protocol, the MPLS labels that include a time-to-live (TTL) byte can be used. When tunnels are based on other protocols, similar time-to-live mechanisms can be used.","In some embodiments, only traffic that is tunneled based on one or more predetermined tunneling protocols can be allowed to be transmitted through a blocked link. In the example of , only traffic that is tunneled based on the MPLS protocol, but not traffic that is tunneled based on an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling protocol (e.g., CAPWAP, GRE), can be transmitted through link .","In some embodiments, tunneled traffic is allowed to be transmitted through a blocked link only if the tunneled traffic is originated at or destined to at least one of the two end entities of the link. In the example of , traffic tunneled between core network node  and access network node  can be transmitted through link  only if access network node  is the source or destination of the tunneled traffic. This example would include a tunnel associated with a wired host device (not shown in ) directly coupled to access network node , but not a tunnel associated with an access point directly coupled to access network node  and wirelessly coupled to a wireless host device. Note that aggregation network node  cannot be a source or destination of the tunneled traffic between core network node  and access network node .","In some embodiments, a blocked link can be allowed for transmitting tunneled traffic only if the link is included in a path of equal-cost multi-path (ECMP); otherwise the link is blocked for transmitting tunneled traffic. For example, as shown in , link  is included in an ECMP path that connects core network node  and access network node  via aggregation network node  (i.e., via link  and link ), which has an equal cost as the other ECMP path that connects core network node  and access network node  via aggregation network node  (i.e., via link  and link ).

Alternatively, the control information can be received via another tunnel from the core network node to the network node. In the example of , after retrieving the control information including the MAC address of wireless host device , access network node  can be configured to receive the control information from core network node  via the same tunnel (shown as the tunnel represented by  in ) that is used to send the ARP request from access network node  to core network node .","At , the control information can be sent from the network node to the host device. In the example of , after receiving the control information including the MAC address of wireless host device  from core network node , access network node  can be configured to send the control information to wired host device .

Any portion of the apparatus and\/or methods described herein may be combined in any combination, except mutually exclusive combinations. The embodiments described herein can include various combinations and\/or sub-combinations of the functions, components and\/or features of the different embodiments described.","While shown and described above with respect to  as DHCP requests and\/or ARP requests being handled by core network nodes without being broadcast in an enterprise network, in other embodiments, other broadcast signals can also be handled by core network nodes without being broadcast in the enterprise network. For example, inverse address resolution protocol (InARP) requests that request an IP address associated with a MAC address can also be handled by a core network node without being broadcast in an enterprise network. Similar to handing an ARP request, in response to receiving an InARP request from a network entity via a tunnel, a core network node can be configured to retrieve control information associated with the InARP request without sending a broadcast signal, and send the retrieved control information to the network entity via the tunnel.","While shown and described above with respect to  and  as the control information associated with a DHCP request including an IP address, a lease, a subnet mask, and\/or a default gateway IP address, etc., in other embodiments, other control information related to IP configuration can also be optionally included in the control information associated with a DHCP request. For example, the control information associated with a DHCP request can include an IP address of a controller (e.g., a core network node). For another example, the control information associated with a DHCP request can include an IP address of local caching domain name server (DNS) resolvers. In addition, similar to a DHCP request, while shown and described above with respect to  and  as the control information associated with an ARP request including a MAC address associated with an IP address, in other embodiments, other control information related to the associations of MAC addresses with IP addresses can also be optionally included in the control information associated with an ARP request.","While shown and described above with respect to  as identifier table  being included in memory  within core network node , in other embodiments, an identifier table can be located in a memory separate from and operatively coupled to a core network node. In some embodiments, an identifier table can be located in a memory within a separate device that is operatively coupled to a core network node. In such embodiments, the core network node can be configured to access the memory that hosts the identifier table to retrieve and\/or update control information such as MAC addresses and\/or IP addresses stored in the identifier table. For example, a processor (e.g., processor  in ) of the core network node can be configured to send a unicast signal containing an IP address to the device with the memory that hosts the identifier table, such that control information including a MAC address associated with the IP address can be retrieved from the identifier table and sent to the core network node. For another example, a control module (e.g., control module  in ) of the core network node can be configured to send a control signal to the device with the memory that hosts the identifier table, instructing an entry including an IP address and\/or a MAC address stored in the identifier table to be modified.","While shown and described above with respect to  as control module  being included in core network node , in other embodiments, a control module can be separate from and operatively coupled to a core network node. In some embodiments, a control module can be located on a separate device that is operatively coupled to a core network node. In such an example, the control module can be configured to manage wired and\/or wireless sessions and apply user policies to wired and\/or wireless sessions by sending signals (e.g., control signals) to and receiving signals from the core network node. For example, the control module can send a control signal to an tunnel module in the core network node, instructing the tunnel module to encapsulate or decapsulate a received packet, according to a predetermined tunneling protocol (e.g., an Ethernet-over-layer-3 tunneling protocol, the MPLS protocol). For another example, the control module can send a control signal to a processor of the core network node, instructing the processor to compare information associated with a user session with data stored in a policy table within the core network node, such that an appropriate user policy can be determined and applied on the user session.","While shown and described above with respect to  as a tunnel between an access network node and a core network node including multiple paths, in other embodiments, tunnels between other types of network devices can also include multiple paths. For example, a tunnel between an access point and a core network node can include multiple paths. The access point can be configured to send a broadcast signal to the core network node via one path from the multiple paths included within the tunnel, and the core network node can also send control information associated with the broadcast signal to the access point via one path from the multiple paths in a similar way.","While shown and described above with respect to  as aggregation network nodes - with their associated access network nodes - and access points - comprising a pod, in other embodiments, a pod can include less than two or more than two aggregation network nodes and their associated access devices (e.g., access network nodes, access points).

Furthermore, while shown and described above with respect to , ,  and  as a redundant set of core network nodes connected to a pod including two core network nodes, in other embodiments, such a redundant set of core network nodes can include more than two core network nodes. For example, a cluster of any number (e.g., 3, 4, 5, etc.) of core network nodes can be coupled to a pod of aggregation network nodes and their associated access devices. Each core network node in the cluster of core network nodes can function as a controller, a hop and\/or a switch for the network devices included in the pod associated with the cluster of core network nodes.","Some embodiments described herein relate to a computer storage product with a computer-readable medium (also can be referred to as a processor-readable medium) having instructions or computer code thereon for performing various computer-implemented operations.
