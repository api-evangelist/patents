title: Feature vector clustering
abstract: One goal of computer services (e.g., email, web pages, blogs, advertisements, etc.) is to provide a user with Kinds (digital representations of everyday things) that may be relevant and interesting to the user. Users and Kinds may be plotted within a multidimensional matrix as feature vectors based upon their respective characteristics. An unsupervised clustering technique may be executed upon the matrix to create a mathematical cluster of feature vectors having similar characteristics. For example, a clothing cluster may comprise a dress Kind, a shoe Kind, a wool Kind, a watch Kind, etc. because the unsupervised clustering technique may determine these Kinds are plotted within the matrix in such a way that they have similar characteristics relating to clothing. The unsupervised clustering technique may also be utilized in determining which Kinds may be relevant to a user given a particular context with which a user is engaged with a computer resource.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Many users interact with computer resources daily. The user's experience of these computer resources may involve navigation, discovery, and interaction with data items (e.g., files, emails, images, web searches, etc.). For example, the user may access their work email or perform a web search using a mobile device. Unfortunately, the user's experience may be limited because the devices through which the user and computer resources interact may not understand the user's interests, detailed information of the data items with which the user interacts, and\/or the context with which the user interacts with the data items. For example, when a user checks their calendar for an upcoming trip through a work computer, the work computer may not understand the context of the user's interactions and thus may not understand that it may be advantageous to provide the user with additional information, such as itinerary information.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Among other things, a technique for determining a relevancy between one or more Kinds and a user and a technique for creating a mathematical cluster of similar feature vectors is disclosed herein. It may be appreciated that a Kind may be interpreted as a digital representation of everyday things, such as a data structure defining a car. Characteristics of a Kind and a user may be represented as Kind feature vectors and user feature vectors, which may be plotted within a matrix based upon their respective characteristics. The matrix may be, for example, a data structure representing a multidimensional space, wherein dimensions correspond to characteristics that Kinds and\/or users may relate to in varying degrees. Matrix operations, such as unsupervised clustering techniques, may be executed upon the matrix to determine relevancy and\/or similarity between Kinds and\/or users.","In determining relevancy, a user context may be determined when a user interacts with a computer resource (e.g., an office context may be determined when the user opens their work email). An unsupervised clustering technique may be utilized to classify one or more Kind feature vectors as relevant with respect to a user feature vector in view of the user context. The user context may be taken into account to further determine what Kind feature vectors are relevant. That is, if a user is within an office context, then Kind feature vectors relating to office may be more relevant, for example. In one example, relevancy may be determined based upon executing the unsupervised clustering technique upon the matrix, such that feature vectors closer to one another may be interpreted as more relevant than feature vectors further away from one another because feature vectors closer to one another may comprise similar characteristics that may be relevant in view of the user context.","The unsupervised clustering technique, for example, may comprise a cosine similarity operation, a Laplacian, a Euclidian distance, a Kernal method, an SVM framework, and\/or other techniques that may be executed upon the matrix. The unsupervised clustering techniques may be executed upon the matrix to create a mathematical cluster comprising one or more Kind feature vectors. The one or more Kind feature vectors may comprise characteristics that are relevant to characteristics of the user feature vector in view of the user context, thus the one or more Kind feature vectors may be classified as relevant with respect to the user feature vector.","A technique for creating a mathematical cluster of feature vectors based upon a similarity metric is disclosed herein. A mathematical cluster comprising one or more feature vectors may be created using an unsupervised clustering technique in view of a similarity metric. In one example, a feature vector may represent characteristics that a Kind (e.g., a Kind feature vector) or a user (e.g., a user feature vector) may relate to. The feature vectors may be plotted within a matrix based upon their respective characteristics. The unsupervised clustering technique may be executed upon the matrix to create the mathematical cluster of similar feature vectors based upon their position within the matrix with respect to one another. For example, an unsupervised clustering technique may create a mathematical cluster comprising Kind feature vectors relating to sports based upon a sports similarity metric. The unsupervised clustering technique may determine which Kind feature vectors comprise characteristics relating to sports based upon their distance from one another within the matrix, for example.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","A user's experience of computer resources may involve interacting with data items (e.g., web content, local content, subscription content, and\/or shared content). The user's experience may be enhanced by understanding the user's interests and classifying data items with which the user interacts. For example, if a user writes an email regarding the use of orange peels as an air freshener, then a digital representation of an orange (e.g., an orange Kind) may be classified as relating to an air freshener and\/or a home cleaning product. The user may also be classified as having an interest in air fresheners and\/or home cleaning products. This classification technique allows additional information and more advanced interactions to be presented to users.","A Kind may be interpreted as the digital representation of everyday things (e.g., a desk Kind may be a digital representation of a desk; an orange Kind may be a digital representation of an orange\u2014the color and\/or the fruit). A feature vector may be a data structure representation of the conceptual space within which a Kind (e.g., a Kind feature vector) or a user (e.g., a user feature vector) digitally exists. That is, a feature vector provides information regarding characteristics that a Kind or a user may relate to in varying degrees. Feature vectors may comprise one or more dimensions (e.g., millions of dimensions), wherein a dimension corresponds to a characteristic (e.g., red, wood, sports, office, travel, boat, etc.) that a Kind or a user may relate to in varying degrees. For example, a desk Kind feature vector may have thousands of dimensions (e.g., a wood dimension, a seat dimension, an office dimension, a sport dimension, a boat dimension, etc.). Respective dimensions may comprise probabilistic values from 0 to 1, wherein values close to 0 indicate the feature vector has a low probability of relating to the characteristic of the dimension and values close to 1 indicate the feature vector has a high probability of relating to the characteristic of the dimension.","A technique for classifying feature vectors as relevant to a user and a technique for clustering similar feature vectors into mathematical clusters is provided herein. Feature vectors may be plotted within a matrix. The matrix may be a data structure representing a multidimensional space of characteristics, wherein a dimension corresponds to a characteristic. A feature vector may be plotted as a point within the matrix based upon one or more dimensions of the feature vector (e.g., the plotted location of the point within the matrix may be dependent upon the probabilistic values of the dimensions). The matrix provides a mathematical\/graphical representation of one or more feature vectors based upon their characteristics. Unsupervised clustering techniques may be executed upon the matrix to determine relevancy (e.g., one or more Kind feature vectors that are relevant to a user) and similarity (e.g., a mathematical clustering of feature vectors that are similar with respect to one another).","One embodiment of determining a relevancy between one or more Kinds and a user is illustrated by an exemplary method  in . At , the method begins. At , a user context is determined. For example, a travel user context may be determined when a user checks their personal calendar at a time where the user has an upcoming vacation trip. At , one or more Kind feature vectors may be classified as relevant with respect to a user feature vector in view of the user context using an unsupervised clustering technique. That is, a Kind represented by a Kind feature vector and a user represented by a user feature vector may be plotted within a matrix using respective characteristics of the Kind and the user. The Kind may be determined as relevant to the user based upon executing the unsupervised clustering technique upon the matrix. For example, Kind feature vectors plotted closer to the user feature vector within the matrix may be determined as relevant, whereas Kind feature vectors plotted further away from the user feature vector may be determined as not relevant. The unsupervised clustering technique may be employed to determine which Kind feature vectors are close to the user feature vector and are thus relevant to the user.","The user context may be taken into account when determining which Kinds (e.g., Kinds represented by Kind feature vectors) are relevant to the user (e.g., a user represented by a user feature vector). For example, thousands of Kind feature vectors may be plotted with a user feature vector within a matrix. The user, as plotted by the user feature vector, may be interested in cars, boats, oranges, work, office supplies, house, and\/or thousands of other Kinds in varying degrees. One or more Kinds representing everyday things in which the user is interested along with other Kinds may be plotted within the matrix as Kind feature vectors. The unsupervised clustering technique may determine that a car Kind, a boat Kind, a work Kind, and an office supply Kind are relevant to the user. However, the user context may be travel, thus the boat Kind and the car Kind may be more relevant than the work Kind and the office supply Kind.","In one example of classifying one or more Kind feature vectors, the user feature vector and one or more Kind feature vectors may be plotted within the matrix. A mathematical cluster comprising at least one Kind feature vector within the matrix may be created using the unsupervised clustering technique in view of the user context. For example, the mathematical cluster may be created by computing a metric distance between the user feature vector and the Kind feature vectors within the matrix using the unsupervised clustering technique. The Kind feature vectors within the mathematical cluster may be classified as relevant with respect to the user feature vector.","It may be appreciated that the unsupervised clustering technique may be utilize in deriving partitions (e.g., mathematical cluster) between what is relevant and what is not relevant and\/or between what is similar and what is not similar. In one example, the unsupervised clustering technique may be a cosine similarity, such as a dot product or an inner product. In another example, the unsupervised cluster technique may be a Laplacian (e.g., a technique that inverts weights and applies a normalization factor along a diagonal so that all rows within the matrix sum to 1), which may be used as a basis to perform spectral operations upon the matrix (e.g., graph cuts, patricians, clustering, etc.). Other examples of an unsupervised clustering technique may be Euclidian distance, a Kernel method, an SVM framework, a principle component analysis, etc. Forming mathematical clusters within the matrix allows feature vectors to be compared to determine relevancy and\/or similarity based upon distance, for example.","One or more Kinds classified as relevant (e.g., a Kind characterized by a Kind feature vector classified as relevant with respect to a user feature vector characterizing a user) may be presented to the user. For example, if a user opens their personal calendar a day before a vacation trip, then an itinerary Kind, a restaurant Kind, and a car rental Kind may be classified as relevant. Information relating to these relevant Kinds may be presented to the user. This allows additional information that is relevant to the user to be presented to the user. At , the method ends.","One embodiment of creating a mathematical cluster of feature vectors based upon a similarity metric is illustrated by an exemplary method  in . At , the method begins. At , a mathematical cluster comprising one or more feature vectors may be created using an unsupervised clustering technique in view of a similarity metric. It may be appreciated that the one or more feature vectors within the mathematical cluster may be classified as similar with respect to one another. The similarity metric may comprise one or more characteristics. For example, a similarity metric may comprise a sport characteristic and a ball characteristic, which may be utilized as a reference for determining what feature vectors are similar based upon the similarity metric (e.g., soccer balls, baseballs, footballs, etc.).","Feature vectors may comprise one or more dimensions, wherein a dimension comprises a probabilistic value based upon the probability a Kind or a user of the feature vector relates to a characteristic of the dimension. The spatial location of a feature vector may be based upon respective probabilistic values of a feature vector's dimensions. The unsupervised clustering technique may be executed upon feature vectors plotted within a multidimensional matrix of characteristics based upon the characteristics of the feature vectors as defined by respective dimensions of the feature vectors. The unsupervised clustering technique may group one or more feature vectors into the mathematical cluster based upon characteristics of the one or more feature vectors (e.g., dimensions) being similar to the similarity metric. That is, the unsupervised clustering technique may group feature vectors that are plotted close to one another within the multidimensional matrix in view of the similarity metric because feature vectors located in close spatial relation to one another may exhibit similar characteristics due to being plotted within the multidimensional matrix based upon their characteristics.","A sub-mathematical cluster may be created, wherein the sub-mathematical cluster is a cluster within the mathematical cluster. The sub-mathematical cluster may comprise one or more feature vectors comprising at least one characteristic within a second similarity metric. For example, a mathematical cluster with a similarity metric of cars may comprise a hood, door, window, engine, tire, rim, color, and\/or other such feature vectors. A sub-mathematical cluster with a second similarity metric of metal may comprise the hood, the engine, and the rim feature vectors. Thus, mathematical clusters may be hierarchical.","It may be appreciated that the feature vectors may be a user feature vector and\/or a Kind feature vector. Thus a similarity between users, between Kinds, and\/or between users and Kinds may be determined. It may be appreciated that the unsupervised clustering technique may comprise at least one of a Laplacian, a cosine similarity, a Euclidian distance, a Kernel method, an SVM framework, and\/or a principle component analysis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","308","310","308","304","302","306","302","310"]},"In one example, the Kind feature vectors  and the user feature vector  may be plotted within the matrix .

The user feature vector  may be plotted within the matrix  based upon the one or more dimensions of the user feature vector , thus the location of the user feature vector  may be analyzed to determine what characteristics the user relates to in varying degrees. A kind feature vector may be plotted within the matrix based upon one or more dimensions of the kind feature vector (e.g., plotted based upon probabilistic values of the one or more dimensions). Thus, the kind feature vectors  and the user feature vector  may be compared using unsupervised clustering techniques to determine one or more Kind feature vectors that are relevant to the user feature vector based upon characteristics as defined by respective dimensions of the one or more Kind feature vectors and the user feature vector.","In one example, the relevancy component  may determine the user context . The relevancy component  may execute the unsupervised clustering technique upon the matrix  to determine relevant Kind feature vectors  with respect to the user feature vector  as illustrated in matrix  (e.g., the matrix  after the one or more Kind feature vectors are classified as relevant).
