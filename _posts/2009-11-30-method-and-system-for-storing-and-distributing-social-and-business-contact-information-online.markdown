{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments are generally related to networking systems and methods. Embodiments also relate in general to the field of computers and similar technologies and, in particular, to software utilized in this field. Embodiments additionally relate to the management and distribution of contact information over a network.","Business cards typically contain information pertaining to an individual and an associated business entity. The information associated with the business cards usually includes a company name, an individual's name, title, phone number, facsimile number, mail address, e-mail address, and so forth. A business card thus records information that is needed to identify and contact the individual represented by the business card. Typically, business cards become outdated when the individual moves offices, change employers, obtain promotions, etc. As a result, inaccurate business cards remain in circulation long after being outdated. Another problem with conventional business cards is that the distribution of such cards is manual.","With the advent of the Internet, a large number of social and business networking websites have been developed and utilized extensively to connect people and business associates. Social and business networking systems connect users associated with the system to facilitate communications between users for business profile creation, job networking, service referrals, activity partners, and the like. A number of approaches have been conventionally employed to obtain social opportunities and information from such networks. Such approaches, however, do not provide an efficient mechanism for communicating personal contact information, nor the ability to quickly update and distribute updates, search for key contacts based on connections or referrals from others, rate connections, etc.","Based on the foregoing, it is believed that a need exists for an improved method and system for storing and distributing contact information over a network. A need also exists for automatically updating contact information with respect to a social and\/or business network, as described in greater detail herein.","The following summary is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the disclosed embodiment and is not intended to be a full description. A full appreciation of the various aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein can be gained by taking the entire specification, claims, drawings, and abstract as a whole.","It is, therefore, one aspect of the disclosed embodiments to provide for an improved data-processing method and system.","It is another aspect of the disclosed embodiments to provide for an improved method and system for automatically storing and distributing contact information over a network.","It is a further aspect of the disclosed embodiments to provide for an improved virtual card plug-in interface for updating contact information with respect to a social and business networking system.","The aforementioned aspects and other objectives and advantages can now be achieved as described herein. An information management and distribution method and system are disclosed herein. A plug-in associated with a cloud-based back-end unit interacts with a Web application for updating contact information over a network. A virtual card (e.g., connectcard) comprising a set of pluggable user interface components associated with the plug-in can be displayed in a user interface associated with the Web application (e.g., a social or business networking Web application). Contact information with respect to a user can be updated and automatically distributed to other users associated with the Web application that is configured with the virtual card plug-in module. The back-end unit can be employed to track contact information stored in a database and provide management functions associated with such data via a Web services API (Application Programming Interface). A hard copy version of the virtual card can also be rendered utilizing a variable data composition engine and appropriate rendering technology.","The database associated with the back-end unit stores and manages the updated information associated with a plurality of users. When the user adds additional information to the user profile, such as adding additional contacts, the user profile in the database may then be updated with the information added. The disclosed method and system enables users to create a variety of virtual cards such as, for example, a social card for a social networking website and\/or a business card for a business networking website. The virtual card may then be shared with other users and information with respect to other users can be obtained.","A rating indicative of the services associated with the shared contact information can be promulgated in order to identify potential customers. The plug-in associated with the cloud-based back-end unit may be connected to one or more users through a communication network (e.g., the Internet) to permit each user to access, edit, and update a user's profile data. The user may select privacy settings, share contact information, provide tags, and so forth, for ease of search and retrieval of the contact information. Such an approach permits users to communicate contact information efficiently across large networks.","The particular values and configurations discussed in these non-limiting examples can be varied and are cited merely to illustrate at least one embodiment and are not intended to limit the scope thereof.","The disclosed embodiments may be employed for automatically updating and distributing contact information over a network. The contact information may include social and\/or business contact information for identifying or contacting a user (e.g., person or entity). For example, the social contact information may include name, telephone number, facsimile number, mail address, and email address. The business contact information may include a title, business name, and a Universal Resource Locator (URL) to an associated business website. The approach described herein is capable of automatically updating previously distributed contact information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 1-3","FIGS. 1-3"]},"As illustrated in , the disclosed embodiments may be implemented in the context of a data-processing system  comprising, for example, a central processor , a main memory , an input\/output controller , a keyboard , a pointing device  (e.g., mouse, track ball, pen device, or the like), a display device , and a mass storage  (e.g., hard disk).
