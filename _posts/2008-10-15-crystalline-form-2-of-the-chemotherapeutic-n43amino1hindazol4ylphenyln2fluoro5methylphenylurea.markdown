No. 7,297,709.","The following examples are presented to provide what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of procedures and conceptual aspects of this invention.","A mixture of ABT-869 hydrochloride in ethyl acetate and ethanol, in which the ABT-869 hydrochloride was completely soluble, was mixed with dibasic sodium phosphate. The organic layer was separated, treated with decolorizing carbon, and filtered. A small quantity of L-ascorbic acid was added, and the solution was concentrated. The ethyl acetate was removed by azeotropic distillation with ethanol. Additional ethanol may be added and the solution heated to dissolve any solid that forms. The solution was cooled to 25\u00b0 C. and diluted with water, causing ABT-869\u00b7\u00bc Ethanolate Crystalline Form 1 to crystallize. The product was isolated, washed with water, and dried under reduced pressure, while monitoring residual ethyl acetate and ethanol (by gas chromatography (GC)) and water (by Karl Fischer (KF)). A yield of 92% is typical.","Following the neutralization with dibasic sodium phosphate, decolorizing carbon treatment and the removal of ethyl acetate as described in EXAMPLE 1, the mixture of ABT-869 in ethanol was gradually mixed with water at 25\u00b0 C., with vigorous agitation. ABT-869.HO Crystalline Form 1 was isolated, washed with water, and dried under reduced pressure while monitoring residual ethyl acetate and ethanol (by GC) and water (by KF). The dried material may be delumped\/milled to control particle size. A yield of 76% is typical.","A mixture of EXAMPLE 2 was stored under nitrogen at 0% humidity.","Diffraction patterns were collected using an Inel G3000 diffractometer equipped with an incident beam germanium monochromator to provide Cu\u2014Kradiation. The X-ray generator was operated at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. The Inel G3000 is equipped with a position sensitive detector that monitors all diffraction data simultaneously. The detector was calibrated by collecting the attenuated direct beam for seven seconds in 1 degree intervals across a 90 degree two theta range. The calibration was checked against a silicon line position reference standard (NIST 640c). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis was conducted in the following manner. A sample of hydrate powder was placed in a thin layer on the sample holder and gently flattened with a glass microscope slide. The hydrate sample was then equilibrated under dry nitrogen purge at atmospheric temperature and pressure using the low temperature furnace for the Inel G3000 powder X-ray diffractometer. The low temperature furnace contains a Kapton\u00ae window that results in a broad diffraction peak at approximately 6 degrees two theta. The sample was equilibrated under nitrogen overnight, followed by PXRD data acquisition for two hours under continued nitrogen purge.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"It is meant to be understood that relative intensities of peak heights and\/or intensities in a PXRD pattern may vary and will be dependent on variables such as the temperature, size of crystal size or morphology, sample preparation, or sample height in the analysis well of the X-ray diffractometer.","It is also meant to be understood that peak positions may vary when measured with different radiation sources. For example, Cu\u2014K, Mo\u2014K\u03b1, Co\u2014K\u03b1 and Fe\u2014K\u03b1 radiation, having wavelengths of 1.54060 \u212b, 0.7107 \u212b, 1.7902 \u212b and 1.9373 \u212b, respectively, may provide peak positions which differ from those measured with Cu\u2014K\u03b1 radiation, which has a wavelength of 1.5478 \u212b.","The term \u201cabout\u201d preceding a series of peak positions means that all of the peaks of the group which it precedes are reported in terms of angular positions (two theta) with an allowable variability of \u00b10.1\u00b0 as specified by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, pages 1843-1884 (1995). The variability of \u00b10.1\u00b0 is intended to be used when comparing two powder X-ray diffraction patterns. In practice, if a diffraction pattern peak from one pattern is assigned a range of angular positions (two theta) which is the measured peak position \u00b10.1\u00b0 and if those ranges of peak positions overlap, then the two peaks are considered to have the same angular position. For example, if a peak from one pattern is determined to have a position of 11.0\u00b0, for comparison purposes the allowable variability allows the peak to be assigned a position in the range of 10.9.\u00b0-11.1\u00b0.","Accordingly, for example, the phrase \u201cabout 6.7\u00b0, 10.1\u00b0, 11.8\u00b0, 13.4\u00b0, 14.4\u00b0, 15.4\u00b0, 16.6\u00b0, 16.8\u00b0, 17.8\u00b0, 20.5\u00b0 and 23.4\u00b0 means about 6.7\u00b0, about 10.1\u00b0, about 11.8\u00b0, about 13.4\u00b0, about 14.4\u00b0, about 15.4\u00b0, about 16.6\u00b0, about 16.8\u00b0, about 17.8\u00b0, about 20.5\u00b0 and about 23.4\u00b0, which, in turn, means 6.7\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 10.1\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 11.8\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 13.4\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 14.4\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 15.4\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 16.6\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 16.8\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 17.8\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, 20.5\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0, and 23.4\u00b0\u00b10.1\u00b0.","The term \u201cabout\u201d preceding a temperature means the given temperature \u00b12\u00b0 C. For example, about 25\u00b0 C. means 25\u00b0 C.\u00b12\u00b0 C. or 23\u00b0 C.-27\u00b0 C.","The foregoing is meant to be illustrative of the invention and not intended to limit it to the disclosed embodiments. Variations and changes obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be within the scope and nature of the invention as defined in the claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"}},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
