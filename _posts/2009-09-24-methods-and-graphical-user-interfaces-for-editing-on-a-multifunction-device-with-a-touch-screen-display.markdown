No. 12\/565,760, \u201cMethods and Graphical User Interfaces for Editing on a Multifunction Device with a Touch Screen Display,\u201d filed Sep. 24, 2009, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.","The disclosed embodiments relate generally to multifunction devices with touch screen displays, and more particularly, to conducting edits (e.g., cutting, copying, or pasting user-selected content) on such devices.","As electronic devices become more compact, and the number of functions performed by a given device increase, it has become a significant challenge to design a user interface that allows users to easily interact with a multifunction device. This challenge is particular significant for handheld portable devices, which have much smaller screens than desktop or laptop computers. This situation is unfortunate because the user interface is the gateway through which users receive not only content but also responses to user actions or behaviors, including user attempts to access a device's features, tools, and functions. Some portable communication devices (e.g., mobile telephones, sometimes called mobile phones, cell phones, cellular telephones, and the like) have resorted to adding more pushbuttons, increasing the density of push buttons, overloading the functions of pushbuttons, or using complex menu systems to allow a user to access, store and manipulate data. These conventional user interfaces often result in complicated key sequences and menu hierarchies that must be memorized by the user.","Many conventional user interfaces, such as those that include physical pushbuttons, are also inflexible. This is unfortunate because it may prevent a user interface from being configured and\/or adapted by either an application running on the portable device or by users. When coupled with the time consuming requirement to memorize multiple key sequences and menu hierarchies, and the difficulty in activating a desired pushbutton, such inflexibility is frustrating to most users.","Conventional user interfaces on multifunction devices with touch screen displays do not provide a simple and intuitive way to edit text and graphics. Editing functions such as cut, copy, and paste (if they even exist) are often difficult to find and use, thereby creating a significant cognitive burden on a user. In addition, conventional editing methods take longer than necessary, thereby wasting energy. This latter consideration is particularly important in battery-operated devices.","Accordingly, there is a need for multifunction devices with touch screen displays with faster, more efficient methods and interfaces for editing content. Such methods and interfaces reduce the cognitive burden on a user and produce a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated multifunction devices, such methods and interfaces conserve power and increase the time between battery charges.","The above deficiencies and other problems associated with user interfaces for multifunction devices with touch screen displays are reduced or eliminated by the disclosed devices. In some embodiments, the device is a desktop computer with a touch screen display. In some embodiments, the device is portable (e.g., a notebook computer or handheld device). In some embodiments, the device has a touch-sensitive display (also known as a \u201ctouch screen\u201d or \u201ctouch screen display\u201d). In some embodiments, the device has a graphical user interface (GUI), one or more processors, memory and one or more modules, programs or sets of instructions stored in the memory for performing multiple functions. In some embodiments, the user interacts with the GUI primarily through finger contacts and gestures on the touch screen display. In some embodiments, the functions may include image editing, drawing, presenting, word processing, website creating, disk authoring, spreadsheet making, game playing, telephoning, video conferencing, e-mailing, instant messaging, workout support, digital photographing, digital videoing, web browsing, digital music playing, and\/or digital video playing. Executable instructions for performing these functions may be included in a computer readable storage medium or other computer program product configured for execution by one or more processors.","In accordance with some embodiments, a computer-implemented method is performed at a multifunction device with a touch screen display. The computer-implemented method includes: displaying editable content on the touch screen display at a first magnification; detecting a finger gesture on the editable content; in response to detecting the finger gesture on the editable content: expanding a portion of the editable content on the touch screen display to a second magnification that is greater than the first magnification while continuing to display at least some of the editable content at the first magnification; and displaying a content magnifier that displays the expanded portion of the editable content and an insertion marker at a first location within the expanded portion of the editable content; detecting movement of a finger contact across the touch screen display; moving the content magnifier and changing the expanded portion of the editable content in accordance with the detected movement of the finger contact; moving the insertion marker from the first location to a second location within the expanded portion of the editable content in accordance with the detected movement of the finger contact; detecting lift off of the finger contact while the insertion marker is located at the second location within the expanded portion of the editable content; and, in response to detecting lift off of the finger contact: ceasing to display the content magnifier and the expanded portion of the editable content; displaying the insertion marker at a current location in the editable content at the first magnification, wherein the current location corresponds to the second location within the expanded portion of the editable content; and displaying a first command display area adjacent to the insertion marker, wherein the first command display area includes an icon for selecting content associated with the current location of the insertion marker.","In accordance with some embodiments, a graphical user interface on a multifunction device with a touch screen display, a memory, and one or more processors to execute one or more programs stored in the memory includes: editable content at a first magnification, a content magnifier, an insertion marker, and a command display area; wherein: in response to detecting a finger gesture on the editable content: a portion of the editable content on the touch screen display is expanded to a second magnification that is greater than the first magnification while continuing to display at least some of the editable content at the first magnification; and the content magnifier is displayed, wherein the content magnifier displays the expanded portion of the editable content and the insertion marker at a first location within the expanded portion of the editable content; the content magnifier is moved and the expanded portion of the editable content is changed in accordance with detected movement of a finger contact across the touch screen display; the insertion marker is moved from the first location to a second location within the expanded portion of the editable content in accordance with the detected movement of the finger contact; and, in response to detecting lift off of the finger contact while the insertion marker is located at the second location within the expanded portion of the editable content: display of the content magnifier and the expanded portion of the editable content are ceased; the insertion marker is displayed at a current location in the editable content at the first magnification, wherein the current location corresponds to the second location within the expanded portion of the editable content; and the command display area is displayed adjacent to the insertion marker, wherein the command display area includes an icon for selecting content associated with the current location of the insertion marker.","In accordance with some embodiments, a multifunction device includes a touch screen display, one or more processors, memory, and one or more programs.

In some embodiments, the external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or similar to and\/or compatible with the 30-pin connector used on iPod (trademark of Apple Computer, Inc.) devices.","The contact\/motion module  may detect contact with the touch screen  (in conjunction with the display controller ) and other touch sensitive devices (e.g., a touchpad or physical click wheel). The contact\/motion module  includes various software components for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as determining if contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging events), and determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact). The contact\/motion module  receives contact data from the touch-sensitive surface. Determining movement of the point of contact, which is represented by a series of contact data, may include determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction), and\/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and\/or direction) of the point of contact. These operations may be applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts (e.g., \u201cmultitouch\u201d\/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments, the contact\/motion module  and the display controller  detects contact on a touchpad. In some embodiments, the contact\/motion module  and the controller  detects contact on a click wheel.","The contact\/motion module  may detect a gesture input by a user. Different gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns. Thus, a gesture may be detected by detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture comprises detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up event at the same position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface comprises detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger-dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up event.","The graphics module  includes various known software components for rendering and displaying graphics on the touch screen  or other display, including components for changing the intensity of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the term \u201cgraphics\u201d includes any object that can be displayed to a user, including without limitation text, web pages, icons (such as user-interface objects including soft keys), digital images, videos, animations and the like.","In some embodiments, the graphics module  stores data representing graphics to be used.
