{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure relates in general to the field of computer networks and, more particularly, to a system and a method for cloud-based scanning for computer vulnerabilities in a network environment.","The field of computer network administration and support has become increasingly important and complicated in today's society. Computer network environments are configured for virtually every enterprise or organization, typically with multiple interconnected computers (e.g., end user computers, laptops, servers, printing devices, etc.). In many such enterprises, Information Technology (IT) administrators may be tasked with maintenance and control of the network environment, including executable software files on hosts, servers, and other network computers. As the number of executable software files in a network environment increases, the ability to control, maintain, and remediate these files efficiently can become more difficult. Generally, greater diversity of software implemented in various computers of a network translates into greater difficulty in managing such software. In addition, IT administrators and other users may want to use efficient computer scanning methods to identify and remove vulnerabilities quickly and effectively. When networks have hundreds to millions of nodes, scanning all the nodes for many possible vulnerabilities presents challenges to IT administrators. In many cases, IT administrators may have to run approximately 30,000 vulnerability checks covering thousands of applications and operating systems, and perform dozens to hundreds of new checks in any given week. Thus, innovative tools are needed to assist IT administrators in the effective control and management of executable software files and computer scan methods on computers within computer network environments.","Overview","A method in one embodiment includes establishing a first secure tunnel between a configuration manager and a scanner, and a second secure tunnel between a scan controller and the scanner, where the scanner is located in a public network and the configuration manager and the scan controller are located in a private network, communicating scanner configuration information between the scanner and the configuration manager over the first secure tunnel, and communicating scan information between the scanner and the scan controller over the second secure tunnel. The scan controller and the configuration manager may also communicate with one or more scanners located in the private network.","In specific embodiments, the method includes identifying a first origination port, a second origination port, a first destination port, and a second destination port, and forwarding, from within the private network, the first origination port to the first destination port to create the first secure tunnel, and the second origination port to the second destination port to create the second secure tunnel. The first origination port and second origination port are coupled to the scanner, the first destination port is coupled to the configuration manager, and second destination port is coupled to the scan controller. Further, the scanner may include a first port coupled to the first origination port and a second port coupled to the second origination port. In more specific embodiments, the method may include configuring the scanner to communicate scan information through the second port.","In yet other embodiments, the scanner may include a scan engine configured to scan one or more assets in the private network based on scan information provided by the scan controller, and a configuration agent configured to facilitate configuring the scan engine based on scanner configuration information provided by the configuration manager. In more specific embodiments, the secure tunnels may comprise reverse secure shell (SSH) tunnels. The scanner may also include an SSH server, and other features.","Example Embodiments",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","10","12","20","12","12","20","20","12","20","20","20","12","22","24","16","18","22","24","12"]},"Private network  may be separated from a public network  by a firewall . In , although firewall  is illustrated, it may be understood that any security feature that separates private network  from public network  may be used in system  without departing from the broad scope of the present disclosure. For example, switches, routers, packet filters, etc. may separate private network  from public network . A scanner  may be located in public network . One scanner is depicted in  merely for the sake of illustration, and not as a limitation, and any number of scanners may be deployed outside private network  within the scope of the present disclosure. Scanner  may comprise a scan engine  and a configuration agent . In various embodiments, scan engine  and configuration agent  may be substantially functionally equivalent to scan engine  and configuration agent , respectively. Embodiments of system  provide for establishing a secure tunnel  between configuration manager  and scanner . Embodiments of system  also provide for establishing a secure tunnel  between scan controller  and scanner . In some instances, a single secure tunnel, rather than two distinct tunnels , , can be established for communication between a public network-based scanner's  scan engine  and configuration agent  and a private network-based scan controller  and configuration manager  (as discussed in more detail below).","As used herein, a \u201csecure tunnel\u201d encompasses a communication protocol that secures a communication channel from unwanted and\/or unauthorized intrusions and vulnerabilities, such as packet sniffing, data leakage, unauthorized modification while in transit, etc. In the embodiment shown in , each secure tunnel can include a reverse Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel. SSH is a network protocol for secure communication (e.g., data communication, remote shell services, remote login, command execution, and other secure network services) over, for instance, an insecure network (e.g., public network ) between a network element running an SSH server program, such as an SSH server , and another network element running an SSH client program, such as an SSH client . Any other secure tunnels (e.g., SSL, IPSec, etc.) may be suitably used in system , without departing from the broad scope of the present disclosure. For illustrative purposes, reverse SSH tunnels are described herein in connection with embodiments of system .","Scan controller  may be configured to provide one or more scan instructions (and other scan information) to scan engine , and accept scan results from scan engine  over dedicated internal network connections (e.g., Ethernet, wireless connection, etc.) within private network . Scan controller  can accept scan requests (e.g., from users, network administrators, etc.), spool them to various scanners , monitors scanners , and accept scan results from scanners . For example, scan controller  can schedule scans for assets A-C and distribute scan instructions to scan engine  appropriately.","According to embodiments of system , scan controller  may also be configured to provide one or more scan instructions (and other scan information) to scan engine , and accept scan results (and other scan information) from scan engine  over a secure tunnel (e.g., secure tunnel ). Scan engines ,  can include program logic to scan assets A-C according to the scan instructions (and other scan information) dictated from scan controller . Such logic, when combined with other scan information from scan controller , can be used to perform scans including, for example, detecting open ports, determining running services, identifying the operating system, recording the MAC address, host name, and other information about the asset; processing and pattern-matching vulnerability definitions with data it finds on scanned assets in order to determine the presence or absence of the vulnerabilities; simulating malicious users or systems accessing an asset and monitoring response of the asset as a result of the simulated attack, etc.; among other examples.","Configuration manager  may be configured to provide one or more scanner configurations to configuration agent  over dedicated internal network connections in private network . Further, configuration manager  can provide scanner configurations to the configuration agents (e.g., configuration agent ) of one or more remotely provided or cloud-based scanners (e.g., scanner ) over secure tunnels (e.g., secure tunnel ). Configuration agents  and  may operate as platforms to implement changes in configuration data used by scan engines  and , respectively, to update content such as tests and scripts; to update\/patch scan engines  and , or configuration agent executables or configurations and then restart them if needed; to patch system operating systems (OS) or any other software on respective scanners; or any other administrative operations required to maintain scanners  and . In example embodiments, configuration agents  and  may use \u201cpull\u201d methodology to receive scanner configuration information from configuration manager . For example, configuration agent  may authenticate itself to configuration manager  over internal network connections before receiving any scanner configuration information.","Scan engines  and  may be generally updated frequently to implement new OS detection fingerprinting techniques and to provide new tests to detect the existence of vulnerabilities on an asset. Updating scan engines  and  may be facilitated by configuration agents  and , respectively. Configuration agents  and  can communicate with configuration manager  to obtain configuration settings for scan engines  and , respectively. For example, configuration agent  can obtain an update patch from configuration manager  and facilitate execution of the patch on scan engine . According to embodiments of the present disclosure, configuration manager  may also be configured to provide one or more scanner configurations (and other scanner configuration information) to configuration agent  over secure tunnel . The scanner configurations may be used to update content such as tests and scripts; to update\/patch scan engines  and , or configuration agent executables or configurations and then restart them if needed; to patch the system OS or any other software on the respective scanners; or any other administrative operations required to maintain scanners  and .","Whereas scan engines  and  are both configured to scan assets (e.g., assets A-C), scan engine  may be able to scan for different or additional vulnerabilities compared to scan engine , based on its location outside private network . For example, asset A may be an email server located in private network . To devices located outside private network  (or on the perimeter, or in a DMZ), only certain ports on asset A may be visible. Moreover, firewall  may prevent users\/systems outside private network  from accessing other ports in asset A. In contrast, to devices located inside private network , substantially all ports on asset A may be visible. A malicious user or system such as a hacker or other threat located outside private network  may have a substantially different view of asset A than scan engine  located within private network . Thus, vulnerabilities visible to the outside user or system may be ignored by scan engine  because of its location within private network  (e.g., scan engine's view is from within the private network, not outside the private network). On the other hand, scan engine , located outside private network , may have a substantially similar view of asset A as the outside user or system, thereby providing additional views of the asset and making the scanning more complete and valuable.","In another example, asset B may be a printer within private network , and supposedly inaccessible to devices outside private network . By scanning (or attempting to scan) asset B using scan engine , any vulnerabilities in asset B, for example, an unauthorized externally visible port, may be discovered. Thus, a vulnerability in inadvertently exposed systems, which would have otherwise gone unnoticed may be discovered by scan engine  located in public cloud . Another example is a server configuration port that allows remote configuration of the machine or application. The remote configuration may be permitted from within private network , where it is expected that the machine or application may be suitably managed; however, if the same port is visible from outside private network , an external user\/system (e.g., hacker) may be able to access the machine and alter configurations without authorization.","The network environment illustrated in  may be generally configured or arranged to represent any communication architecture capable of electronically exchanging packets. In addition, private network  and public network  may also be configured to exchange packets with other networks such as, for example, other LANs. Other common network elements (e.g., email gateways, web gateways, routers, switches, loadbalancers, firewalls, etc.), may also be provisioned in the networks where appropriate and based on particular needs.","Certain terminologies are used with regard to the various embodiments of the present disclosure. An \u201casset\u201d may be any electronic device, network element, mobile device, end-user computer, desktop, laptop, client, server, peer, service, application, or other object capable of sending, receiving, or forwarding information over communications channels in a network. As used herein, \u201cscan information\u201d includes scan instructions (e.g., instructions directed to vulnerabilities to test for, vulnerability scripts to run, and calculations to perform to produce a network security score), scan targets (e.g., assets A-C), scan configuration, tests to run, asset resolution data (e.g., taking an IP and returning the host name and operating system (OS)), scan results, and any other information that may be used to scan assets (e.g., assets A-C) and analyze scan results. As used herein, \u201cscanner configuration information\u201d includes scanner component configurations (e.g., configurations of scan engines, SSH server programs, operating systems, etc.), new versions of the scanner executables, OS updates to fix vulnerabilities on the scanner, new application programming interfaces to respect, list of vulnerabilities, certificates, updates, ports for communication, and any other configuration information that may be used for managing and maintaining the scanner (e.g., scanner , scanner , etc.).","As used herein, the term \u201cvulnerability\u201d encompasses any flaw, condition, security risk, or weakness in a system (e.g., hardware or software in an asset, including operating systems, applications, files, chipsets, hardware-implemented computing logic, configuration settings, etc.) that could result in unauthorized access to the system and a possible security breach or a violation of the system's security policy, organization standards, industry standards, government standards, or the like. Vulnerabilities can exist, for example, in system security procedures, system designs, operating systems, open ports, internal controls, hardware configurations, applications, configuration settings, etc. that could be exercised (accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited) and that could result in such breaches or violations. Examples of vulnerabilities include CVE-2011-2460, which is a flaw in Adobe Flash Player that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service via unspecified vectors; CVE-2011-2016, which is an untrusted search path vulnerability in Windows Mail that allows local user to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in a working directory; among tens of thousands of other vulnerabilities.","As used herein, a \u201cprivate network\u201d encompasses any network that is separated from other networks by a security feature, such as a firewall, network address translation (NAT), etc. Examples of private networks include enterprise, office, and home networks. Assets within the private network are typically easily accessible to users within that network. On the other hand, assets within the private network are not generally accessible (or even visible) to users\/systems outside the private network.","Any network other than a private network is included in the term \u201cpublic network.\u201d Public networks may encompass fully public networks, such as the Internet, and semi-private (or community) networks where multiple, disparate enterprises share a cloud infrastructure, and at least some assets within the cloud infrastructure are easily accessible to users from within and outside the cloud, and other networks not explicitly part of the private network. In public networks generally, a substantial number of assets are typically accessible (and viewable) by any user. For example, in the Internet network, all assets in the Internet are typically accessible by all users. Thus, assets within private cloud  may access assets in public cloud ; however, assets in public cloud  may not access (or even see) assets in private cloud , unless the assets in private cloud  are specifically configured to be accessible or visible externally. Examples of such specifically configured assets in private networks include email and Web servers.","For purposes of illustrating the techniques of system , it is important to understand the activities and security concerns that may be present in a given network such as the network shown in . The following foundational information may be viewed as a basis from which the present disclosure may be properly explained. Such information is offered earnestly for purposes of explanation only and, accordingly, should not be construed in any way to limit the broad scope of the present disclosure and its potential applications.","Typical network environments, both in organizations (e.g., businesses, schools, government organizations, etc.) and in homes, include a plurality of computers such as end user desktops, laptops, servers, network appliances, and the like, with each computer having an installed set of executable software. In large organizations, network environments may include hundreds or thousands of computers, which can span different buildings, cities, and\/or geographical areas around the world. IT administrators are often tasked with the extraordinary responsibility of maintaining these computers and their software in a way that minimizes or eliminates disruption to the organization's activities.","One difficulty IT administrators face when managing a network environment is ensuring that their organization's network security complies with regulatory and industry standards in risk compliance. Companies are under considerable pressure to protect customer information, customer privacy, and sensitive business information against threats from cyber criminals, competitors, and network hackers. For example, business partners may demand increasingly tight compliance in implementing and enforcing IT policies, processes, and controls around key assets and sensitive information. Effective risk management may entail accurate and comprehensive visibility into a company's assets and business processes. Such visibility may include detailed information on vulnerabilities (e.g., operating system or application exploitable flaws) in the network.","Currently available risk management software programs can maintain an up-to-date database of vulnerabilities, detect vulnerabilities, perform trend analyses and provide reports of the results. Most of such risk management software programs reside within a private network, and scan assets within the private network. Many assets within the private network may be visible externally (to public networks) by virtue of their functions. For example, email and Web servers may be visible to users in a public network in addition to users within the private network. Such assets offer a different view to the external users compared to the view offered to the internal users. For example, internal users may be able to view substantially all ports of the asset. In contrast, external users may be able to view only one port. By scanning the asset from within the private network, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain an external view of the asset and check for vulnerabilities that may be exploited by an external user. A scanner located in a public network may be able to obtain an external view of the asset; however, current security features (e.g., firewalls) of private networks do not permit a scanner located outside the private network (e.g., in the cloud) to use typical communication techniques to interface with scan controllers and other systems located within the private network and provide the scan results to, or obtain scan configurations dynamically from, the private network (e.g., a scan controller located within the enterprise).","Deployment methodologies for setting up scan engines can include deploying the scan engine outside the private network (e.g., customer environment) with the scan controller inside the private network; and deploying the scan engine inside the private network with scan controller also inside. In both cases, there are potential communication challenges that may be circumvented in order to get a working system. The scan engine should be able to communicate with the configuration manager and the scan controller, but communication may be blocked due to various firewalls, routers, and proxies.","Security features of private networks, such as firewalls and NATs, prevent network elements (e.g., scan engines) located in public networks from initiating communication with network elements (e.g., scan controllers) within the private network. On the other hand, the security features may permit the network elements located within the private network to initiate communication with assets in the public network. Nevertheless, Virtual Private Network (VPN) and reverse SSH tunnels can permit network elements external to the private network to maintain communication (across a firewall and\/or NAT) with network elements within the private network. However, VPN offers network-to-network connectivity; with VPN enabled between the public network and private network, any network element located in the public network may be able to connect to any other network element located in the private network. If a VPN solution were to be deployed on a scan engine located in a public network (such as the Internet cloud), any user from within the cloud may be able to access devices located in the private network, thereby compromising the security of the private network.","Reverse SSH tunnels can also permit network elements external to private networks to initiate communication with assets in the private network while providing a more targeted and precise tunneling solution compared to VPNs. Regular SSH tunneling opens a port on a local machine (e.g., in a private network) and forwards connections from that port on the local machine to a corresponding port on a remote machine on the other end of the connection (e.g., in a public network). Communications to the port on the local machine get forwarded across the SSH tunnel to the corresponding port on the remote machine. In a \u201creverse\u201d SSH tunnel, a port is opened on the remote machine (e.g., in a public network), and forwarded to a corresponding port on the local machine (e.g., in a private network). Communications to the port on the remote machine get forwarded across the reverse SSH tunnel to the corresponding port on the local machine, within the private network. Moreover, unlike a VPN connection that is a network-to-network connection, a reverse SSH tunnel is a point-to-point connection.","An SSH server running an SSH server program can connect across an SSH tunnel to an SSH client running an SSH client program. The SSH server program (also called SSH daemon) permits the SSH server to accept connections using the SSH protocol from remote computers. The SSH client program permits the SSH client to connect to a remote computer using the SSH protocol. SSH can use public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to authenticate the user, in certain instances. Anyone can produce a matching pair of different keys (public and private). The public key is placed on all computers that allows access to the owner of the matching private key (the owner keeps the private key secret). SSH is typically used to log into a remote machine and execute commands, and it also supports tunneling; forwarding TCP ports and X11 connections; file transfers using the associated SSH file transfer (SFTP) or secure copy (SCP) protocols; among other functionality and features.","In some instances, a server or other device located in a public network cannot initiate a communication with another server located in a private network to thereby establish an SSH tunnel. Accordingly, in such instances, a reverse SSH tunnel may be established from the server in the private network to the server in the public network. From the SSH client (located in the private network), an origination port on the SSH server (located in the public network) may be opened for listening, and all connections to the origination port may be forwarded to a destination port on the SSH client. In many operating systems, a command such as the following on the SSH client may set a reverse SSH port forwarding from example origination port 10002 on SSH server remotehost at IP address 1.1.1.1 to example destination port 22 on SSH client: ssh -R remotehost:10002 localhost:22 1.1.1.1. All connections to origination port 10002 at 1.1.1.1 are forwarded to destination port 22 on the protected SSH client in the private network.","Currently available scan technologies may implement the scan controller on the cloud and the scan controller can control one or more scan engines located within the private network, for example, using SSL. However, such scan systems cannot work if the scan controller is within the private network, as is usually the case in many traditional enterprise scanning systems. Further, currently available scan technologies also implement a cloud based scanning, wherein a scan system, comprising a scan controller and scan engines are located in the public network and can scan assets in private network for certain limited number of vulnerabilities. Such scanners typically cannot access assets within the private network that are not visible externally; they also operate separately from any scanning systems deployed within the private network. Many users, for various reasons (e.g., improved scanning, efficiency, value, etc.), may desire to have a traditional scan system wherein the scan controller and at least some scan engines are located within the private network, while other scan engines, also controlled by the internal scan controller, are located outside the private network to provide an external view of certain assets.","System  outlined by  can resolve many of these issues. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, one or more secure tunnels (e.g., secure tunnels , ) may be established between scanner  (located in public network ), and configuration manager , and scan controller , both located in private network . In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a secure tunnel (e.g., secure tunnel , secure tunnel ) can include reverse SSH tunnels. In one particular example, such as shown in the particular example embodiment of , a first secure tunnel  can be established between configuration manager  and configuration agent ; and a second secure tunnel  can be established between scan controller  and scan engine . According to embodiments of the present disclosure, communication is initiated by scanner  and passes through secure tunnels  and .","According to an example embodiment, secure tunnel  may be created from within private network  to public network  over connection (e.g., from SSH client  to SSH server ), and configuration agent  may subsequently initiate and maintain communication over connection (e.g., from SSH server  to SSH client ) via secure tunnel . Secure tunnel  may be created from within private network  to public network  over connection (e.g., from SSH client  to SSH server ), and scan engine  may subsequently initiate and maintain communication over connection (e.g., from SSH server  to SSH client ) via secure tunnel . Communication between scan engine  and scan controller  and between configuration agent  and configuration manager  may be request\/response type, wherein scan engine  and configuration agent  request information from scan controller  and configuration manager , respectively, and obtain responses in return.","While the example of  illustrates two separate reverse SSH tunnels established between each of scan engine  and scan controller  and configuration agent  and configuration manager , other embodiments can adopt alternative architectures without deviating from the subject matter of the present disclosure or the principles described with regard to the establishing, maintaining, and communicating over secure tunnels. For instance, in some instances, scan controller  and configuration manager  can be implemented as a single component on private network  possessing the combined functionality of scan controller  and configuration manager . Further, a single secure tunnel, such as a single reverse SSH tunnel can be established between the combined scan controller and configuration manager and the scan engine  and configuration agent  of a scanner . In another example, a single reverse SSH tunnel can be established, in lieu of two separate tunnels, by providing an additional communication manager component (not shown) in private network  that cooperatively functions with scan controller  and configuration manager  and routes traffic received over the single secure tunnel from the scan engine  and configuration agent  to the scan controller  and configuration manager , respectively. Similarly, a communication manager component can also ensure that communications from the scan controller  or configuration manager  are addressed and properly forwarded to scan engine  and configuration agent , respectively, over the single secure tunnel enabling communication between scan controller  and configuration manager  and scanner , among other potential implementations.","In any of the above implementations, certain scan systems, including in embodiments of system , configuration manager  and scan controller  may communicate with scanners such as scanners  and  through distinct ports. In one example embodiment, configuration agents  and  may initiate communication with configuration manager  prior to scanning. Similarly, scan engines  and  may initiate communication with scan controller  prior to scanning. In other instances, scan controller  can initiate communications with a respective scan engine ,  and similarly, configuration manager  can initiate communication with respective configuration agents , . Further, configuration manager  can listen on a specific port (e.g., port number \u201c3803\u201d for Direct Internet Message Encapsulation (DIME)\/SSL connections; likewise, scan controller  can listen on another specific port (e.g., port number \u201c3801\u201d for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\/SSL connections.","In another example, configuration manager , at example IP address 1.1.1.1 may be configured to communicate scanner configuration information through port number \u201c3801,\u201d and scan controller , also at example IP address 1.1.1.1 may be configured to communicate scan information through port number \u201c3803.\u201d Inside private network , configuration agent  typically checks for updates through port number \u201c3801\u201d at 1.1.1.1, and scan engine  typically checks for scan instructions through port \u201c3803\u201d at 1.1.1.1.","According to embodiments of system , outside private network  (e.g., in public network ), configuration agent  and scan engine  may be configured to check for scanner configuration information and scan information, respectively, through local ports rather than through remote ports. For example, configuration agent  may be configured to listen on a local port (e.g., port number \u201c38010\u201d) and scan engine  may be configured to listen on another local port number (e.g., port number \u201c38010\u201d). In various embodiments, the local port (e.g., localhost:38010) on configuration agent  may be forwarded to another port (e.g., port number 3801 at 1.1.1.1) on configuration manager  through secure tunnel  for communicating scanner configuration information. Likewise, the local port e.g., localhost:38030) on scan engine  may be forwarded to a corresponding port (e.g., port number 3803 at 1.1.1.1) on scan controller  through secure tunnel  for communicating scan information.","In various embodiments, components (e.g., OpenSSH, etc.) to facilitate creation of secure tunnels  and  may be installed on scanner . Scanner , configured with such components may be generically redistributable (e.g., as a disk image, virtual machine, a cloud instance such as Amazon Cloud Instance (AMI), etc.). Corresponding client software (e.g., SSH Client) may be installed on devices within private network  to facilitate creation of secure tunnels  and . For example, a command such as ssh -TNfR 38010:localhost:3801 remote.engine.com may create reverse tunnel  from local configuration manager port (e.g., port number \u201c3801\u201d) to remote engine port (e.g., port number \u201c38010\u201d) on configuration agent . Similarly, a command such as ssh -TNfR 38030:localhost:3803 remote.engine.com may create reverse tunnel  from local scan controller port (e.g., port number \u201c3803\u201d) to remote port (e.g., port number \u201c38030\u201d) on scan engine . The connection into private network  can then be initiated from public network  over either tunnel  or , but from the perspective of scanner , scanner  would be initiating communication over secure tunnels  and  to scan controller  and configuration manager .","Turning to the infrastructure of , the example network environment may be configured as one or more networks and may be configured in any form including, but not limited to, local area networks (LANs), wireless local area networks (WLANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), wide area networks (WANs), virtual private networks (VPNs), Intranet, Extranet, any other appropriate architecture or system, or any combination thereof that facilitates communications in a network. In some embodiments, a communication link may represent any electronic link supporting a LAN environment such as, for example, cable, Ethernet, wireless technologies (e.g., IEEE 802.11x), ATM, fiber optics, etc. or any suitable combination thereof. In other embodiments, a communication link may represent a remote connection through any appropriate medium (e.g., digital subscriber lines (DSL), telephone lines, T lines, T lines, wireless, satellite, fiber optics, cable, Ethernet, etc. or any combination thereof) and\/or through any additional networks such as a wide area networks (e.g., the Internet).","In addition, gateways, routers, switches, and any other suitable network elements may be used to facilitate electronic communication between the various nodes. Note that the network illustrated in , may include a configuration capable of transmission control protocol\/internet protocol (TCP\/IP) communications for the transmission and\/or reception of packets in the network. The network could also operate in conjunction with a user datagram protocol\/IP (UDP\/IP) or any other suitable protocol, where appropriate and based on particular needs. Only a few assets and networks are illustrated in , for ease of description. Any number of assets and networks may be included in system  within the broad scope of the present disclosure.","Scanner  may be implemented on a physical or virtualized hardware in public network , or may be implemented on specialized devices configured to scan networks or assets. Implementing scanner  using virtual machines can allow, among other advantages, for dynamic provisioning of a scanner for any one of a variety of systems or assets, thereby taking advantages of cloud-based extensibility and permitting on-demand provisioning and scaling of scanners . In various embodiments, configuration agent  may be coupled to, or in communication with, or integrated into, scan engine . In one embodiment, configuration agent  may be a software application (or part of a software application) that periodically polls configuration manager  for updates and other scanner configuration information. In some embodiments, configuration agent  may perform updates and other scan configuration changes on scan engine  automatically as and when such updates are received from configuration manager . In other embodiments, configuration agent  may perform updates and other scan configuration changes on scan engine  prior to a scan. In yet other embodiments, configuration agent  may perform updates and other scan configuration changes according to user specified rules.","In some embodiments, scanner  can be a logical object that consists of scan engine  and configuration agent . In other embodiments, scanner  can be a physical machine that includes scan engine  and configuration agent , as well as its own instance of SSH Server . For example, scanner  may be implemented on a server or virtual machine that also runs an SSH server program. In another example embodiment, scanner  may include an SSH server program. In yet other embodiments, scanner  may be implemented on a device separate from SSH server . For example, scanner  may be a separate network appliance that is connected to a server running an SSH server program. Various such combinations are possible within the broad scope of the present disclosure.","Not shown in system  of  is hardware that may be suitably coupled to scanner  in the form of consoles, user interfaces, processors, memory elements, memory management units (MMU), additional symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) elements, peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus and corresponding bridges, small computer system interface (SCSI)\/integrated drive electronics (IDE) elements, etc. In addition, suitable modems and\/or network adapters may also be included for allowing network access. Any suitable operating systems may also be configured in scanner  to appropriately manage the operation of hardware components therein. Scanner  may include any other suitable hardware, software, components, modules, interfaces, or objects that facilitate the operations thereof. This may be inclusive of appropriate algorithms and communication protocols that facilitate the operations detailed herein.","Turning to ,  is a simplified block diagram illustrating details of an embodiment of system . Scanner  can include a memory element  and a processor  in addition to scan engine  and configuration agent . Ports  and  may be two of a plurality of ports provided in (or coupled to, or otherwise communicable with) scanner . In some embodiments, ports  and  may be physical ports; in other embodiments, ports  and  may be virtual ports. In an example embodiment, scanner  may be implemented on a network element, such as a server. In another embodiment, scanner  may be a separate service appliance located in public network . Ports  and  on scanner  may communicate with origination ports  and , respectively, in SSH server . SSH client  may include destination ports  and  that may be used to establish secure tunnels  and  with origination ports  and , respectively. Destination ports  and  on SSH client  may communicate with (or be coupled to) corresponding port  on configuration manager  and port  on scan controller , respectively.","In some embodiments of system , port  may be combined with port , and port  may be combined with port . Such may be the case, for example, in embodiments where scanner  is implemented on a server running an SSH daemon (e.g., SSH server ). In some embodiments, ports  and  may be combined with ports  and , respectively. Such may be the case, for example, in embodiments where a server including scan controller  and configuration manager  performs functions of SSH client  (e.g., connects to remote computers using the SSH protocol). Although the embodiment shown in  uses SSH server  and SSH client , it may be understood that any network element that can establish secure communication channels may be used instead in system  without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","In one particular example, provided merely for the sake of illustrating certain principles, port  is numbered \u201c38010\u201d and port  is numbered \u201c38030.\u201d According to an embodiment of system , configuration agent  may be configured to listen on port , which is coupled to origination port . In one embodiment, scanner  may be pre-configured before deployment in public network  to listen on port  on its loopback network interface (e.g., localhost, 127.0.0.1, etc.). Scanner  may be deployed in public network  (e.g., installed on a server in public network ), and coupled to SSH server  such that ports  and  are coupled to origination ports  and , respectively. For example, port  and  may be connected (physically, or virtually) to origination ports  and , respectively.","In general, configuration manager  may be configured to communicate through port , and scan controller  may be configured to communicate through port . In an example embodiment, port  may be numbered \u201c3801,\u201d and port  may be numbered \u201c3803.\u201d All configuration agents (e.g., configuration agent ) in private network  may communicate with configuration manager  through port number \u201c3801,\u201d whereas all scan engines (e.g., scan engine ) in private network  may communicate with scan controller  through port number \u201c3803.\u201d In an example embodiment, destination ports  and  on SSH client  may be coupled (physically or virtually) to ports  and , respectively.","From within private network  (e.g., from SSH client ), secure tunnel  may be created over connection (e.g., using commands such as ssh -R remotehost:38010 localhost:3801 remote_host_IP), such that origination port  may be forwarded to destination port . Subsequently, all communication to port  may be transferred to origination port , from where it is tunneled to destination port  over connection , and onto port . Unlike configuration agents (e.g., configuration agent ) located within private network , configuration agent  may be configured to poll configuration manager through port  (e.g., port number \u201c38010\u201d) at localhost rather than port  (e.g., port number \u201c3801\u201d) at the configuration manager's IP address. For example, configuration agent  may authenticate itself to configuration manager  through port .","In various embodiments, configuration manager  may be configured to recognize that configuration agent  is located outside private network . Configuration manager  may instruct configuration agent  to configure scan engine  to listen on port  (e.g., port number \u201c38030\u201d) at scanner  (e.g., localhost, 127.0.0.1, etc.) for scan information, rather than port  (e.g., port number \u201c3803\u201d) at the scan controller's IP address for scan engines (e.g., scan engine ) located within private network . From within private network  (e.g., from SSH client ), secure tunnel  may be created over connection (e.g., using commands such as ssh -R remotehost:38030 localhost:3803 remote_host_IP), such that origination port  may be forwarded to destination port . Scan controller  may send scan information through port  (e.g., port number \u201c3803\u201d), which is coupled to destination port . The scan information may be tunneled to origination port  over connection via secure tunnel , from where it is received by scan engine  through port  (e.g., port number \u201c38030\u201d). Scan engine  listening on port  may pick up the scan information, and proceed to scan assets accordingly.","Scanning assets may be done through regular communication channels, outside secure tunnels  and . For instance, scanner  may perform scans over public network  (i.e., outside of a secure tunnel), for example, to simulate a device's attempt to access certain files, assets, networks, etc. of private network  using public network  (such as the Internet). Scan results can be generated by scanner  in response to the performance of the scan and reporting results of the scan. After scanning, scan engine  may then communicate the scan results through port , which gets tunneled over secure tunnel  to scan controller  through port , for consideration by scan controller , for instance, in connection with other scan results received from other scan performed by other scanners, including scanners (e.g., scanner ) internal to the system (e.g., based in private network ).","Turning to ,  is a simplified block diagram showing an embodiment of system . A private network  may include a plurality of assets A-C. Scanner  may be located in cloud , which may be based in a public network. Two secure tunnels  may form point-to-point connections between scanner  and a scan controller and configuration manager (not shown) within private network . Using scanner configuration information and scan information provided over secure tunnels , scanner  may scan plurality of assets A-C in private network . Although only a few assets are shown in , it may be understood that any number of assets may be used in system  within the broad scope of the present disclosure.","Turning to ,  is a simplified block diagram showing another embodiment of system . Two private networks A and B (e.g., of two distinct enterprises) may communicate with scanners A, B, and C provided in cloud , which may include a public network. According to one embodiment, scanner A may form two secure tunnels A connecting scanner A point-to-point with a scan controller and configuration manager (not shown) within private network A. Similarly, scanner B may form two secure tunnels B connecting scanner B point-to-point with a scan controller and configuration manager (not shown) within private network B. Scanner C may form two secure tunnels C connecting scanner C point-to-point with the scan controller and configuration manager within private network B. The configurations permit each scanner A-C to communicate through unique ports to the corresponding scan controllers and configuration managers within the respective private networks. Thus, each scanner A-C may be configured for use in each of the corresponding private networks A and B. In one embodiment, scanner A may be configured specifically for private network A, and may not be used with any other private networks in that configuration. In another embodiment, scanner A may be initially configured for private network A. Based on scan loads and other considerations as appropriate, scanner A may be reconfigured (e.g., as a virtual machine capable of being dynamically provisioned to replace configurations of one private network (e.g., A) with configurations of another private network (e.g., B)) to form two secure tunnels D with private network B.","Turning to ,  is a simplified block diagram illustrating yet another embodiment of system . Scanners A and B may be located in distinct clouds A and B, respectively. The respective devices and systems implementing clouds A and B may be separated geographically; for example, cloud A may be located in the US, whereas cloud B may be located in China. Two separate sets of tunnels A and B may be established between respective scanners A and B with private network . In various embodiments, it may be desired to scan assets in private network  from different geographical locations (for example, to determine whether any additional vulnerabilities are present when accessed from one location as compared to the other location). Scanners A and B may be used to scan assets in private network , for example, to provide a comparison of vulnerabilities for accesses from different geographical locations.","Turning to ,  is a simplified block diagram illustrating yet another example embodiment of system . A scan engine service  may be provisioned in cloud . A cluster of scanners A-D may be managed by scan engine service . A plurality of private networks A, B and C (e.g., belonging to distinct enterprises) may use scan engine service . Each scanner A, B, C or D may be shared by multiple private networks (e.g., A and B, or A-C, etc.) Rather than using (and configuring) a specific scanner, respective scan controllers and other scan components located within private network  may use scanning services provided by scan engine service .","Turning to ,  is a simplified flow-chart illustrating operational steps that may be associated with embodiments of the present disclosure. Operations  begin at , when system  is activated. At , scanner  may be deployed in public network . At , scanner  may be configured to communicate scanner configuration information on a first port (e.g., port ) at scanner . In various embodiments, scanner  may be pre-configured (e.g., at factory, software development site, launch on the cloud, etc.) to communicate through the first port for scanner configuration information. At , a first origination port (e.g., port ) and a second origination port (e.g., port ) may be identified in public network . In some embodiments, the first origination port may be identical to the first port, and the second origination port may be identical to the second port. In other embodiments, the first origination port and the first port may be separate ports on a single device; likewise, the second origination port and the second port may be separate ports on a single device. In yet other embodiments, the first origination port may be located on a device that is separate and distinct from the device on which the first port is located. Likewise, the second origination port may be located on a device that is separate and distinct from the device on which the second port is located. \u201cIdentifying\u201d includes determining the IP address of the device on which the port is located and the port number.","At , the first port (e.g., port ) at scanner  is coupled to the first origination port (e.g., port ) and the second port (e.g., port ) is coupled to the second origination port (e.g., port ). In some embodiments, the coupling can be physical (e.g., by attaching wires, or a wireless connection), or virtual (e.g., by appropriate commands). Coupling the ports can enable one-to-one communication between the coupled ports, so that data at one port is translated directly to the coupled port across a communication link, without requiring advanced communication techniques, such as port forwarding.","At , a first destination port (e.g., port ) and a second destination port (e.g., port ) are identified in private network . At , the first destination port (e.g., port ) is coupled to a third port (e.g., port ) at configuration manager  and second destination port (e.g., port ) is coupled to a fourth port (e.g., port ) at scan controller . In some embodiments, the first destination port may be identical to the third port, and the second destination port may be identical to the fourth port. In other embodiments, the first destination port and the third port may be separate ports on a single device; likewise, the second destination port and the fourth port may be separate ports on a single device. In yet other embodiments, the first destination port may be located on a device that is separate and distinct from the device on which the third port is located. Likewise, the second destination port may be located on a device that is separate and distinct from the device on which the fourth port is located.","At , from within private network , the first origination port (e.g., port ) may be forwarded to first destination port over a first secure tunnel (e.g., secure tunnel ). Thus, all communication received at the first origination port (e.g., port ) may be forwarded across the first secure tunnel to the first destination port (e.g., port ). Because the first origination port (e.g., port ) is coupled to the first port (e.g., port ) at scanner , and the first destination port (e.g., port ) is coupled to the third port (e.g., port ) at configuration manager , all communication through the first port (e.g., port ) is forwarded to the third port (e.g., port ) over the first secure tunnel (e.g., secure tunnel ).","At , scanner configuration information may be communicated between configuration manager  and configuration agent  in scanner  over the first secure tunnel. For example, configuration agent  may authenticate itself to configuration manager  or poll configuration manager  through port  (e.g., localhost:38010). Configuration manager  may communicate scanner configuration information through port  (e.g., port number 3801). The scanner configuration information provided by configuration manager  through port  is tunneled through the first secure tunnel (e.g., secure tunnel ) and picked up by configuration agent . In some embodiments, configuration manager  may recognize that scanner  is located outside private network , and may instruct scanner  to communicate scan information through the second port (e.g., port ).","At , scanner  may be configured to communicate scan information through the second port (e.g., port ). At , from within private network , the second origination port (e.g., port ) may be forwarded to the second destination port (e.g., port ) to create a second secure tunnel (e.g., secure tunnel ). Thus, all communication received at the second origination port (e.g., port ) may be forwarded across the second secure tunnel (e.g., secure tunnel ) to the second destination port (e.g., port ). Because the second origination port (e.g., port ) is coupled to the second port (e.g., port ) at scanner , and the second destination port (e.g., port ) is coupled to the fourth port (e.g., port ) at scan controller , all communication through the second port (e.g., port ) is forwarded to the fourth port (e.g., port ) over the second secure tunnel (e.g., secure tunnel ).","At , a determination may be made (e.g., at scan controller ) whether an external scan on an asset may be performed. If external scan is chosen, scan controller  may communicate scan information over the second secure tunnel (e.g., secure tunnel ) to scan engine  in scanner  located in public network . Scanner  may perform an external scan of assets according to scan instructions and other scan information provided by scan controller . Scan engine  may communicate scan results and other scan information to scan controller  over the second secure tunnel (e.g., secure tunnel ).","On the other hand, if an internal scan is chosen, scan controller  may communicate scan information over internal network connections to scan engine , in scanner , located within private network . Scanner  may perform an internal scan of assets according to scan instructions and other scan information provided by scan controller . Scan engine  may communicate scan results and other scan information to scan controller  over internal network connections.
