{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation application of U.S. Non-Provisional application Ser. No. 13\/058,964, which was the National Stage of International Application Serial No. PCT\/US09\/53857, filed on Aug. 14, 2009, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/088,827, filed on Aug. 14, 2008, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to vehicle air springs and elastomeric compositions for making the same.","Air springs, or pneumatic suspension devices, have long been used to isolate road disturbances from a vehicle, seat, or cab. An air spring, as part of a vehicle's suspension, supports the vehicle's load or mass at each axle. Typically, each axle of a vehicle associated with an air spring supports the mass component or load carried by the axle. In addition, there may be ancillary air springs that support driver comfort in and around the driver's compartment, or cab. In an air spring, a volume of gas, usually air, is confined within a flexible container. As an air spring is compressed (jounce travel), the pressure of the gas within the air spring increases; and as an air spring extends (rebound travel), the pressure of the gas within the air spring decreases. Road disturbances are mainly absorbed by this compression and extension of the air springs as a function of work (w=\u222bF\u00b7dx). Air springs are often engineered to have a specific spring rate or spring constant, thereby controlling jounce and rebound characteristics for the desired application and for comfort.","Because an air spring may undergo countless cycles between compression and extension, the air spring must include an enclosure container for the gas that is flexible and durable. Typically, these enclosures are referred to as bellows or airsleeves and are made of cord-reinforced rubber compositions. The reinforcement in cord-reinforced rubber compositions may be fabric or metal, and cord-fabric may be, but is not limited to, natural or synthetic materials.","Over time and under operational stresses, the material properties of an airsleeve will change. Eventually, cracks may form and become sufficiently large so that the integrity of the airsleeve is challenged, requiring replacement. Thus, there is a need in the market for an air spring with an airsleeve having improved resistance to cracking.","In one or more embodiments, the present invention provides an air spring having an airsleeve, wherein at least one layer of said airsleeve includes the vulcanization product of an elastomer and syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene.","In one or more embodiments, the present invention provides a method for the production of an air spring airsleeve comprising mixing an elastomer, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, and a curative in a masterbatch to form a rubber composition, forming the rubber composition into the shape of an airsleeve, and curing the rubber composition.","In one or more embodiments, the present invention provides an air spring having an airsleeve, wherein at least one layer of said airsleeve has a rubber component comprising an elastomer and syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","12","14","12","14","12","16","12","16","12","16","12","18","18","12","10","20","12","22","24","26","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["30","30","32","34","32","34","32","36","32","34","30","38","32","40","42","30"]},"For both air spring assemblies  and , airsleeves  and  are made of cord-reinforced rubber and may be comprised of several layers, as shown in a cutaway view of an exemplary airsleeve  in .

Innerliner  and outer cover  may include calendered rubber. First ply  includes a single ply of cord-reinforced rubber with the cords at a specific bias angle. Second ply  includes a single ply of fabric-reinforced rubber with the same bias angle laid opposite that of first ply .","While the present invention is described in the context of an airsleeve and an air spring used in the suspension of an automobile, one of skill in the art will appreciate that the teachings disclosed are general and the present invention may be applied to other art relating to the air spring areas. The other areas might include, for example, air springs for seats, air springs used to support truck cabs, air springs used with buses, and the like.","One or more embodiments of the present invention are directed toward rubber compositions, which may also be referred to as vulcanizable compositions, that are useful in the manufacture of one or more layers of an air spring airsleeve. These vulcanizable compositions include a vulcanizable elastomer, syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, and optionally other ingredients known to be included in rubber compositions for preparing one or more layers of an airsleeve. These rubber compositions may be fabricated and cured into airsleeves and ultimately assembled into air springs by employing techniques known in the art.","In one or more embodiments, vulcanizable elastomer, which may also be referred to as rubber, includes those polymers that are capable of being cured (also referred to as vulcanized) to form elastomeric compositions of matter.","As those skilled in the art appreciate, exemplary elastomers include natural rubber, synthetic polyisoprene, polybutadiene, polyisobutylene-co-isoprene, polychloroprene, poly(ethylene-co-propylene), poly(styrene-co-butadiene), poly(styrene-co-isoprene), poly(styrene-co-isoprene-co-butadiene), poly(isoprene-co-butadiene), poly(ethylene-co-propylene-co-diene), polysulfide rubber, acrylic rubber, urethane rubber, silicone rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, and mixtures thereof.","In particular embodiments, the rubber includes polymers that derive from the polymerization of halogenated dienes and optionally monomer copolymerizable therewith.

These factices decrease compound nerve and may permit higher liquid plasticizer levels. Factices may also speed the incorporation of fillers and increase milling efficiency. A suitable factice is commercially available from Akrochem Corporation (Akron, Ohio) under the Akrofax tradename.","In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition of this invention may include carbon black. Carbon black is virtually pure elemental carbon in the form of colloidal particles that are produced by incomplete combustion or thermal decomposition of gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons under controlled conditions. Carbon black may be added to the vulcanizable composition as a reinforcing filler to achieve the required balance of processability, hardness and tensile or tear properties. Generally, any conventional carbon black, or blends of the same, used in compounding rubber-based airsleeve formulations is suitable for use in the present invention. Particularly useful carbon black varieties include those conforming to the characteristics of ASTM N550 and ASTM N762.","In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition of this invention may include silica. Useful forms of silica (silicon dioxide) include crystalline and amorphous silica. The crystalline form of silica includes quartz, tridymite and cristobalite. Amorphous silica may occur when the silicon and oxygen atoms are arranged in an irregular form as identified by X-ray diffraction. In one or more embodiments, the silica is a precipitated silica.

Stearic acid is particularly effective as a processing aid in minimizing mill and calendered roll sticking.","In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition of this invention may include metal oxides, such as magnesium oxide (MgO) or zinc oxide (ZnO). The primary function of metal oxides in neoprene compositions is to neutralize trace hydrogen chloride that may be liberated by the polymer during processing, vulcanization, heat aging, or service. By removing the hydrogen chloride, metal oxides prevent auto-catalytic decomposition, resulting in greater stability. Metal oxides may also take part in the crosslinking process by speeding the rate of reaction of elemental sulfur with the unsaturation of the rubber.","In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition of this invention may include antioxidants. A useful bisphenol type antioxidant is Vulkanox BKF, which does not discolor. Vulakanox BFK is commercially available from LANXESS (Leverkusen, Germany).","In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition of this invention may include a low-viscosity polyethylene wax. Low-viscosity polyethylene wax is a release, or antisticking, agent. A useful low-viscosity polyethylene wax is available from Akrochem Corporation (Akron, Ohio) under the Akrowax PE-100 tradename.","In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition of this invention may include wax. Wax is a processing aid and serves as a release agent.","In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition of this invention may include a plasticizer. A useful plasticizer is DOS (dioctyl sebacate), available from Harwick Standard (Akron, Ohio) under the tradename Polycizer DOS.","In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition of this invention may be prepared using a compatibilizer to improve the blending of the neoprene and the syndiotactic polybutadiene.

The cure package includes a sulfur-based compound and may also include other optional ingredients. Although one having skill in the art may appreciate other possible cure packages, an exemplary cure package includes sulfur, TMTM, and zinc oxide.","Sulfurs that are soluble or insoluble in elastomers may be used. An exemplary sulfur is Crystex OT 20, a polymeric sulfur that is insoluble in elastomers. At vulcanization temperatures, Crytex OT 20 de-polymerizes to soluble sulfur and behaves similarly to what is traditionally known as \u201crubber maker's sulfur\u201d and fosters the crosslinking of polymer molecules. Crystex OT 20 is commercially available from Flexsys (Akron, Ohio).","TMTM, or tetramethylthiuram monosulfide is a cure accelerator that increases the rate of cure by catalyzing the addition of sulfur chains to the rubber molecules. TMTM is commercially available from Western Reserve Chemical Corporation (Stow, Ohio).","Zinc oxide acts as a cure activator in the presence of sulfur, one or more accelerators, and unsaturated rubber to help promote the formation of sulfur cross-links during the vulcanization process.","Antidegradant protect the final product vulcanizate against damaging external influences such as oxidation, ozone, heat, and dynamic stresses. A suitable antidegradant is Vulkanox MB2, also known as 4- and 5-methyl-2-mercaptobenzimidazole (MMBI) and is commercially available from LANXESS (Leverkusen, Germany).","Another suitable antidegradant is Wingstay 100, which is a mixed diaryl-p-phenylenediamine type antidegradant.

IPPD is available through Flexsys (Akron, Ohio) under the tradename Santoflex IPPD.","Another suitable antidegradant is 6PPD, or N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N\u2032-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine. 6PPD is available through Flexsys (Akron, Ohio) under the tradename Santoflex 6PPD.","In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable compositions employed in practicing the present invention include a sufficient amount of vulcanizable rubber so as to achieve a technologically useful airsleeve of an air spring. In one or more embodiments, the overall vulcanizable composition of matter include at least 35% by weight, in other embodiments at least 40% by weight, and in other embodiments at least 45% by weight of vulcanizable rubber. In one or more embodiments, at least 80%, in other embodiments at least 90%, and in other embodiments at least 95% of the rubber component of the vulcanizable composition comprises polychloroprene or polychloroprene copolymers.","In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition of this invention includes at least about 5, in other embodiments at least about 8, and in other embodiments at least about 10 parts by weight (pbw) of syndiotactic polybutadiene per 100 parts by weight of rubber (e.g. total rubber).

In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition may include less than about 20, in other embodiments less than about 15, and in other embodiments less than about 12 phr of factice.","In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition may include at least about 20, in other embodiments at least about 30, and in other embodiments at least about 40 phr of carbon black. In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition may include less than about 100, in other embodiments less than about \u221275, and in other embodiments less than about 50 phr of carbon black.","In one or more embodiments, the vulcanizable composition may include at least about 15, in other embodiments at least about 20, and in other embodiments at least about 25 phr of silica. In one or more embodiments the vulcanizable composition may include less than about 250, in other embodiments less than about 200, in other embodiments less than about 90, and in other embodiments less than about 80 phr of silica.","Those skilled in the art will be able to select an appropriate amount of the various ingredients that can be used based upon the ultimate desired properties sought within the airsleeve of an air spring. Likewise, those skilled in the art will be able to select an appropriate amount of curative and complementary cure agents in order to achieve a desired level of cure.","The rubber compositions for preparing one or more layers of airsleeve according to the present invention can be prepared by conventional means using conventional rubber compounding equipment such as Brabender, Banbury, Werner-Pfleiderer, Sigma-blade mixer, two-roll mill, or other mixers suitable for forming viscous, relatively uniform admixtures. Mixing techniques depend on a variety of factors such as the specific types of polymers, fillers, processing oils, waxes, and other ingredients used. In one or more embodiments, the ingredients can be added together in a single stage. In other embodiments, some of the ingredients such as syndiotactic polybutadiene, carbon black, etc. can be first loaded followed by the rubber. In other embodiments, a more conventional manner can be employed where the rubber is added first followed by the other ingredients. In even other embodiments, the rubber may be added at the same time as the syndiotactic polybutadiene.","When utilizing an internal mixer, the dry or powdery materials such as the carbon black can be added first, followed by the processing aids and finally the neoprene (this type of mixing can be referred to as an upside-down mixing technique).","Mixing cycles generally range from about 2 to 10 minutes. In certain embodiments an incremental procedure can be used whereby the rubber and part of the ingredients are added first, and the remaining ingredients are added in additional increments. In other embodiments, part of the rubber can be added on top of the other ingredients. In other embodiments, the rubber and syndiotactic polybutadiene are added together. In one or more embodiments, two-stage mixing can be employed.","The syndiotactic polybutadiene can be added with the rubber near the beginning of the mixing cycle. In one or more embodiments, the syndiotactic polybutadiene is included before the cure package is added.","Because of the melting point of the syndiotactic polybutadiene, the masterbatch drop temperature may be set to about 100\u00b110\u00b0 C.","The cure package (sulfur, accelerators, activators, etc.) can be added near the end of the mixing cycle and at lower temperatures to prevent premature crosslinking of the neoprene chains.","Once mixed, the rubber composition can be then formed into a sheet via calendering or combined with a fabric or metal reinforcing cord. The rubber compositions of the invention can also be formed into various types of articles using other techniques such as extrusion.","In one or more embodiments, the rubber compositions of the present invention include discontinuous domains of syndiotactic polybutadiene in polychloroprene or polychloroprene copolymers. It is believed that these domains are formed because syndiotactic polybutadiene and polychloroprene or polychloroprene copolymers are immiscible. Despite this, the rubber compositions of the present invention have advantageous qualities. By selecting syndiotactic polybutadiene having the disclosed melting temperatures, the syndiotactic polybutadiene can be dispersed into the neoprene without employing high mixing temperatures that may cause scorching of the polychloroprene or polychloroprene copolymers.","The vulcanizable rubber compositions of the present invention can be formed into airsleeves of air springs by employing conventional techniques for fabricating and manufacturing air springs.","In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention, the following examples have been prepared and tested. The examples should not, however, be viewed as limiting the scope of the invention. Accordingly, for an appreciation of the true scope and breadth of the invention, reference should be made to the following claims.","Two airsleeve rubber compositions were prepared according to the examples in Table I, and the parts of each ingredient are by weight, unless otherwise specified. The first rubber composition did not include syndiotactic polybutadiene. The second rubber composition included syndiotactic polybutadiene having a 1,2-linkage content of about 92%, a melt temperature of about 95\u00b0 C., a density of about 906 kg\/m, a crystallinity of about 15-30% and a molecular weight of about 120 kg\/mol. The Polychloroprene I and polychloroprene II were copolymers of chloroprene and 2,3-dichloro-1,3-butadiene.
