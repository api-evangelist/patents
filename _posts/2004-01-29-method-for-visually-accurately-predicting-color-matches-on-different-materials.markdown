title: Method for visually accurately predicting color matches on different materials
abstract: An example method uses a spectrophotometer to collect reflectance curve data from a physical sample colored to a desired color. The reflectance curve data is employed to produce computer display outputs of substrates as they would be appear if colored with the desired color. The method includes using a colorimeter to collect calorimetric data from the outputs on the display. The sets of colorimetric data are compared and data that facilitate manipulating the reflectance curve data associated with the desired color is produced. The synthetic reflectance curve data facilitates producing matches for the various substrates as colored and displayed on the computer display. The synthetic reflectance curve data may also be used to manipulate colorant formulae.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The systems, methods, application programming interfaces (API), graphical user interfaces (GUI), data packets, and computer readable media described herein relate generally to computer programming and more particularly to acquiring and manipulating reflectance curve data to facilitate matching colors on materials with different properties (e.g., texture, construction).","Materials with different properties like texture, construction, opacity, and so on reflect light differently. Thus, when the same colorant is applied to materials with different properties the two colored materials may have different appearances. For example, a first shade of blue paint, applied to a substantially smooth surface may have a different appearance than the same shade of blue paint when applied to a textured surface. Similarly, a first shade of red dye may yield a first appearance when applied to a cotton knitted garment and a second appearance when applied to a cotton woven garment. Apparent color mismatches are also evidenced in color matching that attempts to cross product lines. For example, a first shade of green may have a first appearance on a football jersey, a second appearance on a poster promoting the team with the green jerseys, a third appearance on a toy rubber football promoting the team with the green jerseys, a fourth appearance on a promotional foam finger, a fifth appearance on a team key chain, a sixth appearance on a cotton baby outfit, and so on. Ideally, to enhance marketing and promotion, the green would appear substantially identical on all products, regardless of the material and\/or substrate on which the color appears.","Matching colors on materials with different properties has historically been undertaken in applications including, but not limited to, textile dyeing, leather tanning, leather dying, plastics master-batching, coatings, point of sale paints, trade sale paints, wood stains and so on. Typically, color matching on materials with different properties has relied on a human technician applying intuition, experience and ad hoc methods. Thus, varying results may be attained due to the varying levels of technician experience, skill, visual capacity for discerning color differences, and estimating\u2014based on experience in color matching\u2014the combination and proportions of colorants employed to match a color on two or more substrates. By way of illustration, a color formula for a latex paint may be an ideal match when the paint is applied to a flat, non-porous surface. However, when the same latex paint is applied to a highly textured surface, it will appear to be unacceptably off-color. Commercially this causes customer complaints, returns and so on.","Improved, automated, repeatable methods for color matching on materials with different properties is desired. Thus, the following summary presents a simplified overview of methods, systems, computer readable media and so on for automated color matching on different materials using acquired, manipulated, and synthetic reflectance curve data to facilitate providing a basic understanding of these items. This summary is not an extensive overview and is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the methods, systems, computer readable media, and so on or to delineate the scope of these items. This summary provides a conceptual introduction in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The application describes systems and methods for determining a predicted color match between dissimilar materials using reflectance data from a \u201cstandard object\u201d and an electronically computed \u201ccompensation\u201d to the \u201cstandard\u201d color derived from digital imaging on a calibrated computer monitor (e.g., cathode ray tube (CRT) or other similar device for displaying computer output) that equalizes the observed color in and\/or on materials with different surface qualities. In one example, the resulting synthesized reflectance data is then employed in formulating a matching colorant.","One example method includes using a spectrophotometer to collect measurement data, in the form of a reflectance curve data, from an actual physical sample colored to the desired color. The method includes accessing a computer on which digital images, representations, and\/or models of various substrates are stored. The digital images, representations, and\/or models of the various substrates are stored in the computer in a manner that facilitates producing an output on a computer display, where the output will be the substrate as it would appear when colored with the color on the actual physical sample from which the reflectance curve data was acquired using the spectrophotometer.","Thus, the example method includes producing an output on the display of a first substrate as it would be appear if colored with the color on the actual physical sample from which the reflectance curve data was acquired using the spectrophotometer. The example method then includes using a calorimeter to collect calorimetric data from the output on the display, where the calorimetric data can be employed to characterize, evaluate, measure and\/or record the color of the first substrate produced on the output display.","The method then includes producing an output on the display of a second substrate as it would be appear if colored with the color on the actual physical sample from which the reflectance curve data was acquired using the spectrophotometer. The example method then includes using a colorimeter to collect calorimetric data from the output on the display, where the calorimetric data can be employed to characterize, evaluate, measure and\/or record the color of the second substrate produced on the output display.","Once the colorimetric data has been acquired for the two substrates as rendered by the color from the actual physical sample, the two sets of calorimetric data can be processed to determine similarities and\/or differences between the two colors produced on the output display. In one example, a compensation value is produced that facilitates creating synthetic reflectance curve data. The synthetic reflectance curve data can then be employed to manipulate the original reflectance curve data acquired from the actual physical object that was colored to the desired color. The synthetic reflectance curve data thus facilitates matching the output appearance of the second substrate as colored to the first substrate as colored. Once a match has been made to within a predetermined, configurable tolerance, the synthetic reflectance curve data can then be employed to develop, update, and\/or modify, for example, a colorant formula, to facilitate matching the apparent color on two different physical items with different properties.","Certain illustrative example methods, systems, computer readable media and so on are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These examples are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the methods, systems, computer readable media and so on may be employed and thus are intended to be inclusive of equivalents. Other advantages and novel features may become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","Example systems, methods, computer media, and so on are now described with reference to the drawings, where like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout.

The application describes example systems and methods for determining a predicted color match between dissimilar materials using reflectance data acquired from a \u201cstandard object\u201d. Reflectance data is acquired, in one example, as a reflectance curve from a spectrophotometer. In general, the data acquired from the spectrophotometer can be referred to as \u201cspectrophotometric data\u201d, one example of which is a reflectance curve. A spectrophotometer is used to acquire spectrophotometric data from a physical sample that has been colored to a desired color. Then, to match the desired color on other substrates, a database of digital images of substrates is accessed. One or more digital images of substrates are electronically \u201ccolored\u201d according to the spectrophotometric data and displayed on a computer monitor or similar display device. The coloring is performed by a computer component.","A colorimeter is employed to acquire colorimetric data associated with the display on the computer monitor or similar display device. For one or more calorimetric data sets, a compensation value is programmatically and\/or electronically computed. The compensation value facilitates equalizing the color observed on one or more materials with different properties so that those materials with different properties, after being colored, will appear to be the same color as the color on the actual physical sample that has the desired color. In one example, the compensation value is used as an input to a computer component that computes a synthetic reflectance curve for the color that should be applied to a material to make it match the color on the actual sample. In one example, the resulting synthesized reflectance curve is employed to formulate a matching colorant (e.g., paint, dye, ink).

The system  includes a computer  that receives spectrophotometric data  from, for example, a spectrophotometer. The spectrophotometric data  may be acquired substantially simultaneously with performing the color matching, or it may be acquired at a point in time remote from the color matching. For example, spectrophotometric data may be acquired at a first time (e.g., June), at a first location (e.g., scanning a clothing artifact unearthed during an archeological trip to Machu Pichu) from an article of clothing made from a first fabric (e.g., llama wool). The spectrophotometric data may then be stored for later use (e.g., August) to manufacture a reproduction garment made of a second material (e.g., nylon). Thus, the computer  may receive the spectrophotometric data in various ways, in various formats at various times.","The spectrophotometric data  may be of a \u201creference sample\u201d or \u201cactual physical sample\u201d that has been colored to a \u201cdesired color\u201d. In one example, a fabric sample is placed on a flatbed scanner and the image data  is acquired from the flatbed scanner. While a flatbed scanner is described, it is to be appreciated that other image capturing devices can be employed. The image data  is then transformed by the software into, for example, a reflectance curve. In one example, the spectral reflectance measurement of a target color on the standard substrate is obtained using a spectrophotometer. The spectral reflectance is represented by R(\u03bb) or R(\u03bb), i=1, 2, . . . n, where n is the total number of the wavelengths.","The computer  receives the spectrophotometric data generated from the image data  and accesses a data store .

The data may be, for example, in the xyY value form or comparable colorimetric equation (e.g., \u0394X=X\u2212X, \u0394Y=Y\u2212Y, \u0394Z=Z\u2212Z).","The calorimetric data  is fed back into the computer  and\/or to one or more other cooperating computer components and stored for future comparison to other colorimetric data  acquired from other images displayed on display .

The digital image may be stored, for example, in a substrate data store (e.g., database). The substrate may be, for example, a computer image of a fabric, a plastic, a plaster, a wood, a rubber, and so on. The computer image may be, for example, acquired from a scanner, produced programmatically by a programmer, produced graphically by an artist, and so on. The digital image has a form that facilitates \u201ccoloring\u201d the image with spectrophotometric data.

Now the method  has two or more sets of calorimetric data associated with displayed images. One set of calorimetric data is associated with the computer display of a reference sample that has been colored to a desired color. One or more other sets of colorimetric data are associated with computer displays of simulated samples that have been colored according to spectrophotometric data retrieved from the reference sample. Thus, at , the first colorimetric data and the second colorimetric data(s) are compared to determine what differences, if any, exist between the displays. In one example, the method calculates the image of the target color on the standard substrate. For example, the RGB value of image pixels is calculated as:\n\n{}=\u0192({}(\u03bb)) For 1,2\n\nwhere the function \u0192 represents an algorithm.

For example, a piece of cloth could be placed on a flatbed scanner and an image data acquired from which a reflectance curve can be generated. At , the method includes generating a first output color. The first output color is generated by applying the spectrophotometric data to a first simulated substrate. For example, a digital image could be retrieved from a database of digital images of substrates and colored according to the spectrophotometric data.","At , colorimetric data associated with the first output color is acquired.

In the loop, one or more additional colors are generated, displayed, and analyzed to acquire calorimetric data. For each of the additional colors that are generated, displayed, and analyzed, a synthetic reflectance curve is generated. The synthetic reflectance curve facilitates producing a color that when applied to a simulated substrate will make that simulated substrate appear to have the same color as the reference sample and\/or that facilitates resolving differences in apparent colors. In one example, the synthetic reflectance curve is employed to generate a formula for a colorant that can be applied to an actual substrate to make it appear to match the reference sample.","At , a determination is made whether all N, N being an integer, desired substrates have been analyzed. If the determination is yes, then processing can conclude. Otherwise processing continues at .","At , another output color is generated by applying the spectrophotometric data to another simulated substrate. The output color can then be displayed. Thus, at , colorimetric data associated with the output color can be acquired. For example, a calorimeter can acquire data from a computer monitor displaying the output color. In one example, at , a compensation value is generated that facilitates, at , computing a synthetic reflectance curve for a color that facilitates matching colors on materials with different properties. Though a compensation value is computed at , it is to be appreciated that other values and\/or formulae can be applied to facilitate producing the synthetic reflectance curve at . In one example, at , a matching formula is computed. The formula can be computed to facilitate having the apparent colors of different materials appear the same. The matching formula may be based on the synthetic reflectance curve of  and\/or the compensation value of 1170.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 13","FIG. 14","FIG. 14"],"b":["1200","1210","1200","1310","1200","1210","1310","1410","1440","1420","1430"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1500","1502","1504","1506","1510","1512","1508","1500","1500","1502","1504","1506","1506","1504","1514","1516","1506","1504","1500"]},"The bus  can be a single internal bus interconnect architecture and\/or other bus architectures. The bus  can be of a variety of types including, but not limited to, a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus or external bus, and\/or a local bus. The local bus can be of varieties including, but not limited to, an industrial standard architecture (ISA) bus, a microchannel architecture (MSA) bus, an extended ISA (EISA) bus, a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus, a universal serial (USB) bus, and a small computer systems interface (SCSI) bus.","The computer  interacts with input\/output devices  via input\/output ports . Input\/output devices  can include, but are not limited to, a scanner, a spectrophotometer, a calorimeter, a keyboard, a microphone, a pointing and selection device, cameras, video cards, displays, and the like. The input\/output ports  can include but are not limited to, serial ports, parallel ports, and USB ports.","The computer  can operate in a network environment and thus is connected to a network  by a network interface . Through the network , the computer  may be logically connected to a remote computer . The network  can include, but is not limited to, local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN), and other networks. The network interface  can connect to local area network technologies including, but not limited to, fiber distributed data interface (FDDI), copper distributed data interface (CDDI), ethernet\/IEEE 802.3, token ring\/IEEE 802.5, and the like. Similarly, the network interface  can connect to wide area network technologies including, but not limited to, point to point links, circuit switching networks like integrated services digital networks (ISDN), packet switching networks, and digital subscriber lines (DSL). Since the computer  can be connected with other computers, and since the systems and methods described herein may include distributed communicating and cooperating computer components, information may be transmitted between these components.","Thus, referring now to , information can be transmitted between various computer components associated with matching colors on materials with different properties described herein via a data packet . An exemplary data packet  is shown. The data packet  includes a header field  that includes information like the length and type of packet. A source identifier  follows the header field  and includes, for example, an address of the computer component from which the packet  originated. Following the source identifier , the packet  includes a destination identifier  that holds, for example, an address of the computer component to which the packet  is ultimately destined. Source and destination identifiers can be, for example, globally unique identifiers (guids), URLS (uniform resource locators), path names, and the like. The data field  in the packet  includes various information intended for the receiving computer component. The data packet  ends with an error detecting and\/or correcting field  that facilitates a computer component determining if it has properly received the packet . While six fields are illustrated in the data packet , it is to be appreciated that a greater and\/or lesser number of fields can be present in data packets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 16"],"b":["1700","1640","1700","1700","1710"]},"The sub-fields  may also include a field  that holds calorimetric data. The calorimetric data may have been acquired, for example, by using a calorimeter to analyze a color displayed on a computer monitor or other display device. By way of illustration, a color may have been generated by applying the spectrophotometric data stored in field  to a digital image of a simulated substrate. The color may then have been displayed on a computer monitor and a colorimeter employed to analyze that color and produce the calorimetric data stored in field . While a single calorimetric field  is illustrated, it is to be appreciated that a greater number of colorimetric data fields  may be included in the sub-fields .","As a result of analyzing one or more sets of colorimetric data, a synthetic spectrophotometric data may be generated. Thus, the sub-fields  may include a field  for storing spectrophotometric data. While a single field  is illustrated, it is to be appreciated that there may be two or more such fields. For example, there may be a field  for storing a synthetic spectrophotometric data for each of a corresponding colorimetric data stored in a field .","Referring now to , an application programming interface (API)  is illustrated providing access to a system  for matching colors on materials with different properties. The API  can be employed, for example, by programmers  and\/or processes  to gain access to processing performed by the system . For example, a programmer  can write a program to access the system  (e.g., to invoke its operation, to monitor its operation, to access its functionality) where writing a program is facilitated by the presence of the API . Thus, rather than a programmer  having to understand the internals of the system , the programmer's task is simplified by merely having to learn the interface to the system . This facilitates encapsulating the functionality of the color matching system  while exposing that functionality. Similarly, the API  can be employed to provide data values to the system  and\/or retrieve data values from the system . For example, a process  that processes spectrophotometric data can provide that data to the system  via the API  by, for example, using a call provided in the API . Thus, in one example of the API , a set of application program interfaces can be stored on a computer-readable medium. The interfaces can be employed by a programmer, computer component, and\/or process to gain access to a color matching system . Interfaces can include, but are not limited to, a first interface  that communicates a spectrophotometric data, a second interface  that communicates a calorimetric data, and a third interface  that communicates a synthetic spectro-photometric data related to the colorimetric data communicated by interface  and the spectrophotometric data communicated by the interface .","The systems, methods, and objects described herein may be stored, for example, on a computer readable media. Media can include, but are not limited to, an ASIC, a CD, a DVD, a RAM, a ROM, a PROM, a disk, a carrier wave, a memory stick, and the like. Thus, an example computer readable medium can store computer executable instructions for a method for matching colors on materials with different properties. Similarly, a computer readable medium can store computer executable components of a system for matching colors on materials with different properties.","What has been described above includes several examples. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the systems, methods, computer readable media and so on employed in matching colors on materials with different properties. However, one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that further combinations and permutations are possible. Accordingly, this application is intended to embrace alterations, modifications, and variations that fall within the scope of the appended claims. Furthermore, the preceding description is not meant to limit the scope of the invention. Rather, the scope of the invention is to be determined only by the appended claims and their equivalents.","While the systems, methods and so on herein have been illustrated by describing examples, and while the examples have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicants to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention, in its broader aspects, is not limited to the specific details, the representative apparatus, and illustrative examples shown and described. Accordingly, departures may be made from such details without departing from the spirit or scope of the applicant's general inventive concept.","Furthermore, to the extent that the term \u201cincludes\u201d is employed in the detailed description or the claims, it is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term \u201ccomprising\u201d as that term is interpreted when employed as a transitional word in a claim. Further still, to the extent that the term \u201cor\u201d is employed in the claims (e.g., A or B) it is intended to mean \u201cA or B or both\u201d. When the author intends to indicate \u201conly A or B but not both\u201d, then the author will employ the term \u201cA or B but not both\u201d. Thus, use of the term \u201cor\u201d herein is the inclusive, and not the exclusive, use. See BA.
