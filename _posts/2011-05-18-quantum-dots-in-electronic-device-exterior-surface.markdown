title: Quantum dots in electronic device exterior surface
abstract: Applying quantum dots to surface features of an electronic device to augment or replace reflective and transmissive features. Applying quantum dots can yield more efficient illumination of those features and can permit use of diverse internal light sources to cause those features to emit any color of visible light. An electronic device, keyboard for same and method of applying features to areas of the exterior surface of an electronic device are provided. Quantum dots are applied to an area of the exterior surface that is illuminated by the device's internal light source. The quantum dots absorb incident light then emit predetermined longer wavelength light. The interior light may be a UV light, high energy light emitting diode, or back light. The quantum dots can be applied to exterior surfaces, buttons or key on electronic devices, mobile devices, and keyboards for mobile devices.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to illuminating features on the exterior of an electronic device.","Typically, an electronic device will have features on its exterior surface which provide visual cues to the user to assist him or her when interacting with the device. In this context, a feature is a letter, symbol, shape or combination thereof having some color or combination of colors. For example, the IEEE 1621 standard symbol for power  may appear in red on a button of a mobile device while the manufacturer's trade-mark may appear in white elsewhere on the device's black exterior surface. The features considered herein should not be limiting and may comprise any shapes and any colors which provide visual cues for the user.","To make features visible in a wide range of lighting conditions, the features commonly reflect light from external sources and transmit light from an internal light source within the electronic device.","Typically, external light sources, such as the sun or office florescent tube lighting, emit light including wavelengths from all parts of the visible spectrum of light. This is more pleasing to the eye than light sources having a narrow visible spectrum or containing fewer wavelengths of visible light. Furthermore, when incident light contains a broad visible spectrum of light, any color can be selected for a feature and that color can be reflected from the broad spectrum external light.","Light sources internal to an electronic device similarly usually provide a broad spectrum of incident light so that any color can be selected for a feature and that color can be transmitted through the feature from the broad spectrum internal light. If an internal light source did not include a broad spectrum of visible light, the available colors that features could transmit would be limited by the spectrum of the internal light source. For example, a dishwasher with a blue internal light could not correctly illuminate red, green, yellow or white colored features solely by transmission of its blue light through those features.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","The present disclosure applies quantum dots to a feature of an electronic device to augment or replace reflective and transmissive colorants. The inclusion of quantum dots permits the use internal light sources emitting high energy, short wavelength, non-white light without restricting the potential colors or intensity of features illuminated on the device. Applying quantum dots to features of an electronic device also makes more efficient use of the light provided by the light source and may reduce the energy used by the device to illuminate a broad spectrum of colored features. Efficiency may be increased because the intensity of short wavelength light is less reduced by filtering and absorption effects and because quantum dots use any higher energy light to emit a specific lower energy wavelength while reflective or transmissive colorants without quantum dots cannot use other wavelengths of light to increase the emission of their particular color.","A quantum dot is type of small particle that absorbs, and is excited by, incident light. If the energy absorbed from the incident light is great enough, this excitation causes the quantum dot to emit light at a specific, lower energy, longer wavelength. Accordingly\u2014and unlike reflection and transmission by other colorants\u2014absorption and emission by quantum dots can change the wavelengths (and hence color) of the light involved. The wavelength of light emitted depends on the size of the quantum dot. The smaller the size of the quantum dot, the shorter the wavelength of the emitted light. Because the size of a quantum dot can be controlled when the quantum dot is manufactured, it is possible to create quantum dots that will emit any wavelength in the visible spectrum. Furthermore, a mixture of different sized quantum dots can be made which can emit a spectrum of visible light comprising a number of wavelengths. For example, a mixture of different quantum dot sizes illuminated solely by non-visible ultraviolet light can produce visible white light.","Some quantum dots are semiconductors whose excitons are confined in all three spatial dimensions. Some quantum dots are nanocrystals. Some quantum dots are reactive to moisture and air and are conventionally manufactured to prevent exposure of the quantum dots.","When an electronic device is designed to illuminate features of any possible color from an internal light source, that internal light source should provide a spectrum of light including all visible wavelengths so that features of any color can be illuminated by the light source. This restriction is based on the principle that reflection and transmission of light generally cannot change the wavelength (or color) of the light involved. Accordingly, to illuminate all colors of features, the light source must contain all colors of light. By applying quantum dots to a color feature of an electronic device, the quantum dots can generate different wavelengths of light than the wavelengths provided by the light source.","Without quantum dots, a reflective or transmissive red colored feature appears red under broad spectrum light because it absorbs all incident wavelengths except red, which is reflected or transmitted and thus visible to an observer. If that red feature was illuminated solely by blue light, it would appear dark to an observer because the feature absorbs the blue light and has no red light to reflect or transmit. By applying quantum dots of a particular size to the red feature, a portion of the higher energy, shorter wavelength, blue light is absorbed by the quantum dots and re-emitted as red light. Some blue light will pass through undisturbed. The amount of blue light that is absorbed and re-emitted as red light depends on the density of the quantum dots in the feature.","In some electronic devices, a high intensity white light emitting diode (LED) has been used to provide a broad spectrum visible light source. However, even the best white LEDs provide uneven intensities of colors. In some electronic devices, red features illuminated by these white LEDs will appear to have reduced color saturation in comparison to other colored features illuminated by the same light source.","Without quantum dots, any light of non-red wavelengths that is absorbed by the red feature represents energy that was wasted by the electronic device. By applying quantum dots to the red colored feature, even if the white LED light source does not change, the higher energy light from the source can be absorbed by the quantum dots causing more red light, or greater intensity red light, to be emitted. Thus applying quantum dots to the red feature can increase the efficiency of the device by increasing the intensity of light emitted by the colored feature.","Quantum dots applied to an area of the exterior surface of an electrical device permit light emitted from the quantum dots to be visually perceived by a user interacting with the device. For the quantum dots to emit light by excitation from a light source internal to the device, the internal light source must illuminate the quantum dots. In environments where there is little external light, illumination and excitation by the internal light source permits emission of light by the quantum dots which makes the features of the electronic device visible to the user.","The quantum dots can also be illuminated by external light sources and will similarly absorb and emit light if the incident light is of sufficiently short wavelength, high frequency or high energy.","One aspect of the present disclosure provides an electronic device comprising: an internal light source, a housing having an exterior surface and a quantum dot mixture applied to an area of the exterior surface. The quantum dots mixture emits a spectrum of light in response to illumination from the light source.","Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a keypad for an electronic device having an internal light source. The keypad comprises a plurality of keys each having an exterior surface and a quantum dot mixture applied to an area of an exterior surface of at least one key. The quantum dot mixture emits a spectrum of light in response to illumination from the light source.","A further aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for providing a feature on an exterior surface of an electronic device having an internal light source. The method comprises: defining an area of the exterior surface that is illuminable by the internal light source and applying quantum dots to the area in the shape and color of the feature.","Reference is first made to  which illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a mobile communication device (mobile device)  in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile device  is a two-way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device , in various embodiments the device  may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system with a wireless modem.","The mobile device  includes a rigid case (not shown in ) housing the components of the device . The internal components of the device  are constructed on a printed circuit board (PCB). The mobile device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem  (sometimes referred to as a radio layer) for exchanging radio frequency signals with a wireless network  to perform communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen  such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, input devices  such as a keyboard and control buttons, flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, speaker , microphone , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The device  may comprise a touch screen display in some embodiments. The touch screen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller. In some embodiments, a touch screen is integrated directly with the display. In still other embodiments, a touch screen is placed behind the display.","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the mobile device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which mobile device  is intended to operate.","The mobile device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are output to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  comprise operating system software , software applications  comprising an email messaging application  (also referred to as an email client ), a personal address book , a calendar application , and a phone application .","The software applications  also may include a range of applications, including, for example, a notepad application, Internet browser application, voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, mapping application, or a media player application, or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display screen ) according to the application.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","In some embodiments, the auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS (Global Positioning System) subsystem comprising a GPS receiver or transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise a pointing or navigational input device such as a touchpad, a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel, or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device  such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some embodiments, the mobile device  also includes a removable memory card or module  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory card interface . Network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device  via the memory card , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the mobile device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The mobile device  also stores other data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments, the data  includes service data comprising information required by the mobile device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the mobile device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.","The mobile device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .","The mobile device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the mobile device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals are output to the speaker  and signals for transmission are generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., the phone application ) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display screen  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","The phone application  can be split into multiple applications or sub-modules, for example one or more user phone modules and a call control module. The user phone modules provide a variety of telephony features through a user interface, while the call control module provides access to common telephony functions desired by the user phone modules, such that telephony requests from phone modules can be coordinated and so that the user phone modules do not need to each provide instructions understood by the wireless communications subsystem . The call control function typically makes telephony features available to user phone modules through an application programming interface (API). It is to be recognized that all or part of the phone application  features or functions could be provided through the operating system or otherwise distributed in the device , while continuing to fall within the term phone application .","The present disclosure applies quantum dots to an exterior surface of an electronic device such as a mobile communication device  or any of the other electronic devices described in respect of . The breadth of possible electronic devices contemplated is very large. Any electronic device that includes an internal light source for illuminating the exterior surface of the device can have quantum dots applied according to the present disclosure. Quantum dots can also be applied advantageously to electronic devices having external features that should be visible to the user when there is no or minimal external light. For the purposes of explanation, the present disclosure uses mobile communication device  as an example of any electronic device. The present disclosure may also be applied as a reflective surface on an electronic or a non-electronic device to absorb light from a light source and emit a desired wavelength or wavelengths of light.","Referring to , a cut away side view of an embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated. An electronic device  comprises an internal light source , a housing  having an exterior surface  and a quantum dot mixture . The quantum dot mixture  emits a spectrum of light  in response to illumination  from the light source .","In , a partially cut away embodiment of an electronic device  is illustrated. The electronic device  comprises a housing  having an external surface  and an internal light source . The external surface  includes buttons  and a keypad  having a plurality of keys . Features  are disposed in areas of the external surface  including areas of the buttons , and keys . The internal light source  emits light  which is absorbed by a quantum dot mixture , exciting quantum dots in the quantum dot mixture  which then emit lower energy, longer wavelength, light .","Referring to , a partially cut away embodiment of a keypad  according another embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated. The keypad  comprises a plurality of keys  each having an exterior surface . A quantum dot mixture  is applied to an area of the external surface  of at least one key . The quantum dot mixture  emits a spectrum of light (not shown in ) in response to illumination from an internal light source (not shown in ) of an electronic device that receives the keypad .","In , portions of an exterior surface  of a mobile communication device  are illustrated. The illustrated exterior surface  comprises a rigid case housing the components of mobile device . The exterior surface  includes buttons  and a keyboard  having a plurality of keys . Features  are provided on areas of the exterior surface  to visually contrast with the remainder exterior surface  and provide visual cues for a user interacting with the mobile device . The features in  are provided in areas of the buttons , keys  and other portions of the exterior surface . Features  may take the form of letters, symbols, trade-marks and logos. The visual design of features  is unlimited: the features may be provided in any colors and may take on any shapes. In some embodiments, a feature spans over or is integrated into one or more buttons or other portions of the exterior surface .","In some embodiments, such as that shown in , portions of the exterior surface  are not always exposed on the electronic device. The mobile device  in  is illustrated in an open configuration. In a closed configuration of an embodiment, a portion of the exterior surface , including the keypad , slides behind the display and buttons  temporarily hiding the keypad  and part of the exterior surface  from view. Other examples of exterior surfaces which may, from time to time be hidden from view include surfaces on the inside of a closed flip or clamshell shaped mobile device, or on the surface of a keyboard of a closed laptop computer.","Referring now to  an exploded view some of the physical components within an example mobile communication device  is illustrated. When assembled, portions of many different physical components form the exterior surface . These include the top frame , the display enclosure , the first and second lateral frames , , the keypad frame , the keypad , the bottom frame,  and the back cover  along with various buttons (not shown in ). Other physical components illustrated in  include the keypad printed circuit board (PCB) , display , the battery , first and second slider assemblies , , interconnect  and mainboard . In this embodiment the internal light source comprises the keypad printed circuit board  and the display . When assembled, light emitted from these sources can illuminate the features  of the external surface.","An area of the exterior surface  bearing a feature  will generally comprise a light transmissive material so that light from an internal light source can excite quantum dots in the feature . The feature  may comprise a quantum dot mixture which is painted or sprayed onto the area of the exterior surface . Such paint may be applied directly to an exterior surface or on the inside of the exterior surface beneath a light transmissive material, screen printed or applied by an in mold decoration process. When applied to an external surface, a further protective coating and other light transmissive layers may also be applied over the quantum dots. Quantum dots may also be applied in the shape of a feature  by applying a stamp, adhesive, coating or film to the exterior surface . In some example embodiments, quantum dots are applied to a feature  by a screen printing process or applied by an in mold decoration process, such as when forming a key, keypad or a painted cover lens. In some example embodiments, a filter containing quantum dots may be applied to or within the exterior surface  to form a feature . In some example embodiments the quantum dots may be injected into the light transmissive material as it is being formed into a portion of the exterior surface , such as a key  or button .","The quantum dot mixture that is applied to an area of the exterior surface  to form a feature  may include other colorants including reflective and\/or transmissive colorants, pigments, dyes and combinations thereof. Providing a combination of quantum dots, reflective colored particles and transmissive colored particles generates a feature  that can provide color in a greater range of lighting environments. For example, reflective and transmissive color particles can provide color to the feature  when the electronic device is observed in external light that includes more light in the visible spectrum than in ultraviolet or higher energy portions of the spectrum. For example, sunlight may have a greater irradiance or intensity of visible light than higher energy ultraviolet light. In such environments, the reflective and transmissive color particles could provide more colored light to the feature than would be provided by the quantum dots. Including reflective and transmissive colored particles can improve the visibility of a feature  in these external lighting conditions.","In environments with low external light, the internal light source provides light to the features so they can be visible to a user. The internal light source typically illuminates the features from within the electronic device. When only reflective and transmissive color particles are used in the features , a white internal light source is frequently used to illuminate features of any color in the visible spectrum. A significant portion of the white light is absorbed by the reflective and transmissive color particles. For example, a red colorant will absorb the green and blue components of the incident white light but reflect and transmit the red light component. Accordingly, using only reflective and transmissive color particles inefficiently absorbs much of the white light that was generated by a white internal light source. In contrast, quantum dots can be used with a higher energy light source such as a blue LED light or an ultraviolet backlight unit but all of the light emitted by the light source can be used by the quantum dots to emit light of different colors depending on the particular size or sizes of the quantum dots in the feature . In this manner, a feature containing quantum dots permits more efficient use of the light generated by an electronic device's internal light source and thereby may more efficiently use the power supplied by the electronic device to the light source.","Furthermore, a white backlight unit generally requires a higher irradiance or intensity to adequately illuminate reflective and transmissive colored particles in features of an electronic device. Because the light from the internal light source must pass through light transmissive material, its intensity is reduced before reaching the feature . Accordingly, the intensity of the internal light source of the present disclosure can be reduced because less light is lost travelling through the transmissive material.","Internal light sources that provide a single narrow spectrum of visible light wavelengths (such as a blue or ultraviolet LED) can be less expensive than internal light sources that provide a broad spectrum of visible light wavelengths (such as a white or RGB LED).","By applying quantum dots to the features of the electronic device, it is also possible to reduce the presence of visible backlight bleed when the internal light source is on and the device is in a low external light environment. By applying quantum dots to the features, an internal light source may be used which contains very little, if any, light in the visible spectrum but contains light of a shorter wavelength, such as ultraviolet light. Accordingly, there will be very little or no visible backlight bleed but the quantum dots will emit visible light illuminating the features of the electronic device.","By applying quantum dots to features to be illuminated and using an internal light source above the visible spectrum, it also may be unnecessary to design the exterior surface using opaque materials surrounding the features. With traditional visible spectrum back lights, opaque materials surrounding the features were necessary to block backlight bleed. In the present disclosure, because the backlight bleed may not form any part of the visible spectrum, the remainder of the exterior surface is not required to block visible light.","Returning to , both the keypad PCB  and parts of the display  are examples of internal light sources of the electronic device. These internal light sources illuminate features  in areas of the exterior surface . For example, the keypad PCB  illuminates features  of the keypad  while parts of the display  illuminate the trademark feature  (more clearly shown in ) of the top frame  and the logo feature  (also more clearly shown in ) of the first lateral frame . In some embodiments, the internal light source emits high energy light spanning a narrow range of wavelengths. Many other configurations of an electronic device having an internal light source for illuminating quantum dots applied to area of the electronic device's external surface that can be illuminated by the internal light source are contemplated.","Unlike a light source containing quantum dots, the present disclosure applies quantum dots to a feature of an electronic device's external surface. This provides several differences. First, a smaller quantity of quantum dots may be used in the present disclosure than the quantity necessary for a quantum dot light source. Instead of applying quantum dots to the entire light source or a large surface, quantum dots are applied to specific areas of the exterior surface  that define features of the electronic device. Second, the lifespan of the quantum dots in the present disclosure may be longer than the lifespan of quantum dots applied within a quantum dot light source because the quantum dots are located further away from the light source than in a quantum dot light source. Third, the quantum dot mixture in the present disclosure can be applied in different colors and shapes to each individual feature.","The present disclosure also contemplates applying quantum dots to components of an electronic device. These components may be manufactured separately from the electronic device and the internal light source and latter assembled or connected to the electronic device. For example, a replacement housing or keypad  for a mobile communication device  may be manufactured with quantum dots applied according to the present disclosure and the component may be sold independently of the associated electronic device. Referring to  portions of the exterior surface  such as the top frame , first lateral frame  and keypad  or buttons  and keys  can be independently manufactured for use in an electronic device having an internal light source. In some embodiments, these components may have an integrated internal light source. For example, a keypad having features containing quantum dots may form an integral unit with a backlight and that unit can be used to customize an existing electronic device. The keypad may comprise a plurality of keys any number of which may include features having quantum dots. Different quantum dot mixtures may be applied to different features on the same key or different keys. In this manner, different features may appear in different colors on the same keys and keypad.","Referring to , an example method  for providing a feature on an exterior surface of an electronic device having an internal light source is illustrated. The method includes defining  an area of the exterior surface that is illuminable by the internal light source of the electronic device and applying  quantum dots to the area in the shape and color of the feature.","The light source of the electronic device comprises any one of an ultraviolet light, a light emitting diode, a backlight unit, a laser and other light sources. The light source emits light having sufficient energy to excite quantum dots capable of producing any color of visible light. In some embodiments light between about 350 and about 500 nanometers will have sufficient energy. In some embodiments, the light source emits a narrow range of wavelengths or a single wavelength. For example, a laser may emit a single high energy wavelength or an ultraviolet LED source may emit a high energy narrow band of wavelengths between 390 and 400 nm. In other embodiments a broader range of wavelengths may be provided such as a blue LED emitting wavelengths between 420 nm and 500 nm. The light source typically illuminates features of the exterior surface from within the electronic device; however external light sources may also be used.","Defining  the area of the exterior surface that is illuminable by the internal light source may involve defining an area of a button, keypad, key or other portion of the exterior surface of the electronic device to receive a feature that provides a visual cue to a user interacting with the electronic device. Defining  the area may involve defining an area on top of, within or beneath a light transmissive material comprising a portion of the exterior surface of the electronic device.","Quantum dots can be applied  to an area of the external surface of an electronic device in a variety of manners. Quantum dots can be mixed into a stamp, adhesive, paint, or coating that is applied to an area of an exterior surface of an electronic device. Quantum dots can also be mixed into a film or filter that comprises part of the exterior surface. The quantum dots can be applied beneath a protective exterior coating exterior surface, or, where the exterior surface comprises a light transmissive material, the area the quantum dots are applied to can be internally within or beneath the exterior surface.","The quantum dots may be applied  to the area of the exterior surface such that they can be illuminated by external light sources and emit light at their predetermined wavelengths. Other colored particles such as colorants, pigments and dyes may also be included in the quantum dot mixture to improve visibility of the features in environments with more external light in the visible spectrum than at higher energies.","The various embodiments presented above are merely examples and are in no way meant to limit the scope of this disclosure. Variations of the innovations described herein will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art, such variations being within the intended scope of the present application. In particular, features from one or more of the above-described embodiments may be selected to generate alternative embodiments comprised of a sub-combination of features which may not be explicitly described above. In addition, features from one or more of the above-described embodiments may be selected and combined to generate alternative embodiments comprised of a combination of features which may not be explicitly described above. Features suitable for such combinations and sub-combinations would be readily apparent to persons skilled in the art upon review of the present application as a whole. The subject matter described herein and in the recited claims intends to cover and embrace all suitable changes in technology."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
