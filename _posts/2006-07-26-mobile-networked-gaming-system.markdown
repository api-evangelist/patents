{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority from international patent application number PCT\/IB2006\/002153, filed Jul. 26, 2006.","A. Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to a mobile networked gaming system having one or more games available to the user.","B. Description of Related Art","Several categories of networked gaming systems are well known in the prior art. A networked gaming system may be a web-based java application operable on a computer, for example, Yahoo! Games. Further, a networked gaming system may be in the form of a downloadable software application that has a unique graphical user interface (GUI) and may connect to the network via a backend of the software, for example, the PartyPoker.com client application. Even further, a networked gaming system may be in the form of a networked video game console wherein several players playing a game are connected to a network through their video came consoles (e.g. Xbox). Other categories of networked gaming systems are apparent to those persons having ordinary skill in the art.","Furthermore, a networked gaming system may be operable on a mobile phone or other wireless device. Wireless technology has evolved greatly over the past decade allowing users to download and play games on their mobile devices. Games may be downloaded to the wireless device through a wireless network. Games may also be pre-installed on the wireless device when the user purchases the wireless device. Generally, a connection to the wireless network is not required for a user to play a downloaded game because the game may be a single-player game. According to at least one research agency, the market for downloadable mobile games will grow six-fold over the five-year period 2005 to 2010. It is expected that the number of consumers using downloadable games will grow from 32 million in 2005 to 220 million in 2009.","As wireless technology advances, more games will utilize the wireless network so that multiple users connected to a wireless network may play games against one another. These types of games are generally called \u201cmulti-player\u201d games.","Furthermore, in recent years online gaming has reached record highs, due in part to the increase in gaming options such as poker, online casino games, and online (sports) betting. Some forecasters believe that with the widespread penetration of mobile phones, poker\/casino\/betting trend will carry over from the PC to the wireless device.","It comes as no surprise that many companies that operate networked gaming systems on computers or elsewhere are moving forward with implementing a mobile phone version of their applications. Some of the considerations during this transition to wireless devices may include: building a profitable mobile gaming customer base, educating the consumer on mobile gaming opportunities, adjusting the game play to make the best use of the mobile format (small screens). Other considerations may include installing an accessible and time-effective customer registration process suitable for the keyboard restraints of the mobile device, creating a good user experience on the mobile device, implementing effective billing models and registration processes, encrypting transactions to ensure secure billing, or ensuring that any age verification processes are in place. Another important consideration may be to design games to suit the limitations of mobile phone technology. Besides having a relatively small screen and limited keyboard capabilities, mobile phones also have limited battery life, memory, and processing capabilities.","Some networked gaming system operators have implemented \u201cscaled-down\u201d mobile phone versions of their networked gaming systems. These \u201cscaled-down\u201d mobile phone versions generally do not offer the same gaming choices to the user as a standard PC-based networked gaming system because of the limitations of the mobile technology, including the small screen, limited keyboard, limited battery life, limited memory, and limited processing capabilities. For example, one operator offers only casino games (slots, blackjack, roulette, instant-win scratch card, etc.) on their mobile platform, but the same operator offers poker (Hold'em, 7-card stud, Omaha, etc.) in addition to casino games on their standard PC-based platform. Other operators have a casino, a poker room, and also a sports betting console on their standard PC-based platform, but offers only a sports betting console on their mobile platform. In most cases, operators do not have a poker client available on their mobile platform because it is simply too difficult to create a mobile poker client that would give the user an enjoyable experience. Even if an operator has a mobile poker client, generally this mobile client offers only a single-player poker game where the user plays against an imaginary computer-controlled player.","Because of the technical barriers, only a few networked gaming system operators have launched mobile multi-player poker clients. One of the most advanced multi-player mobile poker operators only offers \u201climit\u201d poker, meaning that during each betting round a player may either \u201cfold,\u201d \u201ccall,\u201d \u201cbet\u201d a pre-defined amount, or \u201craise\u201d a pre-defined amount. (Limit poker, unlike no-limit poker, does not allow a user to bet\/raise to any amount but limits the player to bet\/raise a pre-defined amount). As mobile phones become more advanced and the users become more sophisticated, an operator that offers only one game type (i.e. \u201climit poker\u201d) will not endure in the marketplace.","As more game types are added to a given mobile gaming system, the user may have to navigate through multiple menus to access a game that the user intends to play. Because of the limited memory and processing capabilities of mobile phones, the mobile phone may \u201cfreeze\u201d or time-out as the user navigates through the one or more menus as the user tries to access a game. This \u201cfreezing\u201d problem is one of the problems with current mobile networked gaming systems. There are simply too many menus that a user must navigate to access a game, causing the mobile phone or other wireless device to freeze or timeout.","As multiple game types are added to mobile networked gaming systems, the number of games available from single operator may be very large. For example, for the game of poker there may be multiple game types (Limit Hold'em, No-Limit Hold'em, Pot-Limit Hold'em, Omaha, 7-Card Stud, Razz), multiple game styles (cash game, tournament, sit-and-go, freeroll), and multiple game stakes (\u201c$0.05\/$0.10 Limit\u201d through \u201cNo-Limit\u201d). Thus, there may be many variations of poker available to the user of the mobile networked gaming system.","Navigating a PC-based poker client is already very challenging for some novice users, so the added complexity of trying to navigate a myriad of choices on a mobile phone would undoubtedly turn a novice user away from the mobile gaming system. Furthermore, because of the limited memory and processing capacity of mobile phones, navigating through multiple menus to find a game may cause the mobile phone to \u201cfreeze\u201d or time-out.","Moreover, once a user has located a game that the user would like to play (either on a PC or mobile device), and has further located the desired variation of that specific game, the user may not be able to play the game because all available player positions or tables are full for that specific variation of the game. This may be a common concern for users who like to play popular games because any available position\/seat is filled almost instantly after it becomes vacant. This is a major concern for networked gaming system operators and mobile networked gaming system operators because users may become frustrated and decide not to play on that particular networked gaming system in the future. A partial solution to the seating problem is allowing users to join a \u201cwaiting list\u201d for that specific game. Having a \u201cwaiting list\u201d is helpful, but a waiting list is not fully effective because of its inherent deterrent effects. Some users may not want to join a waiting list because they are either impatient, are very selective about the game table they play at, or otherwise. Further, when users are waiting, they are not playing. This may cause a decrease in revenue for the networked gaming system operator or possibly a reduction in the revenue that the networked gaming system operator may earn through advertising.","Attempts have been made to alleviate some of the problems users face when trying to connect to a specific game of a networked gaming system or mobile networked gaming system. A particular PC-based poker client, not a mobile client, has a feature called \u201cQuickSeat\u201d that lets players bypass the lobby and choose which limit, game type, and stakes they would like to play. But, the QuickSeat feature may not fully solve the problems associated with mobile networked gaming systems having a plurality of games available to the user. First, the QuickSeat feature has only three fields by which the user may narrow the game selection process. Second, the QuickSeat feature does not automatically \u201cbuy-in\u201d to the table (i.e. take money out of the user's account and sit at the table with that money). Once a table has been found that meets the three search criteria, the user must manually select how much money he would like to take to that table. Third, the QuickSeat feature cannot save a user's preferences and automatically seat a player at a table that meets various user-defined criteria. A player using the QuickSeat feature must re-enter his search criteria each time the user logs in to the networked gaming system.","A mobile networked gaming system wherein a downloadable game client application connects a player to at least one game server (or wireless network), wherein the at least one game table is hosted on said game server. The game server (or wireless network) provides game operations and displays for transmission to the game client application and a display including at least one screen display including at least one lobby screen display from which a player can manually request to be seated at one or more of a plurality of virtual game positions in one or more of a plurality of multi-player or single-player games. Furthermore, a selectable automated seating option is available for automatically seating a player at one or more of a plurality of virtual game positions, wherein a player is directly seated when the player logs-in to the mobile networked gaming system. Embodiments of the present invention are disclosed as a mobile poker client application and a mobile casino client application incorporating the above features.","In one embodiment, the present invention is incorporated into a mobile networked gaming system application, such that when a user logs in to networked gaming system, the user is immediately taken to his preferred game.","These and other features and advantages are evident from the following description of the present invention, with reference to the accompanying drawings.","The description herein describes an embodiment of the present invention, wherein the invention is incorporated into a mobile phone that is connected to a wireless network. Persons having ordinary skill in the art recognize that the invention is not limited to those embodiments discussed herein.","A. Downloading the Game Client Application","There are a plurality of ways that a user may download a game client application to a user's mobile phone. First, a user may navigate the Internet on a PC to a website where the user may enter the phone number of his mobile phone. In a few moments, the user may receive an SMS (Text) Message or WAP Push on the mobile phone with a link to download the application. The user may need to select the link to download the game client application. Second, the game client application may be downloaded via SMS or text through the mobile phone. The user may text a \u201cshortcode\u201d to the mobile network gaming system operator with a specific message (e.g., \u201cPoker\u201d) and then the operator may send the user a SMS Message\/WAP Push with a link to download the application. The user may need to select the link to download the game. Other methods of downloading a game client application to a mobile device are also known.","B. Log-in to the Game Client Application","There are several ways for a mobile game client application to become active. In one embodiment, when the mobile game client application is chosen from a list of mobile game client applications available on a mobile device, the mobile gaming application may login automatically once the user selects it. This type of auto-login option may be beneficial or convenient to a user because the user may be the only person to have access to that mobile device. In contrast, the mobile gaming application may be configured so that a user would have to manually log-in with a username and password each time the user would like to access the mobile gaming application. Referring to , an embodiment of a mobile phone is shown with a log-in screen displayed. Two text fields are visible, a username field  and a password field . The user may use the keypad  to type in a username and password specific to the user. The user may use a navigation pad  to move up using an up key , down using a down key , left using a left key , and right using a right key , as necessary. In the case of a log-in screen, as shown in , the user may use the down key  to move a cursor  down to the password field  from the username field . The user may press an OK button  to submit a username and password. Furthermore, if the user is a new user of this application, and does not have a username\/password unique to the user, then the user may select a \u201cNew user\u201d option by selecting a left softkey . This selection will take a new user through the registration process. If the user has accidentally reached to the log-in screen shown in , the user may select the \u201cBack\u201d option by selecting a right softkey . Furthermore, in an embodiment of the present invention, the at least one lobby screen display is accessible by the mobile game client application without a player logging-in to the mobile game client application. A user may be able to view tables without logging in, but in order for a user to play for real money or play money, the user may need to log in.","C. Navigation when Logged-in",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","21","20","21"]},"A main screen, as seen in , may further have several selectable options available to the user. The options may be numbered so that the user may simply choose the corresponding number on the keypad  to select that option. For example, by selecting the number \u201c3\u201d on the keypad , the user would choose the \u201cFavorites\u201d option. Also, an option may be highlighted  and the user may use the up key  or the down key  to move the highlighted  option up or down. The user may select a highlighted  option by pressing the OK button . Other options may also be available to the user by pressing \u201csoftkey buttons.\u201d A left softkey  and a right softkey  may be available. By selecting a softkey, a user selects the option that is visible directly above the softkey. As seen in , selecting the left softkey will choose the \u201cCashier\u201d option, while selecting the right softkey  will select the \u201cLogout\u201d option.","1. Options\u2014Overview","There may be several options available to a user once logged in. As seen in , may be a \u201cPlay for Real\u201d option , a \u201cPlay for Fun\u201d option , a Favorites option , a Settings option , a Help\/Support option , a Cashier option , a Logout option , or a My Account option . Other options that may be available to a user would be known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. For example, if a mobile networked gaming operator operates several different game client applications (i.e. a poker client, a casino client, a backgammon client) then there may be selectable options available to the user of any of these client applications that \u201clinks\u201d the user directly to other client applications operated by the mobile networked gaming system operator.","A \u201cFavorites\u201d option  allows users to set up a favorite games list and have quick access to these games. This feature will be discussed in depth later.","Selecting a \u201cSettings\u201d option  may take the user to another screen, from which a user may choose various game client application settings.","Selecting a \u201cHelp\/Support\u201d option  may open a new screen from which a user may get help or support for the game client application. Also it may provide frequently asked questions (FAQs) that may help the user with problems.","A \u201cLogout\u201d option  facilitates logging out of the system.","Selecting the Cashier option  may take the user to a new screen where the user may cash-out (withdraw) money from his real balance , or may deposit more money into his real balance . To deposit money, a user may need to access a third party client to facilitate a transfer of funds from a credit card, debit card, bank account, or otherwise as is well known to those having ordinary skill in the art.","Selecting a My Account option  may take a user to another screen from which a user may change his account specific options and see all account specific information.","Selecting a \u201cPlay for Real\u201d option  may take the user to a new screen from which the user may access \u201creal money\u201d games.","Selecting a \u201cPlay for Fun\u201d option  may take the user to a new screen from which the user may access \u201cplay money\u201d games.","2. Options\u2014My Account","As seen in , selecting a My Account option , may take a user to another screen from which account-specific features are available. The screen may have selectable options, like, for example, Account Info , My Balance and Points , Cashier , Network Status , Log Out , or other options that would be obvious to those having ordinary skill in the art.","An \u201cAccount Info\u201d option  may open a screen to a login page to view or edit account settings. If the user is already logged-in, as shown in , selecting the Account Info option  would take a user directly to the appropriate page.","A \u201cMy Balance and Points\u201d option  may open a screen an account balance page.","A \u201cCashier\u201d option  may open a new screen to the account cashier page. This may be the same screen accessible directly from the main screen via the left softkey  as seen in .","A \u201cNetwork Status\u201d option  may check the status or strength of a user's mobile network connection.","A Logout option  may log a user out of the mobile networked game client application. If the user is already logged out, the Logout option  may change to a Log-in option.","3. Options\u2014Settings","Referring to , a \u201cSettings\u201d option , when selected, may open up a new screen that allows a user to manage his settings. It may include the following areas. On\/off sections may be represented by checkboxes.\n\n","As seen in , a Help\/Support option  may be available. The following is an embodiment of a list of selectable options available to a user who selects a Help\/Support option  (parenthetical notes may not be visible to a user).\n\n","The thrust of the present invention consists in extending in data depth and functionality a standard favorites menu. As seen in , a user may select a Favorites option  that may open a new screen from which the user may set his favorites. Recall that a mobile networked gaming system operator may operate various mobile game client applications. Thus, favorites may be vertical-independent, i.e. a user can have multiple favorites from various game client applications, each of which is operated by the same mobile networked gaming system operator. Favorites may be included on an account-level, meaning that a user may set personal favorites. For advanced systems, the mobile networked gaming system, along with the mobile game client application, may suggest favorites to the user based on player game history. An automated seating option (or \u201cAutoSeat\u201d) of said mobile game client application is further selectable by the mobile networked gaming system, whereby personal gaming history, including but not limited to a game category, a specific game type, stakes, or an amount of money that a player commonly plays, may be recorded by the mobile networked gaming system and a player may be taken directly to a table, upon logging into the system, in accordance with the recorded personal gaming history of a player. Furthermore, based on the personal gaming history of a player, some amount of money may be taken from a player's account when seating a player, such that the player is seated with said amount of money usable for game play.","The Favorites option  may cover three types of favorites: category favorites, direct favorites, and AutoSeat favorites. Each of the three types requires different handling in functionality and representation.","5.1. Category Favorites","Category favorites are those of the type where a further selection by the user is still necessary before being able to access a game. When selecting a category, the proper brand-specific mobile game client application lobby may open up in the messaging program and the according sub-category opened. For example, if the user selects the category favorite \u201cSlots,\u201d then the Casino lobby opens (if not already open) and the category slots expands. The user may still need to select which game to play from a general category like \u201cSlots\u201d. Category favorites may be convenient for a user who enjoys playing various games located on various mobile game client applications, each of which is operated by the same mobile networked gaming system operator.","5.2. Direct Favorites","Direct favorites are those of the type where a specific game can be directly accessed (not simply a category of games) and no additional refinement or action has to be done by the user. When clicking on a direct favorite, the user will directly be sent to the according game. The buy-in window opens and the user can buy in and sit down. All standard logic when accessing a table will be applied (e.g. if insufficient funds, then user will be prompted to go to cashier). For example if the user selects the direct favorite \u201cPoker Cash Games Cash>Pot-Limit Omaha>$0.10\/0.25 PL,\u201d then the user will be automatically taken to a poker cash game, pot-limit Omaha where the \u201cblinds\u201d are $0.10 and $0.25. The user chooses the amount of his \u201cbuy-in\u201d and sits down and may begin playing.","5.3. AutoSeat Favorites","A mobile networked gaming system may include an automated seating option (or \u201cAutoSeat\u201d feature\u201d) of said mobile game client application capable of receiving and storing personal preference information, including but not limited to a game category, a specific game type, stakes, and an amount of money to be taken from a player's account when seating a player, and for seating a player at a table in accordance with said stored personal preference information. AutoSeat favorites are those of the type where the user has selected an AutoSeat option and also provided some more information, and is then automatically seated and \u201cbought-in\u201d when the user chooses this option. For example, if a user has the AutoSeat option selected on a No-Limit Hold'em table, having blinds of $1\/$2, and a user buy-in of $200, then once the user signs on he will automatically be taken to a No-Limit Hold'em table, having blinds of $1\/$2 and the user will be bought-in for $200 automatically. A goal of the AutoSeat functionality is to get users seated more quickly on a table. Furthermore, the AutoSeat feature is meant to ease some of the burdens created by gaming applications on mobile devices. For example, the user may normally have to navigate through a plurality of screens before sitting at a game table. This processing-intensive navigation may take a considerable amount of time to complete, or may cause the mobile device to freeze or time-out.","The AutoSeat feature may be chosen automatically by the system using hand history, saved settings, or an automated procedure using certain assumptions. When the AutoSeat feature is chosen automatically by the system, some amount of money (calculated by the system based on personal gaming history) may be taken from the user's account when the player is seated at a table.","Also, the AutoSeat feature may be manually selected by a user. Referring to , there are approximately nineteen steps required to open a gaming application and sit at a table with cash. The approximately nineteen steps may include: 1. Select game group (e.g. Cash games), 2. Select game type (e.g. Limit Holdem), 3. Select stakes (e.g. $5\/10), 4. Select filter to limit choice of tables, 5. Sort table list by specific column, 6. Scroll table list, 7. Find free table, 8. Highlight table, 9. Select table, 10. Open table, 11. Check of logged-in, 12. Check if seat free, 13. Check if enough money\/points for buy-in, 14. Time-out for sitting down, 15. Check blinds at table, 16. Geographic preference to sit, 17. How much money to take to table, 18. One or more players at table, and 19. Wait for blinds. In contrast to the nineteen step process described herein and depicted in , the AutoSeat feature allows for seating at a table using only one step: signing on.","The main motivators for the AutoSeat feature are to (1) assist users in getting a table of their choice in a large, dynamic, and quickly moving data set of tables or games, (2) make the seating process more convenient for user, (3) use history and stored information to overcome ambiguous situations on the way to getting seated, (4) apply the service to a number of frontends\/interfaces from which the user might be accessing the networked gaming system, (5) and seat a player at a table while putting a relatively small burden on a mobile device's limited memory and processing capabilities.","The AutoSeat feature may be either backend- or frontend-driven. The best case is a mixture with backend storing the user's preferences and the frontend executing the query through the application programming interface.","In accordance with the above description, once a user has chosen a Favorites option , as seen in , a new screen may be displayed from which the user may select and manage favorites.  is an embodiment of a new screen that opens when a user selects a Favorites option .","Naming conventions may be used to identify favorites. The following are examples of naming conventions and structures that may be taken for poker and casino games:","Poker Cash Games: Cash>Pot-Limit Omaha>$0.10\/0.25 PL","Poker Jackpot Tables: Holdem>Bad Beat Jackpot>$15\/30","Poker Tournaments Tournaments>Regular","Poker Sit&Gos: Sit&Go's>Steps>2-Table Steps","Poker Play Money Games: Play>Pot-Limit Hold'em>50\/100 PL","Casino: Cash Cruise Slots, Kanga Cash Video Poker","The structure of the favorites menu may be either in a one-level list, or as a multiple-level (i.e. sub-levels) list.  shows a favorites list as a one-level list. Several choices may be available from this favorites menu. There may be an \u201cAdd a Favorite\u201d option , a \u201cManage My Favorites\u201d option , an AutoSeat On\/Off option , and zero or more selectable favorites .","When opening the mobile gaming application, the favorites associated with a user's account are read from the existing favorites list of the user. If no favorites exist, the favorites list may be empty. If the Autoseat On\/Off option  is set to \u201cOn,\u201d then the user will be automatically seated at a table corresponding to an AutoSeat favorite. Since favorites may be stored across brand-specific client applications (distinct game client applications operated by the same mobile networked gaming system operator), favorites may be added from each brand-specific client application. If upon attempted addition of a favorite it is discovered that it already exists as a favorite, then the existing favorite may just be over-written.","In the case of adding a favorite, especially an AutoSeat favorite, upon choosing an \u201cAdd a Favorite\u201d option , a separate screen may open up where the user may select more criteria. In order to ensure that the table\/seat that the AutoSeat feature selects is to the user's liking, more search criteria may be selected in addition to simply selecting the game type and stakes. Some of the possible narrowing criteria may be: Game group (e.g. Cash Games, Jackpot Tables, Sit&Go, and Play for Free), Game Type (e.g. NL Holdem, Limit Holdem . . . ), Stakes (e.g. 5\/10, 10\/20 . . . ), Seats at Table (2, 6, 10), Players at table (e.g. Number=X, X or more, X or less), Waiting (Waitlist OK, Waitlist not OK), Hands per hour (e.g. Number=X, X or more, X or less), Average pot (e.g. Number=X, X or more, X or less), or Buy-in (Min. buy-in, Normal buy-in, Full balance).","AutoSeat favorites automatically select a game table for the user, open it up, buy-in, and sit the player down. AutoSeat is a direct favorite with additional data and procedures to directly sit down on a table and \u201cbuy-in.\u201d The logic of table selection in the AutoSeat feature may be taken and modified from the existing Waitlist functionality.","Referring to , after choosing a Direct or AutoSeat Favorite, the process of seating a player follows the sequence: Connected \u2192Tables available \u2192Free tables available \u2192Buy-in \u2192Sit Down .","If the mobile networked gaming system or wireless connection  is not operational, then the standard error popup will be displayed in case a user loses connection.","If currently no tables are available  in the selected game type\/stake combination (e.g. No-Limit Hold'em $5\/10), a popup will come up telling the user \u201cThere are currently no tables available in [GAME TYPE]\/[STAKE]. Please try other [GAME TYPE] tables.\u201d When clicking on the OK button, the popup closes and the user will be taken to the [GAME TYPE] category, which includes tables from all stakes. [GAME TYPE]\/[STAKE] combinations are applicable for live games and Sit&Go's (which use Buy-ins).","If currently no tables are available  in the selected game group (e.g. Cash Games), a popup will come up telling the user \u201cThere are currently no tables available in [GAME GROUP 1]. Please try [GAME GROUP 2].\u201d with [GAME GROUP 1] being the game group he is looking for and [GAME GROUP 2] being the other available game group (game groups are Cash and Play). When clicking on the OK button, the popup closes. The user will stay in his current lobby selection.","Refining criteria can be used to filter for a table of choice. Independent of the game type or stake, these filters may have special behaviors if no table is found with the exact criteria.","For the refiner \u201cAverage Pot Size,\u201d the criteria may be: \u201cX or more\u201d or \u201cX or less.\u201d If the selected average pot restriction does not retrieve any tables, but tables with other values are available, a popup may come up saying \u201cWe did not find any tables with avg. pot [SELECTED VALUE] or [SELECTED CONDITION, LESS OR MORE]. However we found similar tables with different avg. pot values.

For example, if a mobile game client application operator operates a plurality of game client applications (i.e. a casino client, a poker client, a backgammon client, etc.), then it may be possible for a user to be able to access each of the clients via the Play for Real option . It may be further possible to have links available to the user to download other brand-specific mobile game client applications offered by the operator. Also, in accordance with the present invention, a mobile networked gaming system wherein when any two of said mobile game client applications are designated as client X and client Y, when either client X or client Y is installed, a corresponding lobby X or lobby Y may open from the mobile game client application, when both clients X and Y are installed, a lobby which was last open when the application was running the last time may be opened from the mobile game client application, and when no client is installed, a predetermined lobby may be opened from the mobile game client application. For example, if a user has either poker client or a casino client installed (but not both), then the corresponding lobby may be opened for the game client application. If a user has both a poker and a casino client installed, either lobby may be accessible for the game client application, preferably the last lobby that was open. Finally, if a user has neither a poker nor a casino client installed, a predetermined lobby may be open, like for example a news or events lobby.","Referring to , a poker lobby is shown following a user selection of a Play for Real option  of a mobile poker client application. A mobile poker lobby may have the same characteristics as a brand-specific PC-based client poker lobby with the difference of the dimensions. The same error case handling can be applied as well. For easier access to the tables of choice in the limited dimensions of the mobile gaming device, filters  may be used. A top-level filter  may contain broad categories such as: Cash Games, Jackpot Tables, Sit & Go, Tournaments, Tournament Events, or Play for Free, as shown in . Second level navigation items  match the secondary navigation in the brand-specific client poker lobby, e.g. the \u201cCash Games\u201d top-level section may include Hold'em, Omaha, Stud and other games, as shown in . A third level  may contain the stakes as a refiner, e.g. All, $5\/10, $10\/20, etc, as shown in .","When changing the filters, the selection change may be processed requested immediately; thus a submit command (i.e. a \u201cRun Filters\u201d button  () may not be required). The order of filtering is from first to third level descending, i.e. the top-level selection influences the second level, which influences the third level, which influences any other levels there may be. If the user changes the top-level navigation , both second level navigation items  and third level  may change. Initial selection in the Poker lobby may be: Cash Games>Limit Hold'em>$100\/$200.","Referring to , vertical or horizontal scroll bars  will enable the user to quickly scroll up and down the table list and also to the right (via horizontal scroll bar, not shown), in case his window is not wide enough to display all columns. Default position of the list window will be top left of the list. The scroll bar  will have the same functionality as other standard scrollbars. In case the table list is shorter then the window, the scroll bar  vanishes.","There may be a full table filter : a radio button will let the user hide or show full tables. By default the button may be pressed and say \u201cShow full tables? NO\u201d. In this case, full tables are being hidden.

The top-level navigation  may contain such general categories of games as: Slots, Roulette, Video Poker, Blackjack, Caribbean Stud, Let It Ride, etc, as shown in . The second level navigation  may contain the actual games, e.g. Sweet Hawaii, Cash Cruise, Super Fortune Wheel, etc, as shown in . When changing the filters, the selection change may be requested immediately; i.e. a submit button is not required.
