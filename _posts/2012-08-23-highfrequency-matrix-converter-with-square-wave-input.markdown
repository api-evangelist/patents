One barrier to a full adoption of these renewable energy sources is transferring energy from the energy source, generally just a few volts DC into the grid, generally at least 110 Volts AC. Multiphase systems further complicate matters. Due to the complexity of converting the supplied DC voltage for supplying energy to the grid, for example in synchronizing with the energy grid, and size of the electrical components, for example large transformers, it is highly desirable to be able to reuse these components across a variety of energy sources, for example photovoltaics, wind farms, fuel cells, etc. Reusing components has the potentially to reduce cost, size, heat, and increase efficiency.","There has been a recent push towards efforts in multiple input converter systems. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,227,277 describes a DC to DC system combining many components of the buck boost converter in an effort to reduce cost. However, the system described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,227,277 must additionally convert the energy from DC to AC and properly synchronize with the grid in order to provide energy to the grid. Generally, a larger transformer will be required to amplify the voltage from the converter to the voltage of the grid. Therefore, there is a need in the art for a low cost energy, efficient, compact, energy conversion means, preferably easily allowing for multiple inputs.","A device for producing an alternating current output voltage from a high-frequency, square-wave input voltage comprising, high-frequency, square-wave input a matrix converter and a control system.

The switches must be in the on state for the load to be able to draw current from the capacitors (first capacitor  and second capacitor ), which is necessary any time that the current being provided by the sources is less than the current demanded by the load. This is especially critical if the load duty cycles are longer than the source duty cycles, at which point the capacitors must provide the entire load current once the sources are turned off. For this reason, the active clamp preferably has the same duty cycle as the load with the longest duty cycle. Therefore, the control system  preferably has access to the value of the duty cycles of all the load converters. The clamp  must be turned off before the polarity of the first port  and the second port  changes in enough time to allow the current to drop to zero before the next half cycle. This imposes a maximum duty cycle limit on all of the converters in the system.","The clamp  is advantageous as it forces the current across the first port  and the second port  to reset to zero rapidly. When all of the converters are turned off, including the switches of the clamp , this may interrupt the current through a connected transformer, for example the transformer  in , through leakage inductance of the transformer. This would normally cause a voltage spike across the first port  and the second port , but the first diode  or the second diode  do provide an alternative current path for the current.","During the positive cycle, the first capacitor  of the clamp  provides current balancing and fixes the voltage across the first port  and the second port . When the energy sources connected to the first port  and the second port  turn off, the current passing through any connected transformers (e.g. a transformer  as shown in ), the leakage inductance of the transformer has no path for flowing. This causes the voltage across the transformer, and hence the first port  and the second port , to rise, which biases on the first diode , which provides a current path through the first port  and the second port . Preferably, the first switch  is turned-off and current cannot flow through the first diode  from the second port , current cannot flow into the first capacitor . The current therefore flows through second capacitor  and the second diode  to complete the circuit and flow the current back to the first port . In addition to providing a complete current path, this process also has the effect of reversing the polarity of the voltage applied to the transformer. This entire voltage is applied to the leakage transformer, which causes the current through the leakage transformer to fall very rapidly. Once the current through the leakage transformer reaches zero, the diodes turn off and the system is ready for the next half cycle. This is preferred as it to ensures zero-current switching on many of the switching devices in the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"a ","b":["5","23","25","61","63","27","7","61","63","61","24","27","63","25","27"]},"The first bidirectional switch  is any device that is capable of electrically connecting and disconnecting the first input port  to the first output port  at the direction of the control system .

In a preferred embodiment, a switching order is determined to provide a short-circuit path for the inductor current during the free-wheeling state while at the same time presenting an open-circuit to the output so that any other H-Bridges may operate according to their own requirements. In short, this is accomplished by turning on only one output of the H-bridge to provide a short circuit to the boost inductor while the other output is turned off, providing the open circuit to the output. This switching order which implements this scheme is shown in .  gives the control signals for all of the switches in the H-bridge over a single switching period.  shows each of the device switching actions for the positive half cycle (the half of the cycle where the converter applies a positive voltage to the output); the negative half cycle has symmetrical operation.","In , Srefers to the second switch  in . Srefers to the first switch  . In , Srefers to the sixth switch  in . In , Srefers to the fifth switch  in . Srefers to the fourth switch  in . In , Srefers to the third switch  in . These switches (S, S, S, S, S, S) are used to provide an output voltage V, across the outputs (first output ( in ) and the second output ( in )).","At time t0, S2, S1, and S6 are all on, thereby providing a voltage, V, across the outputs.","At time t, S1 is turned off, beginning the transition to the free-wheeling period, where the voltage is increased. The positive voltage Vout is still applied to the outputs and the inductor ( in ) current is still passed through the antiparallel diode of S1. The first output ( in ) is no longer forcibly connected to the H-bridge.","At time t2, S5 is turned on. The antiparallel diode of S4 prevents a short circuit from forming immediately, but since first output ( in ) is at a higher voltage potential than the second output ( in ), this antiparallel begins to commutate on. This causes the voltage of the first output ( in ) to decrease, and as a result the antiparallel diode of S1 commutates off.","By time t3, the antiparallel diode of S4 has naturally commutated on; and the antiparallel diode of S1 has naturally commutated off. Therefore, a shortcircuit path is provided through the fourth diode ( in ) and the fifth diode ( in ). The antiparallel diodes of S1 and S3, in the meantime, present an open circuit to outputs and allow any other electrical components connected to the output to operate according to its own timing. Since the antiparallel diodes of S1 and S3 prevent conduction, S2 turns off under a zero-current condition at t4. S4 turns on at t5, completing the transition to the free-wheeling period.","By time t6, which is shortly before the beginning of the negative half cycle beginning at TSW\/2, any other converters preferably have transitioned to their own free-wheeling cycle. Preferably, converters on the outputs operate with the same switching frequency and transition from the positive half cycle to the negative half cycle at the same time so that the same voltage is impressed on the outputs by all the converters, preventing short circuits. In one embodiment, the converters operate with different timing within the positive and negative half cycles, allowing different duty cycles and voltage conversion ratios.","At time t7, S3 turns on. This impresses a short circuit on the common HF bus through S3 and S6, which is the other reason that all of the converters must have the same switching frequency and half cycle transition time, since it will be forced upon them anyway by the operation of a single converter. If the proper timing is observed, however, no problems will arise since all converters are disconnected from the common bus by this time. Turning on S3 prepares the converter so that when S6 is turned off at t8 (T or TSW\/2), there is a path for the current available through S5, S4, and S3, preventing the boost inductor current from interrupting and causing a large inductive kick voltage. This is the beginning of the negative half cycle where the converter imposes Vout with a negative polarity on the outputs and passes the boost inductor current idc1 with a negative polarity on to the load. This is the parallel of the situation seen at the beginning of the positive half cycle at time t0.","The voltage conversion ratio of the boost converter is the same as for a standard boost converter given in equation (3-1). The duty cycle D is the duration ton of the freewheeling state divided by the duration T of the half cycle, which is equal to TSW\/2, half the switching frequency interval. The free-wheeling state begins at t3 when the antiparallel diodes of S1 and S4 naturally commutate so that idc1 no longer flows to the outputs but instead flows through the right-hand leg of the converter. In practice, this commutation happens shortly after device S5 is turned on at t2, so the duration of ton is equal to (TSW\/2)\u2212t2. A short overlap period to overlap must be provided between the turn-on of one device and the turn-off of the next in order to ensure that the boost inductor current has a continuous conduction path and does not generate a large inductive kick voltage. This is the reason for the slightly staggered control signals for the devices in . Implementing these signals uses the following equations:\n\n2=0 for +0.5and 1 otherwise\u2003\u2003(3-2)\n\n1=0 for +0.5+2and 1 otherwise\u2003\u2003(3-3)\n\n6=0 for 0.5and 1 otherwise\u2003\u2003(3-4)\n\n5=1 for +0.5and 0 otherwise\u2003\u2003(3-5)\n\n5=1 for +20.5and 0 otherwise\u2003\u2003(3-6)\n\n3=0 for 0\u2266+0.5and 1 otherwise\u2003\u2003(3-7)\n","Preferably, the unidirectional H-bridge has the same control and the same voltage conversion ratio as the bidirectional H-bridge, except it does not possess the series switching devices S1 and S4. It has a single series diode in these positions instead which have the same functionality as the antiparallel diodes of S1 and S4 shown above. The control of this converter does not require equations (3-3) or (3-6), but otherwise utilizes the same control equations described above.","When the converter enters the positive half cycle at time zero, the first switch ( in ) and the second switch ( in ) has been on for a (relatively) long time and third switch ( in ) has just turned-on. The third diode ( in ) has turned on, and current is flowing from the first input ( in ) to the first output (in ).

The three-phase voltages become, in the alpha-beta reference frame, a vector with a constant magnitude and time-varying angle. The control signal can then be represented as a vector with a constant magnitude and time-varying angle which moves past the vectors of the various switch states. Preferably, the Clarke transform, preserving constant power, is used to convert the phase voltages to the alpha-beta reference frame, resulting in the hexagon shown in .","The operation of the Matrix converter is designed to prevent electrical shorts, while producing a PVVM (pulsed-width-modulated) output. Preferably, this is controlled by the control system. After the SVPWM Hexagon is generated as described above. The control system receives the voltage reference. The alpha\/beta domain is determined for the received voltage reference. The lengths of the alpha and beta components fo the reference voltage is used to determine which sector of the SVPWM Hexagon the reference vector lies in. Predetermined control signals for each switch of the matrix converter sector are then determined using the alpha and beta components for the reference voltage and the SVPWM Hexagon.","The first step to implementing the SVPWM switching scheme is to identify the Sector of operation. The SVPWM hexagon, shown in , divides the control space into six equal triangles, each occupying 60 degrees of the space. Sector 1 occurs from 0 to 60\u00b0, Sector 2 from 60\u00b0 to 120\u00b0, Sector 3 from 120\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, Sector 4 from 180\u00b0 to 240\u00b0, Sector 5 from 240\u00b0 to 300\u00b0, and Sector 6 from 300\u00b0 to 360\u00b0. This is the typical hexagon used in SVPWM notation. The sector wherein the reference vector lies can be found by determining the angle of the reference vector and comparing it to the angle borders of each sector is found as described in the process below.","The angle of the reference vector can be determined from the alpha- and beta components of the reference vector, though this method involves solving the tangent function which can be computationally intensive. An alternative method is to use the magnitudes of the alpha and beta components of the reference vector, which are normally readily available from the outer loop controller. It should be noted that at the counterclockwise border of Sector 1 and the clockwise border of Sector 2, 60\u00b0 and 300\u00b0 respectively, the alpha component of any vector is equal to one half of its magnitude. Similarly, at the clockwise border of Sector 3 and the counterclockwise border of Sector 4, the alpha component of any vector is equal to negative one half of its magnitude. In Sectors 1 through 3, the beta component of any vector is positive, while in Sectors 4 through 6, the beta component of any vector is negative. The reference vector is in Sector 1, therefore, when the alpha component is greater than 0.5*m and the beta component is positive. It is in Sector 2 when the alpha component is between 0.5*m and \u22120.5*m and the beta component is positive. It is in Sector 3 when the alpha component is less than \u22120.5*m and the beta component is positive. It is in Sector 4 when the alpha component is less than \u22120.5*m and the beta component is negative. It is in Sector 5 when the alpha component is between 0.5*m and \u22120.5*m and the beta component is negative. Finally, it is in Sector 6 when the alpha component is greater than 0.5*m and the beta component is positive.

Preferably, the commutation from the upper to the lower device on a phase leg is accomplished by the natural commutation of the diodes rather than by forced switching action. Correct configuration and switching control can ensure that the diode on the upper device and the diode on the lower device can never be naturally commutated on at the same time, so allowing these two diodes to control the commutation of current from the upper device to the lower device ensures that there is never a short circuit. At the same time, any condition that would make it so that the currently active diode cannot carry the current would produce a voltage rise on the filter inductor which would naturally bias on the other diode. This ensures a smooth transition of the current from the lower device to the upper device on a phase leg.","It is to be understood that the above-described arrangements are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the present invention.
