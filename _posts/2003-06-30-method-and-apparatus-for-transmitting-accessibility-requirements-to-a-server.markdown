{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention is related to an application entitled Method and Apparatus for Transmitting Locale Objects, Ser. No. 10\/610,240, filed even date hereof, assigned to the same assignee, and incorporated herein by reference.","1. Technical Field","The present invention relates generally to an improved data processing system and in particular, to a method and apparatus for processing data. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to a method, apparatus, and computer instructions for transmitting accessibility information from a client to a server.","2. Description of Related Art","The Internet, also referred to as an \u201cinternetwork\u201d, is a set of computer networks, possibly dissimilar, joined together by means of gateways that handle data transfer and the conversion of messages from a protocol of the sending network to a protocol used by the receiving network. When capitalized, the term \u201cInternet\u201d refers to the collection of networks and gateways that use the TCP\/IP suite of protocols.","The Internet has become a cultural fixture as a source of both information and entertainment. Many businesses are creating Internet sites as an integral part of their marketing efforts, informing consumers of the products or services offered by the business or providing other information seeking to engender brand loyalty. Many federal, state, and local government agencies are also employing Internet sites for informational purposes, particularly agencies which must interact with virtually all segments of society such as the Internal Revenue Service and secretaries of state. Providing informational guides and\/or searchable databases of online public records may reduce operating costs. Further, the Internet is becoming increasingly popular as a medium for commercial transactions.","Currently, the most commonly employed method of transferring data over the Internet is to employ the World Wide Web environment, also called simply \u201cthe Web\u201d. Other Internet resources exist for transferring information, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Gopher, but have not achieved the popularity of the Web. In the Web environment, servers and clients effect data transaction using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a known protocol for handling the transfer of various data files (e.g., text, still graphic images, audio, motion video, etc.). The information in various data files is formatted for presentation to a user by a standard page description language, the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In addition to basic presentation formatting, HTML allows developers to specify \u201clinks\u201d to other Web resources identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A URL is a special syntax identifier defining a communications path to specific information. Each logical block of information accessible to a client, called a \u201cpage\u201d or a \u201cWeb page\u201d, is identified by a URL. The URL provides a universal, consistent method for finding and accessing this information, not necessarily for the user, but mostly for the user's Web \u201cbrowser\u201d. A browser is a program capable of submitting a request for information identified by an identifier, such as, for example, a URL. A user may enter a domain name through a graphical user interface (GUI) for the browser to access a source of content. The domain name is automatically converted to the Internet Protocol (IP) address by a domain name system (DNS), which is a service that translates the symbolic name entered by the user into an IP address by looking up the domain name in a database.","The Internet also is widely used to transfer applications to users using browsers. With respect to commerce on the Web, individual consumers and business use the Web to purchase various goods and services. In offering goods and services, some companies offer goods and services solely on the Web while others use the Web to extend their reach.","Users exploring the Web have discovered that the content supported by the HTML document format on the Web was too limited. Users desire an ability to access applications and programs, but applications were targeted towards specific types of platforms. As a result, not everyone could access applications or programs. This deficiency has been minimized though the introduction and use of programs known as \u201capplets\u201d, which may be embedded as objects in HTML documents on the Web. Applets are Java programs that may be transparently downloaded into a browser supporting Java along with HTML pages in which they appear. These Java programs are network and platform independent. Applets run the same way regardless of where they originate or what data processing system onto which they are loaded.","Java servlets and Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) are Java programs that are run on a server. These programs are generally accessed by clients via a Web browser. Typically, when servlets and EJBs generate or format information, the usability needs of a client user should be honored.","For example, if a user is blind, the user's client computer is typically speech enabled. If the user has a slight vision impairment, the user may configure the operating system to use large fonts or certain types of contrasts to increase the readability of text. Currently, such accessibility information is available only at the operating system level of the client computer.","Currently, a user must be explicitly asked or prompted for accessibility needs before a web server can generate and send content to the user. For example, the user may be presented with a form or pop-up window in which the user may select accessibility options. This information is then transmitted back to the Web server. Such a system, however, requires active user input. Further, in some cases the user may be unable to view the form depending on the particular accessibility requirements. This type of system is burdensome and requires user attention.","As a result, it would be advantageous to have an improved method, apparatus, and computer instructions for transmitting accessibility information from a client to a server for use in providing the appropriate formatting of documents.","The present invention provides a method, apparatus, and computer instructions for transmitting accessibility requirements. Content is received from a computer at a data processing system. The content is parsed for a selected indicator. The data processing system is queried to identify accessibility requirements in response to the selected indicator being present. The identified accessibility requirements are sent to the computer. These accessibility requirements are used by the computer to generate content for the data processing system.","With reference now to the figures,  depicts a pictorial representation of a network of data processing systems in which the present invention may be implemented. Network data processing system  is a network of computers in which the present invention may be implemented. Network data processing system  contains a network , which is the medium used to provide communications links between various devices and computers connected together within network data processing system . Network  may include connections, such as wire, wireless communication links, or fiber optic cables.","In the depicted example, server  is connected to network  along with storage unit . In addition, clients , , and  are connected to network . These clients , , and  may be, for example, personal computers or network computers. In the depicted example, server  provides data, such as boot files, operating system images, and applications to clients -. Clients , , and  are clients to server . Network data processing system  may include additional servers, clients, and other devices not shown. In the depicted example, network data processing system  is the Internet with network  representing a worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) suite of protocols to communicate with one another. At the heart of the Internet is a backbone of high-speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers, consisting of thousands of commercial, government, educational and other computer systems that route data and messages. Of course, network data processing system  also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks, such as for example, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), or a wide area network (WAN).  is intended as an example, and not as an architectural limitation for the present invention.","Referring to , a block diagram of a data processing system that may be implemented as a server, such as server  in , is depicted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Data processing system  may be a symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) system including a plurality of processors  and  connected to system bus . Alternatively, a single processor system may be employed. Also connected to system bus  is memory controller\/cache , which provides an interface to local memory . I\/O bus bridge  is connected to system bus  and provides an interface to I\/O bus . Memory controller\/cache  and I\/O bus bridge  may be integrated as depicted.","Peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus bridge  connected to I\/O bus  provides an interface to PCI local bus . A number of modems may be connected to PCI local bus . Typical PCI bus implementations will support four PCI expansion slots or add-in connectors. Communications links to clients - in  may be provided through modem  and network adapter  connected to PCI local bus  through add-in boards.","Additional PCI bus bridges  and  provide interfaces for additional PCI local buses  and , from which additional modems or network adapters may be supported. In this manner, data processing system  allows connections to multiple network computers. A memory-mapped graphics adapter  and hard disk  may also be connected to I\/O bus  as depicted, either directly or indirectly.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware depicted in  may vary. For example, other peripheral devices, such as optical disk drives and the like, also may be used in addition to or in place of the hardware depicted. The depicted example is not meant to imply architectural limitations with respect to the present invention.","The data processing system depicted in  may be, for example, an IBM eServer pSeries system, a product of International Business Machines Corporation in Armonk, N.Y., running the Advanced Interactive Executive (AIX) operating system or LINUX operating system.","With reference now to , a block diagram illustrating a data processing system is depicted in which the present invention may be implemented. Data processing system  is an example of a client computer. Data processing system  employs a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) local bus architecture. Although the depicted example employs a PCI bus, other bus architectures such as Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) and Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) may be used. Processor  and main memory  are connected to PCI local bus  through PCI bridge . PCI bridge  also may include an integrated memory controller and cache memory for processor . Additional connections to PCI local bus  may be made through direct component interconnection or through add-in boards. In the depicted example, local area network (LAN) adapter , SCSI host bus adapter , and expansion bus interface  are connected to PCI local bus  by direct component connection. In contrast, audio adapter , graphics adapter , and audio\/video adapter  are connected to PCI local bus  by add-in boards inserted into expansion slots. Expansion bus interface  provides a connection for a keyboard and mouse adapter , modem , and additional memory . Small computer system interface (SCSI) host bus adapter  provides a connection for hard disk drive , tape drive , and CD-ROM drive . Typical PCI local bus implementations will support three or four PCI expansion slots or add-in connectors.","An operating system runs on processor  and is used to coordinate and provide control of various components within data processing system  in . The operating system may be a commercially available operating system, such as Windows XP, which is available from Microsoft Corporation. An object oriented programming system such as Java may run in conjunction with the operating system and provide calls to the operating system from Java programs or applications executing on data processing system . \u201cJava\u201d is a trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. Instructions for the operating system, the object-oriented operating system, and applications or programs are located on storage devices, such as hard disk drive , and may be loaded into main memory  for execution by processor .","Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware in  may vary depending on the implementation. Other internal hardware or peripheral devices, such as flash read-only memory (ROM), equivalent nonvolatile memory, or optical disk drives and the like, may be used in addition to or in place of the hardware depicted in . Also, the processes of the present invention may be applied to a multiprocessor data processing system.","As another example, data processing system  may be a stand-alone system configured to be bootable without relying on some type of network communication interfaces. As a further example, data processing system  may be a personal digital assistant (PDA) device, which is configured with ROM and\/or flash ROM in order to provide non-volatile memory for storing operating system files and\/or user-generated data.","The depicted example in  and above-described examples are not meant to imply architectural limitations. For example, data processing system  also may be a notebook computer or hand held computer in addition to taking the form of a PDA. Data processing system  also may be a kiosk or a Web appliance.","The present invention provides a method, apparatus, and computer instructions for transmitting accessibility requirements or information from a client to a server. The mechanism of the present invention employs the use of an application, such as a plug-in that is activated whenever a particular indicator is received in a Web page. In these examples, the indicator takes the form of a multi-purpose Internet mail extension (MIME) object type that is included within the Web page. This indicator causes the application or process to query the client for accessibility information. The accessibility information is obtained by reading accessibility settings present at run-time on the client. Then, this information is sent to the server. In the depicted example, the information is sent to a server in the form of a data object, such as an extensible markup language (XML) document. Further, other types of indicators, such as other types of tags may be used.","Turning next to , a block diagram illustrating components used in transmitting accessibility information is depicted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this example, client  makes a request to server  for a Web page through browser . Browser  may take many forms, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, which is available from Microsoft Corporation, or Mozilla, which is available from Mozilla.org. In response to this request, server  generates Web page  from information within Web page database .","The generation of Web page  may occur through the use of Java servlet  or Enterprise Java Bean (EJB) . Additionally, Web page  may be generated using other mechanisms such as a servlet or server process. As illustrated, indicator  is included within Web page  by context server . In these examples, context server  is a server process that is used to include indicator  as well as process return accessibility information for use by other server processes. Web page  is received by browser  at client .","Upon receiving Web page , browser  processes the Web page. The presence of indicator  causes plug-in  to be activated. As shown, indicator  is an object type that takes the form of a multi-purpose Internet mail extension (MIME) type, which is a file identification system based on the MIME encoding system. This MIME type is associated with plug-in  and causes plug-in  to be activated when the MIME type is detected within Web page . In this example, the MIME type is accessibility. This MIME type is used to indicate a particular type of server, such as WebSphere. WebSphere applications are available from International Business Machines Corporation. In addition, the indicator may be located in other types of content other than Web pages. For example, an indicator might be included in a message, a file, or other forms of inter-server process communications.","Plug-in  obtains accessibility information, such as the client's font type, font size, whether a speech interface is enabled, enablement of visual warning for generated sounds, and a high contrast display. This information may be obtained by querying the operating system through native calls, such as APIs . In response to using APIs , accessibility information  is obtained from client . As illustrated, accessibility information may include information, such as, show sounds, screen reader, and high contrast. Show sounds is used to initiate an application programming interface (API) to provide sounds for users that are hearing impaired. Screen reader is an accessibility feature that provides a text-to-voice translation of text displayed on the screen. High contrast is an accessibility feature used to increase the font size on the display.","With this accessibility information, plug-in  returns this information to server  by constructing and sending extensible markup language (XML) document . This document contains information describing the font size and font type in this example. XML document  is sent to server  using a POST command. A POST command is an HTTP command used to send text to a Web server for processing. The POST method is widely implemented in HTML files for sending typed-in forms to the server. In these examples, this command is used to transmit the XML document to accessibility server . A post command is used in these examples, but other commands, such as a GET command, also may be employed to send the XML document  to accessibility server .","When XML document  is received by accessibility server , accessibility server  may create a session object, such as accessibility object  for tracking purposes. Accessibility object  allows for the accessibility information to be recalled for a particular session with client . Currently, this kind of information is not accessible by processes on a server.","With the present invention, such a request for accessibility information returns the accessibility information stored in accessibility object . No changes or modifications are required to server processes to obtain this type of accessibility information for client . Session objects are described in the Java  Enterprise Edition (J2EE) architecture by Sun Microsystems, Inc.","Alternatively, instead of maintaining a session object, accessibility server  may generate HTML content containing an indicator, such as indicator  to retrieve accessibility information from client  each time the information is needed. This type of content generation is performed each time Java servlet  or EJB  instantiates a default data object for a client, such as client .","With reference now to , a diagram illustrating hypertext markup language (HTML) content is depicted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Web page  in this example is an HTML document generated by a server process, such as Java servlet  or EJB  in , using information from Web page database  in . This document is processed by a server process, such as accessibility server  to include an indicator.","Turning now to , a diagram illustrating hypertext markup language content with an indicator is depicted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, Web page  is similar to Web page  except Web page  has been modified to include indicator . This indicator takes the form of an object type called \u201cAccessibility\u201d in Web page .","With reference now to , a diagram illustrating a document containing accessibility information is depicted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Web page  is an example of an XML document, such as XML document  in . Web page  is generated by a process, such as plug-in  in , at a client activated in response to an indicator being present in content received by a browser. This document contains accessibility information defining a font size desired by the user for accessibility purposes. In this example, the font size is a 24 point font.","In this manner, the present invention provides an improved method, apparatus, and computer instructions for automatically obtaining accessibility information from a client without requiring user input. The mechanism of the present invention employs a process, such as a plug-in, at the client. This plug-in identifies accessibility information from the client when an indicator, such as a MIME type, is identified or present in content received from a server. This information is returned to the server in a document, such as an XML document using a POST command. This accessibility information is then used by processes on the server to provide appropriate formatting of information for the client.","With reference now to , a flowchart of a process used for automatically obtaining accessibility information from a client is depicted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The process illustrated in  may be implemented in a server, such as server  in .","The process begins by receiving a request for a Web page (step ). This request is received from a browser at a client, such as browser  in . The Web page is generated (step ). A special MIME is included in the Web page (step ). This special MIME type is associated with a plug-in that gathers accessibility information on the client. This accessibility information includes the settings present at run time on the client in these examples. This indicator is included using a server process, such as accessibility server  in . The Web page is then sent to the client (step ).","In response, an XML document is received from the client (step ). As described above, this XML document is received from the client using a POST command. A session object is created from the XML document (step ) with the process terminating thereafter. This session object is maintained during the session with the client in these examples. Alternatively, these steps in  may be repeated each time accessibility information is needed by a server process if the information is not maintained during the session with the client.","Turning now to , a flowchart of a process used for returning accessibility information to a server is depicted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The process illustrated in  may be implemented in a browser, such as browser  in .","The process begins by receiving a Web page (step ). The web page is processed (step ). In processing the Web page, the different HTML lines in the Web page are parsed to determine whether an indicator is present. Specifically, a determination is made as to whether an accessibility MIME type is present (step ). If an accessibility MIME type is present, a determination is made as to whether a plug-in is present (step ). The determination in step  may be made by examining a set of MIME type associations in which different extensions are associated with different plug-ins.","If the plug-in for the accessibility MIME type is present, the plug-in is activated (step ). The description of the processes performed by the plug-in are described in more detail in  below. The Web page is presented (step ) and the process terminates thereafter.","With reference again to step , if the plug-in is not present, the process proceeds to step  as described above. Returning again to step , if a accessibility MIME type is absent, the process also proceeds to step  as described above.","With reference now to , a flowchart of a process used for automatically obtaining accessibility information at a client is depicted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The process illustrated in  may be implemented in a plug-in, such as plug-in  in . This process is automatically initiated when an indicator associated with the process is identified in content received from a server.","The process begins by making calls to the operating system for accessibility information (step ). In these examples, the calls are API calls for the operating system. These types of API calls are commonly available for use in obtaining accessibility information from the operating system environment. For example, these types of calls are described in Microsoft Windows software development kit available from the Microsoft Corporation. In these examples, the accessibility information includes settings present at run-time as maintained by the operating system. As described above, these accessibility settings include, for example, a font type, a font size, enablement of a speech interface, and settings for contrast on a display. The accessibility information is received from the operating system (step ).","After the accessibility information is obtained, an XML document containing accessibility information is generated (step ). This XML document is posted to the Web server (step ) and the process terminates thereafter.","Thus, the present invention provides an improved method, apparatus, and computer instructions for automatically obtaining accessibility information from a client for use by a server process. The mechanism of the present invention includes an indicator, such as a MIME type, in the content sent to a client. This indicator results in a process, such as a browser plug-in, to be activated when the content is received by the client. This plug-in queries the client to identify accessibility information.","The accessibility information is then returned to the server by the plug-in for use in providing formatting of content for the client by server processes. In this manner, accessibility information may be automatically obtained from the client without requiring changes to existing servlets or EJBs to take advantage of this feature. The accessibility information obtained from the client is placed in a location or format for use by the existing servlets or EJBs.","It is important to note that while the present invention has been described in the context of a fully functioning data processing system, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the processes of the present invention are capable of being distributed in the form of a computer readable medium of instructions and a variety of forms and that the present invention applies equally regardless of the particular type of signal bearing media actually used to carry out the distribution. Examples of computer readable media include recordable-type media, such as a floppy disk, a hard disk drive, a RAM, CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, and transmission-type media, such as digital and analog communications links, wired or wireless communications links using transmission forms, such as, for example, radio frequency and light wave transmissions. The computer readable media may take the form of coded formats that are decoded for actual use in a particular data processing system.","The description of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description, and is not intended to be exhaustive or limited to the invention in the form disclosed. Many modifications and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the illustrations show a server and client exchange of cultural context information. This process may be applied to other types of communications, such as peer-to-peer communications between computers. In such a case, a computer may take various forms, such as, for example, a PDA, a cell phone, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a workstation, a kiosk, or a server computer.
