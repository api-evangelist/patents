GM086868 and RC2CA148354. Therefore the U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to phosphohistidine analogs that are useful for the preparation of immunogens, haptens containing said phosphohistidine analogs, immunogens comprised of these haptens linked to carrier molecules, antibodies thereto and uses of these antibodies, haptens, immunogens and phosphohistidine analogs.","Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common and extensively studied posttranslation modifications (PTMs). Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins control the function of the target protein, and their misregulation has been linked to many diseases, including cancer. Accordingly, protein kinases and phosphatases have emerged as important drug targets, boosted by the prominent success of Gleevec\u00ae, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat leukemia and other malignancies.","While most studies on protein phosphorylation have focused on the O-phosphorylation of Ser, Thr and Tyr residues, very little is known about histidine phosphorylation, which occurs at the imidazole nitrogens. The role of the histidine phosphorylation, however, is well documented in bacterial two-component signaling pathways; yet proteins with phosphohistidine (pHis) residues are also found in eukaryotic cells. In fact, in , pHis accounts for 6% of the total phosphonoamino acids in its basic nuclear proteins. The prevalence of pHis is strikingly high among these proteins, considering that phosphotyrosine (pTyr) is found in less than 1% of eukaryotic cellular phosphoproteins.","Histidine phosphorylation plays an important role in cell processes. For example, histidine phosphorylation plays an important role in the signaling processes of higher eukaryotes. Further, the modification has been implicated in several processes, including G-protein signaling, ion conduction, secondary metabolism and chromatin biology. It is known that a histidine Kinase, nucleoside diphosphate Kinase, phosphorylates histidine and protein histidine phosphatase (PHP) dephosphorylates histidine. It has been found that histone (H4), which is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells, and which, along with the core histones (H2A, HB, and H3), forms the proteinaceous spool around which DNA is packaged in chromatin, is phosphorylated on histidine, located on positions 18 and 75 of H4. It has also been found that H4 histidine Kinase activity is about 400 times higher in human hepatocellular carcinoma liver tissue as compared to normal liver tissue. Thus, H4 histidine Kinase activity is strongly correlated with liver growth. Further, it has been found that mutation of His-18 (to either Ala or Gln) profoundly perturbed chromosome silencing in yeast and that this had the biggest effect on any of H4 mutants in silencing the yeast.","Despite these discoveries, further understanding of histidine phosphorylation has been impeded because it is technically challenging to detect and isolate pHis proteins. To further complicate matters, histidine can be phosphorylated in vivo at either of the nitrogen atoms in the imidazole ring, giving rise to two isomers, 1-phosphohistidine (1-pHis) and 3-phosphohistidine (3-pHis). Both isomers have a phosphoramidate (P\u2014N) bond, which thermodynamically is higher in energy (\u0394 G\u00b0 of hydrolysis: about \u221212 to about \u221214 kcal\/mole) than the phosphoester bond of phosphohydroxyamino acids, as in pSer, pThr or pTyr (\u0394 G\u00b0 of hydrolysis: about \u22126.5 to about \u22129.5 kcal\/mole). Under acidic conditions, pHis is rapidly hydrolyzed due to protonation of the imidazole ring. Although pHis is stable under basic conditions, the instability of pHis under acidic conditions severely hampers detection and isolation of the pHis using standard protocols. Indeed, the instability of pHis in acidic conditions has impeded the development of antibodies to molecules containing pHis. For example, no specific antibodies against pHis-containing proteins have been found since immunogens with pHis will be dephosphorylated in serum.","Moreover, to further complicate matters, even though chemical phosphorylation of protein and peptides can be selectively carried out on histidine residues, it is difficult to obtain the 1-pHis form regioselectivitely, since 1-pHis isomerizes to the more thermodynamically stable 3-pHis under phosphorylation reaction conditions.","The present inventors, however, have found tools to investigate these problems. They have made pHis analogs which have been incorporated into peptides and proteins and have used these in the development of haptens and immunogens. The present inventors have prepared semi-synthetic pHis containing proteins and have generated pHis antibodies to further investigate the physiological functions of pHis.","The present invention is directed to a phosphoryltriazole of formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"34.29mm","wi":"25.40mm","file":"US09035068-20150519-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["or salts thereof,","wherein X and Y are independently","\u2014OR, \u2014NRR, \u2014SR, \u2014COOR, \u2014CONRR, NHJ, COQ or H;","Z is CH, N or SiR;","E and G are independently a chemical bond or a linker group selected from alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkyl-alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkenylalkyl, (CH)q wherein one of the methylene groups is replaced by O, (O\u2014CHCH)n, heterocyclic or heterocyclicalkyl,","n is 1-100;","q is 1-6;","Rand Rare independently hydrogen, alkyl, alkeyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkyl alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heterocyclic or heterocyclic alkyl;","Ris H or alkyl and","J is an amino protecting group;","Q is an acid protecting group;","one of Rand R is"]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0024"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"13.63mm","wi":"73.83mm","file":"US09035068-20150519-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["\u2003and the other is hydrogen","R, R, R, R, R, Rand Rare independently H, alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkyl-alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heterocyclic, heterocyclicalkyl, or a phosphate protecting group."]}},"Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a hapten comprising the fragment of",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0028"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"27.18mm","wi":"28.28mm","file":"US09035068-20150519-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["wherein R, R, E and G are as defined hereinabove, and","Xand Yare independently a chemical bond, \u2014O\u2014,"]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0031"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"9.31mm","wi":"26.25mm","file":"US09035068-20150519-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":"\u2003or \u2014S\u2014."}},"In another aspect, the hapten can be conjugated to carrier material to provide immunogens for antibody production and conjugates.","In still further aspects, the present invention provides an immunogen comprising a hapten of the present invention coupled to an antigenicty conferring carrier material.

Among the immunogenic carrier substances are included proteins, glycoproteins, complex polyamino-polysaccharides, and nucleic acids that are recognized as foreign and thereby elicit an immunologic response from the host. The polyamino-polysaccharides may be prepared from polysaccharides using any of the conventional means known for this preparation. Also various protein types may be employed as a poly (amino acid) immunogenic carrier. These types include albumins, serum proteins, lipoproteins, and the like. Illustrative proteins include bovine serum albumin (BSA), bovine gamma-globulin (BgG), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), egg ovalbumin, bovine thyroglobulin (BTG), and the like. Alternatively, synthetic poly(amino acids), polymerized protein or cross-linked protein may be utilized.","Immunogenic carriers can also include poly amino-polysaccharides, which are a high molecular weight polymer built up by repeated condensations of monosaccharides. Examples of polysaccharides are starches, glycogen, cellulose, carbohydrate gums such as gum arabic, agar, and so forth. The polysaccharide also contains polyamino acid residues and\/or lipid residues.","The immunogenic carrier can also be a poly(nucleic acid) either alone or conjugated to one of the above mentioned poly(amino acids) or polysaccharides.","The immunogenic carrier can also include solid particles. The particles are generally at least about 0.02 microns and not more than about 100 microns and usually about 0.05 microns to about 10 microns in diameter. The particle can be organic or inorganic, swellable or non-swellable, porous or non-porous, optimally of a density approximating water, generally from about 0.7 to about 1.5 g\/mL, and composed of material that can be transparent, partially transparent, or opaque. The particles can be biological materials such as cells and microorganisms, including non-limiting examples such as erythrocytes, leukocytes, lymphocytes, hybridomas, , and viruses, and the like. The particles can also be comprised of organic and inorganic polymers, liposomes, latex, phospholipid vesicles, or lipoproteins.","\u201cPoly(amino acid)\u201d or \u201cpolypeptide\u201d is a polyamide formed from amino acids. Poly(amino acids) will generally range from about 500 daltons in molecular weight, having no upper molecular weight limit, normally being less than 10,000,000 and usually not more than about 600,000 daltons. There will usually be different ranges, depending on whether an immunogenic carrier or an enzyme is involved.","A \u201cpeptide\u201d is any compound formed by the linkage of two or more amino acids by amide (peptide) bonds, usually a polymer of alpha-amino acids in which the alpha-amino group of each amino acid residue (except the NHterminus) is linked to the alpha-carboxyl group of the next residue in a linear chain. The terms peptide, polypeptide and poly(amino acid) are used synonymously herein to refer to this class of compounds without restriction as to size, unless indicated to the contrary. The largest members of this class are referred to as proteins.","A \u201clabel,\u201d \u201cdetector molecule,\u201d or \u201ctracer\u201d is any molecule which produces, or can be induced to produce, a detectable signal. The label can be conjugated to an analyte, immunogen, antibody, or to another molecule such as a receptor or a molecule that can bind to a receptor such as a ligand, particularly a hapten. Non-limiting examples of labels include radioactive isotopes, enzymes, enzyme fragments, enzyme substrates, enzyme inhibitors, coenzymes, catalysts, fluorophores, dyes, chemiluminescers, luminescers, or sensitizers; a non-magnetic or magnetic particle, a solid support, a liposome, a ligand, or a receptor.","The term \u201cantibody\u201d refers to a specific protein binding partner for an antigen and is any substance, or group of substances, which has a specific binding affinity for an antigen to the exclusion of other substances. The generic term antibody subsumes polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments such as fab, fab\u2032 and (fab\u2032), and the like, and application products containing these materials such as chimeric antibody, or humanized antibody, and the like.","In the present specification, antibody specificity refers to the property of an antibody which enables it to recognize, react, or bind to some particular antigenic determinants and not others. Specificity is dependent on chemical composition, physical forces, and molecular structure at the binding site.","The term \u201cderivative\u201d refers to a chemical compound or molecule made from a parent compound by one or more chemical reactions.

For example, by protecting the amino group in Formula I\u2032\u2033, other functional groups on the left side of Formula I can be made. For instance, esters can be prepared from the carboxylic acid by reacting the carboxylic acid with an alcohol in the presence of acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, under ester forming conditions. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid can be converted to an acid chloride which is then reacted with an alcohol under ester forming conditions to form an ester. Alternatively, the ether functionality (e.g., alkoxy) can be prepared from the corresponding alcohol which is prepared by reducing the carboxyl group with a reducing agent known in the art, such as lithium aluminum hydride and by reacting the product with an alkyl halide, for example, in the presence of base. The amino functionality can be prepared from the carboxylic acid by converting the carboxylic acid into an amide by reacting the acid chloride with ammonia and then heating the amide under Hoffman degradation conditions to form an amine at the \u03b1-carbon. The Alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkenylalkyl, aryl, aryl alkyl heterocyclic and heterocyclic alkyl substituents of E and X can be added to the molecule by reducing the carboxylic acid with lithium aluminum halide or other reducing agent known in the art to form an alcohol and converting the alcohol to a halide by techniques known in the art, such as reacting with Hydrochloride acid and then reacting the product with R\u2033CuLi under Gilman reaction conditions to form a carbon-carbon bond where R\u2033 is an allyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkenylalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heterocyclic or heterocyclic alkyl.","On the other side of the molecule, the carboxy group of Y is protected with an acid protecting group, and the amino group is reacted. For example, it is reacted with alkyl halide to form a quaternary ammonium salt and then reacting the product thereof with base, such as KOH, under Hoffman elimination reaction conditions to form a carbon-carbon double bond. The carbon carbon double bond can be reacted with HBr in the presence of peroxide to form a terminal bromide which in turn reacts with additional base (e.g. KOH) to form a terminal OH compound. This in turn can react with an alkyl halide in the presence of further base to form an ether under ether forming conditions. Moreover the alcohol can be oxidized by an oxidizing agent known in the art, such as KMnO, in the presence of acid to form a carboxylic acid. The resulting carboxylic acid can undergo the reactions discussed in the previous paragraph. For example, the carboxylic acid can then be converted to an acid chloride and react with an alcohol to faun an ester under ester forming conditions. The halide described hereinabove can react with R\u2033CuLto form carbon carbon bond wherein R\u2033 is defined above.","As shown by these sample reactions, it is possible to obtain various functional groups on both side of the Z moiety by techniques known to one of skill in the art.

At the end of the reaction or at the end of the overall synthesis, these protecting groups can be removed.","The reactions described herein are generally performed in solvents which solubilize the reactants and are conducted under temperatures and conditions sufficient to effect the reaction.","The compounds of Formula I are not in and of themselves immunogenic.

The haptens of the present invention are employed in the preparation of immunogens by coupling them to modified or non-modified antigenicity-conferring carrier materials to provide immunogens for antibody production and conjugates (tracers) using synthetic organic chemistry techniques.","The hapten may be bonded directly to the carrier material or indirectly through a linking group. Spacer groups may be added to the hapten or to the carrier. The hapten, on the one hand, may be linked to the carrier by a linker, which links one group on the carrier with another group on the hapten. A hapten can directly or indirectly (via a spacer or linker) be coupled to a carrier protein to form an immunogen such as hapten-enzyme conjugate. The hapten can also be linked to other non-enzymatic reporter groups such as a chromogen, a fluorescent compound, a phosphorescent compound or a chemiluminescent material, and the like. For example, in an embodiment of the present invention, the hapten is a polypeptide wherein the end groups thereon are functional groups, the amino group at one end and a carboxy group at the other end. The linkage may be through the carboxylic acid or phosphoric acid of the hapten and the alcohol if present, on the carrier to form an ester or through the carboxyl group of the hapten and amino group, if present, of the carrier to form an amide. However, if necessary, the carboxy group or the amino group may be further functionalized to form other bonds with the carrier molecule. For example, the carboxy group may be reduced to form an alcohol group by techniques known in the art and linked to the carboxyl group, if present, of the carrier to form an ester. Alternatively, the alcohol may be converted to a halide or other good leaving group, such as mesylate, tosylate, brosylate and reacted with other groups on the carrier by substitution reactions. In another embodiment, the side groups of the amino acid residues may react with functional groups on the carrier molecules. For example a sulfhydryl (mercaptan) can react with an olefin, halogen, or other alkylating agents to form thioethers. In another embodiment, a linking group which contains two functionalities, one reactive with the hapten to be linked thereto and one reactive with the carrier may be added to either the hapten or the carrier and react with a functional group on the carrier or hapten, respectively. Other bio-conjugation reactions can be effected as illustrated in the literature of conjugation chemistry, such as in the Bioconjugate Techniques book described hereinabove. Additionally, if the carrier has a ribose or adenine moiety thereon, it can be coupled to the haptens of the present invention via the functional groups in the ribose or the adenine moiety.","The carrier material typically is a protein, a protein fragment, a synthetic polypeptide or a semi-synthetic polypeptide. Illustrative examples of useful carrier materials are bovine serum albumin (BSA), egg ovalbumin, bovine gamma globulin, thyroxine binding globulin, keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) and the like. Alternatively, synthetic poly(amino acids) having a sufficient number of available amino groups, such as lysine, may be employed, as may other synthetic or natural polymeric materials bearing reactive functional groups. In particular, carbohydrates, yeasts or polysaccharides may be conjugated to the hapten to produce an immunogen.","Each hapten of the present invention can also be coupled to a labeling agent. For example, it may be coupled to an enzyme. Any common reporter enzyme (e.g., alkaline phosphatase or AP, and beta-galactosidase or beta-gal, horseradish peroxidase or HRP, and the like) can be use for preparation of hapten-enzyme conjugate. The hapten may be coupled to a substance having fluorescent properties or a radioactive label for the preparation of conjugates (or detection reagents) for use in the immunoassay. The fluorescent substance may be, for example, a monovalent residue or fluoroescein or a derivative thereof.","In order to confirm that adequate conjugation of hapten to carrier material has been achieved prior to immunization, each immunogen is evaluated to verify that the hapten is conjugated to a carrier material. For example, the immunogen may be evaluated using matrix-assisted UV laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF-MS).","The immunogens obtained are then administered to hosts to elicit production of specific antibodies, i.e., polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, which are then used to develop immunoassays for the detection and determination of p-His polypeptides in a biological sample. Each of the immunogens of the present invention is suitable for immunization to produce the antibodies described hereinbelow. For specific application, the hapten may be coupled to antibody, or biotin\/avidin (or streptavidin), and the like. The antibody can be a monoclonal antibody or a polyclonal antibody.","The immunogen is administered to animals such as rabbits, mice, rats, chickens, sheep, goats, or cows, and the like by a series of injections according to techniques generally known in the art. An antibody, according to the present invention, is raised in response to an immunogen of the invention which is derived from a substantially purified hapten including optically pure hapten of the invention. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies recognize specific epitopes on an immunogen, and, while typically polyclonal antibodies have been utilized in the present invention, both may be suitable. Polyclonal antibodies consist of a mixture of multiple antibodies, each recognizing a specific epitope, whereas monoclonal antibodies are produced by cells secreting a single antibody recognizing a specific epitope. Techniques for preparing polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies generally are well known in the art.","The antibodies of the present invention recognize the His and the pTza of the present invention or peptide containing same.","The antibodies do not recognize amino acids other than histidine which are phosphorylated, nor do they recognize peptides including polypeptides, which are not phosphorylated or are phosphorylated on amino acids other than histidine but not on histidine. As long as the peptide contains 1 histidine moiety that is phosphorylated, even if the other histidine moieties therein are not phosphorylated, the antibody will recognize the peptide.","Thus, even after separation of the antibodies, and the antibodies are isolated, to verify that the correct antibodies are collected non-phosphorylated histidine or the peptide containing non-phosphorylated histidine is used. If the antibody does not recognize the non-phosphorylated histidine, then the antibody is kept. If it still recognizes the dephosphorylated His or peptide containing non-phosphorylated histidine, then the antibody is discarded.","The polyclonal antibodies are obtained by techniques known in the art. For example, in a method to generate anti sera and polyclonal antibodies, each immunogen is mixed with Freud's Adjuvant and the mixture injected into a host animal, such as rabbit, sheep, mouse, guinea pig or horse. Further, injections (boosts) are made and their serum is sampled for evaluation of the antibody titre. When the optimal titre has been attained, the host animal is bled to yield a suitable volume of specific anti serum. For many purposes, there is no requirement for purification, however, in other cases, such as where the antibody is immobilized on a solid support, purification steps can be taken to remove undesired material. The antibodies are then separated from the serum using techniques known in the art.","For example, monoclonal antibodies may be prepared by injecting animals, such as mice or rats, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intravenously, or in some other manner, with an antigen, namely an immunogen of the present invention linked to an immunogenic carrier, to elicit an immune response in the animals (namely, the production of antibodies which are specific for the antigen). Sera from the animals are drawn, and the sera are tested to determine the titer of antibody in the sera (to determine whether or not the animal elicited the desired immune response, and to what extent). Those animals in which the desired immune response has been produced are permitted to rest for approximately three weeks to three months for clearance of circulating antibodies. After this three weeks to three-month period of time, and approximately three days prior to the anticipated fusion of B-lymphocyte cells (cells which, upon stimulation by antigen, mature into plasma cells which synthesize antibody, and which are also referred to as B cells) with, for example, myeloma cells (tumor cells), a boost injection (intravenously preferred) of the antigen is administered to these animals B-lymphocyte cells are then removed from the spleens and\/or lymph nodes of these animals by standard procedures, and the B-lymphocyte cells are then fused with myeloma fusion partners according to standard procedures, such as those described in Ed Harlow and David Lane, \u201cAntibodies, A Laboratory Manual,\u201d Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988, and in Kohler and Milstein, \u201cContinuous Culture of Fused Cells Secreting Antibody of Predefined Specificity,\u201d 256, 495 (1975). The B-lymphocyte-myeloma fusions are then plated in multiwell tissue culture plates containing HT media, or other suitable media. The resulting cultures are fed with HT media, or other suitable media, and fetal bovine serum or calf serum on or about the fifth and seventh days after the fusion of the cells and then tested on or about the tenth day after the fusion for the presence of antibody which is specific for the antigen. Specific desirable hybrids are then cloned by limiting dilution (Hybrid cells are diluted in differing amounts of HT media, or other suitable media, and plated out in tissue culture plates in order to isolate a single desired clone.) Established clones are then retested for specificity to a broader panel of cross reactants.","The amount of the resulting monoclonal antibodies produced by a desired clone can then be scaled up to produce a sufficient quantity of antibody for purification in either: (1) tissue culture (by expanding the number of cells in tissue culture, or HT media); or (2) mice for ascites. The monoclonal antibodies can be scaled up in mice by injecting hybrid cells into the abdominal cavity of mice and allowing the cells to grow (usually for about 7 days). The ascites are harvested from the mice by sacrificing the mice, collecting the ascites fluid, and purifying the ascites fluid. BALB\/c mice are the most common strain of laboratory mouse used for this process, and they can be obtained from any mouse vendor. Pristane should be injected into the mice to stimulate their immune systems to produce B and T cells (about two or three weeks before the hybrid cells are injected into the mice) which serve as a feeder layer for the clone cells that are injected into the mice. This is performed to provide a suitable environment in which the hybrid cells can grow.","The antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fc fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","The antibody application derivatives and products are intended to include chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, genetically engineered or modified antibody sequences by site specific mutagenesis.","An additional method for selecting antibodies that specifically bind to the immunogens of the present invention or variant or fragment thereof is by phage display. In an embodiment, the antibodies prepared by the techniques hereinabove are collected. Human or murine immunoglobulin variable region gene combinatiorial libraries may be created in phage vectors, that can be screened to select the antibodies fragment (Fab, Fb, sFv or multimers thereof) that bind specifically to the immunogen of the present invention or variants or fragments thereof, but do not bind to the corresponding nonphosphorylated polypeptide using phase transfer techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a library containing a plurality of polynucleotide sequences encoding the antibody isolated hereinabove or variable region fragments can be prepared and inserted into the genome of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or variant thereof, in frame, with the sequence encoding a phage coat protein, for instance, gene III or gene VIII of M13 to create an M13 fusion protein with the antigen binding domain on the outside of the bacteriophage. The fusion protein may be a fusion of the coat protein with the light chain variable region domain and\/or with the heavy chain variable region doman. A random population of variable region genes are cloned to give rise to a mixture of bacteriophages, that is a phase display library.","Phage that display an Ig fragment (e.g., an Ig V-region or Fab) that binds to the immunogen of the present invention may be selected by mixing the phage library with the immunogen of the present invention or a variant or a fragment thereof, or by contacting the phage library with a immunogen of the present invention immobilized on a solid matrix under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow binding. Unbound phage are removed by a wash, which typically may be a buffer containing salt (e.g., NaCl) at a low concentration, preferably with less than 100 mM NaCl, more preferably with less than 50 mM NaCl, most preferably with less than 10 mM NaCl, or, alternatively, a buffer containing no salt. Specifically bound phage is then eluted with a NaCl-containing buffer, for example, by increasing the salt concentration in a step-wise manner. Typically, phage that bind the immunogen of the present invention with higher affinity will require higher salt concentrations to be released. Eluted phage may be propagated in an appropriate bacterial host, and generally, successive rounds of immunogen of the present invention binding and elution can be repeated to increase the yield of phage expressing immunogen of the present invention specific immunoglobulin.","Phage display techniques may also be used to select polypeptides, peptides or single chain antibodies that bind to immunogen of the present invention. The inserted DNA molecules may comprise randomly generated sequences, or may encode variants of a known peptide or polypeptide domain that specifically binds to the immunogen of the present invention, or variant or fragment thereof, as provided herein. Generally, the nucleic acid insert encodes a peptide of up to 60 amino acids, more preferably a peptide of 3 to 35 amino acids, and still more preferably a peptide of 6 to 20 amino acids. The peptide encoded by the inserted sequence is displayed on the surface of the bacteriophage. Phage expressing a binding domain for the immunogen of the present invention may be selected on the basis of specific binding to an immobilized immunogen of the present invention as described above. As provided herein, well-known recombinant genetic techniques may be used to construct fusion proteins containing the fragment thereof. For example, a polypeptide may be generated that comprises a tandem array of two or more similar or dissimilar affinity selected immunogens of the present invention binding peptide domains, in order to maximize binding affinity for the immunogen of the present invention of the resulting product.","In certain other embodiments, the invention contemplates the specific antibodies to the immunogens of the present invention that are multimeric antibody fragments. Useful methodologies are described generally, for example in Hayden et al. 19979:201-12; Coloma et al., 1997 15:159-63). For example, multimeric antibody fragments may be created by phage techniques to form miniantibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 5,910,573) or diabodies (Holliger et al., 199745:128-130). Multimeric fragments may be generated that are multimers of Fv region of the immunogen of the present invention, or that are bispecific antibodies comprising the immunogen of the present invention or specific Fv region of the immunogen of the present invention noncovalently associated with a second Fv having a different antigen specificity. See, e.g., Koelemij et al., 199922:514-24. As another example, a multimeric antibody may comprise a bispecific antibody having two single chain antibodies or Fab fragments. According to certain related embodiments, a first Ig fragment may be specific for a first antigenic determinant on an immunogen of the present invention (or variant or fragment thereof), while a second Ig fragment may be specific for a second antigenic determinant of the an immunogen of the present invention. Alternatively, in certain other related embodiments, a first immunoglobulin fragment may be specific for an antigenic determinant of the immunogen of the present invention or variant or fragment thereof, and a second immunoglobulin fragment may be specific for an antigenic determinant on a second, distinct (i.e., non-) molecule. Also contemplated are bispecific antibodies that specifically bind, wherein at least one antigen-binding domain is present as a fusion protein.","The invention also provides an immunoassay for determining the presence or amount of phosphorylated histidine polypeptide in biological samples. The immunoassay of the invention includes a step of contacting the biological sample to be determined with antibodies raised in response to an immunogen of the invention. It is contemplated that any immunoassay for peptides containing at least one phosphorylated histidine utilizing haptens, immunogens, and\/or antibodies raised against immunogens, are within the scope of the present invention. Examples of immunoassays include radioimmunoassays (RIAs), enzyme immunoassay (EIAs), enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and fluorescent polarization immunoassays (FPIAs), etc. Comprehensive reviews on immunoassay principles, critical components, and assay designs can be readily found in literature. One example is \u201cThe Immunoassay Handbook, 3Edition\u201d by David Wild, Editor (Elservier Science, 2005), another is \u201cImmunoassay,\u201d E. P. Diamandis and T. K. Christopoulos, Editors, Academic Press, Inc., 1996.","The immunoassays of the invention may be heterogenous or homogenous. In heterogenous assays, the purpose of the label is simply to establish the location of the molecule to which it is conjugated\u2014i.e., to establish whether the labeled molecule is free in solution or is part of a bound complex. Heterogenous assays generally function by explicitly separating bound antigen-antibody complexes from the remaining free antigen and\/or antibody. A method frequently employed consists of attaching an antigen or antibody to a solid surface by covalent bonding, physical absorption or some other means. When antigen-antibody binding occurs, the resulting bound complexes remain attached to the solid surface which is composed of any suitably inert material such as plastic, paper, glass, metal, polymer gel and the like. This allows for separation of free antigen and\/or antibody in the surrounding solution by a wash step. A variation of this method consists of using small (typically 0.05 to 20 microns) suspendable particles to provide the solid surface onto which either antibody or antigen is immobilized. Separation is effected by centrifugation of the mixture. Separation is effected by centrifugation of the mixture of sample, reagents and suspendable beads at an appropriate speed, resulting in selective sedimentation of the support particles together with the bound complexes. Alternative solid capture phases, such as magnetic particles, glass beads, plastic tubes, glass wool, latex beads, and the like may also be used.","The capture mechanism may be simply by binding to immobilized secondary antibody or an antigen or to utilize, for example, avidin\/streptavidin-biotin type of binding pairs. Natural or manmade binding pairs can be adapted to capture the signals from the rest of the assay mixture.","Signal reporting can be by UV or visible light, fluorescence, luminescence, photon, gold sol, and chemiluminescence, and the like. Furthermore, application of such an antibody include assay variation which utilizes latex beads, liposome, vesicles, and alike to carry signals or signal precursors, and utilize channeling processes, or PCR and alike methods to amplify signals. Furthermore, assay format that are semi-heterogeneous or qusai-heterogeneous (e.g. Roche's Elecsys assay), can also be applied to the assays of the invention.","Use of an enzyme as a label has produced a variety of useful enzyme immunoassays (EIA), the most popular of which is known as ELISA. For a review, see \u201cEnzyme Immunoassay (EIA)\/Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA)\u201d by Rudolf M. Lequin, 51: 2415-2418, 2005. In one typical heterogeneous format a competition reaction is employed, in which the ligand of interest, a p-His polypeptide, binds to the specific antibody-enzyme conjugate. After suitable incubation, any remaining free enzyme conjugate is eliminated by washing or other separation methods. A suitable substrate for the enzyme is then brought into contact with the surface containing the bound complexes. The enzyme-substrate pair is chosen to provide a reaction product which yields a readily detectable signal, such as a color change or a fluorescence emission. The use of an enzyme as label services to effectively amplify the contribution of a single labeled bound complex to the measured signal, because many substrate molecules can be converted by a single enzyme molecule.","In another type of assay, an enzyme is covalently coupled to avidin\/streptavidin and the resulting enzyme labeled avidin\/strepavidin is then mixed or combined with biotin-labeled reagent (i.e., biotin-labeled ligand or biotin-labeled specific binding substance for said ligand) prior to or during utilization of the latter in a specific binding reaction. The basic components in the binding reaction are, in addition to the biotin-labeled reagent, liquid medium or sample (presumed to contain the ligand to be detected) and an insoluble phase containing a specific binding substance for said ligand. The biotin-labeled reagent may be bound to enzyme labeled avidin\/streptavidin after it has been mixed or combined with the insoluble phase or, alternatively, the biotin labeled reagent may be pre-combined with enzyme labeled avidin and the resulting conjugate used directly.","Following the specific binding reaction, the enzyme activity of either the insoluble phase or the liquid phase is determined by a suitable detection system; the amount of activity being related to the quantity of ligand in the sample.","For immunoassays with no separation of bound vs. unbound species (homogeneous assays), Enzyme-Mediated Immunoassay (EMIT) exemplifies such an approach. Based on the functional change of an enzyme such as glucose-6-phoshate dehydrogenase, or G6PDH (commonly shown in diminishing activity) of the hapten-enzyme conjugate when bound to the specific antibody, the assay is achieved by contacting sample with an appropriate amounts of antibody and hapten-enzyme conjugate. When there is a large quantity of analyte in the sample, few of the hapten-enzyme conjugates are bound to the antibody (i.e., minimal amount of enzyme activity is attenuated) and the assay mixture exhibits maximal enzyme activity turning over maximal amount of substrate NAD (or NADP) to NADH (or NADPH). By contrast, when there is little analyte present, the majority of the hapten-enzyme conjugates are bound to antibody, and the assay mixture thus reports substantially reduced signal due to diminished enzyme activity.","Thus, the antibodies are selected and characterized for specificity using standard techniques known in the art, such as standard affinity chromatography, dot blot and ELISA assay protocol. The antibody isolated by these techniques recognize the pHis polypeptide but not free histidine or other phosphonoamino acids.","More specifically, the antibodies of the present invention recognize the immunogens of the present invention, such as, for example, polypeptides containing at least the phosphoryltriazolyl alanine moiety thereon. In addition, the antibodies will recognize a phosphorylated histidine, e.g., polypeptides which have at least one phosphorylated histidine thereon, but will not recognize a non-phosphorylated polypeptide or amino acid or a polypeptide in which the phosphorylation is present on amino acids other than histidine and not on any of the histidines present.","In an embodiment, immunogens of various polypeptides are prepared by linking carrier molecules such as KLH through reactive cysteine sulfhydryl group to the polypeptides and then injecting the resulting product into host animals such as rabbits. Then the antibodies are collected and isolated in accordance with techniques known in the art. The sera is screened for antibodies that recognize phosphoylated histidine and polypeptides which have a phosphorylated histidine thereon or compounds of Formula I, such as, phosphoryltriazolyl alanine thereon, but will not recognize a non-phosphorylated polypeptide or amino acid or a polypeptide which is phosphorylated on an amino acid other than histidine and not on histidine.","Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a kit for detecting and determining p-His polypeptides in a sample. The kit includes the polypeptide containing the hapten, or the mixture thereof which may or may not be immobilized and the antibodies of the present invention or a mixture thereof. The kit may optionally include instruction for use of phosphoprotein containing haptens and the antibodies for detecting and or determining the presence of phosphorylated polypeptides comprised of at least one phosphorylated histidine residue.","The preparation of various antibodies by the procedure described opens the door to perform numerous investigations, such as investigation the mechanism of action of the phosphorylation reactions and dephosphorylation reactions. For example, the haptens having SEQ ID. Nos. 1-8, 12, 13, 14 and 21 described hereinbelow when linked to carrier molecules, generate immunogens, and when administered to a host, generates antibodies, which are isolated from the sera thereof. These antibodies are used to study the mechanism of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions at the molecular level. For example, the H4 p-His antibodies can be used to follow the biochemical enrichment of the histone histidine kinase in nuclear lysates from cultured cells. Extracts derived from regenerating rat liver cells and Walker-256 carcinosarcoma cells, where high histone histidine kinase (HHK) activity has been observed, can be utilized. The nuclei is isolated from cells and the soluble nuclear proteins separated from the chromatin pellet with KCl extraction. The HHK activity in each fraction is evaluated by utilizing the antibodies. Further fractionation is effected using hydroxyapatite chromatography of the solubilized pellet and weak ion exchange chromatography of the soluble nuclear proteins. As the activity is enriched, mass spectroscopy is utilized to identify the proteins in the active fraction. Candidates, in particular those predicted or known to bind ATP, can be generated by recombinant expression in a host animal and assayed for HHK activity in the reconstituted assay with H4.","In another embodiment the present invention is directed to assessing whether a patient has liver cancer or tendency to contract liver cancer. Liver cancer is the third most common cancer in the world. Quite often the diagnosis of liver cancer is too late. As indicated hereinabove, the histone H4 histidine kinase activity is upregulated by 200-fold in human hepatcellular carcinomas compared to normal liver tissue. Thus, there is an abnormal level of phosphorylaton of histones if a patient has liver cancer. Since the H4 sequence is highly conserved from yeast to man and is, in fact, invariant around the two histidines at positions 18 and 75, one can utilize the antibodies of the present invention to determine if a patient has liver cancer prior to its manifestation. This is determined by contacting a biological sample such as sera or tissue lysate of a patient suspected of having liver cancer with an antibody of the present invention using any of the immunoassays described hereinabove under conditions sufficient for formation of a complex between the antibody and a phosphopolypeptide in the biological sample in which the histidine is phosphorylated, detecting the presence and determining the concentration of the phospholpolypeptide in the sera and comparing the concentration to normal levels of phosphopolypeptide in the sera, whereupon a significantly enhanced concentration of said complex, e.g., above about 100 times relative to the normal concentration, would indicate that the patient has liver cancer or is at a high risk for liver cancer and treatment can be started early.","The following non-limiting examples further illustrate the present invention.","Unless otherwise specified, all reactions were carried out in an oven-dried (>110\u00b0 C.) round-bottom flask equipped with a Teflon\u2122 coated magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum under a positive pressure of argon.
