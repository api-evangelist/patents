No. 12\/178,771, filed on Jul. 29, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein.","This invention relates broadly to antennas and more particularly to high power antennas operable at high frequencies.","An antenna is an element used for radiating or receiving electromagnetic waves. While antennas are available in numerous different shapes and sizes, they all operate according to the same basic principles of electromagnetics. According to Faraday's law, the induced electromotive force or emf in any closed circuit is equal to the time rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit. Electromotive force, emf, measured in volts, refers to the energy gained per unit charge passing through a generating device. As used herein, the magnetic flux refers to the quantity of magnetism, or the strength of a given magnetic field, given by the equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"\u2130","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","msub":{"mi":["\u03a6","B"]}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}]},"mo":"."}}}}},"br":{}},"\u2208 is the electromotive force (EMF) in volts","\u03a6is the magnetic flux through the circuit (in webers).","The direction of the electromotive force (the negative sign in the above formula) is given by Lenz's law.","As a general principle, a guided wave traveling along a transmission line in an antenna will radiate free-space waves also known as electromagnetic waves. Conversely, when an antenna is receiving, it transforms free-space waves by inducing a guided electromagnetic wave within a transmission line. The guided electromagnetic waves are fed into a circuit, which converts them into a useful format.","When an antenna is transmitting, it receives the guided electromagnetic wave for transmission from a feed line and induces an electric field surrounding the antenna to form a free-space propagating electromagnetic wave. The features of an antenna can be described by parameters of operation such as frequency, radiation patterns, reflected loss, and gain.","An antenna may be a component of a device such as, for example, a cellular telephone, radio, television, or RADAR system that directs incoming and outgoing radio waves between free space and a transmission line. Antennas may be composed of metal or polymers filled with metal or carbonaceous particles and have a wide variety of configurations, from the whip or mast-like devices employed for radio and television broadcasting to the large parabolic reflectors used to receive satellite signals and the radio waves generated by distant astronomical objects.","Many types of portable electronic devices, such as cellular phones, GPS receivers, palm electronic devices, pagers, laptop computers, and telematics units in vehicles, need an effective and efficient antenna for communicating wirelessly with other fixed or mobile communication units, including satellites. Advances in digital and radio electronics have resulted in the production of a new class of personal communications equipment posing special problems for antenna designers.","Personal wireless communication devices have created an increased demand for compact antennas. The increase in satellite communication has also increased the demand for antennas that are compact and provide reliable transmission. In addition, the expansion of wireless local area has also necessitated the demand for antennas that are compact and inexpensive.","Wire antennas, such as whips and helical antennas, are sensitive to only one polarization direction. As a result, they are not optimal for use in portable communication devices which require robust communications even if the device is oriented such that the antenna is not aligned with a dominant polarization mode.","A patch antenna is a type of antenna that offers a low profile and easy manufacturability, great advantages over traditional antennas. Patch antennas are planar antennas used in wireless links and other microwave applications. Generally, conventional patch antennas use \u201cpatches\u201d formed on the top surface of a thin dielectric substrate separating them from a conductive layer on the bottom surface of the substrate that constitutes a ground for the transmission line or antenna.","Reflector or dish antennas are commonly used in residential environments for receiving broadcast services, such as television channel signals from geostationary, or equatorial, satellites. Reflector antennas, however, are bulky and relatively expensive for residential use. Furthermore, inherent in reflector antennas are feed spillover and aperture blockage by a feed assembly, which significantly reduces their aperture efficiency. An alternative antenna, such as a patch antenna, overcomes many of the disadvantages associated with reflector antennas.","Patch antennas require less space, are simpler and less expensive to manufacture, and are more compatible than reflector antennas. A parabolic reflector antenna has a curved surface. A patch antenna can be made having a planar surface. Further, a patch antenna can achieve the concentration of an antenna beam in a particular direction by means of the application of one of several methods.","Patch antennas are particularly suitable for use as active antennas. An active antenna is an antenna having all of the necessary components, such as an antenna element, feeding circuits, active devices or active circuits, integrally provided on a monolithic substrate, thus producing compact, low cost, and multi-function antenna equipment.","Additionally, the planar structure of a patch antenna permits it to be conformed to a variety of surfaces having different shapes. Patch antennas can be designed to produce a wide variety of patterns and polarizations, depending on the mode excited and the particular shape of the radiating element used. This results in the patch antenna being applicable to many military and commercial devices, such as, for example, use on aircraft or space antennas.","There is an increasing demand for the use of patch antennas in wireless communication due to their inherently low back radiation, ease of conformity and high gain as compared to wire antennas. The patch antenna design prevents large amounts of radiation from being produced at the back of the antenna.","Patch antennas comprise one or more conductive rectilinear or ellipsoidal patches supported relative to a ground plane and radiate in a direction substantially perpendicular to the ground plane. As opposed to a conventional wire-based antenna, generally the conventional patch antenna comprises a plurality of generally planar layers including a radiating element, an intermediate dielectric layer, and a ground plane layer. The radiating element is an electrically conductive material imbedded or photo etched on the intermediate layer and is generally exposed to free space.","Depending on the characteristics of the transmitted electromagnetic energy desired, the radiating element may be square, rectangular, triangular, or circular and is separated from the ground plane layer. An exemplary conventional patch antenna may include a transmission line feed, multiple dielectrics, and a metalized patch on one of the dielectrics. In a typical conventional patch antenna, the radiator element is provided by a metallic patch that is fabricated onto a dielectric substrate over a ground plane.","The conventional dual-band signal-layer patch antenna has been widely used in applications like radar and communication systems because of its advantages over a conventional antenna, such as lighter weight, lower profile and lower cost. Generally, dual-band single-layer patch antennas can be categorized into categories which include stub-type patch antennas, notch-type patch antennas, pin-and-capacitor-type patch antennas, and slot-loaded-type patch antennas.","The patch antenna has a very low profile and can be fabricated using photolithographic techniques. It is easily fabricated into linear or planar arrays and readily integrated with microwave integrated circuits. Patch antennas are commonly produced in half wavelength sizes, in which there are two primary radiating edges parallel to one another.","The performance of an antenna is determined by several parameters, one of which is efficiency. For a patch antenna, \u201cefficiency,\u201d as used herein, is defined as the power radiated divided by the power received by the input to the antenna. A one-hundred percent efficient antenna has zero power loss between the received power input and the radiated power output. Factors that determine patch antenna efficiency include the loss in the dielectric material, the surface wave loss, and conduction losses. Traditional patch antennas, designed with a dielectric material, have about 80% efficiency. For example, if the patch array antenna, designed on the dielectric, is excited with an input power of 1 kilowatt (KW), the antenna will radiate 800 watts (W) while 200 W are lost.","Patch array antennas typically rely on traveling waves and require a complex feed network which contributes significant feed loss to the overall antenna loss. Furthermore, many patch antennas are limited to transmitting and\/or receiving only a linearly polarized beam. The substrate is mounted on a larger ground plane, which serves as the return path for current induced on the patch element.","A patch antenna operates by resonating at a frequency. The patch antenna performs optimally when it is sized such that the cavity beneath the patch resonates in its fundamental mode at the frequency of interest.","Microstrip antennas and patch array antennas have been developed over many decades because of their low profile structures. These antennas are often designed on dielectric materials and can have reduced efficiency owing to dielectric losses","As stated in the foregoing, in view of the deficiencies of the prior art, there exists a need for a more efficient, low-cost, high power antenna system operable at high frequencies.","The publication entitled \u201c\u201d Ly, Canh; January 2008; Report No.(s): AD-A475036; ARL-TR-4352; Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), discloses mechanical and electrical test results of a high power two-patch array antenna. The mechanical test was run for 55 minutes for each axis of the antenna. The electrical test was conducted using a high power RF source (>1 KW) with single and two-patch array antennas. Although the first mechanical test results indicated that the screws of the antenna cover are loosened about \u00bc turn, and right angle connectors inside the antenna enclosure box were loosened about a fraction of a turn, the antenna still sustained all functional operations. The antenna uses air dielectric to endure a high average power for the system that operates at S-Band in order to neutralize unattended microwave devices.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a C-Band, probe-fed, half-wave length, two-patch antenna array. The array is low profile in construction, but maintains the ability to transmit high power RF efficiently. The antenna is supported in free space by metallic posts rather than by a dielectric material. Conventional patch arrays designed with dielectric substrates are about 80% efficient based on the loss in dielectric material, the surface wave losses, and conductor losses. For example, if the patch array antenna, designed with dielectric material, is excited with an input power of 1 kW, the antenna will radiate 800 W while 200 W must be dissipated by the antenna itself as heat. In contrast, the high power two-patch antenna array, designed using an air dielectric, has very high efficiency (on the order of 97%). As such, only 30 W is dissipated within the antenna structure, primarily due to ohmic losses. In addition to the superior efficiency, a preferred embodiment antenna has a bandwidth of more than three times the bandwidth of a normal patch array at 5.8 GHz center frequency. A preferred embodiment antenna offers a low-profile, light-weight and low-cost solution, has great potential as an integrated antenna array for high power microwave (HPM) applications. Since the antenna has its own ground plane, it will not be sensitive to nearby metal structures when installed on a host platform. An objective of the present invention is the design a low profile, low cost, and light-weight antenna with similar electrical performance in terms of beamwidth, coverage and gain compared to current sectoral horn antennas.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a patch antenna constructed with supporting posts. A unique feature is the absence of a dielectric layer between the patch and the ground plane. As such, this construction precludes the excitement of surface waves increasing the efficiency of the antenna. It was experimentally discovered metallic supports (as compared to dielectric supports) appreciably increased the bandwidth of the antenna. The placement of the supports assumed a simple cavity model estimation of the currents and was validated by measurements and computer simulations. A probe is used as the mechanism to excite the patch. The antenna may be excited by a high power source and measured with a power meter in a chamber; resulting in a measured performance that is equivalent to a larger more visible horn antenna. The antenna's architecture is low profile and suitable for platform integration. The design is unique, reproducible, and affordable for manufacturing.","The preferred embodiment antenna may be used, for example, for high power microwave applications. The two-metal patch embodiment comprises an air dielectric between the patch and ground plane. The two-metal patches may have coaxial feeds with, for example, type N connectors and may be supported by two metal posts positioned for bandwidth enhancement. The array can produce a maximum achievable gain of 11.5 dBi and a bandwidth of 957 MHz (17% bandwidth) referenced to the center frequency of 5.8 GHz.","These and other aspects of the embodiments of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments of the invention include all such modifications.","A more complete appreciation of the invention will be readily obtained by reference to the following Description of the Preferred Embodiments and the accompanying drawings in which like numerals in different figures represent the same or corresponding structures or elements. Similar functioning elements are represented using a suffix such as A, B, or C. The representations in each of the figures are diagrammatic and no attempt is made to indicate actual scales or precise ratios. Proportional relationships are shown as approximates.","The embodiments of the invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments of the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments of the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skilled in the art to practice the embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments of the invention.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the full scope of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. For example, when referring first and second photons in a photon pair, these terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to other elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower\u201d, can therefore, encompass both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements. The exemplary terms \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore, the term \u201couter\u201d may be used to refer to a surface and\/or layer that is farthest away from a substrate.","Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region or object illustrated as a rectangular will, typically, have tapered, rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

A normal patch array antenna, designed with a dielectric material, has about 80% efficiency.

For example, if the patch array antenna, designed on dielectric, is excited with a power of 1 Kilowatt, the antenna radiate 800 watts 200 watts are lost. In contrast, the high power single patch and two-patch antennas constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention, without using dielectric material, have very high efficiency (on the order of 97%.). As such, only 30 watts are lost (due to metal conduction.)

In order to determine the calculated value of the short length (W) for a desired frequency fof 7.2 GHz, the following calculations are made:\n\n0.89\u00d75.82\u00d77.2\n\nThe result is W=0.717 inch, which correlates to the relative measurement for the short length of a patch for a frequency of 7.2 GHz.\n","Similarly, the parameters of the patch are also determinative of the bandwidth and resonant frequency of the antenna. Specifically, the length (L) of the patch is used to determine the bandwidth of the antenna, and the short length (W) is used for the resonant frequency determination. The typical ratio of (L\/W) is about 1.5, in this case, (L\/W)=(1.27\/0.89)=1.427. In addition the two support metal posts on the patch are shorted for the bandwidth enhancement. The bandwidth of the antenna in the invention is more than 3 times compared to the traditional patch antenna designed with dielectric material.","As used in the following claims, the terminology \u201cpatch antenna\u201d is an antenna which uses a patch, for example, a half-wavelength-long patch, and a larger ground plane, for which radiation is produced by the \u201cradiating slots\u201d at top and bottom, or equivalently as a result of the current flowing on the patch and the ground plane. As used herein, the terminology RF means radiofrequency.","Connector  as shown in - may be connected to a high power RF (radio frequency) source. The high power RF source may be greater than 1 Kilowatt in power. Optionally, an outer cover (not shown) may enclose the other elements of system in a manner well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The outer cover may be of metal, plastic, or any other material capable of enclosing the other elements of system. Preferably, outer cover is impervious to the environment. As shown in - an antenna cover  may preferably be made of a doped TEFLON\u00ae composition, e.g. DUROID\u00ae made by the Rogers Corporation.
