{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS","Example","Sample Fabrication, Measurement and Data Analysis"],"p":["The United States Government claims certain rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357 between the U.S. Department of Energy and UChicago Argonne, LLC, representing Argonne National Laboratory.","The present invention relates generally to solar concentrators. More particularly, the present invention relates to systems and methods for improving the efficiency of luminescent solar concentrators.","The modernization and urbanization of developing countries places an increasing demand on supplies of fossil fuels and the use of such fuels places an increasing burden on the environment. As market demand drives fuel prices upward and as increased consumption accelerates environmental pollution, alternative energy sources become more economically feasible and socially popular. Among the various alternative energy sources, solar energy is one of the most promising due to the endless supply of free energy from the sun. One method of harnessing the sun's energy is through optical solar concentration.","Solar concentration is used in combination with traditional photovoltaic cells to reduce the area of cells necessary to generate a given amount of electrical energy. In particular, sunlight shining on a solar concentrator is optically concentrated and transmitted to a solar cell. Through optical concentration, or geometric gain, a smaller photovoltaic cell can be used to generate a given amount of electrical energy. By reducing the photovoltaic cell area necessary to generate a given amount of electrical energy, optical concentration reduces the cost of energy production.","There are two distinct approaches to solar concentration. One approach uses lenses or mirrors and tracks the sun throughout the day. This tracking approach can produce very high concentration (e.g. greater than 500 suns) but requires tracking to within 0.1 degree and, therefore, is expensive and susceptible to tracking errors that may reduce performance. Another approach does not track the sun. One example of this non-tracking approach uses fixed lenses and mirrors, which produces relatively low concentration (e.g. less than 5 suns). Another example is the luminescent solar concentrator (LSC).","Optical solar concentration provides a realistic, near-term prospect for leveraging the cost and expanding the generation capacity of today's established solar cell technologies. The maximum concentration ratio (CR) obtainable using linear geometric optical systems involving lenses, mirrors, or diffractive optics, is fundamentally limited by the acceptance angle (\u03b8) of the system and the refractive index (n) at its output aperture through the well-known sine law, CR\u2266(n\/sin \u03b8). Maintaining high concentration (CR>100) throughout the day thus demands that these concentrators track the sun with high precision, which drives up both capital and maintenance costs of the overall system.","LSCs were developed in the 1970s and have a high fundamental concentration (e.g. greater than 100 suns). LSCs were introduced as an alternative, non-tracking approach that preserves, at least in principle, the potential for high concentration. However, technical issues have limited the utility of LSCs to date. LSCs provide a simple means to concentrate sunlight without tracking the sun. These devices operate by absorbing light and then re-emitting it at lower frequency, typically into the confined modes of a transparent slab, where it is transported toward photovoltaic cells attached to the edges. In the thermodynamic limit, concentration ratio exceeding the equivalent of 100 suns is possible, however, in actual LSCs, optical propagation loss due mostly to reabsorption limits the concentration ratio to approximately 10.","In contrast to their \u2018passive\u2019 geometric optical counterparts, LSCs actively shift the optical frequency by absorbing sunlight and re-emitting it with a finite Stoke's shift into the confined optical modes of, e.g. a transparent slab, where it is trapped by total internal reflection and absorbed by photovoltaic cells attached to the edges. The limiting concentration ratio for an LSC follows from thermodynamic considerations and is exponential in the Stoke's shift according to CR\u2248(e\/e)exp [(e\u2212e)\/kT], where eand eare the absorbed and emitted photon energies, respectively. This theoretical maximum exceeds the equivalent of 100 suns for most emitters employed in LSCs to date, yet the value realized in practice is more than an order of magnitude lower, typically in the range 2<CR<10, which remains too low to provide any economic benefit in reducing the cost of photovoltaic power. The following provides a new approach to LSC optical design that enables a doubling or more in CR for any type of emitter, thereby improving the prospect of low-cost, high-performance luminescent concentration.","Various embodiments of the present invention comprise an all-optical system and method to overcome LSC problems by \u2018resonance-shifting\u2019, in which sharply directed emission from a bi-layer cavity into the glass substrate returns to interact with the cavity off-resonance at each subsequent bounce, significantly reducing reabsorption loss en route to the edges. Near-lossless propagation is demonstrated for several different chromophores that ultimately enables a more than two-fold increase in concentration ratio over that of the corresponding conventional LSC.","In one embodiment, a luminescent solar concentrator is provided, comprising a transparent substrate, a luminescent film having a variable thickness, and a low refractive index layer disposed between the transparent substrate and the luminescent film. In another embodiment, a method for increasing the efficiency of a luminescent solar concentrator is provided. In this embodiment, the efficiency is increased by providing a low refractive index layer to a surface of the transparent substrate and providing a luminescent film of laterally varying thickness to a surface of the a low refractive index layer, such that the low refractive index layer is disposed between the transparent substrate and the luminescent film. In another embodiment, a method of directing light is provided. In this embodiment, light is directed by absorbing a light at a first location in a luminescent film, emitting the light through a low refractive index layer into a transparent substrate, the emitted light evanescently coupled into the transparent substrate, reflecting the light from a bottom boundary of the transparent substrate, and reflecting the light from a second location in the luminescent film laterally displaced from the first location, wherein the light exhibits non-resonant near-unity reflectivity.","These and other features of the invention, together with the organization and manner of operation thereof, will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like elements have like numerals throughout the several drawings described below.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and made part of this disclosure.","Concentration ratio is defined as the ratio of output to input radiant flux, and in the case of LSCs , it is factored according to CR=G\u03b7, where the geometric gain G=A\/Ais the ratio of output to input aperture areas and \u03b7=P\/Pis the efficiency of power transfer from sunlight incident on the concentrator (Pin) to that of the luminescence at its output (Pout). The optical efficiency is often approximated as a product, \u03b7\u2248\u03b7\u03b7\u03b7\u03b7(G), which depends on the absorbed fraction of the solar spectrum (\u03b7abs), the fractional photon energy loss in down-conversion (\u03b7Stokes), and the probability of re-emission into confined modes (\u03b7em). The final factor, \u03b7prop, accounts for all propagation-related losses due to reabsorption and scattering and hence, in contrast to the other losses, is a naturally decreasing function of G. It is this functional dependence that is ultimately responsible for the low CR achieved in practice since, if \u03b7prop were constant, G could simply be increased to compensate for the other losses.","The falloff of \u03b7prop with increasing G is predominantly due to self-absorption by the luminescent material, in which emitted photons are reabsorbed by the tail of the absorption spectrum and then subsequently lost due to non-radiative decay or secondary re-emission out of the waveguide. One strategy for combating this problem is to minimize the overlap between absorption and emission spectra by increasing the Stoke's shift, either via cascaded energy transfer or the use of emitters with intrinsically large shifts, such as rare-earth ions and phosphorescent organic molecules. This approach has recently shown great promise for LSCs  based on organic thin films, however, it is not easily applicable to other emitters such as colloidal quantum dots due to their large self-absorption overlap, and more fundamentally, it does not improve CR relative to the thermodynamic limit since CRlim also grows with increasing Stoke's shift, as noted above. Alternatively, wavelength-selective filters have been used to reduce out-coupling of photons re-emitted within the critical angle, but this can adversely affect the in-coupling of direct and diffuse sunlight at wide angles and it ultimately does not resolve the non-radiative component of reabsorption loss.","Resonance-shifting addresses the reabsorption problem differently in that it relies on emission from optical resonances that change with position across the concentrator, such that subsequent interactions with the emissive region are non-resonant with greatly diminished reabsorption. illustrates a simple implementation of this concept, in which a thin film of the luminescent material, typically a micron or less in thickness, d, is separated from a glass or other transparent substrate  by a layer with low refractive index (here nlow\u02dc1.14, though can range from about 1.1 to about 1.2) and thickness, d. This structure constitutes an evanescently coupled bi-layer cavity, in which slab waveguide modes supported by the emissive thin-film become leaky (into the substrate  of similar refractive index) when the low refractive index (low-n) layer thickness is on the order of half the emitted wavelength. Emission into these modes is favored on account of their increased photonic density of states and hence a large fraction (typically 60-90%) of the thin-film photoluminescence can be coupled into the glass substrate  at sharply defined angles (see ) corresponding to each discrete mode.","These modes, by nature, cannot propagate in air and hence the directional emission undergoes total internal reflection at the opposing glass\/air interface and returns to the emitter\/low-n bi-layer laterally displaced by roughly twice the substrate  thickness. If the waveguide thickness (e.g. the luminescent film ) were to remain unchanged from the original emitting position, the emitted light would be resonantly coupled back into the slab waveguide and reabsorption would be intensified. However, if the original emission returns to find a different waveguide thickness, then it will be non-resonant with the new cavity modes and the reflectivity, R, may consequently approach unity. Since no light is transmitted under conditions of total internal reflection, reabsorption loss, given by the balance 1-R, is drastically reduced.","From a physical standpoint, the decrease in reabsorption is due to reduced overlap of the optical field intensity profile (|E|2) with the luminescent film , as illustrated in . Off resonance, the optical fields decay evanescently from the glass substrate  through the lossless low-n layer such that only the tail of the intensity profile samples the luminescent film . By contrast, the intensity overlap, and hence reabsorption, is much larger in conventional thin-film LSCs  (e.g. luminescent film  on a glass substrate ) since the optical fields do not decay before reaching the emissive layer. This point is further illustrated below through calculation of the field profiles (equations 1-4).","The scheme shown in  works bi-directionally, that is, emission from the left-hand side is non-resonant on the right-hand side and vice versa. It is also broadband since the dispersion of each mode ensures that its propagation constant (i.e. resonant angle) changes with wavelength. Hence, light at each emission wavelength couples into the substrate  at its own unique set of angles and then propagates independently through the concentrator; in short, different wavelengths are not subject to the resonances of one another.","The goal in designing a resonance-shifting luminescent concentrator (RSLSC) is thus to vary the thickness of the luminescent film  across the surface of the concentrator such that resonant emission from any given location does not re-encounter that same resonance in reflectivity elsewhere before reaching the RSLSC edges. The required thickness variation \u2014typically a few tens of nanometers over a lateral distance of approximately twice the substrate  thickness (i.e. the return length between bounces)\u2014is determined by the resonance width, which in turn depends on modal coupling to the substrate  through dlow as well as the extinction coefficient of the emissive layer.","The RSLSC strategy was tested for three different luminescent materials, namely, the green-emitting polymer poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) and two perylene-based Lumogen F-series dyes (denoted here as L170 and L305) that are commercially available from BASF Corporation and are routinely used in LSCs . presents the thin-film absorption and emission spectra of each material, which feature varying degrees of self-absorption overlap and photoluminescent quantum yields, measured in an integrating sphere, that range from \u03c6PL=0.75\u00b10.04 for F8BT to 0.44\u00b10.03 and 0.03\u00b10.01 for L170 and L305, respectively. \u03c6PL is near unity for the Lumogen dyes dispersed in a host matrix, however, testing capabilities were restricted to thermal evaporation of neat films where the luminescence is self-quenched. Nevertheless, this collection of emitters, together with both standard borosilicate and high-index SF10 glass substrates , provides a broad test-bed from which to assess the effectiveness of the RSLSC approach. As explained in further detail below, while these three emitters have been tested, other emitters, such as colloidal quantum dots and organic dyes used in conventional luminescent concentrators, may be used to achieve similar results.","The angular emission pattern of an F8BT\/low-n bi-layer, fabricated as previously by spin-coating on a glass microscope slide (1 mm thick) and out-coupled using a hemispherical prism, is shown in by the plot with bowtie symbols. The cavity exhibits highly directional emission, visible as rings by eye () that consist of two dominant peaks at angles (in glass) of \u03b8\u02dc49\u00b0 and \u03b8\u02dc72\u00b0 that correspond to transverse electric and magnetic TE1 and TM0 modes, respectively. The angularly directed emission of F8BT cavities is easily seen by eye when out-coupled with a hemispherical prism as shown in . A photograph showing the typical emission ring pattern observed from an F8BT cavity is shown in , where the color change from the inner to outer edge of each ring reflects the modal dispersion in the waveguide.","The transverse electric and magnetic TE1 and TM0 modes are also evident in the prism-coupled angular reflectivity spectra (, plots with circles and plots with squares, right-hand axis), where the small mismatch in mode position between emission and reflectivity is due to dispersion since they are measured at slightly different wavelengths, with reflectivity recorded at \u03bb=543 nm and emission collected through a \u03bb=550 nm bandpass filter (\u0394\u03bb=10 nm). As shown by the solid lines, both emission and reflectivity data are well-reproduced by standard transfer matrix models, with optical constant inputs and dem=267\u00b13 nm and dlow=230\u00b18 nm determined from spectroscopic ellipsometry.","In contrast to the \u2018bare\u2019 F8BT cavity, the emission pattern denoted by \u201cx\u201d symbols in has been shifted to higher angle by thermally evaporating 30 nm of the organic semiconductor tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq3) onto the F8BT surface. The Alq3 layer is transparent to the \u03bb=473 nm excitation wavelength and has a similar refractive index to F8BT, thus it serves only to increase the cavity phase and shift the emission peaks away from the bare cavity reflectivity resonances as shown by the dashed arrows. A closer examination of the reflectivity fitting (provided below) shows that loss due to reabsorption (e.g. 1\u2212R) in the off-resonance locations averages over an order of magnitude less than it would be for conventional LSCs  (e.g. dlow=0 nm) with the same F8BT film.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":"a","b":["20","12","1","2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"b ","b":["20","12"]},"Combining the IQE data of both RS+ and RS\u2212 enables the resonance-shifted propagation loss to be deconvolved from the changes in substrate-coupled emission quantum yield that accompany the variation  in cavity thickness and thus calculate a single, \u2018average\u2019 propagation efficiency, \u03b7prop(x), which is further explained below. According to the right-hand scale of , after propagating 25 mm, emission in the LSC  control is reduced to \u02dc85% of its initial intensity, whereas in the resonance-shifted case, it recovers to near 100%, illustrating the capability for low loss propagation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["c ","b"],"b":"20"},"Although F8BT provides a qualitatively useful visual demonstration, a more in-depth analysis is complicated by the natural, uncontrolled thickness variation  inherent in the spin-coated films.

This indicates a significant change in the yield of substrate-coupled emission between the two cavity thicknesses, with the dem=150 nm cavity emitting more efficiently into the glass than the dem=180 nm cavity. This change is more significant than for F8BT in primarily because the resonance shift in the L305 cavity is accompanied by the onset\/disappearance of an available TE0 mode over a large portion of the L305 photoluminescence spectrum. Nevertheless, when propagation efficiency is deconvolved from the changes in emission quantum yield, the resonance-shifted stripe recovers to 96% of its starting value, whereas the control LSC  drops to 78% (, right-hand axis), representing an approximately 5-fold reduction in loss.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIGS. 4"],"i":["b ","a ","b ","a ","b"],"b":["10","4","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIGS. 4","FIGS. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIGS. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["c ","d ","a ","b","b ","a","a ","c ","a"],"b":["4","4","4","10","12"]},"These results demonstrate the potential of resonance-shifting to reduce propagation loss, but whether this can ultimately be harnessed to net benefit in an actual RSLSC consisting of many such shifts is most directly addressed by measurement under operating conditions. This is shown schematically in , where a fully patterned RSLSC is illuminated uniformly over an increasingly larger area, which corresponds directly to increasing the geometric gain G=x\/t, where t is the substrate  thickness. The RSLSCs are patterned with a repeating 6-level stair step pattern, with step widths and heights of 2 mm and 30 nm, respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["b ","c","d "],"b":["10","20","10","10","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"i":["a ","c ","d ","d","b "],"b":["4","10"]},"For certain embodiments, the stair step thickness variation  used in  may not be the optimum way to pattern an RSLSC. As emission from each resonance has a different return-length to the luminescent film  depending on its emission angle and the substrate  thickness, RSLSCs present a complex optimization challenge that will likely require ray tracing in combination with thin-film optical modeling to determine the emission pattern, efficiency, and reflectivity at each point on the surface, for each wavelength in the emission spectrum. The goal is to determine how best to pattern lateral variation  in the luminescent film  thickness to maximize the non-resonant path length of emission from each point to the collecting edge(s) subject to a finite number of available resonances, since emission originating from, e.g. a TE1 mode that encounters a TE2 reflectivity resonance at the same angle will experience loss.","The number of non-overlapping resonances is determined by the angular width of each, which in turn depends on the low-n layer thickness as well as the extinction coefficient of the luminescent film . The resonances cannot be made arbitrarily narrow since the associated increase in cavity Q-factor leads to more initial reabsorption loss, reducing the quantum yield of emission into the substrate . The substrate-coupled quantum yield of the cavity structure thus depends on dlow. It can usually be made comparable to or greater than that of the corresponding non-cavity, though in general, the optimum low-n layer thickness decreases as the substrate  refractive index increases. In , all of the cavities share dlow=230 nm, and hence the power ratios for the SF10-based cavities are lower than their glass counterparts.","Resonance-shifting is most effective for thin luminescent films , less than \u02dc1 \u03bcm thick that support only one or two modes of each polarization, since highly multimode films make it difficult to avoid overlapping resonances. Dense, strongly absorbing films of organic chromophores or colloidal quantum dots with absorption lengths of a few hundred nanometers are thus well suited for this approach. Although quenched in neat film here, the photoluminescent quantum yield of the Lumogen dyes can be greatly increased by doping into a host matrix, though it should be noted that similar red perylene dyes exhibiting high quantum yield in neat film have also been developed. Colloidal quantum dots, in many respects ideal for use in LSCs  due to their broad absorption and tunable emission, may especially benefit from the resonance-shifting approach, as their use to date has been particularly hampered by high reabsorption losses.","Ultimately, RSLSCs retain the potential for low-cost fabrication, taking advantage of solution processable low-index and luminescent layers  as well as additive stamp-transfer processes to pattern the thickness variation  in a roll-to-roll fashion. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the present invention need not be limited by the mechanism utilized to achieve resonance shifting and other ways of achieving resonance-shifting are contemplated. For example, the luminescent film  thickness need not be varied at all if a substrate  with a shallow, slowly varying lower surface profile are used (e.g. reflecting light back at slightly different angles), though this could lead to unacceptable out-coupling loss from rays returned below the critical angle. Another way to achieve resonance-shifting is to laterally vary the refractive index gradient in the substrate . Still another way to achieve resonance-shifting is to use a curved substrate  (e.g. a glass plate deformed into a demisphere, parabloid, or the like), with a luminescent thin film  disposed on one side. One skilled in the art will appreciate that other mechanisms for achieving resonance shifting may be employed without deviating form the spirit of this disclosure.","Borosilicate glass microscope slides (60 mm\u00d725.4 mm\u00d71 mm, Fischer) and polished pieces of SF10 glass (58 mm\u00d725.4 mm\u00d71.15 mm, VPG optical glass) were used as substrates . Low refractive index layers were fabricated using the sacrificial porogen method as detailed previously, which produces uniform optical quality films with RMS surface roughness<2 nm and a nearly dispersionless refractive index of nlow\u02dc1.14. Films of F8BT were first spin-coated from p-xylene on a water-soluble sacrificial layer and then float-transferred onto the nanoporous low index spacer layer to produce a well-defined interface. The L170 and L305 cavities were produced by thermally evaporating the dyes directly onto the low-n layer. Optical constants and layer thicknesses were determined from global fitting of variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry and normal incidence transmission measurements.","Resonance-shifted stripe regions in the F8BT cavities were produced by thermally evaporating Alq3 through a shadow mask, whereas additional L170 and L305 was deposited in the case of the Lumogen cavities. The stair-step pattern of the full RSLSCs was built up sequentially using the appropriate series of shadow masks and was simultaneously deposited on the LSC  control devices (which have no low-n layer) to maintain comparable absorption to the RSLSCs.","Cavity reflectivities were collected as a function of angle via an equilateral prism index-matched to the back of each substrate  using \u03bb=543 nm and \u03bb=635 nm lasers for the F8BT and Lumogen-based cavities, respectively. Angular emission patterns of the F8BT cavity on glass were obtained exciting at \u03bb=473 nm, out-coupling with an index-matched half-ball lens and detecting with an angular resolution of 0.1 degrees. Both reflectivity and emission signals were chopped at 300 Hz and detected with a Si photodiode  and lock-in amplifier.","Luminescence was detected from the concentrator edge by attaching directly to the surface of a bare, rectangular Si photodiode  (5 mm\u00d725.4 mm, Silonex) with index-matching fluid (n=1.52 for glass, n=1.72 for SF10, Cargille Labs) to prevent any air gaps. The remaining three edges were blackened with ink to minimize edge reflections, which complicate the modeling analysis. Laser excitation (\u03bb=473 nm for F8BT and L170, \u03bb=543 nm for L305) was chopped at 300 Hz and directed onto the cavity surface approximately 5 degrees from normal incidence. The focal point (\u02dc200 \u03bcm diameter) was scanned as a function of position, x, along the middle of each sample while synchronously collecting the edge luminescence, transmitted, and reflected beam intensities at each point. The optical internal quantum efficiency was calculated using these data and then corrected for the solid angle change multiplying by \u03c0\/2 tan(w\/2x) as previously, where w is the length of the edge with the attached photodiode . This correction is not valid for small x on the order of the 1 mm substrate  thickness and hence the propagation efficiency, \u03b7(x), was estimated relative to the point x=5 mm through the relationship IQE(x)=\u03b7\u03b7(x) for the LSC  control, since the emission quantum yield, \u03b7em, is constant throughout. The emission quantum yield is not constant crossing over the resonance-shifted stripe region of the cavities and so in this case the propagation efficiency is derived by geometrically averaging the complementary cavity data to deconvolve changes in \u03b7em according to the following:\n\n\u221a{square root over (()())}{square root over (()())}=\u03b7()\u221a{square root over (\u03b7\u03b7)}\n","Edge-emission spectra were collected through the port of an integrating sphere that was fiber-coupled to a cooled Si CCD spectrograph.","Broad area illumination with an intensity of approximately 30 mW\/cm2, chopped at 300 Hz and incident normal to the sample, was provided by a quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp homogenized using a tapered light pipe to achieve spatial uniformity with <1% r.m.s. intensity variation. The photodiode  was attached and the other edges blackened as above, with a small cover used to prevent direct illumination of the photodiode . The lamp output was subsequently shortpass filtered below \u03bb=500 nm to minimize noise from scattered near-infrared light not absorbed by the luminescent film layers , and testing of blank samples (e.g. plain glass) ensured that stray light remained negligible in comparison to the luminescence signal.","Anisotropic transfer matrix modeling was used to fit the angular reflectivity data for the F8BT cavities since these films are uniaxial, with ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices no=1.70 and ne=1.65, and isotropic extinction k=1.5\u00d710\u22124 at \u03bb=543 nm as previously. The model fits for the F8BT cavity in are reproduced in (TE polarization) and (TM polarization), excluding prism-coupling reflections to show the true internal reflectivity of the cavity. The plots with circles denote reflectivity of the F8BT cavity and the plots with squares show reflectivity of the F8BT control, where the same film lies directly on the glass substrate . Deviation from unity indicates reabsorption since no light is transmitted beyond the critical angle (\u02dc42\u00b0). It is clear that loss is much lower for non-resonant cavity angles than it is across all angles for the film on glass.","Dashed arrows in and indicate the peak position of emission from the resonance-shifted stripe in . At these angles, emission is subject to 6- and 12-fold reductions in reabsorption at each reflection as compared to the control film for TE and TM polarizations respectively. and show the intensity profiles (|Ey|2 for TE and |Hy|2 for TM polarizations) that correspond to these particular angles, demonstrating the suppression of fields in the F8BT film that occurs off resonance. Averaged over all non-resonant angles, reabsorption loss for the cavity is a factor of 38\u00d7 and 15\u00d7 lower than the control film for TE and TM polarized emission, respectively.","Global fits of variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry and normal incidence transmission data are used to extract the optical constants of each film for modeling. Since this procedure is not sensitive to the weak extinction present below the absorption edge of each material, extinction coefficients determined from the resonant reflectivity fitting (\u03bb=543 nm for F8BT, \u03bb=635 nm for L170 and L305) are used as data points to fix the magnitude at these wavelengths and then extrapolate the functional decay determined by ellipsometry.","Total dipolar radiated and dissipated (into the lossy luminescent film ) power, was calculated for the cavities numerically using the method of source terms, assuming randomly oriented dipoles distributed throughout the emissive layer and excited in proportion to the amount of incident light absorbed at each position. From this the total power is obtained for each polarization emitted into the substrate  as a function of angle for each wavelength in the emission spectrum, normalized to the calculated substrate-coupled emission quantum yield:\n\n\u03b7(\u03bb)=2\u03c0\u222b[(\u03b8,\u03bb)+(\u03b8,\u03bb)] sin(\u03b8)\u2003\u2003[Equation 1]\n","where \u03b8 is the angle in the substrate  and ITE and ITM are the TE and TM polarized power patterns, respectively.

Secondary re-emission events (e.g. emission following reabsorption) are neglected and light scattered from the other edges are not accounted for since this is minimized by edge blackening in our experiments. Further integration of Equation 3 over x and y gives the edge-intensity under area illumination. Symmetry considerations and the appropriate change of variables in Equation 3 enable the calculation of light from all edges.","The simulation of ideally patterned RSLSCs in  assumes that emission from a given point never re-encounters its own reflectivity resonance. As the optimum pattern is not yet known, this condition is artificially enforced in the simulation by ensuring that the layer thickness for each emitting point is always different than the rest of the structure (i.e. if light is emitted from a point with layer thickness dem, then the rest of the surface has layer thickness dem+30 nm).","The foregoing description of embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
