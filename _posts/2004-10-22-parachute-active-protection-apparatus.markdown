title: Parachute active protection apparatus
abstract: An apparatus for protecting an object from an incoming munition includes a tracking apparatus mounted on the object, for tracking the incoming munition; a firing solution computer connected to the tracking apparatus; a plurality of launch tubes mounted on the object, the plurality of launch tubes pointing in different directions so as to maximize coverage of an area surrounding the object; a parachute container attached to each launch tube; an igniter disposed in a rear of each launch tube and connected to the firing solution computer; a propelling charge disposed in front of each igniter; a mass disposed in front of each propelling charge; a connecting ring attached to a front of each mass; a parachute disposed in the parachute container; and a cable connecting the connecting ring and the parachute.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims benefit under 35 USC 199(e) of provisional application 60\/521,453, filed Apr. 28, 2004, the entire file wrapper contents of which provisional application are herein incorporated by reference as though fully set forth at length.","The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to countermeasures for rocket propelled grenades (RPG).","Rocket propelled grenades, used by enemy forces, pose a serious threat to U.S. military vehicles and personnel. Heavily armored vehicles, such as the Abrams tank and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, are equipped with advanced armors to defeat the RPG's shaped charge warhead. Most other military vehicles, however, cannot survive a direct hit from an RPG.","An existing approach to defeating RPG's approaching these other vehicles requires adding bulky special armor packages to the exterior of the vehicle. This additional armor is heavy and voluminous and consequently limits the transportability and maneuverability of the protected vehicle. Also, such armor engages the incoming RPG very close to the exterior of the vehicle where the RPG may still cause significant damage to the vehicle, its' occupants, and adjacent personnel.","Another existing approach to defeating incoming RPG's involves the use of an active protection system (APS) with explosive counter munitions. The main disadvantages of such a system are the precise timing required for achieving a successful intercept, and the possibility of the explosive counter munitions causing damage to the protected vehicle and personnel. The present invention provides a simple countermeasure to defeat incoming RPG's that overcomes the drawbacks of existing systems.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","A purpose of the present invention is to damage, disturb or cause premature detonation of an incoming RPG by deploying a parachute into its flight path. An array of launchers (similar to the M6 discharger found on U.S. combat vehicles), pointing in different directions, are affixed to an object to be protected. The object to be protected may be a vehicle or a stationary structure such as a building. The invention uses a known apparatus for tracking the incoming RPG. Such apparatus are capable of tracking incoming projectiles using radar and determining the incoming projectile's velocity and flight path direction. This information is then used by a firing solution computer to calculate the optimum time to launch the countermeasure and to determine from which tube it should be launched.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","12","12","12","14","14","14","16","16","10","10","16","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A\u2013F","b":["16","16","20","22","24","20","24","14","26","20","28","30","18","30","18","16","32","28","20","32","30"]},"When an incoming munition such as an RPG is detected by the tracking apparatus , the firing solution computer  determines the time of launch and the particular launch tube  and sends a firing signal to the igniter  of the appropriate launch tube . The igniter  initiates the propelling charge . As the propelling charge  burns, expanding gases  () that are sealed behind the obturator  push the mass  up the tube . The mass  continually accelerates in the direction of the arrow V until the obturator  exits the end of the tube . Soon after the mass  exits the tube , the cable  will be pulled taut. As the force acting on the cable  increases, the parachute  will be pulled from its storage container .","Simultaneously, the resultant force acting on the connecting ring  will cause the mass  to rapidly rotate as shown by the arrow w in  until the connecting ring  is facing rearward. As the mass  continues to fly forward, the parachute lines  and canopy  will be pulled from the storage container . Within a short period of time the parachute  will be fully inflated and flying directly towards the incoming RPG . The parachute  will remain inflated for a long time relative to the incoming projectile's  remaining flight time to impact, thereby alleviating the need for precise timing and fuzing systems. There are several mechanisms by which the collision between the parachute  and RPG  will render the RPG  less effective.","A significant amount of the momentum of the parachute  and mass  (which is similar to the momentum of the incoming RPG ) will be transferred to the RPG , thereby slowing it and possibly causing it to miss the intended target. Secondly, the collision will cause damage to the RPG  such as breaking fins or crushing the nose cone. Damage to the fins and disturbance upon impact will cause the RPG angle of attack to grow, thereby greatly reducing its terminal effectiveness. Crushing the nose cone can short the RPG fuzing system, rendering the warhead inoperable. The collision between the parachute  and RPG  will take place well away from the protected vehicle . If the collision causes the warhead to detonate prematurely it is much less likely to hit or damage the protected vehicle .","While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A\u2013F"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
