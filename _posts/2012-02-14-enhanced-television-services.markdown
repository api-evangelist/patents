title: Enhanced television services
abstract: A method and system to permit TV viewers to interact with program content broadcast over a subscriber network, such as cable, satellite, internet, or cellular telephone. The details of the ability for the viewer to interact is embedded as data in the program signal. The subscription provider broadcasts a visual indicator as a small icon during programming that informs the viewer that interaction is permitted. The viewer then uses a remote control to purchase products, vote on events, respond to polls, download files, request information, and request callback actions. The TV viewer uses the remote control to send information to a set-top box front-end application, and to iteratively create transactions that are batched and then sent to a back-end core application and database which then handles fulfillment.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The Present Application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/552,235, filed on Sep. 1, 2009 (\u201cthe Parent Application\u201d). The Parent Application is the non-provisional counterpart to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/093,713 filed on Sep. 2, 2008, entitled ENHANCED TELEVISION SERVICES. The Parent Application is also a non-provisional counterpart to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/144,772 filed on Jan. 15, 2009, entitled ENHANCED TELEVISION SERVICES\u2014BACK END CORE SOFTWARE. The Parent Application claims the benefit of and priority to both provisional applications, namely U.S. 61\/093,713 and U.S. 61\/144,772, which, along with the Parent Application, are incorporated by reference into this Present Application in their entirety.","Historically, television technology developed so as to mirror radio technology. Television was broadcast via electromagnetic waves in analog mode. Television pictures were broadcast using amplitude modulation (AM band), and sound was broadcast using frequency modulation (FM band). As with radio, a television viewer had control over three elements:","1. on-off control,","2. channel control, and","3. volume control.","During the early 1970's, infrared remote controls were introduced to control these same elements on television sets. Until that time, television broadcasting was limited by relatively low bandwidth. The number of channels and controls were limited by bandwidth. Establishment of new television stations were limited by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The problem was somewhat alleviated by introduction of ultra-high frequency (UHF) broadcast capability. However, UHF channels never achieved much popularity. Cable television service provided television transmission with increased bandwidth. Suddenly, television viewers were able to access a large multitude of channels. Some television stations broadcasted their programming exclusively for cable, while others simulcast their programs both over the airwaves (electromagnetic) and over cable. Other than the increased number of channels, the main discernible difference between \u201ccable TV\u201d and \u201cbroadcast TV\u201d was that viewers had to pay for cable service while broadcast TV remained essentially free. Cable providers provided their users with a \u201ccable box\u201d to enable tuning control. Cable-ready television sets were developed to enable users to plug the cable directly into their sets.","Without a list of what programs were playing on what channels at a given time, viewers would have to \u201cchannel surf\u201d until they found programs that they wanted to watch. Cable service providers began to transmit a program \u201cguide\u201d that was accessed from the remote control. Previously, viewers used newspaper listings and magazine type guides to help with their programming selection. Now, a viewer could use the remote control to select and switch to a channel based upon a desired program. So, the number of control elements were increased.","Next, the cable service providers introduced \u201cPay Per View\u201d programming. Here, not only could a viewer select a special program for viewing at a specific time, but they could also approve (e.g., by pressing the OK button) or not approve (e.g., by pressing the EXIT button) the charges associated with viewing the selected program. With the introduction of digital (as opposed to analog) transmission to cable broadcasting, parents could block channels or specific programs that they did not want their children to watch. On-Demand programming provided viewers with new options that would enable them to watch special programs whenever they wanted. Finally, DVR afforded viewers with the ability to record programs, to time-shift viewing, to pause live TV, and to rewind and move forward through recorded programs and live TV.","All of these new features required the introduction of television remote control units having many more controls than the traditional on-off, volume, and channel controls. Not only are remote controls themselves more sophisticated, but many new television sets may only be controlled using remote controls. These new sets no longer have external controls. Even the brightness, contrast, color, and hue settings are now controlled remotely. Viewers can use their remote controls to control television settings separately form cable settings. They can also use their remote controls to control peripheral devices such as VCR's, DVD's, CD players, etc. With the availability of high-speed internet service over cable television lines, keyboards are often connected to television sets for access to the internet. In some hotels, television viewers can pay their lodging bill by using the remote control. Into the television provider mix also came local telephone companies and satellite broadcasters. These providers advertise even greater increases in bandwidth and possibly more services. So, control over television viewing has become quite sophisticated.","Nevertheless, television viewing essentially remains as a passive activity. Viewers still only turn their sets on or off, control the volume, and select what they want to watch either now or in the future. Cable providers are able to determine what programs are being watched by their viewers. But, viewers cannot actively communicate with cable providers or broadcasters while watching television.","Interactive television is very attractive to cable service providers. Cable companies are in the process of adopting the \u201cEnhanced TV Binary Interchange Format\u201d (EBIF) and the \u201cOpen Cable Application Platform\u201d (OCAP). EBIF is a multimedia content format defined by a specification developed under the \u201cOpenCable\u201d project of CableLabs (Cable Television Laboratories, Inc.). The primary purpose of EBIF is to present to a television viewer one or more multimedia pages, similar to web pages, but specialized for use within an enhanced television or an interactive television system. Action sequences are executed as a result of firing certain predefined events, such as a page load event, a key press event, a click event, etc. These events are triggered by the viewer using the remote control. Execution of all events are serialized and controlled by event handlers. On the other hand, OCAP, is an operating system layer designed for consumer electronics that connects to a television system Unlike operating systems on a personal computer, the cable company controls what OCAP programs run on the consumer's set. Also designed by CableLabs for the cable networks of North America, OCAP programs are intended for interactive services such as eCommerce, online banking, Electronic program guides, and digital video recording. The OCAP standard has not yet been approved by the FCC.","A Multiple System Operator (MSO) is an operator of multiple cable television systems. A cable system in the US, by FCC definition, is a facility serving a single community or a distinct governmental entity, each with its own franchise agreement with the cable company. Though in the strictest sense any cable company that serves multiple communities is thus an MSO, the term today is usually reserved for companies that own a very large number of cable systems.","A number of systems currently exist to purchase items associated with content broadcast over television. An intuitive mechanism for accomplishing such a task would be to have a website associated with a television program. The TV viewer would have a computer alongside the television set. The TV viewer accesses the broadcast content and the website concurrently. Interaction with the broadcast content occurs over the internet on the computer. One such implementation is employed by http:\/\/www.shopnbc.com. This corresponds to an NBC network cable channel, shopNBC. This channel is a home shopping channel where viewers can purchase products that they see on television. However, instead of calling a telephone number to make their purchases, viewers purchase the products over the World Wide Web. A web application exists on the website that allows viewers to watch the programming streaming on their computers, thereby eliminating the necessity of having a separate television set alongside the computer. This application exists for the shopNBC channel only, and viewers cannot switch to watching other channels.","US Patent Application Publication No. 2006\/0031285 to Ruhnke, et. al. teaches an audio and video On Demand type application along with the business functions required therefore. On Demand programming is not truly interactive. While a TV viewer may use a remote control to access the content, that does not happen interactively with broadcast content. On the other hand, US Patent Application Publication No. 2009\/10018898 to Genen, teaches a method of interactively accessing music and other media associated with broadcast content using a remote control. However, there is no back end application associated with this application to provide for fulfillment. The website http:\/\/ensequence.com provides synchronized interactivity using a remote control. This application permits a TV viewer to purchase products, vote, receive targeted offers, access sports specifications. It also permits children and teenagers to participate in the activities programmed into the broadcast content. However, this application also lacks a back end to provide for fulfillment.","The Present Invention provides a way to cater to an untapped market through an innovative suite of products and services bundled as Enhanced Television Service (ETS). ETS functions both on an EBIF and OCAP platform. The Present Invention delivers a host of interactive functions specifically tailored to the broadcast program or commercials. The enhanced and empowered media is then transmitted to the MSO in any one of the many available formats for eventual transmission to the viewer. Invisible and unobtrusive until invoked by the viewer's existing remote control, the enhanced media suddenly reveals a wealth of onscreen information and choices. With no additional equipment installation or modification, the standard cable television remote control transforms the once passive viewer into a participant ordering information downloads, voting, responding and making instant purchases. The ETS handles all of these transactions from order processing to billing and fulfillment. By delivering a host of interactive functions, cable television operators empowered with the ETS solution can increase their competitive position while maximizing their networks financial potential. Through an intuitive portal application, advertisers are able to create and manage their own enhanced television events. They control the look, feel and exact moment the trigger is available to the viewer. Advertisers\/Vendors can also upload products for sale or download and associate them with events described above. The portal also provides statistical data on the performance of events in a dashboard like manner. Also through an intuitive web portal subscribers can look at order history, wish lists, download items and purchase promotional products. This web portal resides in the MSO's web portal. Again ETS handles all of these transactions from order processing to billing and fulfillment.","A TV viewer will hereinafter be referred to interchangeably as a subscriber or a viewer. Subscribers can interact with the broadcast program or commercial with the remote control. They can participate in the following transactions using the ETS system:","1\u2014Purchase","By using the remote control, a subscriber can view the products on the panel of the TV and they are able to purchase that product.","2\u2014Polling\/Voting","By using the remote control, a subscriber can vote for a particular event that is shown on the TV.","3\u2014Request\/Download Information","By using the remote control, a subscriber can request any particular information. They can also request an information download of specific software.","4\u2014View Transaction History","By using the remote control, a subscriber can view their past transaction history on the TV panel. These transactions can be a type of confirmed, unconfirmed and wish list items.","The ETS System provides the following features:\n\n","Typically, when viewer interaction is possible, an icon (called an iBug) will appear on the screen (usually in the lower right-hand corner). At that point, the viewer will be able to press a button on the remote control that would bring up a menu that is specific to the currently viewed channel. By contrast, the GUIDE button brings up a universal guide no matter what channel is being viewed.","The Present Invention allows a TV viewer to use a television remote control to interact with programming content broadcast by a subscription service provider such as cable television service, satellite service provided through a receiving antenna, cellular telephone service, and internet. The TV viewer can purchase a product, vote on an event (e.g., for a contestant on American Idol), request information, or download photographs, audio recordings, ring tones, software, games, and software applications\u2014all using the buttons on the remote control.","The Present Invention allows a TV viewer to interact with the broadcast content using a remote control by associating event identification information with the content. The event identification information, in the form of data, is embedded in the content signals. The event identification data associates the content with an ability for the TV viewer to perform interactive tasks associated with the event by using the remote control. The viewer can purchase a DVD of a documentary while it is being broadcast. The viewer can purchase a product associated with the programming. There is no longer a need to dial a toll free number and to provide a credit card to make the purchase. The credit card information for a particular viewer is already on file with the service provider. When a viewer votes during particular programs, some voting is free of charge, and some voting incurs a charge. For example, voting on American Idol is currently performed by sending a text message on a cellular telephone. The user is charged for the text message. American Idol and the telephone service provider share the revenues from text message charges.","After the event identification data becomes associated with the content, at certain periods during the broadcast, a display indicator becomes visible on the screen. For example, the Discovery Channel might have a small circle with the letter \u201cD\u201d circumscribed therein. The display indicator is a signal that the viewer is able to interact with the programming. When the viewer sees the display indicator (and only when the viewer sees it) can be perform the interactive tasks. The viewer interacts with the broadcast content by pressing buttons on the remote control. The keystrokes are then transmitted to the set-top box. In a two-way conversation between the set-top box and the service provider, the keystroke information is sent to the service provider which starts a transaction, the service provider transmits a response back to the set-top box, and the response is displayed to the viewer in an intelligent fashion. A series of two-way communications between the viewer and the service provider collects data to iteratively form a transaction by concatenating all the data together.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Every MSO will have multiple ETS Edge systems that are geographically located on its head ends. In addition to multiple ETS Edges, every MSO will have one ETS Core system that is centrally located within that MSO. The data from multiple ETS Core systems will go to the Data Warehouse on regular basis for persistent storage and reporting purposes.","The ETS Core controls:","1. event management;","2. subscriber management;","3. order management;","4. product management;","5. memory management;","6. inventory management;","7. maintenance;","8. security and identity;","9. monitoring; and","10. reporting.","The ETS Core communicates directly with the Data Warehouse which stores information regarding:","1. event management;","2. product management;","3. maintenance;","4. security and identity;","5. monitoring; and","6. reporting.","Third party vendors and shippers (e.g., Amazon) and payment processors (e.g., PayPal) communicate directly with the ETS Core through an MSO network, as do administrators (Admin) and customer service representatives (CSR).

The customized application (Xlet) that is sitting on the STB will listen to these user interactions. The Xlet application will send the relevant requested data to the ETS Edge system and the ETS Edge will respond back to the Xlet. This transaction data will eventually go from ETS Edge to ETS Core system in real time or near real time basis. The ETS Core system will process the actual transaction. In the same way, when an event is created in the ETS Core system, that event data will be distributed to the relevant ETS Edges. When an ETS Edge receives a request from the TV subscriber, the relevant event data will be sent back to the Xlet in the form of the response.","ETS Edge",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"1.

The transaction data goes from ETS Edge to the ETS Core in real time (Ex: live polling) or near real time (download, request info) basis as per the configuration settings. The back and forth data transmission between ETS Edge and ETS Core is being taken care of by Oracle TimesTen caching mechanism.

Modules hierarchically below 2.1 (for example) would be labeled 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, . . . and so on. So, by looking at the numeric label of any module, one can determine its level of hierarchy. A black triangle located at the corner of the module block indicates that the module is re-used many times either as a subroutine or as an object.","Following the hierarchy chart, each module depicted on that chart receives an IPO chart. The IPO chart is divided into three columns. The leftmost column represents INPUT. The rightmost column represents OUTPUT. The central column represents PROCESS. This is where the various steps in the process are described. Most of the information in the INPUT and OUTPUT columns is graphical (e.g., representing terminals, hard drives, printers, etc.). Most of the information in the PROCESS columns is descriptive text showing the procedural steps. Arrows connect the PROCESS column to the INPUT and OUTPUT columns to show data flow.","Each IPO chart may have an Extended Description showing notes about the various steps in the process. These act almost like footnotes in a document. They are usually too detailed or extraneous to include in the steps denoted in the PROCESS column.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0201","num":"0333"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"1.
