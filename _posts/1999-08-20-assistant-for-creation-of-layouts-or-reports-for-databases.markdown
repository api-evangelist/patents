Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to databases and, more particularly, to visual presentation of information stored in databases.","2. Description of the Related Art","Databases are used to store data in a manner that facilitates subsequent use of the data. A database includes one or more files, each of which contains one or more records. A record holds information about a subject or item in various fields of the record. Often database programs provide a user interface that allows a user to view the data in various ways. For example, the visual representations can include browse mode, layout mode, and preview mode. The browse mode allows records to be viewed, changed, sorted, deleted, or added. The layout mode allows one to define how the information of the database is presented on a computer screen or in printed reports. The preview mode allows one to see on a computer screen how data in records, forms or reports will look when printed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIGS. 1\u20133","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},"Hence, with FileMaker Pro 4.0, the report layout, such as shown in , can be designed by a user or software developer to provide the particular type of report the user or developer desires. The layout mode typically provides various controls or tools that enable the user or software developer to design reports. The form view layout can also be designed in a similar manner. One problem is that it has been difficult for users or developers to create sophisticated reports using the layout mode. These difficulties not only frustrate users and hinder user satisfaction but also make the generation of sophisticated reports overly burdensome. As a consequence, the producer of FileMaker Pro 4.0 has experienced a significant number of technical inquiries from users or software developers pertaining to difficulties regarding use of the layout mode to create sophisticated reports.","Accordingly, there is a need for improved ways to provide layouts for reports.","Broadly speaking, the invention relates to an assistant for the creation of layouts\/reports for databases. A layout for a database is the arrangement of information for the database such as for data entry or screen viewing, and a report (or report format) for a database is the arrangement of information from the database for presentation of the data in a printed document or with on-line viewing. The assistant serves to automate in the creation of the layout\/reports after an interview sequence with a user.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways including, as a method, an apparatus, a computer readable medium, and a computer system. Several embodiments of the invention are discussed below.","As a method for creating a report or layout for data stored in a database, one embodiment of the invention includes the acts of: (a) performing an interview sequence to obtain organization information, the organization information including at least a list of fields and at least one summary field for the report or layout, the at least one summary field being associated with one of the fields in the list of fields; and (b) automatically creating the report or layout based on the interview sequence.","As a method for creating a report layout for data stored in a database, another embodiment of the invention includes the acts of: (a) performing an interview sequence to obtain organization information, the organization information including at least a list of fields and at least one summary field for the report layout, the at least one summary field being associated with one of the fields in the list of fields, the report layout including a plurality of parts including a header area, a grand total area, a summary area, a body area, and a footer area; and (b) automatically creating the report layout based on the interview sequence, said creating includes placing the summary field in at least one of the grand total area and the summary area, and placing the fields in the list of fields in the body area.","As a computer readable medium including computer program code for creating a report layout for data stored in a database, one embodiment of the invention includes: computer program code for performing an interview sequence to obtain organization information, the organization information including at least a list of fields and at least one summary field for the report layout, the at least one summary field being associated with one of the fields in the list of fields, the report layout including a plurality of parts including a header area, a grand total area, a summary area, a body area, and a footer area; and computer program code for creating the report layout based on the interview sequence, the creating of the report layout includes placing the summary field in at least one of the grand total area and the summary area and placing the fields in the list of fields in the body area.","The advantages of the invention are numerous. Different embodiments or implementations may yield one or more of the following advantages. One advantage of the invention is that sophisticated layouts\/reports are able to be created in an automated manner. Another advantage of the invention is that header and footers, styles, sorts, and summary fields can be provided within the layout\/reports. Still another advantage of the invention is that technical service inquiries concerning creation of sophisticated reports can be significantly reduced. Yet another advantage of the invention is that ease of use and user satisfaction are improved.","Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.","The invention relates to an assistant for the creation of layouts\/reports for databases. A layout for a database is the arrangement of information for the database such as for data entry or screen viewing, and a report (or report format) for a database is the arrangement of information from the database for presentation of the data in a printed document or with on-line viewing. The assistant serves to automate in the creation of the layout\/reports after an interview sequence with a user.","The assistant creates layouts or reports. A report is considered in this application to be a more sophisticated, or complex, layout. A report layout is interchangeable with report.","Embodiments of this aspect the invention are discussed below with reference to . However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes as the invention extends beyond these limited embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","402","402","404"]},"Next, an interview sequence of the layout\/report wizard is performed . The interview sequence operates to interview the user of the layout\/report wizard to present the user with various options and selections to be made so as to produce the desired layout or report. , described below, are a series of screen depictions that are associated with a representative example of the interview sequence. During the interview sequence, data is stored to the temporary file and the temporary data structure based on the information obtained from the user during the interview sequence.","After the interview sequence has been performed , the layout\/report can be created . When creating the layout\/report, the layout\/report wizard processing  utilizes the data stored in the temporary file and the temporary data structure. After the layout\/report has been created , the layout\/report is saved . Then, the temporary node and the temporary data structure are deleted . The layout\/report wizard processing  is then complete and ends.","The layout\/report being created can be organized by layout parts which together form the layout\/report. Exemplary layout parts for a layout\/report are provided in Table 1 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"LAYOUT PARTS"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Title Header"]},{"entry":[{},"Header"]},{"entry":[{},"Leading Grand Totals"]},{"entry":[{},"Leading Summaries"]},{"entry":[{},"Body"]},{"entry":[{},"Trailing Summaries"]},{"entry":[{},"Trailing Grand Totals"]},{"entry":[{},"Footer"]},{"entry":[{},"Title Footer"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","500","408"]},"The create layout\/report processing  initially reads  the temporary file. As noted above, the layout\/report wizard processing  creates a temporary file and updates the temporary file in accordance with information obtained from the interview sequence. Similarly, the temporary data structure is created during the layout\/report wizard processing  and the temporary data structure is likewise updated in accordance with information obtained from the interview sequence. After the temporary file has been read , a decision  determines whether a header is needed. When the decision  determines that a header is needed, then the header is created . On the other hand, when the decision  determines that a header is not needed, the creation  of the header is bypassed.","Following the creation  of the header or directly following the decision  when a header is not needed, a decision  determines whether a body is needed. When the decision  determines that a layout\/report being created does not include a body, then the body is not needed and the create layout\/report processing  skips all the processing associated with the body (e.g., blocks \u2013). On the other hand, when the decision  determines that the body is needed, then various operations are performed to create the body and provide various components for the body. In particular, when the decision  determines that the body is needed, the position of fields for the body are determined . Fields are not actually placed within the body at this time, but their positions within the body are determined. The order in which the fields are placed are determined by a specified order for the fields during the interview sequence. For example, in , the user would identify the fields to appear in the layout\/report and their order.","A decision  then determines whether there are any leading grand totals for the layout\/report. When the decision  determines that there are leading grand totals, then the leading grand totals are placed  in the appropriate leading grand totals layout part. When the decision  determines that there are no leading grand totals, the placement  of the leading grand totals is bypassed. Following the placement  of the leading grand totals or directly following the decision , a decision  determines whether there are any leading subsummaries. When the decision  determines that there are leading subsummaries, the leading subsummaries are placed  in the appropriate leading subsummaries layout part. On the other hand, when the decision  determines that there are no leading subsummaries, the placement  of the subsummaries is bypassed.","Following the placement  of the subsummaries or directly following the decision , a decision  determines whether the layout\/report includes the body. When the layout\/report does include a body, then the fields are placed  in the body at appropriate positions. The appropriate positions were determined in block  above. After the fields are placed  in the body, the field names are place  in the header. The field names are placed  in the appropriate locations such that they are associated with the corresponding fields in the body. Typically, a field is placed in a column location of a report, and the field name would then be placed in the same column location typically above the data for the field. When the decision  determines that the layout\/report does not include a body, the placement  of the fields in the body and the placement  of the field names are bypassed.","Following the placement  of the field names or directly following the decision  when the layout\/report does not include a body, a decision  determines if there are any trailing subsummaries. When the decision  determines that there are trailing subsummaries, then trailing subsummaries are placed  in the appropriate trailing subsummaries layout part. When the decision  determines that there are no trailing subsummaries, the placement  of the trailing subsummaries is bypassed.","Following the placement  of the trailing subsummaries or directly following the decision , a decision  determines whether there are any trailing grand totals. When the decision  determines that there are trailing grand totals, then the trailing grand totals are placed  in the appropriate trailing grand totals layout part. Following the placement  of the trailing grand totals or directly following the decision , a decision  determines whether a footer is needed. When the decision  determines that a footer is needed, the footer is created . On the other hand, when the decision  determines that no footers are needed, the creation  of the footers is bypassed.","Following the creation  of the footer or directly following the decision  when the footer is not needed, a decision  determines whether a layout mode or a preview mode has been selected. When the decision  determines that a layout mode has been selected, then the layout\/report is displayed  in a layout mode. Alternatively, when the decision  determines that the preview mode has been selected, the database is sorted  based on the sort order. By sorting the database, the data provided within the report is updated and displayed in its appropriate order. Then, the report can be displayed  in the preview mode. Following blocks  and , the create layout\/report processing  is complete and ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5C","b":["550","550","500","552","550","554","554","556","554","556","550"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 5A and 5B"],"b":["600","600","516","534","500"]},"The grand total processing  begins with a decision  that determines whether a body is present in the layout\/report. When the decision  determines that a body is not present, then the grand total can be placed  at the leftmost position in the grand total area. Typically, at the very leftmost position, there may be break fields for labels, images, or other content. Break fields are associated with categories (see ), and for example, identify the categories to be sort the data on. Hence, the placement  of the grand total at the leftmost position need not be at the very left position of the layout\/report. The grand total is placed  in the grand total area which is a reserved section or part of the layout\/report. If, for example, there is no body part, then the grand total will be placed in the same column location as the same field which was previously placed when the same field was previously placed. The grand total area, for example, is either the leading grand total part or the trailing grand total part. After the placement  of the grand total, the grand total processing  is complete and ends.","Alternatively, when the decision  determines that a body is present in the layout\/report, then a decision  determines whether the grand total to be placed is dependent on a field to be placed (e.g., in the body). When the decision  determines that the grand total is not dependent on a field to be placed, then the grand total processing  places the grand total in accordance with block . On the other hand, when the decision  determines that the grand total to be placed is dependent on a field to be placed, then the grand total is placed  in the grand total area at the same position as the associated previously placed field. For example, if a grand total operates to total the field \u201csales\u201d, and the grand total is paced such that it is aligned (e.g., in the same column) with the sales field which was previously placed. Following block , the grand total processing  is complete and ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 5A and 5B"],"b":["700","700","700","520","530","500"]},"The subsummaries processing  begins with a decision  that determines whether a body (e.g., a body part) is present in the layout\/report. When the decision  determines that the layout\/report does not include a body, then the subsummary (i.e., summary field) is placed  (i) at the same position as a previously placed like subsummary, or (ii) at the next available rightmost position if there is no previously placed like subsummary.","Alternatively, when the decision  determines that the layout\/report does include a body, a decision  determines whether the subsummary (i.e., summary field) is dependent on a previously placed, or to be placed, field in the body. When the decision  determines that the subsummary is dependent on a previously placed, or to be placed, field in the body, then the subsummary is placed  in the subsummaries area (i.e., subsummaries layout part) at the same position as the associated previously placed, or to be placed, field. For example, the subsummary will be placed in the same column as the associated previously placed field but in the subsummaries area. The subsummaries area is a reserved section or part of the layout\/report. The subsummaries area, for example, is either the leading summaries part or the trailing summaries part.","On the other hand, when the decision  determines that the subsummary is not dependent on a previously placed, or to be placed, field in the body, then a decision  determines whether the subsummary is dependent on a previously placed field in an area (e.g., part) other than the body. For example, the previously placed field could be in the leading grand total or leading summary or trailing summary layout parts. When the decision  determines that the subsummary is dependent on a previously placed field in an area other than the body, the subsummary is placed  at the same position as the associated previously placed field. For example, the subsummary will be placed in the same column as the associated previously placed field but in the subsummaries area. Alternatively, when the decision  determines that the subsummary is not dependent on a previously placed field in an area other than the body, the subsummary is placed  at the next available rightmost position.","Following blocks , ,  and , a decision  determines whether there are more subsummaries to be placed. When the decision  determines that there are more subsummaries to be placed, the subsummaries processing  returns to repeat the decision  and subsequent blocks so that other of the subsummaries can be processed. However, when the decision  determines that there are no more subsummaries to be processed, the subsummary processing  is complete and ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIGS. 8\u201322"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIGS. 9\u201322"],"b":"800"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 10\u201322"],"b":["900","900","800","900"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A\u201310D","FIGS. 10A\u201310D","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10C","FIG. 10D"],"b":["900","902","902","900","902","900"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["1100","1100","900","1102","1102","1100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11","FIGS. 13A\u201313D","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13C","FIG. 13D"],"b":["1200","1102","1100","1200","1204","1204","1204","1204","1202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 12"],"b":["1400","1400","1200","1200","1400","1400"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1500","1500","1400","1500","1500"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 15"],"b":["1600","1500","1600","1602","1600","1602"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 15","FIG. 17"],"b":["1700","1400","1400","1500","1600","1500","1700","1700"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["1800","1800","1802","1800","1804"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 20"],"b":["1900","1900","1900","2000","1900"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["2100","2100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 22","b":["2200","2200","220"]},"In general, the interview session associated with the Columnar List\/Report is much more sophisticated than the interview session utilized for any of the Standard Form, The Table View, Labels, Envelopes or Blank Layout.
