{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates to automated systems and methods for integrated multi-platform communication including real-time language translation.","Web-based communication interfaces are used for many purposes, including remote control support, helpdesk support, and general communication. With multinational corporations and contacts, it is often the case that users (including, but not limited to, support agents, clients, recipients, and senders) speak different languages. In order to communicate effectively, the users can utilize translation software. Existing technologies, however, are inflexible and are typically restricted to only one language translation application programming interface (API). This is not ideal, for example, because some translation APIs are better at translating particular languages, while being inferior at translating others. Utilizing the present technologies thus results in suboptimal translation accuracy.","In addition, current translation technologies typically use a single method of communication (e.g., chat, email, or short message service (SMS)). Currently available systems typically do not allow for users to communicate across multiple platforms. This makes many of the current technologies inconvenient, especially for clients who are travelling, busy, or who otherwise need to alter their mode of communication at various times.","Moreover, currently available technologies may require a user to install third party software programs for full functionality. This increases the time burden on the user, as well as the possibility of malfunctions.","In response to these and other needs, the present disclosure provides a computer-implemented method and related system for facilitating communication among a sender and recipient. In particular, certain embodiments of the disclosure provide a method that can utilize automated translators to obtain a plurality of translations of the message in a second language that are then displayed to the recipient. This method further comprises receiving and processing a response to the plurality of translations from the recipient. In certain embodiments, the received response is a selection of one of the plurality of translations, while in certain other embodiments, the received response is an indication that none of the plurality of translations is acceptable. In certain embodiments, processing the response comprises combining the response with similar responses and updating the communication method based at least in part on the response.","Certain other embodiments of the disclosure provide a method for changing at least the language and mode of a responsive communication sent to the original sender. In particular, this method comprises determining both a first and current device preference of the original sender, as well as both a first and current language preference of the original sender. This method further comprises using automated translators to obtain a plurality of translations of the responding message in the currently-preferred language of the original sender, and presenting at least one of the plurality of translations of the responding message to the original sender via the original sender's currently-preferred device. In certain embodiments, the currently-preferred device is different from the first communication device. The device preference of the original sender can be received from the sender during the communication. In certain embodiments, the first language and currently-preferred language are different.","Systems and methods are disclosed for providing a new capability for users (including, but not limited to, support agents, clients, recipients, and senders) to easily communicate in different languages in real-time across multiple communication platforms (e.g., email, chat, SMS, etc.). Systems and methods are disclosed that are capable of utilizing a user's input and computer information (including, but not limited to, language identification and\/or ID settings) to determine an initial language setting. In certain embodiments, both the sender and recipient are allowed to make preferred language selections on-the-fly. Once a language is selected, the system may receive the sender's communication and translate it into the recipient's selected language. In some embodiments, the system may produce a preferred translation of an incoming communication (translated into the selected language), which is initially displayed to the user. In some embodiments, the system may produce alternate translations of an incoming communication (translated into the selected language) and may allow the recipient to view and select among the alternate translations (or, if applicable, the recipient can choose none of the given translations). In this way, user is able to view additional computer-implemented translations in the event that an initially preferred and displayed translation is not optimally comprehensible. The language translation system may utilize this user selection data to adjust and optimize the language translation algorithm (including, but not limited to, changing the translation API for a given situation, offering suggestions to the user, updating words in the custom dictionary, etc.).","Once a communication is received for translation, the system may \u201ccrowd source\u201d the translation by consulting multiple language translation tools. For example, translations may be obtained from three different translators and all three alternative translations may be presented to the recipient. If the recipient selects one of the three translations, the system may note that the translator that provided the selected translation is preferred for the language involved. The recipient's selection may be combined with responses from other users. Over time, the system may adapt the translation algorithms accordingly. In this way, the translation algorithm is able to adapt and initially select and display a computer-implemented translation that has been chosen as optimal by a population of users.","In certain embodiments, the system utilizes a custom dictionary and\/or custom library to filter and assess words and\/or acronyms that may be difficult for an automated translator to translate (including, but not limited to, jargon, slang, and\/or acronyms). Furthermore, certain embodiments utilize on-the-fly custom or third-party grammar and spellchecking systems to insure words are in a form that is most easily recognized and translated by the API. In certain embodiments, the system interface may indicate words that were unable to be translated (e.g., proper names).","In certain embodiments, the system integrates different communication platforms including, but not limited to, chat, email, SMS, and other forms of remote and\/or web-based communications. For example, a user may submit a communication via text message and the system may process the communication and present it to the recipient such that the recipient cannot tell how the communication was sent. In this way, the recipient may view communications sent by SMS, text message, and email, and may respond in a transparent fashion. A user is allowed to change modes of communication either during a single interaction session or in between sessions. In this way, users can continue using the communication system while they are travelling, busy, or otherwise need to alter their mode of communication at various times. In certain embodiments, for example, a user is able to switch to the email mode if the user is busy, or to the SMS mode if the user needs to go offline. In certain embodiments, a client is able to switch modes of communication without the support agent noticing any difference in the agent's interface window. In this way, the support agent may simply respond, and the system automatically communicates the response to the user via the chosen platform.","In certain embodiments, the translation system is completely web-based and does not require installation of any programs beyond a conventional web browser. This characteristic offers simplicity and ease of use to the user. In certain other embodiments, the system and methods are integrated with other programs (including, but not limited to, commercially available programs such as Microsoft\u00ae Office Communications Server; proprietary programs such as ticketing and backend ticketing functionalities; RSS feed and feed readers; voice capability and\/or transcription programs; and internal company portals).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","100","106","104","102","102","106","110","108","110","108","106","102","104"]},"In other embodiments, however, the user devices  include devices that do not contain web browsers.

Thereafter, the Communication Service  can display one or more translations, from one or more of the different available translators -, to the recipient via the preferred mode of communication . In certain embodiments, the Communication Service  can display a plurality of translations to the message recipient. As an example, in certain embodiments, the recipient can choose Chat  as the preferred mode of communication. In certain embodiments, the recipient can further employ a fully functional interface, such as a Customer Service Interface , that allows the recipient to utilize drop-down menus to select options including but not limited to alternate message translations. In this way, the recipient can choose which of the plurality of translations is optimally comprehensible. In other embodiments, the recipient can choose a SMS  as the preferred mode of communication. In certain embodiments, if the recipient's SMS does not have the capability to display and process various selectable options, including but not limited to alternate message translations, then the Communication Service  may only display one preferred translation. In other embodiments, the Communication Service  may display a plurality of translations to modes of communication that do not support the display and use of various selectable options.","In certain embodiments, the recipient can choose Chat  as the preferred mode of communication, and that certain Chat  can employ a fully functional interface, such as a Customer Service Interface , that allows the recipient to utilize drop-down menus to select options including but not limited to alternate message translations. In such an embodiment, the recipient can choose from amongst the available translations. In certain embodiments, the Communication Service's  preferred translation is initially displayed, with the alternate translations located in a drop-down menu. If a recipient accepts a particular translation, or chooses none of the available translations, the Communication Service  records the recipient's choice and uses that feedback  to update the process . The recipient's response can be combined with responses from other users, and the updates to the process  can be crowd sourced. The updates to the process  can include, but are not limited to, changes to the algorithm to select the preferred language translation. In certain embodiments, if the recipient selects none of the available translations as acceptable , the Communication Service , can send further communication to the recipient. This further communication can include, but is not limited to, additional translations, translations of differently worded messages, additional options, etc. In this way, the Communication Service  enables the recipient to continue with the communication even if none of the given translations were acceptable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","108","1004","108","306","1006","108","1008","1008","1010","1012"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","108","1102","108","308","1104","108","1106","108","1108","308"]},"In certain embodiments, after the Communication Service  processes and translates the message, a plurality of translations are available for the recipient to view (step ).
