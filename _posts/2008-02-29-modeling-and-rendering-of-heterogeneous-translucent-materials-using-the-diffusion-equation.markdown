{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Many materials in the real world exhibit a complex appearance that arises from subsurface scattering of light. For heterogeneous translucent objects, the light transport within the material volume is determined by its geometry, the optical properties of its constituent elements, and the spatial distribution of these elements in the volume. Because of the complex effects of these various factors on subsurface scattering, models of these materials have been challenging to acquire from real objects and to render in real time. Furthermore, computational costs and\/or modeling deficiencies have made interactive editing of material properties a difficult problem. As described herein, various exemplary systems, methods, etc., provide for modeling and\/or rendering of heterogeneous translucent material.","An exemplary method includes providing image data for an illuminated physical sample of a heterogeneous translucent material, determining one or more material properties of the material based in part on a diffusion equation where one of the material properties is a diffusion coefficient for diffusion of radiation in the material and where the determining includes a regularization term for the diffusion coefficient, mapping the one or more material properties to a virtual object volume, assigning virtual illumination conditions to the virtual object volume, and rendering the virtual object volume using the virtual illumination conditions as a boundary condition for a system of diffusion equations of the virtual object volume. Other methods, devices and systems are also disclosed.","Various exemplary methods, devices, systems, etc., described herein pertain to creating artificial visual objects and\/or scenes. An exemplary method includes acquiring data from an illuminated physical sample, determining material properties of the physical sample based on the acquired data, mapping the material properties to at least a portion of an object and rendering the object to provide for a visual display of the object where the object exhibits characteristics of the physical sample.","As described herein, various exemplary techniques pertain to modeling and rendering of heterogeneous translucent materials that enable acquisition from measured samples, interactive editing of material attributes, and real-time rendering. In various examples, the materials are assumed to be optically dense such that multiple scattering can be approximated by a diffusion process described by the diffusion equation.","An exemplary process for modeling heterogeneous materials includes an algorithm for acquiring material properties from appearance measurements by solving an inverse diffusion problem. As such an inverse problem can be ill-conditioned, the process optionally incorporates a regularizer (i.e., to handle ill-conditioned situations), an adjoint method to dramatically reduce computational cost, and\/or a hierarchical GPU implementation to reduce computational cost.","To display an object with known material properties, an exemplary algorithm allows for rendering by solving the diffusion equation with a boundary condition defined by a given illumination environment. In various examples, the exemplary algorithm is centered around object representation by a polygrid, a grid with regular connectivity and an irregular shape, which facilitates the solution of the diffusion equation in arbitrary volumes. Because of the regular connectivity, the exemplary rendering algorithm can be implemented on a GPU for real-time performance. Various examples demonstrate exemplary methods for capturing materials from physical samples and performing real-time rendering and editing with these materials.","As mentioned, various techniques pertain to modeling and rendering of heterogeneous translucent materials. Examples demonstrate acquisition of data from physical samples, interactive editing of material attributes, and real-time rendering. For rendering, material can be represented as a discretized volume (e.g., volume elements or voxels) in which spatially-variant absorption and diffusion coefficients are associated with each voxel. In various examples, multiple scattering is accounted for where the material is assumed to be optically dense such that subsurface scattering becomes isotropic and can be approximated by a diffusion process.","For modeling heterogeneous materials, an exemplary algorithm allows for recovering a material model from appearance measurements by solving an inverse diffusion problem. For a given distribution of spatially-variant absorption and diffusion coefficients, the corresponding diffusion process that generates the material appearance can be expressed as a partial differential equation, defined over the volumetric elements, with a boundary condition given by a lighting environment.","A process of acquiring a volumetric model from a material sample involves an inverse diffusion problem in which a search for a distribution of spatially-variant absorption and diffusion coefficients such that a corresponding diffusion process generates the material appearance that is consistent with the measured surface appearance in captured images. Through an optimization or solution, the process aims to generate the material appearance that is most consistent.","As described herein, in various examples images record an actual material sample where a solution to the inverse diffusion problem is assumed with a high degree of certainty to exist. However, such inverse problems, are known to be ill-posed, since a range of different volumetric models may have indistinguishable surface appearances. In other words, different \u201cinteriors\u201d can produce visually indistinguishable surface appearance for an object. Consequently, the diffusion equations and image measurements define, for a material sample, a group of solutions. Since all solutions correspond to the same visual appearance, any solution from this group provides a valid volumetric appearance model of the given material.","Finding a solution to the inverse diffusion problem is challenging due to the nature of the inverse problem and the large number of variables involved. The inverse diffusion problem is usually solved with an iterative optimization procedure, in which each iteration requires an expensive gradient evaluation. For a volume with elements on an ngrid, this gradient evaluation involves n\u00d7M light diffusion computations, where M is the number of image measurements. The inverse diffusion problem is also ill-conditioned numerically, which presents convergence problems for the iterative solver.","As described herein, to ensure stable convergence, an exemplary method incorporates a regularizer on the diffusion coefficients and includes an effective initialization that assigns uniform diffusion coefficients among the voxels. In various examples, an adjoint method, widely used in optimal control for gradient computation, is used to dramatically reduce the cost of the gradient evaluation down to 2M light diffusion computations. With such schemes and a GPU implementation of the diffusion computation, various examples demonstrate that finding a solution of the inverse diffusion problem becomes feasible for volumes of moderate size.","Also described herein, is an exemplary algorithm for rendering a volumetric model with known material properties that includes solving a diffusion equation whose boundary condition is defined by some stated illumination conditions, which may be varied (e.g., spatially, over time, etc.).","With respect to solving a formulated set of equations (e.g., diffusion equation and associated boundary condition or conditions) for 3D volumes of arbitrary shape, an exemplary technique includes a polygrid and an finite difference method (FDM). Such an algorithm is centered around the polygrid representation, which facilitates the solution of the light diffusion equation in arbitrary volumes. A polygrid is a grid with regular connectivity and an irregular shape for a close geometric fit without fine sampling. Regular connectivity allows for development of a hierarchical GPU implementation of an exemplary rendering algorithm for real-time performance.","Construction of a polygrid on an arbitrary 3D object is described below along with a technique for evaluating diffusion equations defined among irregular intervals of polygrid nodes. With such a technique, models of various materials can be readily captured and interactively transformed with adjustments of scattering properties. An exemplary system allows for flexible use of real appearance data provides designers a valuable tool for creating realistic objects with the visual features of heterogeneous translucent materials. As described herein, an exemplary system supports real-time rendering and editing of such volumes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","102","112","102","114","102","114","116"]},"According to the method , a model acquisition step  forms a model  of the material sample  based at least in part on the captured data . In the example of , the model acquisition step  determines volumetric material properties (e.g., the properties \u03ba and \u03bc).","Once one or more materials properties are known, a material mapping step  can map the material to a virtual object  as indicated by the band  on the virtual rabbit object . In the example of , the band  may be a volumetric slice, an annulus, etc., in the virtual object . In other words, the band  can have any dimension or thickness in the virtual object . Indeed, the band  may be an interior band that resides below the surface of the virtual object .","After mapping, a rendering step  renders the material per the one or more properties to generate a visual representation of the virtual object  that includes a visual representation of the material .

For example, a user can position the cursor  on the virtual rabbit object  to \u201cpaint\u201d a material  using a stamp pattern where the stamp pattern maps certain material properties to the virtual rabbit object . As indicated, a user may change the stamp pattern using controls in the stamp pattern field  and select a material using controls in the paint\/fill material field . The geometric parameters field  can be used to control \u201cstrength\u201d of the mapped material, size of the mapped material and depth of the mapped material.","As the object and\/or scene that appears in the drawing field  is virtual, parameters such as translucency can be adjusted (e.g., per the translucency control ). For example, white quartz from a specific site in Nevada may be selected as the material.

Such a desire may be met using the control of the translucency field .","A more detailed description of various exemplary techniques follows along with some examples.  shows an exemplary technique  that includes a physical model  for diffusion of light in a material, a forward problem for a diffusion process  and an inverse problem for a diffusion process for determining one or more material properties .","As indicated in the physical model , subsurface scattering of light in a heterogeneous material can be quite complex and stochastic and determined by object geometry, material properties and distribution of the light in the object volume. In the forward problem , let the object interior be volume V and the object surface be A.

In solving the inverse diffusion problem, a search is performed for the volumetric model (\u03bc(x), \u03ba(x)) whose forward diffusion solution is most consistent with the acquired images.","In various examples, data capture was performed using a Canon 30D digital camera with a 17-45 mm lens to record images of a material sample that is illuminated by an Optoma DLP projector with a 4500:1 contrast ratio. In these trials, the material samples were all block-shaped and represented as a regular grid with n\u00d7m\u00d7l sample points (n\u2267m\u2267l) on the grid nodes. Depending on sample thickness, two setups were used. In both setups, the sample was positioned so that one of the n\u00d7m faces was perpendicular to the optical axis of the projector.","For thin material samples (n,m>>l), the camera was placed facing the sample from the opposite side, such that the sample is imaged with back-lighting. For thick material samples with little transmission of light through the volume, the camera was positioned beside the projector. For sake of explanation, the side of the sample facing the camera is referred to as the front face.","The camera and projector were calibrated prior to image acquisition. Geometric calibration of both the camera and projector was accomplished with a technique where the projector projected a chessboard pattern onto different planes. The white balance of the camera was calibrated with respect to the projector, based on the projection of a white image onto a Macbeth Color Checker\u2122 chart with known albedos. The color chart was also used in measuring the black level of the projector.","To avoid interference effects from the projector's color wheel, exposure times of at least 1\/30 second were used. In illuminating the sample, the face that received direct lighting was subdivided into 4\u00d74 regions, and light was separately projected onto each region while capturing an image sequence of the complete sample with a fixed aperture and variable exposure times ranging from 1\/30 to 8 seconds. Construction of an HDR image from the image sequence for each illumination condition was performed. Vignetting effects from the projector were minimized by illuminating the sample using only the center of the projector images.","With this capture process, images of multiple scattering data were obtained. In a thin-sample setup, the back-lighting was assumed to scatter multiple times before exiting from the front face, such that captured images contain only multiple scattering. In the setup for thick samples, image data were for only those surface points that were not directly illuminated by the projector, as the appearance of these points is considered to result only from multiple scattering. Since the projector and camera were aligned perpendicularly to the material sample in both configurations, the Fresnel transmittance effects on the measured multiple scattering were disregarded, and the dependence on wo in the inverse diffusion problem equation was dropped. For various examples the following were set: C=2.1489 with h=1.3.","To capture the approximate single scattering term in the equation for L, the front-lighting setup was used and a technique that records one image of the sample under uniform lighting and the single scattering term was obtained by subtracting the multiple scattering contribution.","In model acquisition per step  of the method  of , for each captured image and corresponding lighting condition, a data mapping was performed to map onto each grid node on the front and back faces its incoming light intensity and measured outgoing radiance. The material model was then acquired by solving for the scattering parameters (\u03ba and \u03bc) of each node in the volume that would result in image appearances most consistent with the measured data.

A mapping step  relies on the projecting to maps the polygrid to the object volume. The mapping step  maps the boundary nodes of the polygrid to the object surface, which may be adjusted to obtain an even distribution.","After the mapping step , a computing step  acts such that the interior nodes directly connected to the boundary nodes are placed within the object volume at a distance \u201cd\u201d along the inward normal directions, where \u201cd\u201d is appropriately set (e.g., one-tenth the average distance between connected boundary nodes on the object surface). Close placement of these nodes to the boundary nodes is intended for accurate handling of the boundary condition. In other words, the boundary condition determines the volumetric solution; hence, the polygrid should be appropriately spaced at the interior adjacent the boundary of the object to accurately account for the effect of the boundary condition on the entire volumetric solution. Further, gradients can often be the largest at the boundary. For other interior nodes (i.e., the remaining interior nodes), these are then positioned within the volume in an appropriate manner.

Although a general purpose GPU-based linear system solver could be used for computation, various trials include use of an exemplary GPU-based that is efficient GPU and specific to diffusion computation on a polygrid.","In this exemplary method, the polygrid material parameters are packed into a set of 2D textures for computation on a GPU. For efficient rendering, the textures are packed such that the connected neighbors of each node are easily accessible. Towards this end, each texture is organized according to the positions of the polygrid nodes within the original polycube. The cubes in the polycube are transferred in scanline order, and the grid of each cube is flattened. The grid in each cube is divided into 2D x-y slices, which are each treated as a texture block and ordered in the texture by increasing z value. In packing the texture, empty positions of grid nodes are retained that were previously removed, so that the cubes have slices of equal size. Two 2D textures T and T are created for the corresponding scattering parameters, and for the iterative computation two swap radiance buffers IA and IB are maintained that are organized in the same manner as T and T.

These nodes\/pixels are referred to as type A, type B and type C. Each type of node is rendered using a different geometric primitive. For a node that lies in the interior of a texture block (type A node), four of its connected neighbors in the polygrid are also adjacent neighbors in the 2D texture, while the other two neighbors can be found with the same offset value in other texture blocks. The values of these nodes are updated by rendering a quadrilateral with the texture offsets of the two non-adjacent neighbors as vertex attributes. After rasterization, this offset information can be interpolated from the vertices to each pixel in the quad. In a similar manner, nodes on each texture block edge (type B nodes) are rendered with a line, where three neighbors are adjacent in the texture, and the texture offsets of the other three are stored as line vertex attributes. The nodes of each texture block corner (type C nodes) are rendered with points, with the texture offsets of all six neighbors stored as vertex attributes.","Slices that contain removed nodes can also be rendered using these three primitives (types A, B and C). All of these geometric primitives and their vertex attributes can be precomputed and loaded into graphics memory before rendering. Since the surface boundary nodes and the interior nodes are processed differently, their corresponding geometric primitives can be rendered in two separate passes with different pixel shaders. After completing such a computation, the output radiance can be calculated on the surface by updating the boundary nodes in the radiance buffer as:\n\n()=(,w)[\u03c6\u2032()\u2212()\u03ba()]\/[2\u03c0\u03ba()]\n\nThese boundary node values are then used as a texture for surface vertices in the final pass.\n","With the foregoing exemplary packing and rendering scheme, the radiant fluence values are updated with 10 texture fetches for interior nodes and 5 texture fetches for surface nodes. Such a scheme avoids extra texture storage for node connectivity information and dependent texture accesses in rendering. Alternative schemes for packing and rendering are possible; nevertheless, the foregoing exemplary scheme obtains good performance.","For greater efficiency in computing light diffusion, an exemplary hierarchical scheme is employed to accelerate rendering with a polygrid. In this hierarchical scheme, a multiresolution polygrid in the object volume is constructed. Starting from the original polygrid, the positions and material properties of nodes at successively coarser levels are determined by averaging the positions and material properties of its eight children at the next finer level. For nodes whose children contain removed nodes, the result is normalize by the number of existing children. Before rendering, the material properties at each resolution are packed and texture pyramids generated for T, T, Tand T.","Pyramids need not be generated for the radiance buffers IA and IB, which can simply be reused for computation at each level. During rendering, a process first solves the diffusion equations at the coarsest grid level, and then uses the computed radiant fluence at each node as initializations for its children nodes at the next finer level. This process iterates until a solution at the original polygrid resolution is obtained.","The hierarchical algorithm can be accelerated by employing an adaptive scheme in which light diffusion is computed to different resolutions at different depths in the volume. Since material variations deeper inside the object volume have more subtle effects on surface appearance, it is sufficient to approximate light diffusion at deeper nodes with coarser-resolution solutions.","According to such a coarser-resolution approach to deeper nodes, after obtaining the solution at a coarse resolution and copying it to a finer resolution, the radiant fluence values at nodes below a certain depth are fixed, while the nodes closer to boundary are updated. In such an implementation of this adaptive scheme, the computed resolution at different depth levels can be given by a user. Texture blocks whose nodes are not used in computation at a given level can be removed to save on texture storage.","Various examples are implemented without using the V-cycle multigrid algorithm to speed up light diffusion computation, as a cost exists for incorporating the multigrid algorithm into the foregoing adaptive scheme. Also, V-cycle multi-grid algorithms require extra texture storage for residual and temporary radiant fluence values in each level. If all grid nodes are used in light diffusion, the foregoing exemplary technique may be considered as a simplified N-cycle multigrid scheme without V-cycles for each resolution.","A favorable property of the light diffusion algorithm is that the coherence between frames can be exploited to facilitate rendering. For applications in which the lighting or material changes gradually, the rendering result of the last frame provides an excellent initialization for the current frame. With good initial values, the number of iteration steps can be significantly reduced.","An exemplary hierarchical method for rendering a virtual object volume includes constructing a multiresolution polygrid in the virtual object volume; generating texture pyramids for material properties of the virtual object volume; and rendering the virtual object volume by solving diffusion equations at a coarse grid level and computing radiant fluence at a finer grid level. Such a method my include accelerating the rendering using an adaptive scheme that computes light diffusion at different resolutions at different depths in the virtual object volume.","An exemplary real-time rendering system allows for an acquired volumetric material model to be interactively edited with real-time feedback on the modified appearance. In a trial that illustrates this capability, the exemplary GUI  of  was used. In addition to painting new values for \u03bc(x) and \u03ba(x), various ways to modify existing \u03bc(x) and \u03ba(x) can be supported. The user can directly adjust \u03bc(x) and \u03ba(x) by multiplying them with or adding them to user-supplied constants (strength control of the field ). Alternatively, the user can modulate the \u03bc and \u03ba values within a pattern mask using a texture (the paint\/fill field  and the stamp pattern field ). With volumetric representation, users can also modify a material at specific depth levels (depth control of the field ).","In an exemplary system, all editing operations can be executed as pixel operations on a GPU. Such a system can maintain extra buffers T\u2032 and T\u2032 of the \u03ba and \u03bc textures as rendering targets for editing. In each frame, T\u2032 and T\u2032 can be modified by user-specified operations, and then swapped to T and T for rendering. To support editing operations on local regions, positions of grid nodes can be stored in a texture T. Then when a user selects a region on the screen for editing, computation of the screen projection of each grid node based on its position in the editing shader can occur and execution of the editing operations only for the nodes within the user-specified local region can occur.","In the foregoing example of material editing, the adaptive scheme is not implemented; instead, the illustrative trial takes advantage of the coherence between frames to reduce rendering computation, which allows for more complex material editing operations to be executed on a GPU.","As mentioned, various trials were performed to illustrate various exemplary techniques and their results.

The exemplary GPU-based light diffusion and rendering algorithm was implemented in the OpenGL shading language. For the GPU-based light diffusion computation used in model acquisition, all parameters and computation results were represented as 32-bit floating-point values for high precision.

In rendering, ambient occlusion was used to determine visibility for environment lighting and the shadow buffer was used for visibility of local lighting.

The polycube for the aforementioned hole model of Table 1 included 36 cubes where the grid resolution in each cube at the finest level was 12\u00d712\u00d712. For the hierarchical method without the adaptive scheme, all grid nodes were used in the light diffusion computation. In the adaptive scheme, the depth of nodes that were involved in computing each resolution were manually specified such that the final error was less than 0.5%. Results indicate that the hierarchical scheme can substantially improve light diffusion performance on a polygrid. Specifically, hierarchical and adaptive schemes had error less than 0.5% after processing of about 90,000,000 nodes or less; whereas, for a single resolution scheme, error approached 0.5% only after about 450,000,000 nodes.
