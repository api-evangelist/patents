Technical Field","The present invention relates to a power-off detection device and, more particularly, to a power-off detection device that enables an electronic appliance to detect the power-off of external input power from a power supply device that supplies DC power to the electronic appliance so as to safely prepare for the power-off.","2. Related Art","A typical power supply device for an electronic appliance provides power by converting AC (Alternating Current) power into DC (Direct Current) power.","The power-off detection device detects a power-off of the external input power that provides the AC power to this typical power supply device, and detects the power-off of the external input power at a certain time before the supply of the DC voltage to the electronic appliance is stopped, so that the central control means of the electronic appliance can complete its work safely without any loss.","The typical power-off detection circuit comprises a number of resistors, a bridge rectifier, a photo coupler, a capacitor and a voltage comparator, and the photo coupler includes a photodiode and a phototransistor.","For this power-off detection circuit, the AC power inputted as external input power from a power supply device is transmitted and rectified via the resistor and the bridge rectifier.","Further, the transmitted and rectified power is applied to the photodiode of the photo coupler, and the photodiode emits light depending on the applied AC power.","Further, the phototransistor of the photo coupler converts the emitted light of the photodiode into a corresponding electrical signal.","The photodiode and the phototransistor of the photo coupler should be kept dielectric for electrical stability between circuits.","Further, the capacitor is charged by a predetermined current of the electrical signal produced by the phototransistor, and the capacitor rectifies the charged current to produce a DC voltage.","When the predetermined current is not provided by the phototransistor, the capacitor discharges through a non-inverting (+) terminal of the voltage comparator, thereby providing a comparison voltage thereto.","A reference voltage is applied to the inverting (\u2212) terminal of the voltage comparator according to the resistance ratio between voltage dividing resistors while the a comparison voltage is applied by the capacitor to the non-inverting (+) terminal of the voltage comparator.","Therefore, the voltage comparator compares the reference voltage with the comparison voltage, and when there is a difference between the two voltages, a power-off detection signal is outputted to an output terminal through a pull-up resistor during a predetermined time period.","That is, when the comparison voltage value is not equal to the established reference voltage in the voltage comparator, a predetermined power-off detection signal is outputted through a pull-up resistor.","The output terminal of the voltage comparator, which is the output terminal of the power-off detection circuit, is connected to central control means of the electronic appliance, and when the power-off detection signal is received from the output terminal of the power-off detection circuit, the central control means completes its work safely while primary power continues to power-off.","In preparation for the power-off of the primary power, the central control means can store, in storage means, information as to currently running or pending work, and can complete its work safely before the supply of DC power ceases.","This typical power-off detection circuit has to use the photo coupler having the photodiode and the phototransistor to keep dielectric relationship between circuits.","However, there is a problem in that the cost of manufacturing the power supply device increases because the photo coupler is expensive.","Further, when designing the power supply device, if a photo coupler is employed, it is difficult to guarantee a safe distance between a primary circuit and a secondary circuit, and to make the appliance smaller since the area occupied by the photo coupler becomes large.","The following patents are considered to be generally pertinent to the present invention, but are burdened by many of the disadvantages set forth above: U.S. Pat.

The first capacitor C is connected in parallel with the third coil N, and smoothes and rectifies the current that flows through the first diode D so as to provide the detection voltage.","As a result of the connection of the first resistor R and the second resistor R, the detection voltage discharged from the first capacitor C is applied to the non-inverting (+) terminal of the voltage comparator OP as a detection voltage depending on the ratio of the resistance values of resistors R and R.","Preferably, the ratio of the resistance values of the first resistor R and the second resistor R, based on which the detection voltage is applied to the voltage comparator OP, and the ratio of the resistance values of the third resistor R and the fourth resistor R, based on which the reference voltage is applied to the voltage comparator OP, are set such that the detection voltage value and the reference voltage value, applied to the voltage comparator OP in a state where power-off is not yet generated in the external power supply, are equal.","Further, as a result of the connection of the third resistor R and the fourth resistor R, the predetermined DC voltage provided to the electronic appliance through the output terminal of the primary transformer  is applied to the inverting (\u2212) terminal of the voltage comparator OP as a reference voltage, depending on the ratio of the resistance values of resistors R and R.","The voltage comparator OP compares the detection voltage applied to the non-inverting terminal and the reference voltage applied to the inverting terminal, and when there is a difference between these voltage values, a power-off detection signal corresponding to the difference is outputted to the output terminal of power-off detection device .","The fifth resistor R pulls up a power-off detection signal, which the voltage comparator OP outputs, by as much as the predetermined DC voltage provided from the primary transformer  to the electronic appliance so as to transmit the power-off detection signal to the central control means of the electronic appliance.","A method of detecting the power-off of a power supply device according to the present invention will now be described.","First, in the first coil N of the input unit  arranged at the primary circuit side, a magnetic flux is formed according to the AC power provided as the external input power, and in the second coil N of the primary transformer  arranged at the secondary circuit side, an induced current is generated according to the winding ratio N:N of the first coil N and the second coil N.","Further, if current flows through the second coil N in a direction from the anode to the cathode of the second diode D, the second diode D passes the current, and the second capacitor C is charged with the applied current so as to rectify to the DC voltage.","On the other hand, if the current flows through the second coil N in a direction from the cathode to the anode of the second diode D, the second diode D does not pass the current, and the second capacitor C discharges the DC current rectified depending on the charged current so as to provide a predetermined DC voltage to the electronic appliance.","Based on the designed capacitance of the second capacitor C, a power-off retention time is determined, during which time as measured from a time when the power-off is generated in the external input power supply device, the primary transformer  provides the predetermined DC voltage.","Meanwhile, in the third coil N of the power-off detection device , an induced current is generated according to the winding ratio with the first coil, that is, N:N.","Since the third coil N is wound in a reverse direction with respect to the second coil N, current flows in a direction opposite to the direction of current flowing through the second coil N.","Furthermore, if the current flows through the third coil N in a direction from the anode to the cathode of the first diode D, the first diode D passes the current, and the first capacitor C charges so as to rectify the DC voltage. The voltage rectified at the first capacitor C becomes a detection voltage.","On the other hand, if the current flows through the third coil N in a direction from the cathode to the anode of the first diode D, the first diode D does not pass the current, and the first capacitor C discharges the detection voltage according to the charged current.","Furthermore, the voltage discharged from the first capacitor C is applied to the non-inverting terminal of the voltage comparator OP as a detection voltage according to the ratio of the resistance values of the first resistor R and the second resistor R, and the reference voltage is applied to the inverting terminal according to a ratio of the resistance values of the third resistor R and the fourth resistor R connected to the output terminal, through which the primary transformer  provides the predetermined DC voltage to the electronic appliance.","The voltage comparator OP compares the detection voltage applied to the non-inverting (+) terminal and the reference voltage applied to the inverting (\u2212) terminal, and when there is a difference between these voltages, the power-off detection signal corresponding to the difference is outputted to the output terminal.","Furthermore, the fifth resistor R pulls up the power-off detection signal so that the signal corresponds to the predetermined DC voltage, which the primary transformer  provides to the electronic appliance and transmits to the central control means of the electronic appliance.","It is desirable that the voltage dividing resistors R and R, the first resistor R, the second resistor R, and the capacitor C be designed such that the reference voltage value is equal to the detection voltage value.","When the power-off occurs in the external input power, a magnetic flux is not formed at the first coil N of the input unit  so that the induced current is not generated at the second coil N of the primary transformer , and the second capacitor C provides the current charged according to its capacitance value to the electronic appliance as a predetermined DC voltage during a predetermined period.","During the power-off retention time, as measured from the time that power-off occurs, the primary transformer  continue to provide the DC voltage charged into the second capacitor C, and this power-off retention time is determined by the capacitance of the second capacitor C. That is, when the capacitance of the second capacitor is increased, the power-off retention time grows longer, and when the capacitance of the second capacitor is reduced, the power-off retention time grows shorter.","Further, induced current is not generated, even in the third coil N of the power-off detection device , so that the detection voltage is not applied to the non-inverting (+) terminal of the voltage comparator OP.","The second coil N and the third coil N are wound in reverse directions relative to each other so that, for example, if the second capacitor C of the primary transformer  rectifies the current, the first capacitor C of the power-off detection device  discharges the detection voltage.","Therefore, the power-off detection device  can detect the power-off of the external input power at the same time that the second capacitor C of the primary transformer  discharges the DC voltage.","Furthermore, when there is a difference between the reference voltage and the detection voltage applied to the voltage comparator OP, that is, when the power-off occurs in the external input power, induced current is not generated in the third coil N so that, if the detection voltage is not applied to the voltage comparator OP, the voltage comparator OP outputs to the output terminal the power-off detection signal according to the difference between the detection voltage and the reference voltage.","The fifth resistor R, connected to the output terminal of the voltage comparator OP, pulls up the power-off detection signal outputted to the output terminal so as to correspond to a predetermined DC voltage that the primary transformer  provides to the electronic appliance, and then transmits the power-off detection signal to the central control means of the electronic appliance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"As shown in , when the power-off of the external input power occurs at time t, the power-off detection device  detects the power-off of the external input power at time t, and transmits the power-off detection signal to the central control means of the electronic appliance within the power-off retention time t-t of the primary transformer .","That is, the first capacitor C of the power-off detection device  has a much smaller capacitance than the second capacitor C of the primary transformer  so that it has a faster charge\/discharge period than the second capacitor C.","Therefore, the power-off detection device  detects the power-off of the external input power within the predetermined period t-t, or the power-off retention time during which the primary transformer  provides the DC voltage, so that it can provide the power-off detection signal to the central control means of the electronic appliance.","Therefore, the central control means of the electronic appliance receives the power-off detection signal from the power-off detection device  before the DC voltage supplied from the primary transformer  ceases, and stores information as to currently running or pending work, or safely stops the work.","Additionally, since the second coil N of the primary transformer  and the third coil N of the power-off detection device  are wound in reverse directions relative to each other, the phase of each current that flows through the second coil N and the third coil N is different.","Therefore, during the period when the second capacitor C is charged, the first capacitor C is discharged, so that the power-off detection device  detects the power-off of the external input power during the power-off retention period t-t during which the second capacitor C discharges the DC voltage, thereby allowing the power-off detection signal to be provided to the central control means during a predetermined period.","The power-off retention time of the primary transformer  is determined by the capacitance of the second capacitor C, and it is thus desirable to make the capacitance of the second capacitor C much larger than that of the first capacitor C so that the power-off detection device  detects the power-off of the external input power within the power-off retention time t-t of the primary transformer , thereby providing the power-off detection signal.","Although the present invention has been described in terms of a specific embodiment, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that a variety of modifications and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention, and it is natural that these modifications and changes be included in the following claims.","As described above, according to the present invention, a photo coupler is not employed in the device for detecting the power-off that occurs in the power supply device of the electronic appliance, thereby facilitating a design which provides a safe distance between the first circuit and the second circuit, and minimizing the occupying area of the voltage detection device so as to enable design of a miniaturized power supply device.","Further, a low cost device can be used instead of the expensive photo coupler, thereby minimizing the unit price of the power supply device.","Although preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention should not be limited to the described preferred embodiments. Rather, various changes and modifications can be made within the spirit and scope of the present invention, as defined by the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention, and many of the attendant advantages thereof, will be readily apparent as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like reference symbols indicate the same or similar components, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
