title: System and method for performing analysis on word variants
abstract: A computer-readable medium stores a first lexicon data structure for lexicon words. The first data structure includes a host form variant field containing a host form variant such as a clitic host form variant, a host form field containing the host form of the host form variant (only present if the forms differ) such as a clitic host verbal form, and a verification field indicative of whether the host form variant is a valid word. The first data structure also includes a segment association field containing data or segmentation bits associating the host form variant with certain types of attachment entries in the lexicon, which also contain data or segmentation bits, to define valid combinations between the host form variant and at least one of the attachment entries in the lexicon. A second lexicon data structure for each of the attachment entries in the lexicon is also stored.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["The present application is based on and claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/513,921, filed Oct. 23, 2003, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Reference is hereby made to the following co-pending and commonly assigned patent applications. U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/804,930, filed on Mar. 19, 2004, entitled \u201cCOMPOUND WORD BREAKER AND SPELL CHECKER\u201d and U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/804,998, filed Mar. 19, 2004, entitled \u201cFULL-FORM LEXICON WITH TAGGED DATA AND METHODS OF CONSTRUCTING AND USING THE SAME\u201d, both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The present invention is related to natural language processing. More particularly, the present invention is related to natural language systems and methods for processing words and associated word-variant forms, such as verb-clitic forms, in one of a range of languages, for example Spanish, when they are encountered in a textual input.","Numerous natural language processing applications rely upon a lexicon for operation. Such applications include word breaking (for search engines), grammar checking, spell checking, handwriting recognition and speech recognition, machine translation, text mining, etc. In some languages, the large number of possible word-variant forms makes it difficult for these natural language applications to accurately analyze the words in their various forms. Word-variant forms (or simply word forms) include compound words, clitics, inflections etc. The large number of word forms makes it difficult to include all of the word forms in the lexicon. A lexicon which contains all of these possible variations, inflections, compounds, etc. of a language is referred to as a full form lexicon.","One example of a large number of word-variant forms in a language is verb-clitic attachment in Spanish. In Spanish, clitics (unstressed forms of the personal pronouns) have different behavior depending on whether they appear before or after the verb. Clitics can precede many verbal forms. In this case, they are detached: e.g. lo vi \u2018I saw it\u2019; se la entregu\u00e9 \u2018I gave it to him\/her\u2019. However, when one or more clitics appear after the verb, they are attached to it forming a single word (e.g. verlo \u2018to see it\u2019; entreg\u00e1ndosela \u2018giving it to him\/her\u2019). These strings are referred to herein as \u201cverb-clitic\u201d forms. Other languages use hyphens to attach clitics (French: donnez-moi \u2018give me\u2019; Portuguese: mand\u00e1-las \u2018to send them\u2019) or hyphens and apostrophes (Catalan: enviar-te'l \u2018to send it to you\u2019). In Spanish, clitics are attached directly to the verbal form.","Clitic attachment may or may not cause changes in the verbal form. Here are examples of the possible cases:\n\n","As used herein, the original verbal form to which clitics attach is referred to as \u201cclitic host\u201d and the resulting form with the orthographic\/phonological transformations as \u201cclitic host variant.\u201d","For simple word breaking, if the desired output is only to break the different segments, dealing with clitics would appear to be quite easy. Just looking at the last letters of the words would be sufficient to determine whether a string is a verb-clitic form. However, this approach would mark as verb-clitic forms words that look like verb-clitic forms but are not. For example, the word \u00e1ngeles could very well be taken for the Person 2 Singular Imperative Polite form of an inexistent verb *anger (with the needed accent added in the right position), but it is actually the plural of the noun \u00e1ngel \u2018angel\u2019. To solve this issue, a list of exceptions with all the known cases of false verb-clitic forms could be used. However, this solution would not prevent the treatment as verb-clitic forms of other words with similar characteristics that are unknown to the system.","In a word breaker scenario where the clitic host form has to be emitted, the computation needs to be more refined. When considering the spell checking scenario, it is obvious that low level solutions are not sufficient for the verb-clitic problem. Verbs with clitics are very common in the Spanish language and users expect spell checkers to be able to recognize them and offer appropriate suggestions when they contain an error.","Some Spellers are based on full form lexica: they list all the possible inflected forms for a given language. This way, if a string isn't found in the list, it is considered an error, and the entries from the lexicon with the smallest edit distance are offered as suggestions. Even though this is a good solution for a language with limited inflectional morphology, such as English, it poses significant problems for a highly inflectional language, such as Spanish.","As an example, one particular Spanish lexicon was found to contain around 13,400 verbs in their Infinitive base form, and there were found to be about 55 inflected forms for each verb. Therefore, without counting verb-clitic forms, a full form lexicon already needs to include around 737,000 inflected verbal forms. To recognize 240 verb-clitic forms per verb (adding over 3.2 million entries), the number of verbal forms alone would be too high (almost 4 million) to be effectively handled for these applications.","A variation of this methodology is to harvest the verb-clitic forms, i.e. to extract all the occurrences of verb-clitic forms from corpora and add only those to the list (instead of productively generating all the possible forms). This option has the shortcoming of providing little coverage for spell checking. Clitics are very frequent in Spanish; the user won't understand the inconsistency in their treatment.","The opposite solution to the use of full form lexica is to have a lexicon with only the lemmas. The lemmas can then be annotated with the morphological information needed to recognize all their inflected forms (including all the irregularities and orthographical changes for verbs, nouns, and adjectives). Note that clitics don't only attach to the Infinitive or base forms of the verbs, but also to inflected forms that can present lots of irregularities. For instance, while the 1Person Imperative Plural form of subir \u2018to raise, to get on\u2019 is subamos, producing the verb-clitic form sub\u00e1monos; the corresponding form of decir \u2018to say\u2019 is digamos, producing the verb-clitic form dig\u00e1monos. This approach implies a big hit for runtime performance, especially for spell checking, where the goal is not only to recognize correct verb-clitic forms, but also to offer good suggestions for misspelled ones.","A computer-readable medium stores a first lexicon data structure for each of a plurality of lexicon words. The first lexicon data structure includes a host form variant field containing data representing a host form variant such as a clitic host form variant, a host form field containing data representing the host form of the host form variant (this field is only present if the forms differ) such as a clitic host verbal form, and a verification field containing data representing a property of the host form variant. The property is indicative of whether the host form variant is itself a valid word or whether the host form variant must be combined with another entry in the lexicon. Methods and apparatus using the data structure and the corresponding computer readable medium are also provided.","A further field of the first data structure can include a segment association field containing data or segmentation bits associating the host form variant for the host form word with certain types of attachment entries in the lexicon, which also contain data or segmentation bits, to define valid combinations between the host form variant and at least one of the attachment entries in the lexicon. The computer-readable medium also stores a second lexicon data structure for each of the attachment entries in the lexicon. In Spanish verb-clitic attachment analysis applications, the data contained in the host form word field of the first data structure can represent a verbal host form, with the data contained in the host form variant field of the first data structure representing the host form variant of the Spanish language verbal host form. The attachment entries in the lexicon would then include clitic attachment entries. In one exemplary embodiment, the attachment entries in the lexicon are clitic pair attachment entries in which each clitic pair is represented in the lexicon as a single unit, instead of as separate segments.","Compound word analysis, such as verb-clitic form analysis, is required for a variety of applications that involve natural language processing, for example: word breaking (for search engines), grammar checking, spell checking, handwriting-recognition, speech-recognition, machine translation, text mining, etc. Proofing tools represent important technologies in the editor market. More accurate analysis of verb-clitic forms and other compound words not only supports a more reliable and helpful spell checker, but also helps enhance grammar checkers.","Using the context of Spanish verb-clitic analysis as one of many possible applications, the present invention provides the opportunity for better coverage, accuracy, and speed than conventional systems, due to an annotation system that marks valid candidates and positions for possible combinations of verbal host forms (or other types of host forms) and clitic segments (or other types of segments or attachments), thus allowing for fast lookups rather than costly evaluations. The innovative approach provided by the present invention is a compromise between the traditional static approach of having a full form lexicon containing all possible word forms and the traditional dynamic approach of using a lexicon with only lemmas annotated with morphological information with runtime processing for handling inflected and complex word forms. The description of this invention will show how runtime-expensive technology can be used as a pre-processing tool in order to bootstrap relevant lexical annotations that allow high accuracy, coverage, and speed to be obtained for runtime verb-clitic form (or other complex word form) analysis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

The layout or data structure of words entered into a lexicon of the present inventions, such as lexicon , is described in this document with reference to tables illustrating associated information. Generally, each entry or word stored in lexicon  has associated data fields. For an entry in the lexicon, the data fields which are relevant to the illustration of the concepts of the present invention are shown in particular Tables. These particular data fields are sometimes referred to as \u201cdynamic segmentation bits\u201d fields. In the context of the present invention, references to various data structure fields (i.e., a first field, a second field, etc.) is intended to also represent various individual bits of a single dynamic segmentation bits field. Further, it will be understood that the data structures will typically also include fields which are not needed to describe the aspects of the present invention, and which are therefore not referenced here.","The challenge of verb-clitic form analysis is to have a very vast and consistent coverage while finding a balance between runtime performance and workset size. It is important to recognize only the forms that have undergone the appropriate transformations. For spelling purposes, it is key to offer correct verb-clitic suggestions for misspelled forms. For word breaking purposes, the clitic host variant needs to be restored to its base form, so that it can be matched to other instances of the given verbal form.","Clitics in Spanish:","In general, clitic attachment can only occur in current common Spanish usage with the following verbal forms: Infinitive, Gerund, and five Imperative forms (six if voseo were to be included).\n\n","The list of clitics in Spanish is provided in Table 1 shown in . Note that \u201cse\u201d appears both in the singular and plural columns of the second and third persons because it can function as a clitic for both persons and numbers. However, from now on in this document, the clitic \u201cse\u201d is included only once, no matter what person and number it may represent. The total number of distinct single clitics is eleven.","Clitics usually appear either in single units or in pairs. Some combinations of clitics are not possible. In one embodiment provided for illustrative purposes, the systems and methods of the present invention are configured to cover the 36 clitic pairs illustrated in Table 2 shown in . In Table 2, the slots containing a hyphen represent invalid clitic combinations.","Although some three-clitic combinations, such as in the forms \u201cc\u00f3metemelo\u201d, \u201cd\u00e1rtemelo\u201d, and \u201cd\u00e1temelo\u201d, could be found in some contexts, they appear to be extremely rare and will not be included in the standard Natural Language Group (NLG) Spanish verb-clitic coverage. However, in other embodiments, the treatment of more than two clitics is possible, and the methods of the present invention can be extended to provide such coverage. The most common cases may be covered via lexicalization (i.e., added to the lexicon as a single unit entry instead of as a clitic host variant annotated to reference its clitics combinations).","Not all single clitics and clitic pairs combine with all possible clitic host forms. Thus, in one embodiment provided for illustrative purposes, making abstraction of certain properties of the verbal host forms, we arrive at a total number of 240 valid verb-clitic forms per verb.","Verb-clitic segmentation:","The segmentation method of the present invention treats some of the full form lexicon entries as strings that are concatenated to create more complex forms. Even though a form created by the attachment of a verb and two clitics is linguistically a combination of three words, for pragmatic reasons some embodiments of the algorithm or method of the present invention handle all verb-clitic forms as pairs of strings. Therefore, it treats combinations of two clitics as one entry in the full form lexicon, and refers to them as \u201cclitic pairs.\u201d Conventionally, linguistic analysis breaks down clitic pairs into their constituent single clitics, which requires complex logic to establish how those pairs combine together and with clitic host variants. One aspect of the invention improves on this by adding the clitic pairs as single entries into the lexicon, and annotating how those pairs combine with clitic host variants. By treating clitic pairs as one single segment or unit in the lexicon, tagging logic required in the prior art is reduced or minimized. Thus, this aspect of the invention minimizes run-time processing requirements without increasing the size of the lexicon by a large number of entries.","Thus, the segmentation algorithm operates only on two segments: an initial segment and a final segment. The first segment is an orthographic\/phonological variant of the host form. If the final segment is a clitic pair, it can be segmented into two pieces for word breaking using information on the word break location stored in the full form lexicon (e.g. sete Segs=2 which indicates that the word break location is found after the first two characters \u201cse\u201d; and noslo Segs=3 which indicates that the word break location is found after the first three characters \u201cnos\u201d).","In an embodiment of the present invention, the algorithm uses three kinds or types of bits to annotate the verb-clitic form segments:\n\n","The DoNotVerify bit of the Dynamic Segmentation Bits Field (or alternatively referred to as the DoNotVerify field of the Dynamic Segmentation Bits Fields) is very important for spell checking. In some cases, clitic host variants that differ from their clitic hosts (by addition of an accent or deletion of the last letter) coincide with other inflections of the same verb, but usually they are not valid stand-alone words. Therefore, the latter forms, which are only used for verb-clitic form analysis, need to be marked as errors when standing alone and can't be offered as suggestions. This represents another aspect of the present invention.","To expand upon this aspect of the present invention, it was illustrated above that some of the verb host forms that can connect with clitics undergo some change (gain an accent, move an accent, drop a letter, etc) in the generation of the host variant, and without the clitic they would not be valid stand alone words or forms in a dictionary. In some embodiments of the invention, those forms are added to the lexicon such that they can be found as a possible segment in a verb-clitic compound, but marked using the \u201cDoNotVerify\u201d bit as a form that must be combined with a clitic to be valid. Thus, a spell checker using the lexicon would recognize that these forms aren't valid stand alone words, and stand alone use would be flagged as a spelling error. In this manner, static information is added as necessary to the lexicon, and a tagging system is provided which licenses the valid combinations. This reduces the amount of dynamic reasoning at runtime, without significantly increasing the size of the lexicon.","Examples of this concept are readily seen. For example, the Spanish infinitive verb \u201ccomer\u201d combines with the clitic \u201clo\u201d to form the verb-clitic word \u201ccomerlo.\u201d In this instance, the original verb form \u201ccomer\u201d does not change. However, in contrast, when the Spanish inflected verb form \u201ctoma\u201d combines with the clitic \u201clo\u201d, it takes an accent mark to form the verb-clitic form \u201ct\u00f3malo\u201d. As another example, when the Spanish word \u201cmirad\u201d combines with the clitic \u201cos\u201d and the clitic \u201clo\u201d to form the word \u201cmir\u00e1oslo\u201d, the final consonant of \u201cmirad\u201d is deleted and an accent is added to obtain the verb form \u201cmir\u00e1\u201d. Neither \u201ct\u00f3ma\u201d nor \u201cmir\u00e1\u201d are valid word forms outside of their combination with a clitic. In accordance with the present invention, these verb forms or clitic host variants are included in the lexicon, but are marked or designated as forms that are only valid in correct uses with clitics, but not as stand alone words.","As we mention above, the desired output for word breaking includes emission of the clitic host form. Each clitic host form can have several clitic host variants, which combine with different sets of clitics. Therefore, the Seg bits are assigned to clitic host variants. When clitic host variants differ from their clitic host forms, the former are annotated with a Baseform field containing their clitic host form.","Table 3 shown in  lists all the single clitics that can attach to each clitic host variant type. In the table, the various forms of the verb peinar \u2018to comb\u2019 are used to provide an example of each type. Table 4 shown in  lists all the clitic pairs to be recognized for every host form variant. The table rows are grouped by the clitic (first column) starting the clitic pair combination.","Verb-clitic form lexicalization:","In accordance with some aspects of the present invention, not all verb-clitic attachments are handled via segmentation. For different reasons (conflict with another inflected verbal form, irregular inflection pattern, etc.), some of the forms are treated as lexicalized entries to the lexicon. In such cases, the whole verb-clitic form string is included in the full form lexicon. These are treated as regular entries by the spell checker. However, for word breaking, they are annotated with the clitic host and information about the length of the segments, so that the output is the same as for cases treated by segmentation. Consider the following example (note, the Seg bits referred to in this example are defined in Tables 5 and 6 described below, and further discussed in Tables 7 and 8 also described below):","Segments in the Lexicon:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0012","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0012-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0013","list-style":"none"},"li":["c\u00e1ntalo \u2018sing it\u2019:\n        \n        ","cantaos \u2018sing to yourselves\u2019:\n        \n        "]}}}},"For lexicalized forms, the DoNotVerify bit is not applicable. They are annotated with information about the length of the segments and their base form. This is how the entries for the lexicalized verb-clitic forms cantaos \u2018sing to yourselves\u2019, un\u00edosle \u2018join him\u2019, prevelo \u2018foresee it\u2019, and p\u00f3ntelo \u2018put it on\u2019 will be entered in the full form lexicon:","cantaos Segs=5 Baseform=cantad","uniosle Segs=3,2 Baseform=unid","prevelo Segs=5 Baseform=prev\u00e9","p\u00f3ntelo Segs=3,2 Baseform=pon","Another way of considering lexicalized forms or lexicalized entries is to define them as an entry of the type which would ordinarily participate in this process (verbal forms+clitics or clitic pairs), but which is added to the lexicon as a single entry or unit instead of as a clitic host variant annotated for its clitic combination. The main objective of this invention is to avoid putting the full forms of verb-clitic combinations in the lexicon, thus significantly reducing the lexicon size. However, there are some special cases that, when treated as lexicalized entries, greatly reduce the run-time processing.","In the case of the four cases of lexicalized verb-clitic forms shown above, they are lexicalized because either some conflict with an existing verbal form or some irregularity in the form of the word makes it more efficient to do so. For purposes of spell checking, the lexicalized entries are all that is needed because they appear in the lexicon just as they would appear in input text. For purposes of word breaking, they have to be annotated with (1) information on where to segment; and (2) what baseform to return. For example, consider the fourth lexicalized entry \u201cp\u00f3ntelo\u201d. It has three segments \u201cpon\u201d \u201cte\u201d and \u201clo\u201d. \u201cP\u00f3ntelo\u201d is lexicalized and annotated with a Segs entry Segs=3,2. This means, to segment the form, divide it after the third character (i.e., to obtain \u201cpon\u201d), and then divide it again two characters later (i.e., to obtain \u201cte\u201d and \u201clo\u201d). It is also annotated with the baseform word \u201cpon\u201d (without the accent mark), which is the standard form of this clitic host. This is a case of linguistic exception handling.","One of the reasons for the lexicalizations is the intent to use the same full form lexicon for other applications. Lemma is another piece of information that one would want to extract from the lexicon entries. In order to keep the full form lexicon at a manageable size, and to avoid wrong interactions between clitic host variant forms and lemmas, lexicalization is used to handle all the cases where the clitic host variant differs from the clitic host but coincides with a correct inflection of the verb.","A class of cases treated by lexicalization, of which the previously discussed \u201cp\u00f3ntelo\u201d is an example, is that of some irregular Imperative forms which don't follow the general rules for the placement of the accent mark when combined with clitics.","E.g.:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0020","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0020-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0021","list-style":"none"},"li":["monosyllabic:\n        \n        ","accent in the last syllable:\n        \n        "]}}}},"In an embodiment of the present invention for Spanish verb-clitic attachment analysis, 10 Seg bits are used along with the DoNotVerify bit. These 10 Seg bits are also part of the Dynamic Segmentation Bits Field. The maximum number of Seg bits per entry is 6 or 7 if counting the DoNotVerify bit. Note that this maximum appears only in clitics and clitic pairs, which are a small set of 47 entries. The maximum number of Seg bits per clitic host variant, which are counted by the thousands, is only 2, or 3 if counting the DoNotVerify bit.","Table 5 shown in  explains all the bits used to categorize all clitic host variants and clitic forms. They are grouped in three bit classes. \u201cClitic class\u201d bits differentiate among the sets of clitics that combine with each clitic host variant. The \u201cApplies to\u201d column of Table 5 relates or associates the clitic classes to types of host form variants. Examples (e.g., cantar and cant\u00e1ndo) are also provided, though the classifications are not limited to these examples. The other two classes, \u201cFinal Segment\u201d and DoNotVerify\u201d contain only one bit, as presented in the table. Table 6 shown in  illustrates the bits assigned to single clitics and clitic pairs. Note that some of the double clitic forms in the table will also need to carry the DoNotVerify bit, even though this bit is not illustrated in Table 6. It must also be noted that the names of these bits (or fields or properties) are not of particular relevance. Instead, the names provided (e.g., Seg) are just examples, and can be replaced with other names.","As can be seen in Tables 5 and 6, the Seg bit applies only to the single clitic \u201cos\u201d and a small number of clitic host variants that very often coincide with other valid inflected verb forms. In one embodiment provided for illustrative purposes, these verb-clitic forms were lexicalized in order to avoid the ambiguity between clitic host variants and other inflected forms. This is marked in the table with an asterisk.","Verbal Classes:","In Spanish, there are three main verbal inflectional classes: verbs ending in -ar, -er and -ir. Although linguistically treated as part of the -ir class, for the purpose of verb-clitic form analysis, verbs ending in -ir are considered a separate class due to their different accentuation patterns.","Given the above set of bits, Table 7 shown in  presents all the clitic host form variants needed to fully illustrate each of the above verb classes and their bits. The table includes also the host forms which are to be emitted for word breaking for each of the host form variants. For most verbs, it is necessary to add nine DoNotVerify clitic host variants to the full form lexicon. For some, fewer DoNotVerify lexicon entries are needed.","As discussed previously, clitic host variants which are marked with an * symbol in Table 7 will not appear as separate entries in the full form lexicon to avoid having clitic host variants that are equal to other valid stand-alone inflected verbal forms. Instead, these forms will appear lexicalized as verb-clitic forms in the lexicon.","Building the Full Form Lexicon",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0130"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["500","510","515","515","520","520","525","520","9","525","308"]},"The lemmas  used by the morphological module  come from a database  of lemmas that also include some lexicalized irregular forms (as well as prepositions and adverbs which don't inflect). These forms  go directly to the lexicon . The morphological module  also produces inflections  for nouns and adjectives, which also go directly to the lexicon . Not all the inflected verbal forms are transformed in the Host Variant Generator. Most of them are included into lexicon  without further alternation.","Some of the clitic host forms are too irregular to be generated by means of a morphological process. Since this is not a long list, their correspondent clitic host variants and lexicalized verb-clitic forms can be generated by hand. This list, as well as the list of clitics and clitic pairs, is added to the full form lexicon as well.","Verb-clitic form candidate","For performance's sake, it is not necessary to consider all forms for verb-clitic analysis. For example, the system can identify possible candidates using a test on the length of the form. In one embodiment, to be a verb-clitic candidate, the form must be between 4 and 19 characters in length. Other length ranges can be used as well. More complex candidate filtering techniques can also be used.","Example Text Analyzer Systems","Referring now to , shown is method and system  for performing static verb-clitic form analysis in a word breaker scenario. This system can be implemented, for example, in text analyzer  shown in . Given an input string or form , the task is to see if it is a possible verb-clitic combination, and if it is, then to output the segments of that verb-clitic combination. At decision point or component , a verb-clitic candidate screening test is performed. As discussed above, in some embodiments, the test is a string or form length test. For example, anything between 4 and 19 characters in length is considered as a potential verb-clitic candidate. Again, different length ranges are possible in other embodiments. Also, this test can be based on criteria other than length in other embodiments.","If the input form is determined at  to not be a verb-clitic candidate, then the analysis ends. If the input form passes the candidate test at , it is checked at step or component  for matches with entries in the full form lexicon . If there is a complete match with an entry in the full form lexicon, at step or component  a determination is made as to whether the match has segments. If the match has segments (i.e., one or more of the Segs= or breaking point attributes discussed above has a value), then it is one of the lexicalized verb-clitic words, and at step or component , the segments and baseform of that match are output. If at  it is found that the Segs= attribute is empty (i.e., doesn't have a value) or is absent, then there are no known segments, and the input form is not a verb-clitic word.","If at  it is determined that no match exists in the lexicon, the input form is provided to a static verb-clitic analysis algorithm or component . This algorithm or component implements the segment checking aspects of the invention described above to see if the input form is a valid verb-clitic form or word. If there are two entries in the full form lexicon that concatenated match the input string and these entries have matching segment attributes (i.e., the Segment types match and the final segment has a Seg attribute and the first segment does not) as determined at decision point or component , then the segments and the baseform are output and the analysis is complete. If the segments don't match, the analysis ends and the input form is not considered a verb-clitic form for word breaking purposes.","Referring now to , shown is method and system  for performing static verb-clitic form analysis in a spell checker scenario. This system can also be implemented, for example, in text analyzer  shown in . Given an input string or form , it is compared to entries in the full form lexicon  to see whether a match exists. If at decision point or component  it is determined that there does exist a match of the input form with an entry in the full form lexicon, then the input form is spelled correctly and the analysis is completed. The input form could be a noun or other words found in the lexicon, or it could be a verb-clitic form which has been lexicalized.","If at  it is determined that no match exists in the lexicon, then at decision point or component , a verb-clitic candidate screening test is performed. As discussed above with reference to the word breaker scenario, this test can be a form length test. For example, anything between 4 and 19 characters in length is considered as a potential verb-clitic candidate. In this event, the input form is provided to a static verb-clitic analysis algorithm or component  which is similar or identical to component  shown in . This algorithm or component implements the segment checking aspects of the invention described above to see if the input form is a valid verb-clitic form or word. If there are two entries in the full form lexicon that concatenated match the input string and these entries have matching segment attributes (i.e., the Segment types match and the final segment has a Seg attribute and the first segment does not) as determined at decision point or component , then the input form  is recognized as a valid verb-clitic form, and it passes the spell check. If the segments don't match at , or if the input form fails the verb-clitic candidate test at , then the input form goes to the spell checker module or component . The spell checker  attempts to make suggestions for misspellings (using editing distance or other algorithms). If it can't make a suggestion as determined at decision point or component , the analysis is complete and the input form is flagged as being misspelled, but without recommended corrections. If the spell checker can make a suggestion, the suggestions must be checked again through the full form lexicon and it repeats through another iteration.","As an example, if the input form was \u201ccantandome\u201d, it would be a misspelled verb-clitic form since the only host variant form of the host form \u201ccantando\u201d is \u201ccant\u00e1ndo\u201d. In other words, it is missing the accent, which is a very common type of misspelling in Spanish. The spell checker  would suggest adding an accent to that form. Then the process is repeated and it is found that the suggested correction is made up of two valid segments and that the segments satisfy the matching requirements.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 13"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
