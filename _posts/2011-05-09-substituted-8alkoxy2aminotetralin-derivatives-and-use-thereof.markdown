{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel substituted 8-alkoxy-2-aminotetraline derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to their use for the treatment and\/or prevention of diseases and to their use for preparing medicaments for the treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, in particular for the treatment and\/or prevention of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitric oxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyze the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one heme per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of heme and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Heme-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to attach to the central iron atom of heme, but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.","Through the production of cGMP and the regulation, resulting therefrom, of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system may be suppressed, which may lead for example to high blood pressure, platelet activation, increased cellular proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, thromboses, stroke and myocardial infarction.","A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.","Compounds, such as organic nitrates, whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of heme. Besides the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment [O. V. Evgenov et al., 5 (2006), 755].","Substances which directly stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase, i.e. without previous release of NO, have been identified in recent years. The indazole derivative YC-1 was the first NO-independent but heme-dependent sGC stimulator described [Evgenov et al., ibid.]. Based on YC-1, further substances were discovered which are more potent than YC-1 and show no relevant inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE). This led to the identification of the pyrazolopyridine derivatives BAY 41-2272, BAY 41-8543 and BAY 63-2521. Together with the recently published structurally different substances CMF-1571 and A-350619, these compounds form the new class of the sGC stimulators [Evgenov et al., ibid.]. A common characteristic of this substance class is an NO-independent and selective activation of the heme-containing sGC. In addition, the sGC stimulators in combination with NO have a synergistic effect on sGC activation based on a stabilization of the nitrosyl-heme complex. The exact binding site of the sGC stimulators at the sGC is still being debated. If the heme group is removed from the soluble guanylate cyclase, the enzyme still has a detectable catalytic basal activity, i.e. cGMP is still being formed. The remaining catalytic basal activity of the heme-free enzyme cannot be stimulated by any of the stimulators mentioned above [Evgenov et al., ibid.].","In addition, NO\u2014 and heme-independent sGC activators, with BAY 58-2667 as prototype of this class, have been identified. Common characteristics of these substances are that in combination with NO they only have an additive effect on enzyme activation, and that the activation of the oxidized or heme-free enzyme is markedly higher than that of the heme-containing enzyme [Evgenov et al., ibid.; J. P. Stasch et al., 136 (2002), 773; J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552]. Spectroscopic studies show that BAY 58-2667 displaces the oxidized heme group which, as a result of the weakening of the iron-histidine bond, is attached only weakly to the sGC. It has also been shown that the characteristic sGC heme binding motif Tyr-x-Ser-x-Arg is absolutely essential both for the interaction of the negatively charged propionic acids of the heme group and for the action of BAY 58-2667. Against this background, it is assumed that the binding site of BAY 58-2667 at the sGC is identical to the binding site of the heme group [J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552].","It was an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds which act as NO\u2014 and heme-independent activators of soluble guanylate cyclase in the manner described above and can be used as such in particular for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disorders.","Various aminodicarboxylic acid derivatives for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders have previously been described in WO 01\/19780-A2, WO 02\/070459-A1, WO 02\/070460-A1, WO 02\/070461-A1, WO 02\/070462-A1 and WO 02\/070510-A2. 2-Aminotetraline derivatives which can be used therapeutically in particular for CNS disorders are known from EP 0 041 488-A1, EP 0 064 964-A1, EP 0 270 947-A2, EP 0 272 534-A2, WO 90\/15047-A1, FR 2 659 853-A1, WO 99\/62505-A2 and WO 2005\/012291-A1.","The present invention now provides a compound of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"34.80mm","wi":"70.27mm","file":"US08673903-20140318-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{}],"sup":"1 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"40.56mm","wi":"43.86mm","file":"US08673903-20140318-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["in which","* denotes the respective point of attachment to the remainder of the molecule,","Lrepresents straight-chain (C-C)-alkanediyl which may be mono- or disubstituted by methyl and mono- or disubstituted by fluorine,","Z represents hydrogen, fluorine, cyano, trifluoromethyl or a group of the formula"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"18.03mm","wi":"21.17mm","file":"US08673903-20140318-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["\u2003in which\n        \n        ","Lrepresents a bond or straight-chain (C-C)-alkanediyl,","Ar represents phenyl or 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl having up to three ring heteroatoms from the group consisting of N, O and S,","Rrepresents a substituent selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, cyano, (C-C)-alkyl, trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkoxy and trifluoromethoxy,","P represents the number 0, 1 or 2,\n        \n        ","Lrepresents a bond, \u2014O\u2014, \u2014CH\u2014, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014 or \u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014","and","Rand Rindependently of one another represent hydrogen or a substituent selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, cyano, (C-C)-alkyl, trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkoxy and trifluoromethoxy,\n\nand the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof.\n"]}}}},"Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, the compounds included in the formula (I) of the formulae mentioned in the following and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, and the compounds included in the formula (I) and mentioned in the following as embodiment examples and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, where the compounds included in the formula (I) and mentioned in the following are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","Depending on their structure, the compounds according to the invention may exist in different stereoisomeric forms, i.e. in the form of configurational isomers or if appropriate also as conformational isomers (enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, including those in the case of atropisomers).

Vasorelaxant Effect In Vitro:","Rabbits are anesthetized and sacrificed by intravenous injection of thiopental sodium (about 50 mg\/kg) and exsanguinated. The saphenous artery is removed and divided into rings 3 mm wide. The rings are mounted singly on in each case a pair of triangular hooks open at the end and made of 0.3 mm-thick special wire (Remanium\u00ae). Each ring is placed under an initial tension in 5 ml organ baths with Krebs-Henseleit solution which is at 37\u00b0 C., is gassed with carbogen and has the following composition: NaCl 119 mM; KCl 4.8 mM; CaCl\u00d72 HO 1 mM; MgSO\u00d77 HO 1.4 mM; KHPO1.2 mM; NaHCO25 mM; glucose 10 mM; bovine serum albumin 0.001%.

Contractions are induced by addition of phenylephrine.","After several (generally 4) control cycles, the substance to be investigated is added in each further run in increasing dosage, and the level of the contraction achieved under the influence of the test substance is compared with the level of the contraction reached in the last preceding run. The concentration necessary to reduce the contraction reached in the preceding control by 50% is calculated from this (IC). The standard application volume is 5 \u03bcl.

Radiotelemetric Measurement of Blood Pressure and Heart Rate on Conscious SH Rats","A commercially available telemetry system from Data Sciences International DSI, USA, is employed for the measurements on conscious SH rats described below.","The system consists of 3 main components: (1) implantable transmitters, (2) receivers, which are linked via a multiplexer to a (3) data acquisition computer. The telemetry system makes it possible to continuously record the blood pressure and heart rate of conscious animals in their usual habitat.","The investigations are carried out on adult female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SH rats) with a body weight of >200 g. After transmitter implantation, the experimental animals are housed singly in type 3 Makrolon cages. They have free access to standard feed and water. The day\/night rhythm in the experimental laboratory is changed by the room lighting at 6.00 am and at 7.00 pm.","The telemetry transmitters (TAM PA-C40, DSI) employed are surgically implanted under aseptic conditions in the experimental animals at least 14 days before the first experimental use. The animals instrumented in this way can be employed repeatedly after the wound has healed and the implant has settled.","For the implantation, the fasted animals are anesthetized with pentobarbital (Nembutal, Sanofi, 50 mg\/kg i.p.) and shaved and disinfected over a large area of their abdomens. After the abdominal cavity has been opened along the linea alba, the liquid-filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted into the descending aorta in the cranial direction above the bifurcation and fixed with tissue glue (VetBonD\u2122, 3M). The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally to the abdominal wall muscle, and layered closure of the wound is performed. An antibiotic (Tardomyocel COMP, Bayer AG, 1 ml\/kg s.c.) is administered postoperatively for prophylaxis of infection.","Outline of Experiment:","The substances to be investigated are administered orally by gavage in each case to a group of animals (n=6). The test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures, or suspended in 0.5% strength Tylose, appropriate for an administration volume of 5 ml\/kg of body weight. A solvent-treated group of animals is employed as control.","The telemetry measuring unit is configured for 24 animals. Each experiment is recorded under an experiment number.","Each of the instrumented rats living in the system is assigned a separate receiving antenna (1010 Receiver, DSI). The implanted transmitters can be activated externally by means of an incorporated magnetic switch and are switched to transmission in the run-up to the experiment. The emitted signals can be detected online by a data acquisition system (Dataquest\u2122 A.R.T. for Windows, DSI) and be appropriately processed. The data are stored in each case in a file created for this purpose and bearing the experiment number.","In the standard procedure, the following are measured for 10-second periods in each case: (1) systolic blood pressure (SBP), (2) diastolic blood pressure (DBP), (3) mean arterial pressure (MAP) and (4) heart rate (HR).","The acquisition of measured values is repeated under computer control at 5-minute intervals. The source data obtained as absolute value are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure and stored as individual data. Further technical details are given in the documentation from the manufacturing company (DSI).","The test substances are administered at 9.00 am on the day of the experiment. Following the administration, the parameters described above are measured over 24 hours. After the end of the experiment, the acquired individual data are sorted using the analysis software (Dataquest\u2122 A.R.T. Analysis). The void value is assumed to be the time 2 hours before administration of the substance, so that the selected data set includes the period from 7.00 am on the day of the experiment to 9.00 am on the following day.","The data are smoothed over a presettable time by determination of the average (15-minute average, 30-minute average) and transferred as a text file to a storage medium. The measured values presorted and compressed in this way are transferred into Excel templates and tabulated.","The compounds according to the invention can be converted into pharmaceutical preparations in the following ways:","Tablet:","Composition:","100 mg of the compound according to the invention, 50 mg of lactose (monohydrate), 50 mg of maize starch (native), 10 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP 25) (from BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) and 2 mg of magnesium stearate.","Tablet weight 212 mg, diameter 8 mm, radius of curvature 12 mm.","Production:","The mixture of compound according to the invention, lactose and starch is granulated with a 5% strength solution (m\/m) of the PVP in water.
