{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a divisional of prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/040,894 filed Mar. 2, 2008 claiming the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/892,654 filed Mar. 2, 2007, which prior applications are hereby incorporated by referenced.","The invention relates to Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems and other forms (including checks) processing, particularly for data capture systems, including such activities as manual data entry from image or paper, recognition technologies (OCR, ICR, OMR, etc) that automatically capture data from image, data quality evaluations, and downstream business process performance quality evaluations.","System performance in forms processing is typically measured through \u201cinside out\u201d or \u201cwhite box\u201d test scripting or costly 100% inspection scenarios. System level testing from ingest to population of the content management system is generally not performed, nor is statistical process control employed. This is primarily due to the lack of suitable test materials having a perfectly known result or \u201ctruth\u201d with which to compare system performance results, particularly in sufficient quantities to allow statistically valid conclusions.","We have solved the above problems with this invention, which makes possible \u201coutside in\u201d or \u201cblack box\u201d testing and cost-effective sampling for process quality assurance. This enables system level testing of all (or portions of) a forms data capture system and provides valid data for statistical process control. A preferred element of this invention is the incorporation of special engineered test materials such as a Digital Test Deck\u00ae, available from ADI, LLC of Rochester, N.Y., which simulates a collection of real forms filled out by respondents, but for which the \u201ctruth\u201d is already known, thus rendering unnecessary the laborious and expensive \u201ctruthing\u201d of large volumes of actual production data. However, the use of production image snippets for which the correct answers have been determined (i.e., they have been \u201ctruthed\u201d) is also possible in the scope of this invention, if desired.","The invention is preferably practiced by incorporation of a Digital Test Deck\u00ae such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/933,002 for HANDPRINT RECOGNITION TEST DECK, published on Mar. 2, 2006 under the publication number U.S. 2006\/0045344 A1 and hereby incorporated by reference.","Our invention enables real-time measurement and modeling of system characteristics as part of the workflow of a current Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system or any other forms processing data capture system. With the ingest of special engineered test materials, such as a Digital Test Deck\u00ae, and other system operating parameters, flagged test information will become part of the content repository, date and time stamped with other typical content metadata. While some of the examples specifically reference the Digital Test Deck\u00ae, other engineered test materials can be used.","With the integration of our software into the Enterprise Service Bus or other workflow manager, one can conveniently measure system performance at any point in time. One will also be able to calculate a cost per form based on measured data, (such as the operation point of the OCR engine) as well as reduce the costs associated with traditional inspection processes through the deployment of statistical process control. System level testing can be deployed to measure and validate any changes or improvements made to the forms processing or data entry system.","A primary aspect of our invention is to enable cost-effective, statistically valid, real-time measurement and modeling of system characteristics as an integrated part of the workflow of a current Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system or any other forms processing data capture system.","Another aspect of our invention is that with the ingest of special engineered test materials, such as a Digital Test Deck\u00ae, for which the truth is perfectly known, along with other system operating parameters, flagged test information will become part of the content repository, date and time stamped with other typical content metadata. This test information, consisting of the data capture system's inferences about the true contents of the forms being \u201cread\u201d, may then be compared to the perfectly known truth to score the accuracy of the data capture system's inferences. While some of the examples specifically reference the Digital Test Deck\u00ae, any specially created test materials could be used, if they are sufficiently well \u201ctruthed\u201d and of sufficient quantity to allow statistically valid testing.","Another aspect is that with the integration of our invention into the Enterprise Service Bus or other workflow manager, one can conveniently and cost-effectively measure data capture system performance at any point in time.","Another aspect of our invention is to be able to calculate a processing cost per form based on measured data, (such as the operation point of the OCR engine).","A further aspect is to deploy system level testing to measure and validate any changes or improvements made to the forms processing or data entry system.","An additional aspect of our invention is to allow evaluation of the outputs of just the machine interpreting, or the outputs of human interpreting, or both, in addition the final data capture system outputs.","Another aspect is to allow comparison of data capture system performance over time and from place to place.","Another aspect is to make possible the comparison of two different data capture systems, as might be desired in a proposal and bidding process. This would a fair comparison, as both systems would be inferring the contents of the same data sets.","In addition to scoring data capture accuracy, another aspect of this invention is to enable evaluating data mining systems by designing the test materials to evaluate the internal logic of the systems, such as, testing to see if a document with certain properties is \u201cdiscovered\u201d by the process.","As shown in , integration of the AIMED@Q\u2122 module  seamlessly into an existing data capture system  will allow users to routinely and automatically verify and track system output data quality. This may be accomplished in several ways, the most basic of which is to use a Digital Test Deck\u00ae as input forms  to the existing data capture system . This test deck of forms, by design, having perfectly known \u201ctruth\u201d, is the most cost-effective way to measure the performance of a data capture system. The forms first pass through a scanning step , and the electronic images of the forms  are sent to the OCR subsystem . (Alternatively, an electronic image deck could be sent directly to OCR if only software tests are desired). The OCR engine  (or ICR, if you prefer), as is well-known by practitioners of the data processing art, then examines the form image and creates an estimate of what is written in the field in question, along with a confidence value. If this confidence value is equal to or greater than the confidence threshold set by the data capture system administrator, then that field is accepted  and is sent on to reside in a data merge server . Humans typically never see these accepted fields, and their corresponding computer data is sent on to the system database  where users  may access the data for their downstream business processes.","If a field does not have a confidence value greater than the confidence threshold, then it is rejected  and sent to human Keyers who perform Key From Image (KFI)  to capture the data from that field. The resultant keyed fields  are then sent to data merge  to be combined with the accepted fields  and stored in the database . The combination of the accepted fields  and the keyed fields  are the total data captured by the existing data capture system . This total data contains two sources of error: one is the error made by the OCR (or ICR) subsystem, and the other is the error produced by the human Keyers. In order to measure these errors, the OCR accepted fields are sampled  and so are the keyed fields  and sent to the AIMED@Q\u2122 ADI Scoring Module  for analysis. In the case of using a Digital Test Deck\u00ae as input forms, one may choose to sample everything in the deck. (In the case of scoring production data, it is typical to use a sample size that is much smaller than the total production data population, but still statistically valid). By analyzing and counting the errors coming from OCR and KFI, and by counting the number of fields that are accepted relative to the number of fields processed, one can also estimate the total error in the merged data  as was taught in our referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/933,002 for a Handprint Recognition Test Deck.","The AIMED@Q\u2122 Subsystem may also be used to score production data, but unlike like the above example of using a Digital Test Deck\u00ae, where the truth is perfectly known, the \u201ctruth\u201d of the sampled production data set must first be determined, that is, one must determine the correct answers to the fields that are sampled for analysis. This is a laborious and time-consuming process, usually involving double keying and verifying to get at the correct answers for the sampled fields. Fields selected to be keyed for QA purposes  may then be sent to KFI for keying, whether they originate from OCR accepted fields  or OCR rejected fields . So if a Keyer, say K, keys from the image snippet of a field selected for QA sampling from the OCR accepted fields , and the resultant ASCII data agrees with the result from OCR, than the OCR field is deemed correct. If the result from K does not agree with the OCR result, then we have an inconclusive situation regarding the correct answer, and then another Keyer, say K, is asked to key the same snippet, and if the results from K agree with the OCR, then the OCR is deemed correct. If K agrees with K and not the OCR, then the OCR result is incorrect, and so on. Although such double keying has been practiced in the data capture art prior to this invention, the use of the AIMED@Q\u2122 subsystem  integrated with an existing data capture system  makes it very easy and cost-effective to implement this approach to measure the quality of production data.","If a sampled keyed field from KFI  is selected for QA, keyed originally say by Keyer K, then another Keyer K is independently asked to key the same field image snippet, and if those two resultant ASCII fields agree, then K is deemed correct. If K and K disagree, then we have an inconclusive situation regarding the correct answer, and a third Keyer, say K, may be employed to attempt to determine the correct answer. If all three Keyers disagree, then this field is usually called \u201cambiguous\u201d, and removed from the scoring process. Another advantage of using AIMED@Q\u2122  integrated with the existing data capture system  is the convenient access to OCR rejected fields to assist in QA. By using the data from the OCR's rejected fields , one can obtain some additional efficiency in determining the truth of production data by realizing that a substantial amount (often as much as half) of the OCR rejected fields is actually correct, even though rejected. By first comparing the first Keyer K result with the OCR rejected field, a match would indicate, with no additional labor, that K was correct. In the case where they do not match, then the above procedure may be used as described.","If the amount of production data to be scored is sufficient, the ADI Scoring module  may be enhanced by the addition of another OCR engine to determine a provisional data file to use in determining the truth of the data set being scored. In this application, the extra OCR engine is used in much the same way as K above, except it is much faster and costs less. The field-level results from the extra OCR engine may be compared with the data from the existing data capture system , and if these two ASCII data fields agree, one can declare the existing data capture system to be correct for that field, etc. Human Keyers are brought in only in the case of a disagreement, in which case they can determine which of the two fields are correct, or if neither is correct, key the correct entry. We call this approach \u201cProduction Data Quality\u201d (PDQ\u2122, a product available from ADI, LLC of Rochester, N.Y.) and because it uses automation to help get at the truth of a data file, it is a very cost-effective way to assess production data quality.","In many data capture systems, it is common to associate a group of forms in is what is called a \u201cbatch\u201d, say, of  paper forms of a given size. If it is desired to analyze production data in the existing data capture system  at the batch level for purposes of performing quality assurance on each batch, then the ADI Scoring Module  may be enhanced to perform that function as well, since all the necessary data interfaces and architectures are present. The additional data that must be used is to keep track of batches in production, and to apply a sampling plan to determine if a given batch is acceptable. There are many ways to devise such sampling plans that are well known in the statistical art, but to apply them they usually come down to specifying a batch sample size and a maximum number of errors in the sample that would allow batch acceptance.","Operation on Desktop or in a Client Server Environment","The software may be run in a standalone mode as part of a desktop or distributed client service network as a shared application.","Operation Integrated into Current Workflows and Content Management Systems","As shown in , Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) will be exposed for each Functional Element of the Services Software Module. The API's can be exposed at three levels for each Functional Element, deep, middle, and shallow. The middle API's will be a logical consolidation of the deep API's while the shallow API's will be a logical combination of the middle and deep. A custom negotiator can be written for the legacy system, current workflow, or software of an Independent Software Vendor (ISV) integration. For the initial functionality of AIMED@Q\u2122, only one API level may need to be exposed due to the simple nature of this initial version of the software.","User interfaces, workflow, and security will be outside the scope of this software module, as they will be provided as functionality within the context of the larger document imaging or ECM system, with the exception of software protection for the purpose of tracking and collecting licensing fees.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"AIMED@Q\u2009\u2122","This mark is used in connection with the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Services Software Module; Automatic"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Integration and Management of Enterprise"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Data Quality"]},{"entry":[{},"ECM","Enterprise Content Management"]},{"entry":[{},"API","Application Programming Interface"]},{"entry":[{},"ESB","Enterprise Service Bus"]},{"entry":[{},"RBA","Rules Based Automation"]},{"entry":[{},"Workflow","Either application specific workflow software"]},{"entry":[{},"Software","such as a Filenet system or AnyDoc, or"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Customizable workflow software contained"]},{"entry":[{},{},"within the ESB."]},{"entry":[{},"ISV","Independent Software Vendor"]},{"entry":[{},"XML","Extended Markup Language"]},{"entry":[{},"SOA","Service Oriented Architecture"]},{"entry":[{},"PDQ\u2009\u2122","Production Data Quality monitoring.

Benefits include:\n\n","Another variation on this invention is to use a business rules-based engine that sits off the ESB or workflow software layer internal to the ECM system, which typically stores, or has the ability to create encapsulated information files. These files are utilized for various downstream workflow processes. This invention is to seed the ECM system with data files that would have a predetermined answer based on the requirements of the downstream workflow processes. At a statistically valid cadence, flagged test paper or electronic content would be ingested into the workflow to reside in the depository. Automatic electronic auditing would be performed at many or all of the user group access points and compared to our previously known truth for validity. The statistics and content of the rules engine would be varied depending on current or assumed error rates, necessary time frames to catch workflow errors, desired confidence levels, and other customer-defined requirements. Part of the value here is that content in an ECM system is typically changed and repurposed; physical storage layers are modified, storage software, workflow and content ownership, encryption security layers and so on all change over time and result in changes to content. This auditing and data quality management system would be focused on information after the conversion process but internal to the ECM system. An advantage of this type of software system is that it can run in the background with no manual intervention, providing reports, trends, and other information automatically, and would only need to be refreshed periodically as new content types are ingested into the ECM system.","An example would be the e-Discovery process for legal applications. Typically e-mails are the first set of information sets to be collected, as they are organized and managed and therefore can be discovered. For a Lotus Notes application, a Zantac e-mail server and software application serves this purpose. Encapsulated files pulled from the Zantac system are denoted as \u201c.nsf\u201d files. Encapsulated \u201c.nsf\u201d files would be created as DTD Data Files and placed on the Zantac server. The files would be created in such as way as to statistically test the 60 some odd requirements of the discovery process for e-Discovery of the Zantac system. These requirements include things such as removing e-mails that are privileged (husband and wife, or attorney communications), correctly organizing the information, and correctly identifying \u201chot docs\u201d with certain predefined key words contained within the e-mails or attachments. When litigation is instigated, the DTD data files would be included in the discovery process. During the final quality checks before the \u201c.nsf\u201d files are produced, the files would be compared to the known pre-determined answers, and removed from the submitted discovery package. Risk would be significantly decreased, as you now have an audited process and understand if you are not producing information you are legally required to produce, and\/or are producing information you should not, either of which could cause you to lose the case.","Simulated Data to Check Process Rule Performance","Much of the above description deals with measuring data accuracy, such as to what extent does a data capture system correctly recognize a hand printed character string? It is an additional benefit of this invention that the simulated data may also be created in such a way as to test the system's internal logic and\/or the ability of humans associated with the process to follow the necessary business rules. Some examples of how this is done are instructive.","For example, in the case of a census survey, the respondent might be expected to write the number of people in a household in a two-digit numerical field called, say, \u201cpop\u201d, and then write data about each person in the household in a section of the census form called, say, a \u201cperson block\u201d. Normally, then, you would expect that the number in the \u201cpop\u201d field would be the same as the number of person blocks that contained data. However, it often happens that the \u201cpop\u201d field says, for example, \u201c05\u201d, but there are, say, six person blocks actually containing data. In this case, this form image is supposed to be automatically presented on a computer screen to a human analyst, who attempts to resolve the possible discrepancy. If we wish to test the extent to which the data processing system is correctly presenting form images to the analysts, we would intentionally put \u201c05\u201d in the \u201cpop\u201d field on a simulated form but with six person blocks filled out with data. In a very large test set with thousands of simulated household forms, we could place, say, 100 forms in the test deck that intentionally have this discrepancy, and test to see if all 100 get to the analysts, or if only 90 forms do, (or even if 110 forms are presented). This sort of test would be looking for issues with the inherent system logical performance.","There are also people involved in capturing census data, and in addition to keying the handprint fields accurately, they are expected to follow certain \u201ckeying rules\u201d. Our simulated data sets may also test to see if the keyers, either individually, or as groups, are following these rules. For example, keyers may be told that if they see someone print \u201cFIVE\u201d in the \u201cpop\u201d field (where numbers are expected, not letters), then they are supposed to key the digits \u201c05\u201d, assuming the intent of the respondent was clear. We can test for the extent to which keyers follow this rule by intentionally placing the character string \u201cFIVE\u201d in a \u201cpop\u201d numeric field, and seeing if the resultant output ASCII data string contains a \u201c05\u201d, as it should if the keying rule was followed correctly.","Although the above description is given with respect to preferred embodiments, one skilled in the art of forms processing data capture will employ various modifications and generalizations to meet specific system needs. For example, although basic forms are discussed above, this invention clearly applies to other types of documents, such as bank checks, shipping labels, health claim forms, beneficiary forms, invoices, and other varieties of printed forms. The type of data being captured, in addition to handprint, could also be machine print, cursive writing, marks in check boxes, filled-in ovals, MICR font characters, barcodes, etc. The special test materials might include printed test decks, or in some cases, when testing only a sub-system of the overall forms processing system such as keying, just the electronic \u201csnippets\u201d or images of these forms may suffice. The special test materials for which the truth is perfectly known by design may be used, and\/or it is possible to determine the truth of a collection of real production data if that is desired."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
