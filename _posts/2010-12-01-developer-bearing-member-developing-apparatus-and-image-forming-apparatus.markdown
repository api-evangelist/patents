{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a developer bearing member for developing an electrostatic latent image formed on an image bearing member with one-component developer, a developing apparatus including the image bearing member, and an image forming apparatus.","2. Description of the Related Art","Various developing apparatuses are known in which one-component developer (hereinafter referred to as \u201ctoner\u201d) is coated in thin layer on a developer bearing member, a developing bias is applied to the developer bearing member, an electrostatic latent image formed on an image bearing member is developed with the one-component developer using an electrophotographic method or the like, and the electrostatic latent image is made visible.","As the one-component developer, there are a magnetic one-component developer including magnetic particles (hereinafter referred to as \u201cmagnetic toner\u201d) and a non-magnetic one-component developer including no magnetic particle (hereinafter referred to as \u201cnon-magnetic toner\u201d). However, the one-component developer is not limited to a developer including only toner particles, but may be a developer including one or a plurality of auxiliary materials which can improve fluidity of the developer, limit the amount of charge of the toner, clean the surface of the image bearing member, and so forth.","In the developing method using the non-magnetic toner, a particularly clear color copy can be obtained and image fixability is improved, so that various proposals are presented. For example, a general configuration of a conventional developing apparatus using non-magnetic toner will be described. The non-magnetic toner is contained in a developer container, and is coated uniformly in thin layer on a rotating developer bearing member (hereinafter referred to as \u201cdeveloping sleeve\u201d) by the developing sleeve and an elastic blade. The distance between the image bearing member and the developing sleeve is 0.02 to 0.3 mm at a developing area and an electrostatic latent image formed on the image bearing member is made visible with the non-magnetic toner at the developing area.","At this time, a pulse bias, an AC bias, or the like is applied to the developing sleeve by a developing bias power supply. In a developing apparatus using a non-magnetic toner, no magnetic particle is included in the toner, so that insulating capacity of the toner is higher than that of a magnetic one-component developer. In particular, when image development is frequently and repeatedly performed, a specific charge amount of toner increases (charge up), the developing sleeve is contaminated, and toner cohesion on the developing sleeve increases.","A developing apparatus using a magnetic toner includes a developing magnet long in the axis direction inside the developing sleeve. The magnetic toner rotates on the developing sleeve, contacts the developing sleeve, and slides on the developing sleeve, so that the magnetic toner can uniformly obtain sufficient electric charge to develop an image from the developing sleeve. However, a non-magnetic one-component toner has few opportunities to obtain electric charge by such rotation, contact, and sliding, so that it is difficult for the non-magnetic one-component toner to obtain sufficient electric charge uniformly. Therefore, a problem may arise in that the developing density is not uniform.","In addition, another problem may arise, which is a phenomenon called sleeve ghost. The sleeve ghost is unevenness of image density due to image history. When printing is performed after a continuous unprinted area (white area), only low density development is performed. On the other hand, when printing is performed after a continuous printed area (black area), high density development is performed. Therefore, unevenness of density occurs between the printing after a continuous white area and the printing after a continuous black area.","Conventionally, a sandblast process and a knurling process are performed on the developing sleeve to improve transportability.","For example, a developing apparatus discussed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-13410 (Page 4, FIG. 5) includes a developer bearing member on which spirally shaped groove making concavity and convexity is formed to improve density stability.","An image forming apparatus discussed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-208012 (Page 5, FIG. 5) uses a developing roller on which the sandblast process with a surface roughness Rz of 1.5 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm is performed. Alternatively, a developing roller on which knurled grooves having a diamond pattern with a depth of 5 \u03bcm to 30 \u03bcm are engraved is used to obtain a high-quality image.","An image forming apparatus discussed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2007-127809 (Page 4, FIG. 1, and Page 6, FIG. 8) uses a developer bearing member including grooves having a diamond pattern. Specifically, grooves are formed so that a plurality of grooves extending in the direction slanting to the rotation thrust direction at a sharp angle intersect with a plurality of grooves extending in the direction slanting to the direction opposite to the thrust direction at a sharp angle.","A semiconductor roll discussed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 11-73006 (Page 3, FIG. 1) and a developing apparatus using the semiconductor roll use a developing roll on which semiconductor grooves of 10to 10\u03a9\u00b7cm are formed in the circumferential direction, whereby a developing apparatus that can obtain a high quality image is provided.","However, in the surface processing of the developing roller described above, toner charge amount (toner triboelectrification) cannot be sufficiently sharpened.","Therefore, image quality desired in recent years cannot be satisfied by the prior art.","According to an aspect of the present invention, the charge distribution of developer can be sharpened to improve the stability of developing density and reduce sleeve ghost.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a developer bearing member for carrying one-component developer for developing a latent image includes a base body, a surface layer provided above the base body, and a plurality of concave portions provided on the surface layer, wherein a resistance value of the surface layer is 10to 10\u03a9\u00b7cm, the number of the concave portions per unit area is 2250\/mmto 12254\/mm, a major diameter of an opening of the concave portion is 8 to 20 \u03bcm, the depth of the concave portion is 2 to 5 \u03bcm, a dimensional tolerance of the major diameter is 0.5 \u03bcm or less, and a dimensional tolerance of the depth is 0.5 \u03bcm or less.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a developing apparatus for developing a latent image includes a developer bearing member including a base body and a surface layer on a surface of which a plurality of concave portions are provided and configured to carry one-component developer, and a developer regulating member configured to regulate an amount of developer carried on the developer bearing member, wherein a resistance value of the surface layer is 10\u03a9\u00b7cm to 10\u03a9\u00b7cm, the number of the concave portions per unit area is 2250\/mmto 12254\/mm, a major diameter of an opening of the concave portion is 8 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm, the depth of the concave portion is 2 \u03bcm to 5 \u03bcm, a dimensional tolerance of the major diameter is 0.5 \u03bcm or less, and a dimensional tolerance of the depth is 0.5 \u03bcm or less.","Further features and aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","Various exemplary embodiments, features, and aspects of the invention will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings.","Based on experimentation and consideration by the inventors regarding problems of the prior art, it is considered that the mechanism of the sleeve ghost is deeply involved in a layer of fine particles (particle diameter is 5 to 6 microns or less) formed in the lowermost layer of the toner on the developing sleeve. There is an apparent difference in particle size distribution of the toner in the lowermost layer of the toner on the developing sleeve between the printed area (area on which toner is consumed) and the unprinted area (area on which toner is not consumed). In the area on which toner is not consumed, since toner is not consumed, a fine particle layer tends to be formed in the lowermost layer of the toner. A fine particle has a large surface area per volume, so that a friction charging quantity (specific charge amount) per mass of the fine particle is larger than that of a particle having a larger diameter, and the fine particle is strongly electrostatically attracted to the sleeve by image force. Therefore, toner on a portion where the fine particle layer is formed cannot generate sufficient frictional electrification with the developing sleeve, so that the developing performance of the toner decreases and the toner appears on an image as a ghost.","Furthermore, based on the above noted experimentation and consideration by the inventors, it is considered that the unevenness of the developing performance largely affects unevenness of developing performance and unevenness of developing density caused by unevenness of a specific charge amount of individual toner particles. The non-magnetic toner is easily charged up. Therefore, in particular, in a jumping development without contacting, another non-contact development, and a development method in which the distance between the image bearing member and the developer is very small, the non-magnetic toner causes a decrease of development efficiency and further causes a decrease in density due to repetitive development. In particular, in a developing apparatus used in an image forming apparatus having a high printing speed, a rate for a charge control material or a resin in the developer to contaminate the developing sleeve is high when the non-magnetic toner is used compared with when the magnetic toner is used, so that it results in a further decrease in density due to repetitive development.","Therefore, it may be proposed that an elastic roller be pressed and slid on the surface of the developing sleeve, and the elastic roller and the toner be slid on each other, such that the specific charge amount of the toner contributing to the development is made uniform. However, this method results in a large size and a large torque of the developing apparatus, so that it is difficult to employ this method in a small image forming apparatus from the viewpoints of cost, power, and space. Based in part on these and other considerations, the inventors have developed superior image forming apparatuses which can reduce and frequently avoid the above discussed problems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["1","2","3","4","5","16","10","201","50","60","7","50","60","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":"16"},"As illustrated in , the developing sleeve  can be divided into a base body  and a surface layer . In an aspect of the present embodiment, the base body  is an aluminum cylinder having a thickness of 0.8 mm and a straightness of 20 \u03bcm, and a conductive resin layer having a volume resistance value of 10\u03a9m is used as the surface layer . As illustrated in , the surface of the developing sleeve  is processed to have concave portions.  is a view of  as seen from above (from the direction of arrow D), and  is an enlarged view of the concave portion in . In , a virtual axis n and a virtual axis m perpendicular to the virtual axis n are illustrated to illustrate the arrangement of the concave portions.","The rotation direction of the developing sleeve  is illustrated as A. The structure of one concave portion has a circular shape as seen from above (refer to ), and the cross section of the concave portion has a smooth semicircular shape (refer to ). As illustrated in , in this example, the concave portions are arranged into a hexagonal close-packed structure. Line segments connecting the center of a concave portion and two adjacent concave portions neighboring each other make an angle of 60 degrees. As a definition method of gaps between concave portions, as illustrated in , a gap between two adjacent concave portions is defined as B. The gaps B corresponding to angles of 0 degrees, 120 degrees, 240 degrees, and so forth from the longitudinal direction of the developing sleeve  (n axis direction in ) are respectively defined as B, B, B, and so forth. In this example, it is defined that B=B=B=B=B=B which is 1 \u03bcm and the diameter D of the concave portion is 8 \u03bcm.","In the arrangement of this example, when the m axis and the n axis are defined as illustrated in , the distance between the centers of two adjacent concave portions is represented as \u201cthe radius of the concave portion\u00d72+the gap between the concave portions\u201d. In this example, the number of the concave portions per unit area is 9926\/mm.","When manufacturing the developing sleeve  of this example, a convex mold to form concave portions as illustrated in , B, and C is used. Hereinafter, a specific method will be described.","A conductive resin having a volume resistance value of 10to 10\u03a9m created by the prescription 1 below is prepared on the base body , and formed on the base body .","(Prescription 1)","Resin: phenol resin, 50 parts by weight","Carbon: carbon black, 45 parts by weight","Solvent: methyl alcohol, and","Methyl cellosolve, 200 parts by weight","The carbon black used here is RAVEN1035 manufactured by Columbia Carbon Corp. and the size of primary particles is submicron or less. The volume resistance value is measured by a resistivity measuring device using a four terminal method (for example, LORESTA AP INTERIGENT manufactured by Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Ltd.), and the volume resistivity is about 10\u03a9\u00b7cm.","The prescription 1 is an aspect of the present embodiment, and it is apparent that the embodiment can be implemented not necessarily by the resin and the conductive fine particles. However, to form a three-dimensional shape including the concave portions of the present embodiment, it is apparent that the size of the conductive particles such as carbon or graphite is desired to be sufficiently smaller than the size of the concave portion so that the three-dimensional shape can be stably formed. Specifically, it is desirable to use carbon having a particle diameter smaller than the diameter of the concave portion to be formed.","In the present embodiment, a dimensional tolerance is \u00b10.5 \u03bcm, so that the primary particle diameter of the carbon black is selected to be 0.5 \u03bcm or less. The RAVEN1035 manufactured by Columbia Carbon Corp. shown in prescription 1 is used.","The concave portions are formed in a manner described below. First, a layer thickness T (refer to ) of the surface layer  is formed to have a thickness of about 10 \u03bcm by spraying or dipping. The convex mold to form the shape of this example is heated and pressed onto the entire developing sleeve , and then the convex mold is held under a condition sufficient to transfer the shape. In this example, the mold is held under a condition of 150\u00b0 C. and 30 minutes, and the developing sleeve  having a fine structure illustrated in  is manufactured. Here, the depth d of the concave portion illustrated in  is formed to be 4 \u03bcm.","By such a nano-imprint process, the fine structure is formed with a degree of accuracy of \u00b10.5 \u03bcm or less (dimensional tolerance of diameter and depth). The nano-imprint process is a fine processing technology in which a mold having a concave-convex shape of nano order on its surface is pressed onto a resin or the like and the shape is transferred to the resin or the like.","The one-component developer to be used is a non-magnetic toner . The toner has a volume average particle diameter of 5 \u03bcm as particle size and a degree of circularity (described below) of approximately 0.96.  illustrates a volume particle size distribution of the toner used in the present embodiment.","In an aspect of the present embodiment, non-magnetic one-component jumping development is used for consideration.","The developing bias used in this example is supplied to the developing sleeve  of A4 size by a high-voltage power supply . The developing bias is obtained by superimposing an AC bias on a DC bias, and the AC bias has a peak voltage Vpp of 1600 V and a frequency of 1800 Hz. The gap between the developing sleeve  and the image bearing member  of the present embodiment is approximately 300 \u03bcm. The process speed is about 94 mm\/sec. A reversal development method is used in which a negative-polarity toner is used, a receiving voltage of the image bearing member is \u2212700 V, a light potential is \u2212100 V, and a developing bias is \u2212500 V.","As a comparative example for the present embodiment, a developing sleeve obtained by sandblasting the developing sleeve  with Alundum #400 is prepared. The processing condition of the above is that a sandblasting apparatus manufactured by Fuji Manufacturing Co., Ltd. is used, sandblasting pressure is approximately 3.5 kg\/cm, and processing time of abrasive grains is approximately 30 seconds. When outputting an image by using the same non-magnetic toner  and developing bias as those of the present embodiment, it was confirmed that the sleeve ghost was improved in the present embodiment compared with the comparative example and the density uniformity was also improved in the present embodiment. The result is shown in Table 1. In the surface of the developing sleeve  processed with Alundum #400 shown as the comparative example, an average line center roughness Ra specified in JISB0601 is about 0.4 \u03bcm, and a 10-point average roughness Rz (specified in JISB0601) corresponding to the depth of the concave portion is approximately 5 \u03bcm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Sleeve ghost","Durable density\/Uniformity"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Item","Initial\/10K\/25K","Initial","5K","10K","15K","20K","25K"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Example 1-1","A\/A\/B","1.5\/","1.5\/","1.5\/","1.5\/","1.4\/","1.4\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},"0.01","0.01","0.01","0.01","0.01","0.02"]},{"entry":["Comparative","D\/D\/D","1.5\/","1.3\/","1.2\/","1.0\/","0.8\/","0.5\/"]},{"entry":["example",{},"0.01","0.2","0.4","0.4","0.4","0.4"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Table 1 shows a result of a comparative experiment performed for the sleeve ghost, durable density, and density uniformity in a page. Regarding the sleeve ghost, sleeve ghosts of a relatively new developing apparatus, a developing apparatus after printing 10000 pages (represented as 10K) in an endurance test (test for outputting images), and a developing apparatus after printing 25000 pages (represented as 25K) in the endurance test are compared. The durable density is evaluated in a manner in which, an all black image is output, and the density of the all black image is measured by using a.","Macbeth reflection density meter (RD-918 manufactured by Macbeth Co.) as a relative density to an image of a white portion having the relative density of 0.00. The uniformity is evaluated, in the same page, by using a maximum value of differences between an average value of the reflection densities of five points including four corners and the center and values of the reflection densities at each point.","The sleeve ghost is evaluated by outputting an image using a test pattern as illustrated in . The test pattern is an image in which entire white portions and entire black portions are arranged adjacent to each other in an area having a depth of 45 mm from the top edge, and, below the area, a halftone image of horizontal lines of 1 dot\/1 space is formed. The image of the test pattern is printed on an A4 size paper sheet, and differences in density on the obtained halftone image are visually observed, and then, evaluated using A, B, C, and D. The criterion of the evaluation is as follows:","A: no difference is observed in density","B: a slight difference is observed in density","C: although some difference is observed in density, it is an acceptable level","D: a significant difference is observed in density, not an acceptable level","In an aspect of the present embodiment, the sleeve ghost is not observed until the endurance test of 10K, and even at 25K, it is an acceptable level. On the other hand, in the comparative example, the sleeve ghost is observed from an initial stage. Furthermore, as the endurance test proceeds, the density decreases and the density in a page shows an appreciable nonuniformity. In particular, the nonuniformity in a page shows a phenomenon that the density decreases in an area corresponding to one rotation of the sleeve.","The reasons why the sleeve ghost disappears in an aspect of the present embodiment are considered to be as follows. One reason is that the specific charge amount of the toner on the developing sleeve  is uniform due to the structure including fine concave portions as illustrated in . The other reason is considered that the uniform circulation of the toner in the fine areas is quickly performed. In other words, it is indicated that the toner coating state on the developing sleeve  is uniform.","To examine the above phenomenon, the specific charge amount distribution (Charge\/Diameter (fc\/10 \u03bcm)) of the toner on the developing sleeve  is measured by E-SPART analyzer manufactured by Hosokawa Micron Corp. and the result is illustrated in . (In , the vertical axis is frequency and the horizontal axis is amount of electric charge.) As apparent from , in the comparative example, the specific charge amount distribution is broad, there are a lot of inversely charged toner components (positively charged toner), and the center value is not so high. This is because the shape of the surface of the sleeve sandblasted by Alundum #400 is nonuniform, so that the contact probability between the toner and the surface of the sleeve is nonuniform, and as a result, it is impossible to sharpen the specific charge amount distribution. On the other hand, in an aspect of the embodiment, the inversely charged toner component is hardly observed (in an aspect of the present embodiment, it is observed to be less than 10%), the specific charge amount distribution is sharp, and it is understood that the center value is improved to be a value relatively higher than that of the comparative example.","As described above, the specific charge amount of the toner becomes sharp, the absolute value shifts to a higher level, and a uniform coating state can be formed, so that the sleeve ghost is improved, and the nonuniformity of density is improved not only in the initial stage of the endurance test but also throughout the endurance test.","As another example of the present embodiment, a result of an examination in which the depth d of the concave portion in  is used as a parameter is shown in Table 2.

This is a phenomenon which appears when the concave\/convex on the sleeve becomes considerably small.","When the depth d of the concave portion is 6 \u03bcm or more, even though an improvement effect of the sleeve ghost is observed, a negative ghost phenomenon appears in which the density at the top edge is high and the density decreases after the sleeve rotates once.","Therefore, it is considered that the depth of the concave portion on the sleeve can be about 2 to 5 \u03bcm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},"As the reason of the above, it is considered that the larger the diameter D of the concave portion, the larger the fluctuation and the movement of the average toner particle in the concave portion, so that relative charging performance tends to increase, but the attraction of the toner becomes small. In other words, it is estimated to be because the blotch tends to appear by a stick-slip phenomenon. Further, it is considered that, when the diameter D of the concave portion is small, the toner cannot enter the concave portion, and a contact area decreases, so that the charging performance to be given decreases, and thus, the density stability improvement tends to decrease.","In summary, when the depth d of the concave portion is set to 2 \u03bcm to 5 \u03bcm and the diameter D of the concave portion is set to 8 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm, the improvement of the sleeve ghost, the durable density stability, and the uniformity can be achieved.","When the toner comes into contact with the concave portion, the toner can receive an electric charge from the developing sleeve. However, when the average particle diameter of the toner is approximately 5 \u03bcm, the diameter D of the concave portion can be 8 \u03bcm or more and 20 \u03bcm or less as determined from the particle size distribution of the toner.","The number of the concave portions per unit area when the concave portions are arranged into a hexagonal close-packed structure as shown in the present embodiment will be examined.

However, at least in a range between 2250\/mmto 12254\/mmdescribed above, it is confirmed that the effect of the present invention can be obtained.

The applied voltage at this time is 5 V.","The diameter of the concave portion, the depth of the concave portion, the number of the concave portions, and the dimensional tolerance are measured by a contactless three-dimensional shape measuring device (for example, Microscope VHX-S15 series manufactured by Keyence Corp.).","To form the fine structure of the present embodiment, in the description of the present embodiment, a finely processed mold is heated and pressed onto the developer bearing member. In addition to the above, it is also possible to process more precisely by adding a material using ultraviolet (UV) radiation effect on the surface layer of the developing sleeve , using a finely processed mold using a translucent material, and irradiating light from the outside of the mold.","A characterizing portion of the present embodiment is that the concave portions having approximately the same shape are arranged on the developing sleeve , and the number of the concave portions per unit area is in a certain range. The shape of the concave portion is formed into a shape similar to the particle shape of the toner to be used, so that the toner is held in the concave portion, and electric charge is properly transferred from the developing sleeve to the toner. Since the concave portions having a shape similar to the shape of the toner are provided, electric charge is uniformly transferred to the toner, and thus the specific charge amount distribution of the toner can be sharpened. For example, in the case of the sandblast process described in the conventional example, even if concave portions are provided, the size of the concave portions varies, so that the specific charge amount distribution of the toner tends to be broad. Also, when using a developing roller on which knurled pattern grooves are provided as described in the background of the invention, the specific charge amount distribution of the toner tends to be broad.","To provide the concave portions having approximately the same shape, in the present embodiment, the dimensional tolerances of the depth and the major diameter of the concave portion are set to 0.5 \u03bcm or less. The major diameter of the concave portion, the depth of the concave portion, and the number of the concave portions per unit area are determined based on the range in which the specific charge amount distribution can be sharpened by measuring the specific charge amount of the toner using normally used toner having an average particle diameter of 4 to 6 \u03bcm.

A sample added to a sample chamber is transferred to a flat sheath flow cell with a sample sucking syringe. The sample transferred to the flat sheath flow cell is sandwiched between sheath liquids to form a flat flow. The sample passing through the inside of the flat sheath flow cell is irradiated with stroboscopic light at an interval of 1\/60 second, and the still image of the flowing particles is captured. The still image is captured in focus because the flow of the particles is flat. The still image is captured with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, and the still image is subjected to image processing at an image processing resolution of 512\u00d7512 pixels (0.37 \u03bcm by 0.37 \u03bcm per pixel) to extract the contour of each particle image in the still image, and a projected area S, a perimeter L, and the like are measured. A particle image refers to the image of a particle.","Next, by using the area S and the perimeter L, a circle-equivalent diameter and a degree of circularity are obtained. The circle-equivalent diameter is defined as a diameter of a circle having the same area as that of the projected area of a particle image. The degree of circularity C is defined as a value obtained by dividing the perimeter of a circle obtained from the circle-equivalent diameter by the perimeter of a particle projected image, and is calculated from the following equation.\n\nThe degree of circularity =(2\u00d7(\u03c0\u00d7))\/\n","When a particle image is of a complete round shape, the degree of circularity becomes 1. With an increase in a perimeter unevenness degree of the particle image, the degree of circularity decreases. After the degrees of circularity of the respective particles have been calculated, a range of the degree of circularity of 0.200 to 1.000 is divided into 800 sections, and an average value of the obtained degrees of circularity is calculated, and the average value is defined as an average degree of circularity.","<How to Obtain a Particle Size>","A weight average particle size (D) and a number average particle size (D) of the toner are calculated as described below.

In the same way, when the toner is applied to a contact developing apparatus, the reduction effects of blushing and residual toner are achieved.","A sixth embodiment of the present invention includes a long print head in which an exposure unit arranges a plurality of light emitting sections along one direction. Further, the present embodiment is a cleanerless image forming apparatus that does not have a dedicated cleaning unit for the image bearing member and collects residual toner in the developing apparatus at the same time as performing developing operation.","In the present embodiment, a negatively charged toner is used, the image bearing member  includes the charging device , and the exposure device  uses an LED print head  in which the light emitting sections having a space density of 600 dpi and a wavelength of 780 nm are arranged in one direction. The developing apparatus  includes the developing sleeve  including an elastic material described in the above embodiments, and the developer regulating member  uses a metal blade made of phosphor bronze.","In the cleanerless apparatus, when the residual toner remains, the residual toner passes through the charging device  and reaches the exposure device  according to the rotation of the image bearing member. Then, the residual toner reaches the developing apparatus  and is collected onto the developer bearing member by an electric field.","In the cleanerless process, there is a toner adhesion problem in which the residual toner on the image bearing member flies and attaches to the exposure device . In particular, when a light-emitting diode (LED) is used as the exposure device , the exposure light amount is small, so the exposure device and the image bearing member are arranged close to each other. In this case, the toner easily attaches to the exposure device. When an LED is used as the exposure device, the distance of closest approach between the image bearing member and the LED is about 10 to 5000 \u03bcm.","Therefore, the inventors of the present invention considered sharpening the specific charge amount distribution and preventing occurrence of reversely charged toner (positively charged toner) or negatively charged but weakly charged toner (weakly charged toner). This is because such positively charged toner and weakly charged toner cannot be transferred in the transfer device and tend to be the residual toner.","Further, by increasing the transfer rate, it is possible to reduce the residual toner in a transfer section. As a method for increasing the transfer rate, there is a method for improving repellency of the image bearing member  with respect to the toner. As an indicator of the repellency, the contact angle of the image bearing member with respect to pure water is used.","When the residual toner is reduced, residual toner flying on the image bearing member is also reduced, so that it is also possible to reduce the toner adhesion to the exposure device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0163","num":"0162"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":"1"},"Regarding the specific charge amount of the developer after the development is performed on the image bearing member, an absolute value of the specific charge amount on the image bearing member in an environment of temperature 27\u00b0 C. and relative humidity 70% RH is measured by a Faraday gauge.","In a cleanerless system, when the density of the residual toner is 0.02 or less, it is confirmed that the cleanerless system reaches allowable level in practical use, so that a value of 0.02 or less is determined to be the allowable limit of the density of the residual toner, and the result as illustrated in  is derived.","Specifically, when the specific charge amount of the toner on the developer bearing member is 50 \u03bcC\/g to 90 \u03bcC\/g in absolute value, and the contact angle of the image bearing member  with respect to pure water is 90\u00b0 to 150\u00b0, it is possible to satisfy the allowable limit.","When the absolute value of the specific charge amount of the toner is greater than 90 \u03bcC\/g, the transfer rate tends to decrease, so that the specific charge amount can be 90 \u03bcC\/g or less.","When occurrence of residual toner is suppressed by controlling the specific charge amount of the toner to a proper value, if the developing sleeve  including concave portions is used as described in the present embodiment, it is possible to sharpen the specific charge amount distribution of the toner. Therefore, it is possible to reduce toner having undesirable specific charge amount, and to achieve the effect of efficiently suppressing occurrence of the residual toner.","A part of modified examples other than the examples described in the above embodiments will be described.","It is possible to set the distance between an optical system of the exposure device  and an electrostatic latent image holding body to 0.01 mm or more and 1 mm or less. When the distance between the exposure device  and the image bearing member  is small, exposure can be performed even in an exposure device having a small light amount. On the other hand, there is a problem in which the toner attaches to the exposure device. However, when the developer bearing member and the developing apparatus according to the present embodiment are used, as described in the sixth embodiment, occurrence of optical pollution can be reduced. In particular, when the exposure device  is located below the image bearing member , the toner flying from the image bearing member falls by gravity to the exposure device , so that the toner easily attaches to the exposure device . However, by using the developing sleeve  as described in the above embodiments and sharpening the specific charge amount distribution of the toner, the residual toner is reduced. When the residual toner is reduced, toner flying everywhere is reduced, so that it is possible to suppress the toner adhesion to the exposure device .","When these toners are used, the amount of flying toner is reduced, and toner contamination does not occur in the exposure device .","A micro-lens can be used in an optical system of the exposure device. Also, a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) can be used in the optical system of the exposure device. By using the vertical cavity surface emitting laser, it is possible to manufacture the exposure device  having a higher allowable level of working distance (WD).","While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass, for example, all substantially equivalent modifications, structures, and functions.","This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-276832 filed Dec. 4, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate exemplary embodiments, features, and aspects of the present invention and, together with the description, serve to describe how to make and use the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A to 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A to 7C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 9A and 9B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A and 10B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 12A to 12C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 16"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
