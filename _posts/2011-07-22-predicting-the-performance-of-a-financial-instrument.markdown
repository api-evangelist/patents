title: Predicting the performance of a financial instrument
abstract: Systems and methods are disclosed for predicting the performance of a financial instrument by extracting influential features and emotional sentiment data from received data values, common features, and internet sources, each corresponding to a financial instrument, building multiple predictive models using random selections of the data values and combining the predictive models to create a combined prediction model. The combined prediction model provides a combined predicted data value where the combined predicted data value is a performance indicator, such as a classification count or percentage, of data values that correspond to the financial instrument and classify correctly via the prediction models. Further, the combined prediction model may be iterated over new or test data values to constantly select the most influential common features to build new prediction models and a resulting new combined prediction model for reducing a classification predictive error and updating the combined predicted data value.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure claims priority to Provisional Application No. 61\/449,114, titled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PREDICTING SECURITY PERFORMANCE USING HYBRIDIZATION OF RESULTS FROM MULTIPLE PREDICTABILITY MODELS AND ADAPTIVE LEARNING, filed Mar. 4, 2011, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates to a system and method for predicting the performance of a financial instrument from received data values and their common features, each corresponding to the financial instrument.","Trading platforms and financial instrument current prediction software provide predictive analyses of individual financial instruments or a group of similarly targeted financial instruments based on current valuation and\/or performance of the particular financial instrument or its group. Further, such software may also provide prediction for varying time periods from the analysis of current and historic financial data values, where the data values are gathered over several different time periods.","However, it is common that such current prediction software is unable to follow inconsistent changes in the market environment. Specifically, the software may rely on single patterns or single features in the market fluctuations, but may not adapt to irregular fluctuations that are not typical in regular market cycles. By way of an example, current prediction software may only focus on closing prices for a stock and may ignore sudden and unexpected trading volumes. This approach only looks at part of the available information. An unexpected pattern in the closing price for a stock may reflect an existing pattern, such as the release of financial information by the company that issued the stock. This is an expected event, against, for example, a mid-day news release related to the company, that may cause high volume transaction unrelated to the financial information. The closing value may, therefore, mask the influence of other features\/attributes of the stock. The unexpected trading volumes may not reflect entirely on stock performance until some time has elapsed, therefore rendering an automated analysis irrelevant until after the opportunity has passed.","In another example, known prediction software uses a single feature of a financial instrument for prediction purposes. The single feature may be the closing price alone or the volume of trade alone. Further, the prediction software may use a single prediction model, such as, a hidden markov model (HMM) or a clustering model to predict future valuations of the financial instrument from current valuations or volumes. However, single prediction models are not accurate and do not track multiple feature changes effectively.","Accordingly, there is a need for a process that is able to identify stock value changes, with high confidence, hours to days in advance of the changes.","The system and method described herein attempt to overcome the drawbacks discussed above by extracting influential features from received data values and underlying common features, both associated with a financial instrument; building multiple predictive models using random selections of the data values; and combining the predictive models to provide a combined predicted data value, where the combined predicted data value is a performance indicator of the financial instrument, and may be used to facilitate purchase or sale of at least one unit of a financial instrument (e.g., stock).","In one exemplary embodiment, a method for predicting financial instrument performance includes receiving, by a computer, data values corresponding to a financial instrument, the data values including a plurality of common features; extracting, by the computer, using at least a first prediction model, more than one first common feature from the received plurality of common features and a corresponding dependence value for each of the extracted first common features, each of the extracted first common features being an influential feature; building, by the computer, a plurality of second prediction models, each of the second prediction models corresponding to each of the extracted influential features and each of the second prediction models using a first random selection of the received data values corresponding to each of the extracted influential features to generate predicted data values corresponding to the financial instrument for each extracted influential feature; and combining, by the computer, each of the second prediction models in a series arrangement, where the predicted data values corresponding to one second prediction model is input to another second prediction model until all the second prediction models are involved, thereby creating a combined prediction model, and where the combined prediction model uses the dependence value identified in the first prediction model as a weighing value for each predicted data value from each second prediction model, and the combined prediction model generates a combined predicted data value corresponding to the financial instrument.","In another exemplary embodiment, the method for predicting financial instrument performance further includes computing, by the computer, a predictive error from the predicted data values of each of the second prediction models and the combined prediction model, the predictive error computed using a second random selection of received data values to test each of the second prediction models and the combined prediction model; and iterating, by the computer, the extracting step to create a new first common feature, the building step to build a plurality of new second prediction models, and the combining step to combine each of the new second prediction models using the computed predictive error for each of the second prediction models and the combined prediction model, thereby incorporating the predictive error to each of the second prediction models and the combined prediction model for reducing the predictive error and updating the combined predicted data value corresponding to the financial instrument.","In yet another exemplary embodiment, a system for predicting financial instrument performance includes a computer for receiving data values corresponding to a financial instrument, the data values including a plurality of common features; the computer for extracting, using at least a first prediction model, more than one first common feature from the received plurality of common features and a corresponding dependence value for each of the extracted first common features, each of the extracted first common features being an influential feature; the computer for building a plurality of second prediction models, each of the second prediction models corresponding to each of the extracted influential features and each of the second prediction models using a first random selection of the received data values corresponding to each of the extracted influential features to generate predicted data values corresponding to the financial instrument for each extracted influential feature; and the computer for combining each of the second prediction models in a series arrangement, where the predicted data values corresponding to one second prediction model is input to another second prediction model until all the second prediction models are involved, thereby creating a combined prediction model, and where the combined prediction model uses the dependence value identified in the first prediction model as a weighing value for each predicted data value from each second prediction model, and the combined prediction model generates a combined predicted data value corresponding to the financial instrument.","In yet another exemplary embodiment, the building part of the system for predicting financial instrument performance includes the computer for retrieving, the first random selection of the received data values corresponding to the financial instrument; the computer for separating, the first random selection of the received data values according to more than one different time period and according to its common features, where, when the common features overlap for the first random selection of the received data values, the separating part of the system provides replicate data values for each of the separated common features;

and the computer for selecting, from each of the plurality of second prediction models, only those second prediction models that present a threshold correlation between the separated data values across different time periods.","In yet another exemplary embodiment, the receiving step, by the computer, described above, further includes receiving emotional sentiment data corresponding to the financial instrument from computer-based sources on the internet; the extracting step, by the computer, further comprises extracting textual information from the emotional sentiment data from computer-based sources on the internet; and the building step, by the computer, further comprises assigning a numerical score to the financial instrument corresponding to the positive and negative emotional words extracted from the textual information, wherein the numerical score is a product of a numerical value attached to each positive and negative emotional word, and numerical weights associated with performance of the industry associated with the financial instrument;

The term financial instruments, as used herein, includes various private and public financial securities, including, but not limited to, banknotes, bonds, debentures, equity securities, structured finance securities, common stocks, derivatives-forwards, futures, options, swaps, and other finance related tradable physical or virtual entities. These financial instruments may be issued by companies and government entities, and may be traded via domestic and international exchange markets, e.g., NASDAQ\u00ae, NYSE\u00ae, and Tokyo Stock Exchange\u00ae (TSE). Each of these stock exchanges may provide online resources, including information related to current and historic valuations, performance, volumes, and related information corresponding to the respective financial instruments being traded via each stock exchange.","In an exemplary embodiment, prediction models that may be used with this disclosure include one or more of a time series prediction models, stochastic prediction models, statistical prediction models, clustering prediction models, and general economic prediction models. Further, by way of an example, the time series prediction model may include an auto-regressive (AR) prediction model, a moving average (MA) prediction model, an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) prediction model, a vector auto-regressive (VAR) prediction model, an auto-regressive conditional heteroskedastic (ARCH) prediction model, a generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) prediction model, a recurrent artificial neural network (ANN) prediction model, a hybrid time series prediction model, a fractal time series prediction model, an exponential smoothing model, a Kalman filtering model, and a regime switching prediction model; the stochastic and the statistical prediction models may include a hidden markov model (HMM), a wavelet prediction model, and a jump diffusion prediction model; the clustering prediction model may include a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) prediction model, a support vector model (SVM), an expectation maximization (EM) model, a classification and regression trees (CART) model, and a multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model; and the general economic prediction model includes a Bayesian network prediction model and a macroeconomic model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"In one example, data values for a financial instrument, e.g., a stock, may include the closing price value of the stock for each day of a week for a full week. The common feature associated with the data value is the closing price value and this series of price values are used in conjunction with other received data values associated with the same stock to predict future price values for the stock. The pre-defined time period may include hours, days, weeks, or even months, prior to the implementation of the system  for predicting data values for the performance of a financial instrument. The performance corresponding to the financial instrument may be a measure of the classification of one or more of the common features in a combined prediction model built for the financial instrument.","The system  includes multiple computers for performing various functions associated with predicting the valuation of financial instruments. A prediction software application may include hardware and software components  that perform the role of a prediction software engine (also referred to as the \u201cprediction software analysis engine\u201d), and may function within a backend computer  or multiple related backend computers, where each computer performs a specific role for the prediction software engine. An administrator or developer of the prediction software application may interact with the software application via the hardware and software components . The administrator may use a remote frontend computer, shown as the application developer\/administrator computer . The administrator may use a support application  to access the prediction software application interface , where the support application can be a browser or a stand-alone web-enabled software application. Client computers A-X may include similar stand-alone applications without an administrator-level access to the prediction software application , via a client interface, illustrated as the prediction software application interface . The application interface  may be an online portal, such as a website or a file transfer protocol (FTP) source on the network , the network being the internet, local area network, or any other network, that is accessible via wired or wireless media, including mobile wireless networks, Bluetooth\u00ae and WiFi\u00ae. The stand-alone software application version of the software application  may access the online portal  via an internet protocol (IP) address of the prediction software application backend computer , where the IP address access the backend computer  via the FTP source.","The prediction software application includes software components  on the backend computer , which may include multiple software modules -. The software modules - perform various functions of the prediction software application, including receiving data values corresponding to current or historic performances of one or more financial instruments, the data values received from various computer-based sources ; extracting common features from the received data values; building multiple prediction models corresponding to the received data values and the underlying common features; combining the prediction models to create a combined prediction model; and generating a combined predicted data value from the combined prediction model for the financial instrument. The computer-based sources  include financial resources, such as, financial websites, financial indices, trading platforms, economic indicators, bank rates, gold rates, real-time stock feeds, news portals, stock monitoring websites, stock exchange websites and other related resources. An administrator on computer  may access the prediction software application interface  to update software components - of the backend computer .","Extracting module  performs the extracting functions of the prediction software application , by identifying the influential features among the common features underlying the received data values for a financial instrument. The extracting module  may also generate a dependence value associated with the prediction model used. Processing module  analyzes the received data values and the extracted influential features to build a number of prediction models, each prediction model corresponding to an extracted influential feature and using a random selection of received data values associated with the extracted influential feature to train the prediction model. As part of the building function, the trained prediction model may then generate predicted data values using the remainder of the received data values as test data.","In an exemplary embodiment, the predicted data value is a performance indicator, such as a classification percentage of the number of received data values of the financial instrument that classify perfectly via the trained prediction model. Further, in an example of influential features, those common features that classify above 50% correctly may be considered as influential features. In another example for extracting influential features, the top two common features from a conditional independence test may be utilized as the influential features. The conditional independence test is described in detail below. The classification, based on the common feature, may indicate that the stock is expected to see a positive (or negative) change in a future time period, e.g., within the next day, week, or months. In an exemplary embodiment, the data values used to generate the predicted data values may be historic price values for the selected financial instrument. Further, the historic price values of the financial instrument may be price values collected over varying time periods, including hours, days, weeks, or even months, prior to the implementation of the system  for predicting data values.","In an exemplary embodiment, the extracting module  may extract the influential features from the received data values using a first random selection of received data values, including all the common features, in a prediction model to generate predicted data values indicative of the performance of the financial instrument. The extracting module may include a conditional independence test and at least one prediction model including a classification and regression tree (CART) model, a multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model, or a random forests model. The CART, MARS, or random forests model are prediction models capable of classification and extraction of influential features. Each of these prediction models may be trained using a first random selection of the received data values, including all common features, as discussed above. A tree is created for the selected prediction model, with multiple branches, where each branch uses a further random selection from the first random selection of the data values to train, and later test, the prediction model. Each of the common features in the prediction model is permutated first to find a nominal arrangement of the common features. The exemplary use of these specific prediction models generates influential features by testing the trained prediction models using a second random selection of the received data values, where the second random selection may include overlapping data values from the first random selection of the received data values.","In an exemplary embodiment, the exemplary prediction models in the extracting module generate a variable importance plot, as a result of a testing part of the extracting process, where the variable importance plot identifies influential features. When the prediction model is used over multiple common features to create trees of data, then the average classification error over all the trees in the prediction model is computed and plotted against each of the common features. The variable importance plot is a count measurement of the number of correctly classified data values among the received data values, over each branch of the prediction model. The data values and the model description herein allows the prediction software to choose from the CART, MARS, and random forests model to classify the received data values according to the common features disclosed herein. In another exemplary embodiment, partial independence values are generated for each of the influential features identified by the variable importance plots. The partial independence values may offer weighing values from a scale of 0 to 1 for each influential feature.","The processing module  may select prediction models according to the influential features and the related data values. The selected prediction models may include more than one of the prediction models discussed above. The processing module may train each of the selected prediction model with random selection of the received data values to generate model-specific predicted data values. The selected prediction models may then be combined to use the predicted data values as a combined prediction model, where each prediction model can be assigned their respective dependence value as a weighing factor. In an exemplary embodiment, the combined prediction model is a series arrangement of each of the selected prediction models, where the results from one prediction model is input to another prediction model until all the selected prediction models are involved. In an exemplary embodiment, the selected prediction models are implemented as tree branches to a single combined prediction model, where each tree branch includes the weighing dependence value to weigh an error between the trained prediction model of the branch and test data values that are applied to the branch model.","The combined prediction model incorporates the predicted data values, the associated influential features associated with each independent prediction model, and the dependence value generated for each prediction model. The processing module  may use the dependence values generated from the feature extraction module to weigh each of the independent prediction models in accordance to the dependence of the influential feature on their respective prediction models. In an exemplary embodiment, the combined predicted data value is a performance indicator of the financial instrument, and may be used to purchase a unit of the financial instrument with an indication that a positive change is expected in future time periods for the value of the financial instrument. Similarly, if the expected change is null or negative, this information may be an indicator that an owner should hold or sell the unit(s) (e.g., stock).","In an exemplary embodiment, the combining function of the prediction software application includes a smoothing function using K-fold cross-validation and bagging (or bootstrap aggregation), with multiple sub-samples from the received data values to identify robust influential features and to prevent over-fitting during the training phase. Exemplary smoothing functions that may be applied include loess and kernel smoothers and radial basis function.","The adapting\/learning module  performs learning functions for the independent and\/or combined prediction models. In an exemplary embodiment, the learning module performs a computing function at the backend computer . The computing function computes a predictive error from the predicted data values of each of the second prediction models and the combined prediction model. Further, the learning module  computes the predictive error using a random selection of received data values to test each of the built prediction models and the combined prediction model. A predictive error may be the error in classifying the test data values against the trained prediction models. The learning module  may then iterate the steps used to create the first combined prediction model, including the extracting step discussed above with respect to the extracting module  to create a new first common feature; the building step of the processing module  to build a plurality of new second prediction models; and the combining step of the processing module  to combine each of the new second prediction models using the computed predictive error for each of the second prediction models and the combined prediction model. The learning module  may, therefore, incorporate the predictive error to each respective second prediction models and the combined prediction model, thereby reducing the predictive error in the next iteration, and for updating the combined predicted data value corresponding to the financial instrument.","The database  stores the received data values and the corresponding calculations made for the independent predicted values and the combined predicted value for one of a series of time periods. This prediction software application  may use this stored information to improve the robustness of the prediction system  for future financial instruments. In an exemplary embodiment, the system  includes a multi-tier hardware model to support specific functions of the various modules - of the prediction software application hardware\/software components . In one example, the system  includes a database server, optimized for database functions, therefore, storing the database . The prediction software application interface online portal may reside on a web-tier server optimized for providing the client computers A-X with an optimized web-based interface. Further, the software functions for the prediction software engine may be implemented via C\/C++, Matlab, and R, while the software functions for the web-based software application interface may be implemented via JavaJHTML5.","In an exemplary embodiment, the prediction software application may be available as application programming interface (API) function calls for third-party software applications, where the third-party software applications may embed certain computer codes to enable the end users of the third-party software application to access the prediction software application. By way of an example, existing stock trading websites may register with the prediction software application to use APIs from the prediction software, where the embedded API in the third-party application accesses the backend modules - and database  to provide performance evaluations to the end user. A smart phone application is another example of a third-party application that may use APIs to access the prediction software via the third-party application. In an exemplary embodiment, the APIs may be available in the form of XML feeds, or another computer code for client side and\/or server side scripting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","205","210"]},"A building step, via block , follows the extracting step, using the same first prediction model to build a prediction\/learning tree, where each branch of the prediction tree relates to a specific influential feature or a different prediction model, different from the first prediction model. The prediction software application applies a plurality of second prediction models, different from the first prediction model, where each of the second prediction models correspond to each of the extracted influential features and each of the second prediction models uses a different first random selection of the received data values corresponding to each of the extracted influential features. Each of the second prediction models may generate predicted data values corresponding to the financial instrument for each extracted influential feature.","Block  of the prediction software performs a combining step, thereby effectively combining each of the second prediction models of the building step in block  to create a combined prediction model.

In an exemplary embodiment, the combined prediction model is a series arrangement of each of the selected prediction models, where the results from one prediction model is input to another prediction model until all the selected prediction models are involved. The combined predicted value may be in the form of a range of combined predicted values over different future time periods. The combined predicted value may be used to purchase at least one unit of the financial instrument.

This iteration step reduces the predictive error for successive iterations, and updates the combined predicted data value corresponding to the financial instrument. Since the predictive error is reduced, higher classification in the data values results from the iteration step, where a higher classification is a predicted data value indicating good future performance related to the common feature (influential feature) being analyzed by the prediction model.

The prediction software model may generate prediction curves, represented by block , where the prediction curves may be a regression plot, or any two dimensional mapping of common features with the their influence on stock performance. The mapping provides a determination of influential features that may be applied to the input features, e.g., stock volume , open prices , high prices , and close price . This information is then forwarded to the XML feed  for distribution by any available media to clients and client devices  as explained with respect to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1220"]},"In an example, in some cases, the general market may perform well, while a certain industry or group may perform poorly. The textual content for a company within the poorly-performing industry is analyzed in view of the industry, as well as the general market. Further, historical context may be provided by verifying is similar data patterns existed in the past. Weights assigned to the textual content may be varied in the presence or absence of historical data patterns. Words defined as positive include, \u201csuccess,\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d \u201chigh,\u201d and several other positive-impact type words. Negative words include, \u201clow,\u201d \u201cpoor,\u201d \u201cfail,\u201d and several other negative-impact type words. A database of emotional sentiment data sets  is generated using a general crawling algorithm to crawl external computer-based sources for textual content. The parsed information is analyzed by weighing, classifying, and learning, using methods disclosed above. The result of the analysis is one or more scores assigned to the stock\/instrument symbol assigned to a company on which the analysis is performed.","In one example, the database of emotional sentiment data sets  includes symbols for storing various information, e.g., the EN_symbol for elementscore, the ES_Symbol for StateScore, the EU_symbol for ActionScore, and the other data sets of  tagged with the word symbol. These symbols represent elements whose classifications include textual data; indirect information from news and third party content; and direct information from companies via press releases, filings, and related information. The action score of the EU_symbol represents action-based information, such as social media items like Twitter\u00ae messages or when a user of system  announces that he or she likes a stock or purchased a stock, and other such action items. Analyst reports and opinions typically classify in the element class but may sometimes classify as action classes. An ElementScore, StateScore, and ActionScore are assigned to the symbols, along with a timestamp indicating when the scores were generated. The scores provide such information as current emotional state of the instrument (StateScore) per the crawled web-sourced data, the current ElementScore may represent a score assigned to the instrument prior to the StateScore, and the ActionScore may indicate the score at which an action may be performed.","The prediction result sets  provides data sets of the values for certain instruments identified by the symbols (TP_Symbol, TP_Stocks). Values include High and Low values; ChangeRange of values and Median value; Direction of change, Probability values, and error percentage (ErrPct) based on the probability value. There is a persistent connection  established between the data sets , the prediction software engine , and the database , thereby providing the database with constantly updated prediction data and real-time data. The persistent connection  extends to the stream feeding software  to generate C\/C++ APIs for the feed streams to various system. In an alternative embodiment, XML APIs may be used depending on the receiving clients. The stock feed  provided by the API includes the symbol of the financial instrument, the price, volume, and the related timestamp of this data. Blocks , , and  represent the data sets associated the emotional sentiment engine and the prediction software engine.","In one example, for each symbol there is a separate table for all trades, this could be flat file T Symbol containing information for each trade, price, volume and a microtimestamp. Further, for each symbol there is a separate table for all minute bars, e.g., TB_Symbol contains information for each minute, price, volume and a timestamp. For all stocks there is a table for macro information, which could be flat file with stocks containing information for each stock, symbol, market (NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX), company name, SIC code, sector, industry, initial public offering (IPO) date, symbol begin, previous symbols [dates]. For all stocks there is a table for all splits, e.g., T_Splits which contains information for each stock split, symbol, ratio, date, price (pre-split and post-split). For each stock there is a \u201cminute candlestick table charting\u201d stored via the TCM_Symbol, which contains information for each stock, open, high, low, close, volume, time for each stock there is a \u201cdaily candlestick table charting\u201d in the form of a TCD Symbol contains information for each stock, open, high, low, close, volume, and time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIGS. 1-9"],"b":["1300","1340","1305","1310","1315","1320","1325","1335"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 1"],"b":["1400","1405","1410","1415"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1500","1505","1510","1515","1525","1520","1535","1530"]},"In an exemplary embodiment, service levels intervals are every 10 minutes for a 1 second transmission rate, 30 minutes at 5 seconds, 1 hour at 20 seconds, 2 hours at 60 seconds, 4 hours at 120 seconds, or 30 minutes before market open.
