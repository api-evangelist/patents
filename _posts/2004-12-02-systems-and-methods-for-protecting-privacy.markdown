No. 11\/004,748; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of Invention","This invention relates to protecting privacy.","2. Description of Related Art","Conventional systems for protecting privacy determine quasi-identifiers in data sets useful in re-identifying individuals. These systems attempt to generalize, hide and\/or withhold the quasi-identifying information to protect the privacy of subjects. Thus, in one conventional system for protecting privacy, salary information for a specific user is hidden within the aggregate salary of a group of subjects. Some conventional systems attempt to generalize information to prevent re-identification. Thus, the digits of a subject's unique identification number are transformed by replacing digits with wildcards. This generalization transform creates larger subject groupings which tend to lessen the impact of an information disclosure.","In \u201cProtecting Privacy when Disclosing Information: k-Anonymity and Its Enforcement through Generalization and Suppression\u201d, Technical Report, SRI International, March 1998, P. Samarati et al. describe a privacy system based on a theory of k-anonymity. Samarati et al. propose granular access to any sensitive information by applying the minimal set of generalization transformations necessary to create desired groups of size \u201ck\u201d. In this conventional privacy system, the subject identifying information is transformed by generalization transformations. Although useful, these conventional systems for protecting privacy have limited application in data mining applications since they rely on access to the underlying records of the data source. Due to privacy restrictions, third party access to the records of the underlying data source is generally restricted.","Modern data mining and data warehousing systems use complex algorithms to identify interesting patterns of information in the records of the underlying data source. The patterns of information frequently relate to groups of subjects. Knowledge about these interesting groups of subjects may be extracted or mined using agglomerative clustering; k-means clustering and\/or various other knowledge extraction transformations. However, if the extracted knowledge is combined with information already available to the public, the combined information can in some instances be used to re-identify specific subjects within the groups.","Conventional k-anonymity and\/or data generalization-based privacy systems are applied to the underlying records of the information source before the knowledge extraction and\/or data mining transformations are performed. These conventional systems for protecting privacy are difficult to implement in a multi-party environment where only the clustered, agglomerated or extracted knowledge is available for sharing with a vendor. Moreover, these conventional systems for protecting privacy assume that all the relevant information is available simultaneously in a single location.","In practice however, information about subjects is likely to be dispersed among a number of data sources and only the extracted knowledge or data is sold or transferred. Thus, if the extracted knowledge or data is not properly protected or anonymized, third parties may combine the extracted knowledge with other information sources to re-identify subjects and compromise the subject's privacy.","Thus, systems and methods for protecting privacy of entities associated with the extracted knowledge or data are required.","The systems and methods according to this invention provide for anonymizing knowledge or data extracted using a knowledge extraction and\/or data mining transformation, to protect the privacy of individuals and\/or entities associated with the extracted knowledge and\/or mined data. The systems and methods according to this invention determine a request for information; a privacy policy; sources of information and optional information about the public information concerning a subject and prior query history. Knowledge is extracted using data mining and\/or other transformations, either dynamically in response to a query or in a prior operation. The extracted knowledge is associated with the characteristic information about the applied knowledge extraction transformations and the characteristics information about the data set from which the knowledge was extracted. The privacy protecting transformations are based on information about the characteristics of the applied knowledge extraction methods, the characteristics of the data from which the knowledge was extracted, the determined privacy policy, previous user queries and\/or the optional information about the public information concerning a subject.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","99","400","200","300"]},"A user of the personal computer  submits a query requesting the average salary of employees of a corporation X. The query is submitted to an extracted knowledge repository  containing knowledge extracted from corporate information. The query is mediated by the system for protecting privacy . The privacy policies of the corporation and the users affected by the disclosure of information are retrieved by the system for protecting privacy . The system for protecting privacy  also retrieves the characteristics of the knowledge extraction transforms that were applied to the corporate information as well as the characteristics of the corporate information data set from which the knowledge was extracted. The characteristics of the applied knowledge extraction transforms and the characteristics of the data set are used to determine any additional transformations necessary to properly protect the private information represented by the extracted knowledge without requiring actual access to the underlying data set that was mined. The privacy protected extracted knowledge or data is then returned to the user of personal computer  via the communications links .","The use of the system for protecting privacy  allows knowledge extracted from private information to be safely released without compromising the privacy of the subjects. By releasing less information, the potential value of the information is substantially increased since subjects are more likely to share information when their privacy preferences are met. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, a system for protecting privacy  is used to reduce the risk of privacy violations.","For example, in one of the exemplary embodiments, a system for protecting privacy  is interposed between members of a trade group. The system for protecting privacy blocks the identification of individual elements in the aggregate trade group statistics. In this way, the trade group information is dynamically shared with trade group members while ensuring compliance with regulations concerning anti-trust and\/or anti-competitive behavior.","The system for protecting privacy  can also be used to analyze the influence of various lifestyle factors in clinical drug trials, medical procedures and other experiments without compromising the privacy of subjects. Thus, the lifestyle of a subject, genetic information and\/or other private information likely to affect the drug trial can be introduced into models of drug and\/or medical procedure efficacy while preserving the privacy of the subject. It will be apparent that these examples are illustrative and not intended to be limiting. Thus, the system for protecting privacy  can be used to measure various behaviors and outcomes related to a subject's private information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1000","1005"]},"In step S, a required privacy policy is determined. A privacy policy is defined for the purposes of this application, as any expression of a subject's privacy preferences with respect to the disclosure of information about the subject. The privacy policy may be a single privacy policy or a combined privacy policy. A single privacy policy may be associated with a specific subject, a specific customer or any known or later identified organizational unit or entity. A combined privacy policy is a privacy policy formed by combining one or more single privacy policies together. For example, a combined privacy policy may be formed from the privacy policy of each subject referenced in a customer query, the privacy policies associated with national and regional laws and\/or any other privacy policy grouping likely to affect the customer's query. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the privacy policy is encoded using the Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language (EPAL), the P3P Preference Exchange Language 1.0 (APPEL1.0) or any known or later developed method for expressing privacy preferences. It will be apparent that these examples are illustrative and not limiting.","The privacy policy may be described in terms of k-anonymity, the minimum number of subjects required in the most specific category, the impact or effect a disclosure may have, how much work it would be to re-identify an individual and the like. Single or multiple privacy policies may be created to govern financial, medical and\/or various other types of information. Moreover, two or more privacy policies are combinable into a combined privacy policy reflecting the constraints imposed by each respective privacy policy without departing from the scope of this invention.","For example, a subject in a clinical drug trial may create and\/or select a privacy policy permitting the sharing of medical and lifestyle information with a group of customers. The customer group may include the subject's medical practitioners, the organizers of a clinical trial in which the subject participates, the manufacturer of the drug used in the clinical trial, the Food and Drug Administration and\/or various other entities. Moreover, a subject may be an individual person, a legal entity such as a corporation or any known or later developed organizational entity. It will be apparent that a variety of characteristics such as hair color, eye color, blood type, allergies, ethnicity and\/or any known or later developed feature concerning a subject, may be associated with, and protected by privacy policies within the scope of this invention. These examples are intended to be illustrative and not limiting. After the required privacy policy has been determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, data sources are optionally determined. The data sources may include but are not limited to ubiquitous computing and sensor data, location based data, transaction data, including credit card, credit history, club cards, vendor information financial information, health information or any known or later developed source of information about a subject. After the data sources are optionally determined, control continues to step S.","The information about the public information concerning subjects is optionally determined in step S. Public information is information about a subject that has already been released, is widely known and\/or is easily obtained. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the public information may be optionally purchased from a public information repository, or may be made available without charge.","For example, professional licensing information about a subject may be disclosed in a publicly accessible record as a matter of law. In some cases, this publicly available professional licensing information is available from a website such as a Medical Quality Review Board or the like. Non-public information includes voter registration information that is a matter of public record but which may only be used for certain purposes and\/or in certain jurisdictions. This and other information that cannot be disseminated due to force of law, corporate policy, societal norms or other criteria is not publicly available information. Thus, public information may be change based on the location, residence of subjects, customers and\/or third parties service providers and the like.","In contrast, information that has already been released, is widely known and is easily obtained is publicly available information. The determination of what information is publicly available serves as a standard against which information disclosures can be measured. Thus, information that is already publicly available can generally be disclosed without unduly affecting a subject's privacy. After the public information concerning the subject has been optionally determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, the query is determined. The query is determined by the customer who is presented with a description and\/or summary of information\/knowledge available for query and\/or sale. For example, in one exemplary embodiment according to this invention, a list of features about one or more subjects is presented to the customer. A customer query may then be used to request the subject's hair color, size, weight and\/or various other features about the subjects. After the query is determined, control continues to step S.","The query history is optionally determined in step S. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the query history is determined based on a customer's past queries. However, in still other exemplary embodiments, groupings are based on internet protocol (IP) address information, legal identity and\/or other criteria useful in identifying the same and\/or similarly situated customers. After the query history constraints are determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, the optional knowledge extraction transformations are determined. In one exemplary embodiment according to this invention, the knowledge extraction transformations are used to infer the subject's interest in kayaking and\/or skiing based on credit card purchase transactions of ski and kayak equipment, purchase of lift tickets at Squaw Valley and the like. In various other embodiments, medical information such as the purchase of splints, crutches and pain medication, in Salt Lake City Utah may be used to infer the subject's recreational activities. More specific subject reported and\/or medical practitioner reported information may also be used to infer additional information about a subject. It should be apparent however that these examples are not intended to be limiting and that various knowledge extraction transforms may be used without departing from the scope of this invention. After the knowledge extraction transformations have been determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, the extracted knowledge or data is determined based on the knowledge extraction transforms. After the extracted knowledge or data has been determined, control continues to step S.","The privacy protecting transformations of the extracted data are determined in step S. The privacy protecting transformations are based on the characteristics of the applied knowledge extraction transformations, the characteristics of the data over which the knowledge extraction processes are applied, the privacy policy and optionally, the public information concerning the subjects. The privacy protecting transformations ensure that the determined privacy policy is enforced.","For example, an exemplary privacy policy may specify that individual subject's identities are not to be revealed, that identity is not easily inferred (for example, by making sure that an individual subject's data is merged or aggregated with a minimum number of like subjects' data) and that information that is released cannot be linked to individual subjects either by matching with publicly available information or by combining with previous query results, unless permitted by the privacy policy. Thus, although a black or brown hair color value may not identify an individual subject, a green hair color value may. It will be apparent that the publicly available information may be determined before, after and\/or simultaneously with a query without departing from the scope of this invention. In various embodiments of this invention, categories or groupings that make identification of individual subjects more likely are transformed to make the categories less informative or may be merged and\/or omitted. After the privacy protecting transformations are determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, the privacy protected extracted knowledge or data is determined based on the privacy protecting transformations. The privacy protected extracted knowledge or data is then made available to the customer. Control immediately continues to step S and the process ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","100","20","30","40","50","60","70","80","10","99","300","400","200"]},"In a first exemplary embodiment according to this invention, a user of the personal computer  initiates a request for the average salary of employees in company A contained in the extracted knowledge repository . The requested information may include average salary information for an employee of company A. However, it will be apparent that in various other embodiments, the requested information may include, but is not limited to average salaries of a governmental department, average salaries for a specific position reported across all companies in an industry trade group, and\/or any other type of private information.","The request is forwarded to the input\/output circuit  of the system for protecting privacy . The system for protecting privacy  mediates access to the extracted knowledge repository . The processor  activates the extracted knowledge characteristics determination circuit  to determine the characteristics of the transforms used to extract knowledge. In one of the various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the extracted knowledge characteristics determination circuit  retrieves the characteristics of the extracted knowledge transforms from the extracted knowledge or data repository . That is, the extracted knowledge is associated with information about the type of knowledge extraction transforms used to create the extracted knowledge. The characteristics of the extracted knowledge transforms are then encoded into extensible markup language (XML) tags stored within the extracted knowledge file, associated with a table in a relational database, and\/or encoded using any known or later developed method that associates the characteristics of the extracted knowledge transforms with the extracted knowledge and\/or data.","The processor then activates the data characteristics determination circuit . The data characteristics determination circuit  determines characteristics of the data set from which the knowledge was extracted. The data characteristics may include but are not limited to indications of whether the data has been aggregated in previous steps, the sensitivity of the data or any characteristic useful in protecting the privacy of subjects associated with the information. The data characteristics are optionally encoded using extensible markup language (XML) tags stored within the extracted knowledge information, associated with relational databases and\/or encoded using any known or later developed method of associating the data characteristics information with the extracted knowledge or data.","The processor  then optionally activates the public information determination circuit . The public information determination circuit  determines what information has already been revealed to the public. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the public information determination circuit  dynamically queries the optional public information repository  to determine the public information currently known about a subject.","In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the public information determination circuit  is loaded with public information. The public information may be downloaded from a secure source of public information, or determined using any other known or later developed method. The processor  then activates the privacy policy determination circuit . The privacy policy determination circuit  retrieves one or more relevant privacy policies. The relevant privacy policies are associated with the subject, the jurisdiction, the customer or any other known or later developed feature relevant to determining one or more relevant privacy policies. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the relevant privacy policies are retrieved from a central repository such as a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) server, a directory server, a database or any other known or later developed information source.","Information about subjects in the extracted knowledge is associated with privacy policies. The privacy policies govern the entities to whom the information can be released, the length of time the information can be retained, permissible uses of the information and the like. Additional relevant privacy policies may be imposed by various parties. For example, a government licensing agency accumulates information about a medical professional for licensing purposes. The government agency may specify a privacy policy that allows sharing the information with hospitals and insurance providers but which prohibits transfer of the licensing information to third parties. In various other exemplary uses, a privacy policy created by a corporation is applied to prohibit the disclosure of any information not specifically required by law or regulation. It will be apparent that one or more privacy policies may be applied in combination with the extracted knowledge to determine the type of privacy protecting transformations required. Thus, a subjects' privacy policy may be combined with a health provider's privacy policy. The combined subject-health-provider privacy policy is in turn combined with an insurance company's privacy policy to provide a combined subject-health-provider-insurer privacy policy. It will be apparent that the privacy policies of relevant groups such as subjects, third party processors, aggregators, juridical entities and the like are all combinable within a combined privacy policy according to various embodiments of this invention.","The processor  then activates the privacy protecting transformation circuit . The privacy protecting transformation circuit  uses the determined privacy policy, the characteristics of the extracted knowledge, the characteristics of the data from which the knowledge was extracted, an optional previous user history and the optional public information concerning a subject to determine the privacy protecting transformations required to comply with the determined privacy policy.","The privacy protecting transformation circuit  includes characteristic information about how the different knowledge extraction transformations, the characteristics of the underlying data and the public information concerning one or more subjects, interact to disclose identifying and\/or sensitive information. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the privacy protection transformation circuit  receives information about the characteristics of the knowledge extraction transformations and the characteristics of the data set from a central repository. However, in still other exemplary embodiments, the characteristics of the knowledge extraction transformations and the characteristics of the data set are encoded directly within the circuit, learned through machine learning or determined using any known or later developed method.","The processor  applies the determined privacy protecting transformations required to achieve the specified privacy policy. The privacy protected extracted knowledge is then returned over the communications links  to the user of personal computer . It will be apparent that the system for protecting privacy  may be included directly within the extracted knowledge repository  or at any other location accessible over communications links .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["2000","2005"]},"In step S, a query is determined. The query is determined by a customer who is presented with a description and\/or summary of the information\/knowledge available for query and possibly sale. The publicly available information may be determined before, after and\/or simultaneously with the query without departing from the scope of this invention. After the query is determined, control continues to step S.","The extracted information is determined based on the query in step S. The extracted information includes averages, groups, cluster membership or other aggregate information concerning the subjects. Access to the underlying databases containing discrete records for the subjects is not typically available. Thus, the aggregated information and not the underlying subject records are typically available. Control then continues to step S.","In step S, information about the characteristics of the transforms applied to extract the information are determined. After the information about the characteristics of the applied transforms have been determined, control continues to step S.","The information about the characteristics of the data from which the information was extracted, is determined in step SS. The characteristics may include the sensitivity of the data such as bank account and or medical record information and the like. After the data characteristics have been determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, information about the public information concerning the subject is optionally determined. Public information is information about a subject that has already been released, is widely known and\/or is easily obtained. The public information may be optionally purchased from a public information repository, or may be made available for free. After the public information concerning the subject has been optionally determined, control continues to step S.","A query history for the customer or group of customers is then optionally determined in step S. The query history contains the prior requests from the customer and\/or other customers. The query history is used to ensure that the result of the current query, even if combined with prior results, does not violate any of the relevant privacy policies. After the query history has been optionally determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, the privacy policy is determined. The privacy policy may be a single privacy policy or a combined privacy policy. Moreover, the privacy policy may be privacy policies associated with subjects of a query, the entity or organization supplying the information, making the query and\/or any other combination. Control then continues to step S where the privacy policy is used to transform the extracted information based on the result of the current query, the characteristics of the applied transformations, the characteristics of the data, the optional query history and the optional public information concerning the subject. Control then continues to step S and the process ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["100","510","520","510"]},"The system for protecting privacy  allows employees outside of trusted departments to include the effect of salary and other sensitive information in their analyses. This makes it possible to analyze the organization's salary information in context. Thus, by extracting knowledge such as company-wide average salary information from corporate information repositories and interposing a system for protecting privacy  between any requester and the extracted knowledge, the extracted knowledge is safely released to the requestor while maintaining the relevant privacy controls.","For example, a system for protecting privacy  can be used to ensure that average salary information is computed across a large enough number of subjects that nothing of significance can be learned about any single subject, that no single or small group of salaries contributes unduly to the average, and that the answer to the query is not combined with the answers to previous queries or with publicly available information to reveal information about a subject.","The information storefront , forwards the customer's query to the system for protecting privacy .","The privacy protecting system  receives the query and determines if satisfying the customer query would violate a selected privacy policy  contained in the privacy policy information store. The privacy policy  reflects the desired privacy and\/or anonymity for each subject. As discussed above, the privacy policy  may also reflect privacy preferences imposed by an organization such as a third party processor of the subject's information, either alone or in combination with the subject's privacy policy. The privacy policy  allows different types of information about a subject to have different types of protection. For example, the medical history of a subject is typically associated with a different type of protection than that associated with a subject's hair color. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, a privacy policy  may be recommended and\/or required by statute, government agency, corporate policy or social norms. However, it will be apparent that any known or later developed criteria may be used to recommend\/select and\/or create a privacy policy  without departing from the scope of this invention.","Information about publicly available information  for a subject is used as a standard against which disclosures are measured. That is, information about the available public information for a subject or entity is determined and returned to the system for protecting privacy . In some cases, a privacy policy  may even prohibit disclosure of publicly available information. Thus, an organization may prohibit further dissemination of derogatory or sensitive publicly available information. For example, an organization may enforce a privacy policy  that prohibits revealing home address information even if that information is already publicly available through online telephone directories, county tax records or the like. In various other exemplary embodiments according to this invention, organizations or individuals select a privacy policy  that prohibits further dissemination of information perceived as damaging or derogatory. These determinations may be based on manually or automatically generated surveys of public attitude and the like.","The system for protecting privacy  monitors successive customer requests to determine if any of the query results can be combined to violate the determined privacy policy . The query results violating the privacy policy  are withheld or merged, generalized or otherwise transformed to comply with the determined privacy policy .","Information that is combinable with public information to identify a subject more specifically than permitted by the privacy policy  is also withheld, merged, generalized or otherwise transformed to protect the privacy.","The privacy protecting system  retrieves the extracted knowledge from the extracted knowledge repository . The extracted knowledge repository  contains extracted knowledge or data determined by applying the knowledge extraction transformations to one or more data sources -. The data sources - may include, but are not limited to, repositories of ubiquitous sensor data , transactions data , health records, clinical trial records, survey data, outsourced data  or any other known or later developed source of information.","Thus, in one exemplary embodiment according to this invention, a manager of a workgroup submits a query to compare the average salary of her workgroup to the average salary of other workgroups in the organization. The average salary information is extracted from a personnel database either dynamically or in a prior step. The system for protecting privacy  obtains the extracted average salary knowledge or data and determines whether the extracted knowledge or data can be forwarded to the manager. The system for protecting privacy  determines what privacy transformations should be applied based on the extracted knowledge or data, information about the characteristics of the data used and the characteristics of the applied knowledge extraction transformations and the selected privacy policy .","The extracted knowledge is associated or tagged with information identifying the type of transformation or algorithm applied, the scope of the data used in the computation, the number of subjects represented in the extracted knowledge and characteristics of the knowledge extraction transformation and\/or data set used. The system for protecting privacy  uses information about the applied knowledge extraction transformations, and characteristics about the data sets to determine if the extracted knowledge satisfies the privacy policy . If the privacy policy  is violated, the information or tags associated with the extracted knowledge are used to transform the extracted knowledge and to achieve the desired privacy policy .","The transformations may include but are not limited to merging, generalizing or withholding the extracted knowledge to achieve the desired privacy policy . In cases where the privacy policy  cannot be complied with by merging and\/or generalizing the extracted information, the extracted knowledge may be withheld. The system for protecting privacy  queries the data sources in real time or on a periodic schedule in order to dynamically learn characteristics of the data sources - useful in protecting privacy.","The result of the query is then forwarded to the system for protecting privacy  to ensure that the identities of subject employees are not revealed and that the release of the extracted knowledge is consistent with the selected privacy policy . Optionally, if the extracted knowledge can be combined with public information to identify groups of individuals below a threshold set by the privacy policy, then the extracted knowledge is further transformed by merging\/generalizing, withholding or otherwise transforming the extracted knowledge information.","In one of the various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, similar categories of information are combined to create larger groups of individuals in which each subject's individual information is more effectively hidden or anonymized. If categories of similar information cannot be combined, the category values are omitted to protect privacy. It will be apparent that these privacy protecting transformations are merely illustrative and that any privacy protecting transformation of the query result may be used by the system for protecting privacy  without departing from the spirit or scope of this invention.","The privacy protected result is then forwarded by the system for protecting privacy  to the information storefront . The information storefront  forwards the privacy protected result to the customer and optionally bills for the information. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, an information storefront  provides free privacy protected access to government or other data. In still other embodiments, the storefront provides free or metered privacy protected access for company or organization employees, to company or third party information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","610","620","630","640"]},"The first row of the first exemplary data structure for storing data to be mined  contains the value \u201cABC\u201d in the company identifier portion .
