The entire teachings of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference.","Dry eye, also know as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface (, \u201cThe Definition and Classification of Dry Eye Disease: Report of the Definition and Classification Subcommittee of the International Dry Eye Workshop (2007),\u201d 5(2): 75-92 (2007)). Dry eye is recognized as a disturbance of the lacrimal functional unit, an integrated system comprising the lacrimal glands, ocular surface (cornea, conjunctiva and meibomian glands) and lids, and the sensory and motor nerves that connect them. The lacrimal functional unit controls the major components of the tear film in a regulated fashion and responds to environmental, endocrinological, and cortical influences. The unit's function is to preserve the integrity of the tear film, the transparency of the cornea, and the quality of the image projected onto the retina. Disease or damage to any component of the lacrimal functional unit (the afferent sensory nerves, the efferent autonomic and motor nerves and the tear-secreting glands) can destabilize the tear film and lead to ocular surface disease that expresses itself as dry eye.","The major classes of dry eye are aqueous tear-deficient dry eye (ADDE) and evaporative dry eye (EDE). ADDE is due to failure of lacrimal tear secretion and this class can be further subdivided to Sjogren syndrome dry eye (the lacrimal and salivary glands are targeted by an autoimmune process, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) and non-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome dry eye (lacrimal dysfunction, but the systemic autoimmune features of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome are excluded, e.g., age-related dry eye). EDE is due to excessive water loss from the exposed ocular surface in the presence of normal lacrimal secretory function. Its causes can be intrinsic (due to intrinsic disease affecting lid structures or dynamics, e.g., meibomian gland dysfunction) or extrinsic (where ocular surface disease occurs due to some extrinsic exposure, e.g., vitamin A deficiency) (See , \u201cThe Definition and Classification of Dry Eye Disease: Report of the Definition and Classification Subcommittee of the International Dry Eye Workshop (2007),\u201d 5(2): 75-92 (2007)).","Dry Eye is one of the most common ocular problems with an estimated prevalence of 4.91 million people in the United States affecting around 3.23 million women and 1.68 million men over the age of fifty (, \u201cThe Epidemiology of Dry Eye Disease,\u201d 5(2): 93-107 (2007)). Current therapies for dry eye are palliative with a focus on the replacement of tears to reduce symptoms. Over-the-counter artificial tear formulations are available. In addition, a non-pharmacological approach for improving aqueous tear film content is punctual tamponade occlusion. However, punctual tamponade occlusion carries the risk of reduced tear production, clearance and ocular surface sensation. While these palliative therapies have benefits over the short term, they have limited utility in long-term control therapy for dry eye. RESTASIS\u00ae (cyclosporine A) is the first prescription product for dry eye therapy. RESTASIS\u00ae increases tear production in patients whose tear production is suppressed as a result of ocular inflammation associated with dry eye disease. However, there is a need for therapies that have a broader application than anti-inflammatory medication.","Several clinical studies have found that topical NGF improves the corneal sensitivity in dry eye and increases the number of conjunctival goblet cell density in a study of dogs with surgically induced dry eye (Bonini, S., et al., \u201cTopical Treatment with Nerve Growth Factor for Neurotrophic Keratitis,\u201d Ophthalmology, 107: 1347-1352 (2000)). However, due to the fact that NGF stimulates neurite sprouting by neural cells, one of the side effects of administration of topical NGF is ocular pain (Bonini, S., et al., \u201cTopical Treatment with Nerve Growth Factor for Neurotrophic Keratitis,\u201d Ophthalmology, 107: 1347-1352 (2000)). In addition, NGF has poor pharmacokinetics and bioavailability and the costs for manufacturing are high. A need exists in the art for alternative methods of treating dry eye.","The invention provides a method of treating dry eye in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to said subject an effective amount of a n-turn peptidomimetic cyclic compound.

In addition, the usefulness of the \u03b2-turn peptidomimetic cyclic compound of the present invention in treating dry eye may rely on other modulations of neurotrophin-like activities such as, e.g., effects on the chemotactic recruitment of leukocytes, effects on granulocyte differentiation, effects on neutrophils, mast cells and eosinophils, effects on corneal epithelial cell proliferation, and upregulating selective sensory neuropeptides, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide.","As used herein a \u201cTrk receptor modulator compound\u201d is a TrkA receptor agonist, TrkC receptor agonist, or a compound that is both a TrkA receptor agonist and a TrkC receptor agonist.","As used herein \u201cmodulating\u201d or \u201cmodulator\u201d refers to agonizing or antagonizing a receptor.","As used herein a \u201cp75 receptor modulator\u201d is a p75 receptor agonist or antagonist.","Neurotrophins and Neurotrophin Receptors","Neurotrophins (NTFs) are a family of dimeric proteins that regulate the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of neurons in all vertebrate species. The NTFs include Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and Neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). These NTFs bind to two transmembrane receptors, the high affinity receptor family tyrosine kinase (Trk) (TrkA, Trk B and Trk C) (K=10-100 \u03bcM) and the p75 receptor (K=1 nM). The Trk family receptor ligands are quite selective (e.g., NGF binds TrkA, BDNF binds TrkB; and NT-3 binds mainly TrkC).","Neurotrophins and their receptors have been identified in conjunctival goblet cells (CGCs) (Rios, J. D., et al., \u201cRole of Neurotrophins and Neurotrophin Receptors in Rat Conjunctival Goblet Cell Secretion and Proliferation, & 48: 1543-1551 (2007)). CGCs are the primary source of large soluble mucins in the tear film. These mucins provide a physical and chemical barrier that protects the cornea and conjunctiva from exogenous agents (bacterial or chemical) and facilitates the occurrence of a smooth refractive surface necessary for clear vision.","\u03b2-Turn Peptidomimetic Cyclic Compounds","In one embodiment, the \u03b2-turn peptidomimetic cyclic compound comprises a macrocyclic ring of 13 to 17 carbon atoms.

D., et al., \u201cRole of Neurotrophins and Neurotrophin Receptors in Rat Conjunctival Goblet Cell Secretion and Proliferation, & 48: 1543-1551 (2007), explant cultures were established from rat inferior conjunctival tissue. Cells derived from the explants were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 U\/mL)\/streptomycin (100 m\/mL) at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified 5% CO-atmosphere for seventy-two hours. Contaminating nongoblet cells were removed by scraping them from the plate. During this time, goblet cells migrated from the pieces and began to proliferate. After one week, the goblet cells were trypsinized and plated in twenty-four well culture plates with RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS.","Measurement of Glycoconjugate Secretion:","To measure glycoconjugate secretion, the conjunctival goblet cells were grown to confluence and were serum deprived for two hours before addition of nerve growth factor (NGF), carbachol (Cch), compound D3, compound 3Aa and compound 3Ak for two hours. Compounds D3, 3Aa and 3Ak were administered at concentrations of 30 \u03bcm (micromolar), 10 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM and 0.3 \u03bcM. The vehicle used to dissolve the compounds, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was also included. DMSO was used as the basal control for the 30 \u03bcM concentration of compound, which was at 0.1% (v\/v). The cholinergic agonist carbachol (Cch), added at 100 \u03bcM (micromolar), was a positive control for glycoconjugate secretion. The amount of glycoconjugate secreted into the media was measured by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). The media were collected and analyzed for amount of the lectin-detectable glycoconjugates, including mucins. The amount of secretion was measured by using the lectin UEA-I which is specific for rat conjunctival goblet cell mucins. Biotinylated UEA-I lectin and alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin were used as described in Rios, J.

RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS was used as the positive control in cell proliferation studies. CGC proliferation was determined with a colorimetric nonradioactive, WST-8 proliferation assay that measures the number of cells. This procedure employs the 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt (WST-8), which is cleaved by viable, growing mitochondria to form a dark blue formazan product that is detected by a fluorescence ELISA reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, Vt.) at 460 nm.","Data Presentation:","Data for CGC glycoconjugate secretion and proliferation were expressed as the increase (x-fold) above basal value, which was standardized to 1.0.

Animals were housed 2 per cage under constant light conditions (12-h light\/12-h dark cycle), room temperature (22\u00b11\u00b0 C.) and relative humidity (40-70%). All procedures in this study complied with McGill University's animal welfare policies and were approved by the Lady Davis Research Institute (LDI) Animal Care and Use Committee. The standards for animal care and use conform with or exceed those defined in the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC).","Isolation of Conjunctival Tissue:","Animals were anaesthetized before euthanasia in an Isofluorane 99.9% USB (Abraxis Bioscience, Richmond Hill, Ont) chamber. Animals were euthanized by lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital 2 mL\/0.4 kg or 300 mg\/kg (Ceva Sante Animale, Libourne, France). Conjunctival tissue, more specifically the nictitating membranes and formix, were excised and immediately placed into Hanks\u201d balanced salt solution containing 3\u00d7 penicillin-streptomycin (300 ug\/mL). The formix was identified as the band running along the most posterior part of the fold at the junction of the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva. The lower, nasal portion of the formix was grasped and lifted, and it was cut from the conjunctiva.","Culture of Conjunctival Goblet Cells:","RPMI-1640 culture medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin, and Hank's balanced salt solution were obtained from Wisent (St. Bruno, Quebec). L-glutamine and 0.05% trypsin-EDTA were from Gibco (Grand Island, N.Y.). Tissue culture flasks and culture dishes were from Corning (Lowell, Mass.) and Laboratory Tek chamber slides were from Nunc (Rochester, N.Y.).","The culturing of conjunctival goblet cells from explant cultures was as previously described in Shatos, M. et al., \u201cIsolation, Characterization, and Propagation of Rat Conjunctival Goblet Cells In Vitro,\u201d IOVS 42:1455-1464 (2001), the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Explant cultures were refed every 2 days. Within a few days, goblet cells migrated from the pieces and began to proliferate. After approximately one week, the tissue plugs were removed and the goblet cells were allowed to grow to confluence. Cells were passaged once by trypsinization of adherent cells with 0.05% trypsin-0.53 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), and plated in 8-well Laboratory Tek chamber slides (histochemistry) or in 96 well (proliferation), 24 well (secretion), or 6 well (western blots) culture plates with complete RPMI-1640 media.","Histochemistry:","Cells were fixed and processed for Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and counterstained with Hematoxylin Solution, Gill No. 3 kit (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) according to the manufacturers instructions.

Basal cultures were incubated with the saline vehicle control.","Growth, Morphology and Characterization of Cultured Goblet. Cells","As early as 2 days after establishment of the tissue plug, cells started to grow out from the tissue which continue to grow so that by day 9 adherent cells are visible all around the tissue (). On higher magnification, single cells adhering to the tissue culture well, exhibit cobblestone morphology and contain tiny translucent droplets in cytoplasmic vesicles (). Often as cells proliferated in culture, tiny droplets were observed to form on the surface of the goblet cells, suggestive of a mucus-like secretory product (, open arrows). As these droplet-containing cells grew in culture, the droplets merged into pools, which increased in size and number (, closed arrow). The results are similar to previously published results (Shatos, M. et al., \u201cIsolation, Characterization, and Propagation of Rat Conjunctival Goblet Cells In Vitro,\u201d IOVS 42:1455-1464 (2001), the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference).","It was determined that these cells have positive reactivity to PAS, indicating that these cells were associated with a neutral type of mucin secretion product (). Upon higher magnification (100\u00d7), many cytoplasmic peri-nuclear vesicles were observed (, open arrow). On examination, several of these vesicles stained intensely with PAS, indicating the presence of neutral (pink to red) glycoconjugates within secretory granules ( and C, closed arrows). The cells are counterstained blue with Heamatoxylin\/Eosin stain.","Endpoints and Results:","As discussed in detail below, compound D3 increased mucin secretion in conjunctival goblet cells with the greatest increase seen at the 2 \u03bcM dose. In addition, compound D3 at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM did not stimulate goblet cell proliferation by day 4, with no differences among the doses. Lastly, treatment of conjunctival goblet cells for five minutes with compound D3 increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation.","Glycoconjugate Secretion:","To measure cell secretion, goblet cells were grown to confluence and then serum depleted for 2 hours prior to stimulation. Cells were incubated with compound D3 at 2, 10, and 50 \u03bcM, NGF at 0.1, 1 and 10 nM, and PMA at 0.1, 1, and 10 nM in serum-free RPMI for 2 hours. Goblet cell secretion was measured using an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Briefly, an aliquot of the cell culture supernatant was transferred to a 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate in triplicate (Corning Life Sciences #2592, Fisher Scientific, Nepean, Ont). A dilution series of bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) was included on each plate as the standard (standard curve data and data showing that detection of BSM is linear between 0.003 and 0.1 \u03bcg not shown). The plates were coated by evaporation at 37\u00b0 C. overnight. After, the plates were washed three times with wash buffer [PBS containing 0.3% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20] then blocked for nonspecific binding with PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. The wells were rinsed three times in wash buffer, and then incubated in 2 \u03bcg\/mL biotinylated UEA-1 diluted in wash buffer (Vector Labs, Burlingame, Calif.) at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. The wells were rinsed three times in wash buffer, and then incubated in 1 \u03bcg\/mL HRP-conjugated neutravidin diluted in wash buffer (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. After the wells were rinsed three times in wash buffer, the color development was performed with TMB (Promega, Madison, Wis.) and stopped with 0.5N Sulfuric acid. The absorbance was read at 450 nm on a Benchmark Plus (Biorad). The goblet cells remaining in the culture wells were either scraped in RIPA buffer [1% TritonX-100, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl, 1% Na deoxycholate, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mM Na vanadate, 10 mM Na fluoride, 10 mM Na pyrophosphate, complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind.)] or 1M Tris-buffer (pH 7.5), collected and sonicated. The amount of protein in the cell homogenate was analyzed using the Bradford protein assay kit using a dilution series of bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard (BioRad, Montreal, PQ). Glycoconjugate secretion was normalized to total protein in the homogenate. Data was then expressed as fold increase above basal.","To determine whether compound D3 stimulates goblet cell mucin secretion, cultured passaged goblet cells were incubated for 2 hours in the presence of compound D3 (2, 10 and 50 \u03bcM), or NGF (0.1, 1 and 10 nM, the positive control (Rios, J. et al., \u201cRole of Neurotrophins and Neurotrophin Receptors in Rat Conjunctival Goblet Cell Secretion and Proliferation,\u201d IOVS 48:1543-1551 (2007), the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference) or PMA (0.1, 1 and 10 nM, another positive control (Dartt, D. et al., \u201cRegulation of Conjunctival Goblet Cell Secretion by Ca2+ and Protein Kinase,\u201d C.

After 24 hours, 10% Alamar Blue was added for 6 hours and the absorbance was read at 570 and 600 nm on a Benchmark Plus (Biorad). The percentage of Alamar Blue reduction was calculated according to the manufacture's instructions. The Alamar Blue containing plates were further incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 48, 72 and 96 hours, and the plates reread each day.","Goblet cell proliferation was measured in the presence of 10% FBS for up to four days. A statistically significant increase in proliferation was obtained over time with 10% FBS (247\u00b12 fold at day 3, P<0.0001). After three days of incubation with 10% FBS the percent reduction of Alamar Blue decreased due to high cell numbers or extended incubation times. To determine whether compound D3 and NGF stimulates goblet cell proliferation, goblet cells were incubated in serum-free media in the presence of increasing concentrations of compound D3 () or NGF for up to four days. NGF at all concentrations did not increase proliferation up to day four. Compound D3 at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM did not stimulate goblet cell proliferation by day four (concentrations less than 3 \u03bcM are not shown) with no differences among the dose response (P=0.1098). Combination of NGF with 10 \u03bcM or 100 \u03bcM compound D3 had no effect on proliferation (data not shown).","MAPK:","The activation of p42\/44 MAPK was examined using Western blot techniques. Goblet cells were serum starved in serum-free RPMI for 4-6 hrs prior to the addition of PMA (100 nM), NGF (1 or 10 nM), or MIM-D3 (10 or 50 \u03bcM) for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. After, cells were rinsed once in cold PBS, scraped in 100 \u03bcL of 1\u00d7SDS-PAGE sample buffer [62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02 mg\/mL bromophenol blue] and sonicated for 20 minutes. The homogenates were centrifuged at 14,900 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0 C. Proteins in a 30-4 aliquot of the supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 2 hours in 5% non-fat dried milk in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.01% Tween-20 (TBST). The blots were then probed with an antibody directed against the phosphorylated form of MAPK1\/2 (Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif.) at 0.1 \u03bcg\/mL in TBST containing 5% BSA overnight at 4\u00b0 C., followed by a 1 hour incubation in HRP-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) at room temperature in TBST containing 5% non-fat dried milk. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.). The blots were stripped at 55\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes in stripping buffer [62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol] followed by re-probing with an antibody directed against actin (1:5000 dilution, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) in TBST containing 5% non-fat dried milk and incubation in HRP-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody. The immunoreactive bands were digitally scanned on an EPSON scanner and analyzed using NIH ImageJ v1.38x. The amount of phosphorylated MAPK in each sample was standardized to the amount of total actin protein in the sample.","To determine if compound D3 and NGF induced glycoconjugates secretion via activation of the MAPK pathway, cultured goblet cells from 3 independent rats were stimulated by 10 and 50 \u03bcM compound D3, 1 and 10 nM NGF or PMA (100 nM, the positive control) for 5 minutes and MAPK activity was measured by western blot analysis. A representative western blot from 3 independent rat goblet cell cultures is shown in , and the quantification is shown in . There was a statistically significant effect of treatment on MAPK activation (P<0.0001). Compound D3 increased MAPK activity above basal by 2.5\u00b10.3 fold at 10 \u03bcM and 2.2\u00b10.5 fold at 50 \u03bcM and NGF increased MAPK activity by 2.8\u00b10.5 at 1 nM (P<0.05) and 1.7\u00b10.2 at 10 nM. The positive control PMA statistically significantly increased MAPK activity 6.1\u00b10.7 fold (P<0.01).","Data Presentation and Statistical Analysis:","Data are expressed as the increase (x-fold) above basal value, which was standardized to 1.0. Results are expressed as the mean\u00b1SEM. Data are analyzed by one-way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism v4.0c (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, Calif.). P<0.05 is considered statistically significant. For comparison to basal control adjustment with Dunnett's test was used.","The purpose of this study was to use the scopolamine model of dry eye to study the efficacy of compound D3. The scopolamine model was chosen based on earlier research comparing a controlled environment chamber (CEC) to the scopolamine model of dry eye.","Animals:","Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 300 g and 350 g were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, Mass.). Animals were housed in animal quarters under constant room temperature (22\u00b11\u00b0 C.), light conditions (12-h light\/12-h dark cycle), and humidity (40-60%). Animals were anaesthetized before the surgical experiment and clinical examination with isofluorane.","Induction of Dry Eye by Cholinergic Blockade:","Dry eye was induced using scopolamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.), which was continuously and systemically delivered to the animals via an osmotic pump (2ML4 Alzet\u00ae; CedarLane, Burlington, Ontario) filled with scopolamine and implanted subcutaneously in the mid dorsal area between the scapulae. The wound was closed with 2-3 wound clips. After the surgery and again the next day, the animals were subcutaneously injected with Carprofen (0.5 mg\/100 g) a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and potent, long-acting analgesic in rodents. Animals were anaesthetized before the surgical pump implantation and before all clinical endpoint testing in an Isofluorane 99.9% USP (Abraxis Bioscience, Richmond Hill, Ontario) chamber. Scopolamine was delivered at 12.5 mg\/day and, for technical reasons, the data was evaluated at day 14.","The sterile solution of 0.175 g\/mL of scopolamine hyrdobromide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis Mo.) was prepared in saline (0.9%) and filtered through a 0.22 um syringe-end filter (Millex-GC, Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.). The 2ML4 Alzet\u00ae pumps were filled with 2 mL of 0.175 g\/mL scopolamine solution according to the manufacturer's instructions.","Treatment Groups:","The groups of rat eyes tested were as follows:\n\n","As discussed in detail below, the group treated with topical 1% compound D3 on day eight had a significant reduction (p<0.0001) in corneal fluorescein staining, with a mean score of 1.1\u00b10.1 as compared to the saline-treated control on day fourteen, but had no effect on aqueous tear production and aqueous tear turnover as measured at day thirteen as compared to the untreated or scopolamine treated controls.","There were no mortalities, but there were two morbidities (one in Group 2 and one in Group 3) in which the incision wound sites were reopened due to chewing and the pumps exposed. The clinical sign data was excluded for these two animals. Mild to severe ocular irritation was observed in all scopolamine treated animals (Groups 2-4) from day two onward. Most scopolamine treated animals eyes showed conjunctival congestion, swelling and conjunctival bloody discharge. Conjunctival congestion and bloody discharge usually resolved. However, the conjunctival swelling continued throughout the study. Ocular irritation was observed during the dosing of the animals, even under anesthesia.","Pre-treatment, mean body weight was approximately 350 g, and was not statistically different among groups (P=0.3999). Mean body weight in the untreated control groups (Group 1) increased to approximately 420 g by Day 14. In the three groups receiving scopolamine (Group 2-Group 4), mean body weight increased to approximately 375 g. There was a statistically significant effect of treatment to decrease body weight starting on Day 7, continuing through Day 14 (P=0.0042).","Corneal Staining:","The clinical signs of corneal dryness were evaluated by fluorescein impregnation of the cornea. A drop of a 1% fluorescein sodium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) solution made up in sterile saline was instilled in the conjunctival sac of the anaesthetized animal. The cornea was thereafter observed under blue light using a Portable Slit Lamp ophthalmoscope with blue cobalt filter (Reichert Opthalmic Instruments, Depew, N.Y.) three minutes after fluorescein instillation. For each animal, the punctate fluorescent-positive area of the ocular surface was recorded in a blinded fashion. The score of this test was graded from 0 to 4, where 0=no staining, 1=<25% surface staining, 2=25-50% surface staining, 3=50-75% surface staining and 4=>75% surface staining.","As shown in , the control group (na\u00efve) showed almost complete absence of corneal fluorescein staining, with a mean score (Score\u00b1SD) of 0.8\u00b10.1. The untreated dry eye group (scopolamine alone) showed a significant degree of punctate and diffuse corneal fluorescein staining, with a mean score of 2.3\u00b10.3 on day fourteen post-scopolamine pump implantation. The group treated with topical saline on day eight post-scopolamine pump implantation also showed a significant degree of corneal fluorescein staining on day fourteen, similar to the untreated dry eye group, with a mean score of 2.9\u00b10.3. The group treated with topical 1% compound D3 on day eight had a significant reduction (p<0.0001) in corneal fluorescein staining, with a mean score of 1.1\u00b10.1 as compared to the saline-treated control on day fourteen. In addition, at day fourteen the mean value in the group treated with topical 1% compound D3 (1.1\u00b10.1) was not statistically different from Group 1 (untreated control, 0.8\u00b10.1, p>0.05).","Schirmer Test:","Tear production was measured with Zone-Quick standardized phenol-red threads (FCI Ophthalmics, Marshfield Hills, Mass.) on animals lightly sedated with Isoflurane. The threads were inserted in the lateral lower canthus and left in place for thirty seconds. The length of the stained moistened portion of the thread was measured in millimeters, using the scale provided with the threads to an accuracy of 1 mm. Schirmer testing was routinely combined with tear fluorescein clearance as described in the section below.","At baseline, the mean pre-treatment Schirmer score for all groups was 13.7\u00b14.2 mm (P=0.6943). After six days, scopolamine treated animals had lower Schirmer scores (i.e. less tears) than untreated controls (9.2\u00b12.5 mm compared to 16.0\u00b15.4 mm, P<0.0001), corresponding to dry eye induction. A single topical dose with saline (Group 3) or 1% compound D3 (Group 4) on day eight, was followed by a 5-day no treatment period. On day thirteen, the groups receiving scopolamine had statistically significant lower Schirmer scores than untreated control (Group 1) (P<0.0001), with no statistically significant difference among dosed groups (). A single topical instillation of 1% compound D3 on day eight has no effect on aqueous tear production as measured at day thirteen (five days later) compared to the untreated or scopolamine treated controls.","Tear Fluorescein Clearance:","Tear fluorescein clearance was evaluated as described for humans (Afonso, A A. et al., \u201cCorrelation of Tear Fluorescein Clearance and Schirmer Test Scores with Ocular Irritation Symptoms,\u201d Ophthalmology 106:803-810 (1999), the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference) and modified for rats (Chen, W. et al., \u201cKeratoconjunctivitis Sicca Modifies Epithelial Stem Cell Proliferation Kinetics in Conjunctiva,\u201d Cornea 26:1101-1106 (2007), the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference). Animals were lightly sedated with Isoflurane and two microliters of 1% sodium fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) solution (in sterile saline) was applied to the lower conjunctival sac. The animals awoke within two minutes. After fifteen minutes, the animals were re-sedated and the fluorescein-stained tear fluid was collected with a phenol-red cotton thread (exactly as for Schirmer testing). The threads were immediately sealed in 1.5 mL polypropylene Eppendorf tubes shielded from light until fluorophotometric analysis. The length of cotton wetting in mm determined the volume of the collected tear fluid.","After, 100 \u03bcl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added, the tubes were spun at 12,000 rpm for five minutes and the fluid transferred to a 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate (Corning Life Sciences #2592, Fisher Scientific, Nepean, Ont.). A standard well was prepared on each plate, which consisted of a phenol-red thread placed in 100 \u03bcl PBS containing 2 \u03bcl of 1% sodium fluorescein solution. Fluorescence was measured immediately using a fluorescence microplate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA, BMG Labtech, Germany) after setting the gain to the standard well. The concentration of fluorescein in tears was calculated from the fluorescence units (FU) divided by the mm of cotton wetting (FU\/mm).","Aqueous tear turnover was measured by fluorescein clearance. At baseline, the mean fluorescein clearance value was 606\u00b1496 FU\/mm (P=0.8920). At subsequent examinations on day six and thirteen, numerically, the groups receiving scopolamine had higher values (i.e., less tear turnover) than the Group 1 (untreated control). This difference was statistically significant at day 13 (0.0304), but not day 6 (P=0.1117) (). A single topical instillation of 1% compound D3 on day eight has no effect on aqueous tear turnover as measured at day thirteen (5 days later) compared to the untreated or scopolamine treated controls.","Statistical Analysis:","The mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to characterize the data for each study group. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for body weight and the ophthalmic signs for treatment groups at every observation using GraphPad Prism 4.0c (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, Calif.). When stratified by examination day, when the treatment group was statistically significant (p<0.05, two-tail), pair wise comparisons were performed. For comparison to the untreated control (Group 1 or A), adjustment with Dunnett's test was used. No corrections were made for multiple comparisons. The among group P values are not shown and the difference between each of a pair of means (reported P values as >0.05, <0.05, <0.01 or <0.001) are not shown.","Dose-ranging studies were conducted on the topical instillations of compound D3 in stimulating mucin production in na\u00efve rats. Thirty male sprague dawley rats were divided into five groups of six rats per group and were treated bilaterally once every hour for six consecutive hours with either saline, 0.4% of compound D3, 1.0% of compound D3, 2.5% of compound D3 and 0.00053% of NGF. Once anesthetized, each animal received a 5 pt topical instillation of test article into the lower conjunctival sac of both eyes using a calibrated micropipette.","Tear fluid washings from both eyes were pooled and were collected prior to treatment and following six hourly instillations of saline, compound D3 and NGF. All tear fluid washings were evaluated for mucin concentration by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA).","The mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to characterize the data. The differences in mucin concentration was calculated from treated minus baseline from groups of rats. Continuous mucin changes between two groups from baseline were evaluated using the paired t test. The mucin changes between more than two treatment groups were analyzed using an analysis of variance. The median mucin changes between treatment groups were compared against a theoretical median of zero using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. A two-sided test with P<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0C (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, Calif.).","The results demonstrated that, after treatment, the difference among groups was not statistically significant (p=0.1430). When pair wise comparisons were made between treated to baseline, there was a statistically significant increase in mucin concentration in animals treated with 2.5% compound D3 () (from 3.0\u00b11.9 ng\/\u03bcL to 7.0\u00b14.5 ng\/\u03bcL, p=0.0413), but not other groups (p=0.1799 to 8454). In addition, the difference among groups was not statistically significant (p=0.0818). When the difference among groups were compared against a theoretical median of zero, there was a statistically significant increase in the group treated with 2.5% of compound D3 (4.0\u00b13.5 ng\/\u03bcL p-0.0312), but not other groups (p=0.1562 to 1.1250). Numerically, the increases in mean changes in mucin concentration in all of the groups treated with compound D3 were dose-dependent ().","Animals:","Male Sprague-Dawley rats (six to eight weeks old) weighing between 360 g and 470 g were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, Mass.). Animals were housed in animal quarters under constant room temperature (22\u00b11\u00b0 C.), light conditions (12-h light\/12-h dark cycle), and relative humidity (32-61%). Animals were anaesthetized before the surgical pump implantation and before all clinical endpoint testing in an isoflurane 99.9% (Abraxis Bioscience, Richmond Hill, Ontario) chamber.","Induction of Dry Eye by Cholinergic Blockade:","Dry eye was induced using scopolamine hydrobromide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.), which was continuously and systemically delivered to the animals via an osmotic pump (2ML4 Alzet\u00ae; CedarLane, Burlington, Ontario) filled with scopolamine and implanted subcutaneously in the mid dorsal area between the scapulae. Scopolamine was delivered for a twenty-eight day period at 12.5 mg\/day, which translated to 30.0\u00b11.5 mg\/kg via osmotic pump.","A sterile solution of 0.175 g\/mL of scopolamine hydrobromide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was prepared in saline. The solution was filtered through a 0.22 um syringe-end filter (Millex-GC, Millipore Corp, Bedford, Mass.), and stored refrigerated overnight. Alzet\u00ae Osmotic pumps (Model 2ML4, LOT NO. 10187-08, CedarLane Laboratories, Burlington, Ontario) were filled with 2 mL of the scopolamine solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sterile technique was used during the filling and handling of the pumps.","After the surgery and again the next day, the animals were subcutaneously injected with Caprofen (0.5 mg\/100 g) a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and potent, long-acting analgesic in rodents. Animals were weighed prior to pump implantation on Day-1, and then once a week for four weeks. This dosing regimen was reported to induce dry eye in rats (Viau S et al., \u201cTime course of ocular surface and lacrimal gland changes in a new scopolamine-induced dry eye model,\u201d 246:857-867 (2008), the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference).","Treatment Groups:","As seen in Table 3 and , the groups of rat eyes tested were as follows:\n\n","Treatments for G2-G6 continued daily for seventeen days (up to an including day twenty-one).

Animals were lightly sedated with Isoflurane and two microliters of 1% sodium fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) solution (in sterile saline) was applied to the lower conjunctival sac. The animals awoke within two minutes. After fifteen minutes, the animals were re-sedated and the fluorescein-stained tear fluid was collected with a phenol-red cotton thread (as described for Schirmer testing). The threads were immediately sealed in 1.5 mL polypropylene Eppendorf tubes shielded from light until fluorophotometric analysis. The volume of the collected tear fluid was determined by the length of cotton wetting in mm. After, 100 \u03bcl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added, the tubes were spun at 12,000 rpm for five minutes and the fluid transferred to a 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate (Corning Life Sciences #2592, Fisher Scientific, Nepean, Ontario). A standard well was prepared on each plate, which consisted of a phenol-red thread placed in 100 \u03bcl PBS containing 2 \u03bcl of 1% sodium fluorescein solution. Fluorescence was measured immediately using a fluorescence microplate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA, BMG Labtech, Germany) after setting the gain to the standard well. The concentration of fluorescein in tears was calculated from the fluorescence units divided by the mm of cotton wetting (Fu\/mm).","At baseline, the mean fluorescein clearance value was 387\u00b1427 FU\/mm (p=0.7506). At subsequent examinations, numerically, the groups receiving scopolamine had higher values (i.e., less tear turnover) than the Group 1 (untreated control). This difference was statistically significant at day 7 (0.0378), but not other days (p=0.1242 to 0.4472). There was no statistically significant difference among the groups that received scopolamine (Table 9 and ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0196","num":"0208"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"280pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 9"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Tear Fluorescein Clearance Data"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Tear Fluorescein Clearance (FU\/mm \u00b1 SD)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"231pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Groups",{}]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Day","1","2","3","4","5","6","P value"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u22121","178 \u00b1 151","372 \u00b1 409","288 \u00b1 247 ","575 \u00b1 682","428 \u00b1 312","483 \u00b1 562","0.7506"]},{"entry":["2","282 \u00b1 308","699 \u00b1 389","516 \u00b1 305 ","880 \u00b1 673","777 \u00b1 592","933 \u00b1 824","0.4472"]},{"entry":["5","120 \u00b1 69\u2002","1018 \u00b1 874\u2002","969 \u00b1 732 ","550 \u00b1 369","671 \u00b1 344","804 \u00b1 432","0.1377"]},{"entry":["7","113 \u00b1 49\u2002","1058 \u00b1 1101","296 \u00b1 156 ","1098 \u00b1 639\u2002","561 \u00b1 231","1080 \u00b1 572\u2002","0.0378"]},{"entry":["14","228 \u00b1 119","779 \u00b1 759","635 \u00b1 599 ","686 \u00b1 306","791 \u00b1 235 ","1097 \u00b1 1112","0.4245"]},{"entry":["20","96 \u00b1 66","659 \u00b1 746","667 \u00b1 508 ","1067 \u00b1 773\u2002","673 \u00b1 170","861 \u00b1 414","0.1242"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"left","id":"FOO-00044"},"sup":"a"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"left","id":"FOO-00045"},"sup":"4"}},{"entry":"1) Naive;"},{"entry":"2) Scopolamine + Saline;"},{"entry":"3) Scopolamine + 0.4% Compound D3;"},{"entry":"4) Scopolamine + 1.0% Compound D3;"},{"entry":"5) Scopolamine + 2.5% Compound D3;"},{"entry":"6) Scopolamine + 0.00053% NGF"}]}}]}}},"A significant inverse correlation was noted between tear fluorescein clearance values and Schirmer test values between groups at all examinations.
