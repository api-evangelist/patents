No. 11\/115,887, filed Apr. 26 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,350,132, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of Application No. 10\/659,892, filed Sep. 10, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,191,380, issued Mar. 13, 2007, the contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This invention has been made with Government support under Agreement #MDA972-01-3-005, awarded by DARPA Moletronics. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to nanoscale and hybrid nanoscale\/microscale electronic circuits and, in particular, to defect-tolerant interconnection interface devices, including demultiplexers, that produce electrically distinguishable signal levels and that are defect tolerant.","The present invention is related to nanoscale electronic circuits, including defect-tolerant demultiplexers, with electrically distinguishable output signal levels. In many embodiments, these circuits are implemented using nanoscale or hybrid nanowire\/microscale crossbars.","Nanowire crossbars provide an enormous decrease in circuitry size compared with current, photolithography-produced microelectronic and sub-microelectronic circuitry. However, many alignment and spontaneous defect problems need to be overcome to successfully manufacture electronic devices that include nanoelectronic circuits, including nanowire crossbars. A number of techniques and nanowire-crossbar implementations have been designed to overcome these alignment and defect problems, including configurable, or reprogrammable, nanowire-crossbar implementations that allow defects to be detected and circumvented by programming configurations that provide desired functionality without incorporating defective molecular junctions. These techniques are not needed for current microelectronic circuitry produced by photolithographic techniques, because microelectronic circuits can be assumed, in the current discussion, to be essentially perfect or, more precisely, the defect rate in photolithography-produced microelectronic circuits is so far below the current defect rate in nanoscale electronic circuitry that the comparatively very low defect rate in microelectronic circuitry can be ignored.","Nanoscale electronic circuits need to interface to microelectronic circuitry in order to be incorporated within commercially viable and useful electronic devices. The interface between essentially non-defective microelectronic circuitry and nanoelectronic circuitry is problematic. While various correctly functioning nanoelectronic circuits can be configured from defect-prone nanowire crossbars, these nanoscale circuits need to be interconnected with microelectronic circuits. The relatively high manufacturing-defect rate that occurs in fabricating nanoelectronic devices may produce a yield of usable combination nanoscale\/microscale circuits too low to be economically viable. However, it is not feasible to extend existing redundancy-based, defect avoidance strategies designed for nanoscale circuits to microelectronic circuitry through nanoscale-to-microscale interfaces, because these redundancy-based techniques depend on an ability to attempt a measurement of each junction in the nanoscale circuits to determine whether or not the junction is defective. Such individual access to junctions within an interconnection interface would require the interconnection interface to be properly functioning in the first place. In other words, the redundancy-based techniques assume defective nanoscale circuitry components, but rely on an ability to address the components through a properly working interconnection interface. Thus, defects in the interconnection interface result in degradation or complete lack of addressability of interconnection interface components. The interconnection interface may be viewed as a type of bootstrap mechanism that allows defect control in a nanoscale circuit, the components of which are addressed through the bootstrap For example, electronic memories based on nanowire-crossbar-implemented memory-element arrays are attractive with respect to size and power consumption, but are not economically viable using current designs and manufacturing strategies, because defects in the interconnect would make large portions of the memory unaddressable, pushing the effective cost\/bit of manufacture to a level too high to be competitive.","Another problem that arises in nanoscale electronics is that the separations between ON and OFF voltage or current states may not be sufficiently large to distinguish between ON and OFF states in the presence of noise and imperfect manufacturing tolerances in certain types of circuits, including in groups of nanowires activated by intersecting address signal lines in demultiplexers and other types of circuits. For binary-logic-based circuitry, an easily detected voltage or current separation between \u201c1,\u201d or ON, and \u201c0,\u201d or OFF, states is needed. In certain types of demultiplexers, for example, one of a large set of nanowires may be addressed by the voltage or current states on a smaller number of address lines that cross the nanowire of interest. If the selected nanowire is designed to have a low, \u201c0,\u201d or, synonymously, OFF state, and the unselected nanowires are designed to have a high, \u201c1,\u201d or, synonymously, ON state, then the voltage or current difference between the selected nanowire and the lowest voltage or lowest current unselected nanowire must be sufficiently large to be easily detected. Unfortunately, the electronic characteristics of nanowire molecular junctions may be difficult to precisely manufacture, leading to leaky diodes, resistors with a wide variation in resistance, and leaky transistors, in turn leading to undesirably narrow differences between ON and OFF states in addressed nanowires.","For these reasons, designers and manufacturers of nanoscale electronic circuitry, and, in particular, nanoscale electronic memories, have recognized the need for defect-tolerant interconnection within nanoscale circuitry in the interface between microscale and nanoscale circuits. Moreover, designers and manufacturers of nanoscale electronic circuitry have recognized the need for interconnections with distinguishable signal levels between nanowires and address signal lines that select one or a subset of nanowires to have a different voltage or current state than the remaining nanowires.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a demultiplexer implemented as a nanowire crossbar or a hybrid nanowire\/microscale-signal-line crossbar with resistor-like nanowire junctions. The demultiplexer of one embodiment provides demultiplexing of signals input on k microscale address lines to 2or fewer nanowires, employing supplemental, internal address lines to map 2nanowire addresses to a larger, internal, n-bit address space, where n>k. A second demultiplexer embodiment of the present invention provides demultiplexing of signals input on n microscale address lines to 2nanowires, with n>k, using 2, well-distributed, n-bit external addresses to access the 2nanowires. Additional embodiments of the present invention include a method for evaluating different mappings of nanowire addresses to internal address-spaces of different sizes, or to evaluate mappings of nanowires to external address-spaces of different sizes, metrics for evaluating address mapping and demultiplexer designs, and demultiplexer design methods.","Various embodiments of the present invention include combined nanoscale\/microscale electronic memory devices and fault-tolerant interconnections between microelectronic circuits and nanoelectronic circuits within the electronic memory. Specific embodiments include nanoscale and hybrid nanoscale\/microscale demultiplexes. Embodiments of the present invention employ concepts and mathematical techniques developed for error-control coding used in various data-transmission applications. Therefore, in a first subsection, a mathematical description of a number of error-control encoding techniques is provided. In a second subsection, a partially nanoscale electronic memory is described. In a third subsection, a method for determining the nanoelectronic-to-microelectronic circuit-interface topologies within the electronic memory is described. In a fourth subsection, resistor-based demultiplexers and methods for designing demultiplexers and evaluating demultiplexer designs are described.","Embodiments of the present invention employ concepts derived from well-known techniques in error-control encoding. An excellent reference for this field is the textbook \u201cError Control Coding: The Fundamentals and Applications,\u201d Lin and Costello, Prentice-Hall, Incorporated, New Jersey, 1983. In this subsection, a brief description of the error-detection and error-correction techniques used in error-control encoding are described. Additional details can be obtained from the above-referenced textbook, or from many other textbooks, papers, and journal articles in this field. The current subsection represents a rather mathematically precise, but concise, description of certain types of error-control encoding techniques. The current invention employs concepts inherent in these error-control encoding techniques for a different purpose. Error-control encoding techniques systematically introduce supplemental bits or symbols into plain-text messages, or encode plain-text messages using a greater number of bits or symbols than absolutely required, in order to provide information in encoded messages to allow for errors arising in storage or transmission to be detected and, in some cases, corrected. One effect of the supplemental or more-than-absolutely-needed bits or symbols is to increase the distance between valid codewords, when codewords are viewed as vectors in a vector space and the distance between codewords is a metric derived from the vector subtraction of the codewords. The current invention employs concepts used in error-control coding to add supplemental address signal lines to increase the distance between valid addresses in order to correspondingly increase the signal separation, e.g. voltage or current, between ON and OFF states of address signal lines and to provide defective-junction tolerance in interface interconnections. Thus, in the current invention, the plain-text and encoded messages of error-control encoding are analogous to input addresses and coded addresses, and the additional or greater-number-than-needed symbols or bits in error-control encoding are analogous to supplemental or a greater-than-absolutely-needed number of address signal lines.","In describing error detection and correction, it is useful to describe the data to be transmitted, stored, and retrieved as one or more messages, where a message \u03bc comprises an ordered sequence of symbols, \u03bc, that are elements of a field F. A message \u03bc can be expressed as:\n\n\u03bc=(\u03bc, \u03bc, . . . \u03bc)\n\nwhere \u03bc\u03b5F\n","The field F is a set that is closed under multiplication and addition, and that includes multiplicative and additive inverses. It is common, in computational error detection and correction, to employ fields comprising a subset of integers with sizes equal to a prime number, with the addition and multiplication operators defined as modulo addition and modulo multiplication. In practice, the binary field is commonly employed. Commonly, the original message is encoded into a message c that also comprises an ordered sequence of elements of the field F, expressed as follows:\n\nc=(c, c, . . . c)\n\nwhere c\u03b5F\n","Block encoding techniques encode data in blocks. In this discussion, a block can be viewed as a message \u03bc comprising a fixed number of symbols k that is encoded into a message c comprising an ordered sequence of n symbols. The encoded message c generally contains a greater number of symbols than the original message \u03bc, and therefore n is greater than k. The r extra symbols in the encoded message, where r equals n\u2212k, are used to carry redundant check information to allow for errors that arise during transmission, storage, and retrieval to be detected with an extremely high probability of detection and, in many cases, corrected.","In a linear block code, the 2codewords form a k-dimensional subspace of the vector space of all n-tuples over the field F. The Hamming weight of a codeword is the number of non-zero elements in the codeword, and the Hamming distance between two codewords is the number of elements in which the two codewords differ. For example, consider the following two codewords a and b, assuming elements from the binary field:\n\na=(1 0 0 1 1)\n\nb=(1 0 0 0 1)\n\nThe codeword a has a Hamming weight of 3, the codeword b has a Hamming weight of 2, and the Hamming distance between codewords a and b is 1, since codewords a and b differ only in the fourth element. Linear block codes are often designated by a three-element tuple [n, k, d], where n is the codeword length, k is the message length, or, equivalently, the base-2 logarithm of the number of codewords, and d is the minimum Hamming distance between different codewords, equal to the minimal-Hamming-weight, non-zero codeword in the code.\n","The encoding of data for transmission, storage, and retrieval, and subsequent decoding of the encoded data, can be notationally described as follows, when no errors arise during the transmission, storage, and retrieval of the data:\n\n\u03bc\u2192c(s)\u2192c(r)\u2192\u03bc\n\nwhere c(s) is the encoded message prior to transmission, and c(r) is the initially retrieved or received, message. Thus, an initial message \u03bc is encoded to produce encoded message c(s) which is then transmitted, stored, or transmitted and stored, and is then subsequently retrieved or received as initially received message c(r). When not corrupted, the initially received message c(r) is then decoded to produce the original message \u03bc. As indicated above, when no errors arise, the originally encoded message c(s) is equal to the initially received message c(r), and the initially received message c(r) is straightforwardly decoded, without error correction, to the original message \u03bc.\n","When errors arise during the transmission, storage, or retrieval of an encoded message, message encoding and decoding can be expressed as follows:\n\n\u03bc()\u2192()\u2192()\u2192\u03bc()\n\nThus, as stated above, the final message \u03bcmay or may not be equal to the initial message \u03bc(s), depending on the fidelity of the error detection and error correction techniques employed to encode the original message \u03bc(s) and decode or reconstruct the initially received message c(r) to produce the final received message \u03bc(r). Error detection is the process of determining that:\n\n()\u2260()\n\nwhile error correction is a process that reconstructs the initial, encoded message from a corrupted initially received message:\n\n()\u2192()\n","The encoding process is a process by which messages, symbolized as \u03bc, are transformed into encoded messages c. Alternatively, a message \u03bc can be considered to be a word comprising an ordered set of symbols from the alphabet consisting of elements of F, and the encoded messages c can be considered to be a codeword also comprising an ordered set of symbols from the alphabet of elements of F. A word \u03bc can be any ordered combination of k symbols selected from the elements of F, while a codeword c is defined as an ordered sequence of n symbols selected from elements of F via the encoding process:\n\n{c:\u03bc\u2192c}\n","Linear block encoding techniques encode words of length k by considering the word \u03bc to be a vector in a k-dimensional vector space, and multiplying the vector \u03bc by a generator matrix, as follows:\n\n\n\nNotationally expanding the symbols in the above equation produces either of the following alternative expressions:\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"maths":[{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"c","mn":"0"},{"mi":"c","mn":"1"},{"mi":"c","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}],"mo":[",",",","\u2062",","],"mi":"\u2026","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"0"},{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"1"},{"mi":"\u03bc","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}],"mo":[",",",","\u2062",","],"mi":"\u2026","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"msub":{"mi":"g","mn":"00"}},{"msub":{"mi":"g","mn":"01"}},{"msub":{"mi":"g","mn":"02"}},{"mi":"\u2026"},{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mn":"0","mo":",","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mi":"\u22ee"},{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mi":"\u22f1"},{"mi":"\u22ee"}]},{"mtd":[{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"-","mn":"1"},"mo":",","mn":"0"}}},{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"-","mn":"1"},"mo":",","mn":"1"}}},{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"-","mn":"1"},"mo":",","mn":"2"}}},{"mi":"\u2026"},{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"k","mo":"-","mn":"1"},{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}],"mo":","}}}]}]}}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":"="}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-2","num":"00001.2"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"1.1em","height":"1.1ex"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"c","mn":"0"},{"mi":"c","mn":"1"},{"mi":"c","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}],"mo":[",",",","\u2062",","],"mi":"\u2026","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"0"},{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"1"},{"mi":"\u03bc","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}],"mo":[",",",","\u2062",","],"mi":"\u2026","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"msub":{"mi":"g","mn":"0"}}},{"mtd":{"msub":{"mi":"g","mn":"1"}}},{"mtd":{"mo":"\u00b7"}},{"mtd":{"mo":"\u00b7"}},{"mtd":{"mo":"\u00b7"}},{"mtd":{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}}]}}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":"="}}}}],"br":{},"sub":["i","i,0","i,1","i,2

In other words, one embodiment of the present invention involves applying error-control coding techniques to addresses within an address space of size 2to generate interconnection mappings between address signal lines and up to 2signal lines addressed by the 2addresses.","Other types of codes are employed to increase the Hamming distance between codewords in various applications. Many of these alternative codes do not have the convenient properties of linear block codes, including easy generation using generator matrices, and the transparent, pass-through feature of linear block codes allowing for the encoded value to be directly read from the code word. For linear block codes, a plain-text message transfers directly to a codeword containing, in addition, parity-check symbols or bits. In other types of codes, the plain-text message is not directly readable in a corresponding codeword. In both cases, codewords contain a greater number of symbols or bits than absolutely needed to enumerate all valid messages to be encoded. In the case of linear block codes, the additional symbols or bits are parity-check symbols or bits that supplement the plain-text symbols or bits, while in the other types of codes, valid messages are distributed throughout a vector space of dimension equal to the codeword size. It should be noted that, in the following descriptions of the present invention, the term \u201csupplemental address lines\u201d refers to either parity-check address signal lines, analogous to parity-check symbols or bits in linear block codes, or to the greater-number-than-absolutely-needed address signal lines, analogous to the greater-number-than-needed symbols or bits in these other types of codes.

The greater the value of A, the greater the expected minimum Hamming distance between the codewords.

In a random linear code, the generator matrix is randomly generated, under linearity constraints, rather than generated as the combination of a parity-check matrix generated from linear sums of information elements that represent parity-check sums, and an identity matrix. A random linear block code is generally not systematic, but linear.","In general, codes that may be employed in the methods and systems of the present invention may be systematic and linear, systematic and non-linear, non-systematic and linear, or non-systematic and non-linear.

If C is linear, and u is non-zero, then C\u2032 is non-linear, technically, an affine space. Certain embodiments, discussed below, employ systematic non-linear codes (see, for example, ), while others employ systematic linear block codes (see, for example, ). The random codes are generally neither systematic nor linear. Although linear block codes have properties that are attractive in the applications to be discussed below, linear codes, systematic codes, and non-linear, non-systematic codes may also be employed in various embodiments of the present invention.","In the current subsection, a combined nanoscale\/microscale electronic memory device is discussed.

In the described embodiment, single nanowires are uniquely addressed by addresses transmitted to intersecting microscale address signal lines. In other circuits, subsets of nanowires may be addressed, rather than single nanowires, by a single address.

For example, in one configuration, the upper three address signal lines  of the set of address signal lines  may specify one of seven horizontal rows - of nanowire-crossbar subarrays, and the upper three address signal lines  of the set of address signal lines  may specify one of six vertical columns - of nanowire crossbar memory-element subarrays.

Note that, in general, a larger number of input address signal lines would be employed to address a larger number of columns and rows of nanowire-crossbar memory-element subarrays than shown in , as well as a larger number of nanoscale-memory-element rows and columns within each nanowire-crossbar memory-element subarray.

The address signal lines output by an encoder pass through all of the nanowire-crossbar memory-element subarrays within the column or row accessed via the encoder. For example, the five coded address signal lines  output by the encoder  pass through nanowire-crossbar memory-element subarrays -.

Note that the occupied, or valid addresses, are arranged spatially as the vertices of a tetrahedron, and each valid address is separated from any other valid address by at least two edges. Thus, two address-bit conversions are required to produce a different, valid address from any given address, as indicated by the two dotted arrows  and  in . The concepts illustrated geometrically in  can be generalized to a sparsely occupied address space of any size with addresses arranged so that a transformation of more than one bit is needed to transform one valid address to another.","Graphical representations similar to those shown in  are commonly employed to represent the distances between codewords in linear block codes used for error-control coding. Linear block codes are discussed above in the subsection on error-control coding. Although error-control coding is employed for real-time transmission of data through imperfect communications media, and for storage and recovery of data from error-prone mass storage devices, the similarity between the problem spaces arising in ameliorating defective interconnections between nanoelectronic and microelectronic circuits and in data transmission and data storage inspired the rigorous approach of the present invention to designing redundant, parity-check address signal lines, in addition to direct address signal lines. These redundant signal lines complement the direct address signal lines, increasing the robustness of nanoscale interconnection interfaces in the manner that the single additional parity-check complementary signal-line pair, first illustrated in , markedly increased the defect tolerance of the nanoscale interconnection interface, shown in , with respect to the interconnection interface shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":["2502","2504","2506","2508","2502"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0114"},"figref":["FIGS. 26A-B","FIG. 26A"],"sub":["1","7 ","1","7 ","1","7 ","1","1","1","7 ","1","2","3","5","6"],"b":["2602","2604","2602","2600","2606","2610","2602","2612","2600","2614","2616","2616","2618","2614","2610","2616","2620","2622","2610"]},"The demultiplexer, or nanoscale interconnection interface, can also be easily configured using the generator matrix  used for designing the encoder.  illustrates derivation of a demultiplexer corresponding to the encoding circuit derived in . A matrix A  with 7 columns and 128 rows that includes each possible input address can be multiplied by the generator matrix G , with 12 columns and 7 rows, to produce a matrix D  of codewords with 12 columns and 128 rows. Each codeword, or row, of the matrix D corresponds to a coded address that designates a particular nanowire within a crossbar, access to the nanowires of which is provided by the demultiplexer. Thus, each row in the matrix D corresponds to a nanowire of the accessed nanowire crossbar, and column in the matrix D corresponds to an address signal line output from an encoder. For example, the first two rows of the matrix D correspond to crossbar nanowires  and , the first seven columns of matrix D correspond to the seven coded address signal lines (see also  in ) corresponding to the input address signal lines to the encoder ( in ), and the final 5 columns of matrix D correspond to the five coded address signal lines - (see also ) output by the encoder. If an element of a codeword in a row of matrix D has the value \u201c1,\u201d then the nanowire corresponding to the codeword is interconnected to the address signal line corresponding to the column of matrix D in which the element occurs. In other words, the \u201c1\u201d values in matrix D correspond to the pattern of interconnections between coded address signal lines and nanowires, while \u201c0\u201d values correspond to the pattern of overlapping, but not interconnected nanowires and address signal lines. In many embodiments, each address signal line shown in  is implemented as a complementary pair, and so the \u201c1\u201d values in matrix D correspond to the pattern of interconnections between non-inverted address signal lines of complementary address-signal-line pairs, while the \u201c0\u201d values in matrix D correspond to the pattern of interconnections between the inverted, or complementary, address signal lines of the complementary address-signal-line pairs.

linear block codes provide conveniences in the above application, combinatoric, random, and other types of codes, including linear codes, systematic codes, linear, systematic codes, and non-linear, non-systematic codes may also be employed in order to produce increased fault-tolerance, increased defect-tolerance, and increased ON and OFF state voltage or current separation. Techniques fabricating randomly interconnected address signal lines and addressed nanowires have been disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,256,767. Using these techniques to interconnect a larger number of coded-address signal lines than the number of input address signal lines, where the voltage or current states of the supplemental address signal lines are derived by Boolean logic from the input address signal lines, produces an address space corresponding to a random, fixed length code, with very good expected minimum Hamming distances between addresses. However, a table-driven encoder needs to be used in order to encode input addresses into the coded address space. Encoders somewhat more complex than those used for the above-described linear-block-code-determined address spaces can be used to encode input addresses into coded addresses corresponding to a combinatoric code. As discussed above, combinatoric codes also provide minimum Hamming distances of at least 2, and even better average Hamming distances between codewords, and therefore may provide a reasonably high degree of fault tolerance and ON\/OFF state voltage or current separation.","As discussed above, the mathematical techniques employed for linear block encoding and decoding can be used for constructing encoders and demultiplexers for interfacing microelectronic address signal lines to nanoelectronic circuits. However, there are many different possible linear block codes, having a variety of different ratios of supplemental (e.g. parity-check) symbols to information symbols. A designer of nanoscale interconnection interfaces needs to therefore consider various tradeoffs that arise when the number of supplemental address signal lines is increased to provide greater and greater levels of fault tolerance. On one hand, increasing the supplemental address signal lines increases the ability to uniquely address nanowires in the presence of nanowire-to-address-signal-line connection defects. However, increasing the number of supplemental address signal lines increases the cost of manufacture and increases the complexity, size, and cost of the encoders. Therefore, a designer or manufacturer of devices that include both nanoelectronic circuits and microelectronic circuits needs to select linear block codes, or other specification means, appropriate for the expected or observed connection defect probability in the devices, balancing the cost of supplemental address signal lines with the degree of increased fault-tolerance and defect tolerance obtained by adding the supplemental address signal lines.","One way to consider and quantify the costs and advantages associated with adding supplemental address signal lines is to determine a yield for the overall electronic circuit defined as the number of addressable memory bits per unit of chip area. The microelectronic circuits, at least in initial designs, make up the greatest part of a mixed nanoscale and microscale electronic circuit.

Modifications within the spirit of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, in addition to linear-block codes, many other types of error-control encoding techniques may be used to design resistor-logic nanoscale and microscale electronic devices, such as the demultiplexer embodiments described above. The nanoscale interconnection interfaces described above are suitable for composite nanoscale and microscale electronic devices, including demultiplexers, but are generally applicable to many different interfaces between microscale and nanoscale electronic circuitry, as well as in purely nanoscale devices. Additionally, the techniques of the present invention may be applied not only to two-dimensional memories and circuits, but also to three-dimensional and higher dimensional circuits and memories. In the above discussion, several metrics, including an efficiency metric R, a splay metric S, and an overall figure of merit FOM, but many other metrics can be devised and used to quantify desirable qualities of a demultiplexer, or other addressing circuit, designed to have an encoding-based mapping between k output lines and n-bit addresses, where logn>k. As discussed above, those qualities include broad separation between addresses, but narrow distributions of address separations for the k addresses, and as few supplemental address lines as possible to achieve a desired robustness and voltage-margin compression. Many different embodiments for searching for desirable encodings for addresses can be implemented, in addition to the particular searching embodiment discussed above with reference to . These embodiments may be implemented in many different languages, using many different control structures, modular organizations, variable names, and other such programming parameters.","The foregoing description, for purposes of explanation, used specific nomenclature to provide a thorough understanding of the invention.
