title: Connector-less high speed underwater data interface
abstract: An interface assures high-speed transmission of optical data between submerged vessels. First and second vessels have pressure hulls and have a first plate transparent to optical data on the pressure hull of the first vessel and a second plate transparent to optical data on the pressure hull of the second vessel. A first optical transceiver in the first vessel is adjacent to the first transparent plate, and a second optical transceiver in the second vessel is adjacent to the second transparent plate. A layer of water between the first plate and the second plate is optically transparent to optical data to allow the first optical transceiver and the second optical transceiver to transmit and receive optical data through the first transparent plate, the water layer, and the second transparent plate.

More particularly, this invention is to an interface to optically pass data underwater without using a separate connector or conduit for data that penetrates a pressure hull.","The current methods of transferring data between submersibles, submerged sensors\/transponders of data, and other underwater packages usually rely on cables or connectors that physically penetrate the pressure hull. Typically, undersea vessels have pressure hulls that are strongly built to bear the crushing ambient pressures of deep water; however, the contemporary electrical or optical couplers tend to compromise the structural integrities of the submerged platforms where they penetrate the pressure hulls. Consequently, the capabilities and effectiveness of pressure hulls are limited as a consequence of the need to transfer data. Because of this limitation, some manned or unmanned submersibles must restrict their activities to shallower depths where meaningful data may not be collected as easily, and the risk of detection and more effective countermeasures may be greater.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for an underwater data interface permitting high-speed optical transfer of data between submerged vessels without compromising structural integrity.","An object of the invention is to provide a high-speed optical data interface for use between submerged vessels.","Another object of the invention is to provide a high-speed optical data interface for use underwater that does not compromise the structural integrity of pressure hulls.","Another object of the invention is to provide a high-speed optical data interface transmitting through pressure vessels transparent to the data or optically transparent apertures.","Another object of the invention is to provide a high-speed interface transmitting data at high speed through a first optically clear aperture in one submerged vessel, a layer of ambient water, and a second optically clear aperture in another submerged vessel.","Another object of the invention is to provide a high-speed interface transmitting optical data at high speed through a thin layer of water between a first optical transceiver inside a first submerged hull optically transparent to the data and a second optical transceiver inside a second submerged hull optically transparent to the data.","Another object of the invention is to provide protrusions nestling in mating cavities on first and second optically clear plates to optically align the plates and assure optical transmission of optical data that is not refracted or otherwise distorted appreciably.","Another object is to provide a connector-less data interface requiring no cables, no special fixtures in place of connectors and no pressure hull penetrations to allow two underwater devices to exchange digital data at high speed.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is to an interface for high-speed transmission of optical data between first and second submerged vessels. A first plate is transparent to optical data on the first vessel and a second plate is transparent to optical data on the second vessel. A first optical transceiver in the first vessel is adjacent to the first transparent plate, and a second optical transceiver in the second vessel is adjacent to the second transparent plate. A layer of water between the first plate and the second plate is optically transparent to optical data to allow the first optical transceiver and the second optical transceiver to transmit and receive optical data through the first transparent plate, the water layer, and the second transparent plates. The first transparent plate is an integral part of the pressure hull of the first vessel to create watertight integrity and a conduit of optical data, and the second transparent plate is an integral part of the pressure hull of the second vessel to create watertight integrity and a conduit of optical data.","Referring to , an underwater data interface  of the invention is used to transmit and receive optical data between pressure vessels  and  submerged in water  without drawing attention to the process of transferring data. Pressure vessels ,  can be any of many different submersibles, submerged data gathering vessels or transponders of data that can be deployed for unattended, attended, autonomous, or manned operation.

Pressure hulls ,  can be made in cylindrical or spherical shapes for strength and can be made thicker and have internal bulkheads and bracing (not shown) to increase resistance to ambient pressures.","Underwater data interface  can transmit the information of electronic data signals (shown as arrow ) from pressure vessel  to pressure vessel  or, correspondingly, the information of electronic data signals (shown as arrow ) from pressure vessel  to pressure vessel , or a combination of bidirectional transfers of the information of data signals , . Data signals  can come from a computer based electronics module  inside pressure vessel , and data signals  can come from a computer based electronics module  in pressure vessel . Electronics modules ,  can include appropriate sources for data signals , , such as sensors of ambient phenomena, voice communications, relayed data, etc. Components for memory, storage, multiplexing, time compression, and other useful well known circuitry expedients can be included in electronics modules ,  to handle, process, and transfer data signals , .","Underwater data interface  has curved optical plate members  and  that are made of a strong material transparent to optical data signals. Typical of such materials are some types of glass, clear polycarbonate, acrylic, or other sophisticated high-strength, rigid, plastic-like fabrication materials. Curved, or arc-shaped optical plate members  and  can be formed, or molded as arc-shaped sectors  and  of hulls  and  of vessels  and  that fit into correspondingly-shaped tapered openings  and  that extend coextensively in hulls  and . The arc-shaped sectors ,  of plate members ,  coextensively fitting into tapered openings ,  in hulls ,  provide strong joints that resist ambient pressures. Appropriate adhesives  and  and\/or O-rings  and  can be included between arc-shaped sectors ,  and tapered openings ,  to secure and seal these junctures. Arc-shaped sectors ,  serve as vital, integral parts of hulls ,  that create watertight integrity of pressure vessels , . Arc-shaped sectors ,  additionally function as conduits for optical data as described below.","Arc-shaped sectors ,  of plate members ,  have protrusions ,  facing mating, correspondingly disposed cavities ,  molded inwardly from and along their peripheries. Only one protrusion  and one cavity  for sector  and one protrusion  and one cavity  for sector  are shown, it being understood that many projections and cavities can be molded along the peripheries of arc-shaped sectors , . Protrusions ,  nestle, or mate into cavities  when arc-shaped sectors ,  are brought together to optically align and separate arc-shaped sectors ,  and create layer  of water  in between.

Thin layer  transmits optical data between pressure vessels , . Water  of layer  fills any scratches that may be present on exposed surfaces of optical plates ,  and prevents them from causing unwanted diffraction of the light of the optical data signals.
