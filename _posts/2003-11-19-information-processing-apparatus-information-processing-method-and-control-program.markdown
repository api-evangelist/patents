Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus, an information processing method, a control program, and a storage medium.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventionally, information processing apparatuses are known for managing the usage of image processing apparatuses, such as printers, scanners, copiers, or multifunction printers (MFP) having the integrated functions of printers, scanners and copiers.","However, with the known image processing apparatuses described above, a manager must register information in advance concerning users to be managed, thus requiring a high load for operation.","When accounts have been manually or automatically set for users, a print limit value for every user, which is an example of user information, must be appropriately set. Hence, in known systems, limitations can be imposed on printing only after the manager sets an upper limit or the like, which is undesirable for security.","Furthermore, when system user information registered in a system or system group information is managed separately from information concerning an image-processing-apparatus user or an image-processing-apparatus user group, if a user or group that has newly joined a network has performed printing, there is no method for recognizing the image-processing-apparatus user or that the image-processing-apparatus user has joined the network before the image-processing-apparatus user information has been registered in a job account system.","It is a feature of the present invention to relieve the burden of registering user information in an image processing apparatus.","It is another feature of the present invention to automatically set the print limit value for a registered user in order to improve the security level of a printing system.","The present invention is embodied by the following means in order to achieve at least one of the above features.","The present invention provides, in its first aspect, an information processing apparatus for managing the usage of an image processing apparatus. The information processing apparatus includes a managing unit for managing log information that indicates the usage of the image processing apparatus; a registering unit for registering image-processing-apparatus user information concerning an image-processing-apparatus user in the log information managed by the managing unit; a first acquiring unit for acquiring a limit value of an amount used that is input in response to the registration of the image-processing-apparatus user information by the registering unit; and a setting unit for automatically setting the limit value acquired by the first acquiring unit as a limit value of a usage fee for the image-processing-apparatus user. The present invention also provides a system including the information processing apparatus, a method that can be applied to the system and the information processing apparatus, and a control program.","According to one aspect of the embodiments, it is possible to relieve the burden of registering user information in an image processing apparatus.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, it is possible to automatically set the print limit value for a registered user in order to improve the security level of a printing system.","Further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the attached drawings. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the relative arrangement of components, display screens, and so on described in the embodiments, unless otherwise specified.","An embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.","<Job Account System>",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1010","1020","1030"]},"The job account system also includes a printer with a log-keeping function  and a printer without the log-keeping function . The printers  and  are examples of an image processing apparatus. The job account system further includes a multifunction printer (MFP)  that has a printer function, a copier function, a scanner function, and the log-keeping function. Although a log kept in the printer  and the MFP  strictly differs from job information and is obtained by analyzing the job information to extract the necessary information for usage management, the concept of \u201cjob information\u201d in the following description includes log information kept in these image processing apparatuses.","The job-account client computers  and , the job-account server computer , the printers  and , and the MFP  can communicate with each other via a network.","In the job-account client computer , when an application  invokes a graphics device interface (GDI) , the GDI  generates printing data in response to the instructions from the application  and transmits the printing data to a spooler . A job-account-client application  monitors the invocation of the GDI  by the application  and stores the job information concerning the printing data generated by the GDI . The job information includes the number of prints and the number of pages, the print size, the kind of sheet used, information concerning the user who has issued a print request (user information), and information concerning color printing (color information).","The spooler  communicates with the printer , the printer , or the MFP , which are examples of the image processing apparatus, via the network and transmits the printing data when the image processing apparatus is in a ready state. When the job-account client computer  serves as a print server, the printing data is transmitted from the GDI  to a spooler .","The job-account-client application  regularly transmits the stored job information to a job-account-server application .","In the job-account client computer , an application , a GDI , and the spooler  function in the same manner as the application , the GDI , and the spooler , respectively.","A job-account-client application  regularly monitors the spooler . When a print job is spooled in the spooler , the job-account-client application  acquires information concerning the print job with an application programming interface (API). Specifically, the job-account-client application  acquires the number of output sheets and\/or the number of pages in the print job. The job-account-client application  then transmits the stored job information to the job-account-server application .","If an operating system (OS) has a function for transmitting a change of state in the spooler  to another application, the job-account-client application  may not regularly monitor the spooler . The OS should inform the job-account-client application  that the print job has been spooled in the spooler .","In the job-account server computer , the job-account-server application  includes a user-information management module , an apparatus-information management module , a job-information management module , and a usage input-output module ","The user-information management module stores the user information in a user information database (not shown) in the job-account server computer  and manages the stored user information. The user information includes the name of a user who uses an image processing apparatus, a computer login name (the name input by the user for logging in a computer), a network login name (the name input by the user for logging in a network system), and a user ID or card information for using an apparatus. The user information is, for example, information identifying a user who uses an image processing apparatus and an upper limit for the user to use an apparatus.","According to the embodiment, there are three kinds of user registration. First, a user is registered at a system group, called a domain, which is controlled by the OS of an external server (not shown). The user registered at the domain (system user) can use network devices belonging to the domain within the scope of his\/her authority. This is the first registration. The first registration information can be managed with a domain management system or a directory management system, such as a Microsoft OS. The first registration information may be managed by either a server on a network or an external management apparatus (external information processing apparatus).","However, generally, only access to an apparatus is limited in a domain. A print limit value indicating which network user (system user) can be allowed to print how many pages with which apparatus cannot be imposed on the user.","The authority to use resources in a device, such as the number of printable pages, is separately managed in a job-account server computer. Hence, image-processing-apparatus user information concerning a job account user, who is different from the system user registered in the external server, must be separately registered by an IT manager in the job-account server computer. This is the second registration.","The job-account server computer regularly acquires a log from a printer. For example, even a user who is not registered in the job-account server computer can perform printing with the printer, unless explicitly prohibited. In such a case, the job-account server computer can extract the ID of the unregistered user from the log to automatically and provisionally register the extracted ID in a job account server system. This is the third registration.","The user information concerning the provisionally registered user is input by the manager into a dialog box shown in  or  to officially register the user. At this time, the user is authenticated as a registered user in the second meaning described above. The provisionally registered user may be called an unregistered user (in the second meaning) in the sense that the manager has not explicitly registered the user in the job-account server computer.","The user-information management module displays the stored user information and includes a user displaying program used by the manager for setting the user information. The user-information management module also includes an automatic registration program for confirming, for every job, whether the user who has issued the job is stored in the user information and for registering the user if he\/she is not stored in the user information, based on a job history that is compiled by the job-information management module . The user-information management module further includes an upper-limit initial-value displaying program for displaying the initial value of an upper limit for the user to use an apparatus. The upper-limit initial-value displaying program is used by the manager for setting the initial value of an upper limit for the user.","The automatic registration includes a function for acquiring detailed information or part of the detailed information of the user who has issued the corresponding job via a network or from among other database information upon confirmation of the user information that is acquired based on the job history, and for registering the user information including the acquired detailed information. The automatic registration also includes a function for setting the set initial value of the upper limit as an upper limit for the corresponding user to use the apparatus.","The detailed information described above may be the user name that is stored in a network server or may be user information, such as a mail address, which is in an external user database.","In the user displaying program, the user is registered by the manager by user information that is to be displayed. The user displaying program displays the detailed user information or the upper limit for using the apparatus that is set and the detailed user information or the upper limit for using the apparatus that is only automatically registered by the automatic registration program in different manners in order for the manager to distinguish them. Since the user displaying program has a function for simply inputting the detailed user information or the upper limit for using the apparatus for the displayed user, the manager can instantly input the detailed information concerning the user who is automatically registered with the automatic registration program and for whom the detailed user information or the upper limit for using the apparatus has not been set.","Specifically, referring to , a user for whom detailed information is set and a user for whom the detailed information is not set are illustrated with different icons according to this embodiment.  is a screen displayed in a display of the job-account server computer. The registration user in the second meaning is distinguished from the registration user in the third meaning as illustrated in .","A user icon  represents a user for whom detailed information is formally registered. A user icon  with a minus icon represents a provisionally registered user for whom detailed information is not registered. Referring to , a user folder includes groups A and B. The group B includes users aaa and bbb.","When any of the user icons in  is clicked, a user-information registration dialog box as shown in  is displayed, where a user ID, a user name, an e-mail address, a security level, and so on can be set. Depressing a button for setting an upper limit for usage (not shown) displays an upper-limit setting dialog box in , where an upper limit for the user can be set.","The apparatus-information management module checks whether the image processing apparatus connected to the network has the log-keeping function, and stores the information concerning the apparatus that has the log-keeping function and other apparatuses in an apparatus information database (not shown) in the job-account server computer  and manages the stored information. The apparatus information includes the print speed, the color information, and the network address of the image processing apparatus.","The job-information management module receives the job information from the job-account-client applications  and  and stores the received job information in a job-history database. The job-information management module requests the log information from the image processing apparatus having the log-keeping function (for example, the printer ) and acquires the log information through the usage input-output module . This processing may be regularly performed or may be performed when notifying the usage input-output module that the storage capacity in a log information storage unit (not shown) in the image processing apparatus runs short.","The usage input-output module outputs a usage report (a report indicating which user executes how many jobs) to the printer, which is an image processing apparatus, or to a display unit (not shown) in the job-account server computer . Accordingly, the manager can acquire the usage of the image processing apparatus output from the usage input-output module . The usage input-output module outputs a variety of usage based on the user information, the apparatus information, and print history information that are stored in a memory. The manager specifies an output form for the usage input-output module . The output data concerning the usage may be transmitted to the job-account client computer  or  for displaying the usage in a display (not shown) in the job-account client computer  or .","The usage output includes the amount used for every user (the number of sheets or the amount of toner used for the output) and the time period during which the image processing apparatus is used. The usage is output by operation mode (function), such as color printing or two-sided printing, of the image processing apparatus. Or, the usage is output by the size or kind of sheets used.","Since the usage fee for the image processing apparatus is included in the apparatus information, the amount of the usage fee is output for every image processing apparatus or for every user. Furthermore, since the usage fee is set by the operation mode, the sheet size, and the kind of sheet, the amount of the usage fee is output based on which user prints out how many pages with which sheet in which operation mode and with which image processing apparatus.","The manager can set limit conditions for usage by function, by user, by user department, and by used apparatus with the user-information management module and the apparatus-information management module by executing a limit-condition setting program (not shown) included in the job-account-server application . The limit conditions that can be set include items such as the usage fee, the number of pages, and the number of sheets. Such limit conditions are stored in the memory as part of the user information.","The job-information management module monitors the log of the image processing apparatus to compare the monitored log with the limit conditions for usage set by the manager. When the usage of a user reaches the limit conditions (for example, when execution of the received job information causes the number of sheets to be printed to exceed an upper limit), the use of the job-account client computer  or the image processing apparatus by the corresponding user is refused.","<Control Structure of Computer>",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1010","1020","1030","201"]},"A read-only memory (ROM)  serves as a storage area where information such as a system invocation program is stored. A random access memory (RAM)  is a data storage area having no limit for use. An OS, an application program, a device driver (printer driver), a communication control program, and so on that are stored in the RAM  are executed by the CPU .","A keyboard controller (KBC)  receives input data from a keyboard attached to the computer and transmits the received data to the CPU .

Furthermore, when an IT manager is assigned for every department, the IT manager in each department can recognize unregistered users in the job account system of the department which he\/she is in charge of only by checking the display as shown in . As in the above embodiment, for example, information that could not be acquired in Step S, among the user information of the unregistered users, can be modified or input with the screen for editing user information in  or .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 12"]},"An icon  illustrates a group A. An icon  illustrates a job account user bbb who belongs to the group A. An icon  illustrates a job account user aaa who belongs to the group A. A minus icon appended to the icon  indicates an unregistered user.","An icon  illustrates a group B. Icons  and  illustrate job account users xxx and yyy, respectively, who belong to the group B.","An icon  illustrates a group for users whose departments are unknown, including users whose groups have not been registered in the job account system and users whose groups are set in neither the network system nor the job account system. An icon  illustrates a user zzz whose department is unknown. If another new user www whose department is unknown is registered, an icon (not shown) corresponding to the user www is displayed below the icon . Since the user is not registered in the job account system, the minus icon is appended to the icon illustrating the user www. Although the users whose departments are unknown are collectively displayed, the users whose groups have not been registered in the job account system may be distinguished from the users whose groups are registered in neither the network system nor the job account system for display (not shown).","The job-account-server application  controls the process for identifying a newly registered user as a user who belongs to a group that is a management target for the print history information, which is an example of the log information, and as a new user for the group to display the identified user in the display.","When the job-account-server application  determines that the group that is the management target for the print history information, namely, the group that is the domain acquired in advance from the print history information by the job-account-server application  does not coincide with the system group to which the system user who has been registered in the network system belongs, the job-account-server application  controls the process for displaying the job account user so as to be identified as a job account user whose group is unknown. The display control processes described above may be performed in one module in the job-account-server application  or in two separate modules therein.","The embodiments of the present invention described above may be applied to a system including a plurality of apparatuses (for example, a host computer, an interface device, a reader, a printer, and so on) or to an apparatus (for example, a copier, a facsimile machine, or the like) including one unit.","The job-account-server application , which is included in the job-account server computer  that manages the usage of the image processing apparatus, such as the printer , the MFP , or a scanner (not shown), and which is an example of management means for managing the print history information that indicates the usage of, for example, the printer , registers a printer user ID identifying the user who is the management target for print history information managed by the job-account server computer . The job-account-server application  acquires the limit value of an amount used that has been stored in advance in response to the registration of the job account ID and automatically sets the acquired limit value as the limit value of the number of prints for the printer user. Furthermore, the job-account-server application  acquires system user information from an external server that manages the system users registered in the network system. The job-account-server application  includes determination means for determining whether the system user ID extracted from the acquired system user information coincides with the job account user ID extracted from the log information (print history and output history) that is acquired from the printer and managed by the job-account server computer . If the job-account-server application  determines that the system user ID coincides with the job account user ID, the job-account-server application  automatically sets the limit value acquired by the job-account server computer  as the limit value of the number of prints for the job account user ID.","If the job-account-server application  determines that the extracted system user ID coincides with the job account user ID, the job-account-server application  automatically sets the limit value of the number of prints as the limit value of a usage fee for the job account user. If the job-account-server application  determines that the extracted system user ID does not coincide with the job account user ID, the job-account-server application  sets the job-account server computer  not to allow the user corresponding to the user name acquired from the print history information to use the image processing apparatus. The limit value of the usage fee for a printer or an MFP includes the limited number of prints (the limited number of outputs) that can be set for both the color printing and the monochrome printing. The limit value of the usage fee for a scanner includes the number of times when scanning is performed (the limited number of read documents), or the limit value or upper limit of the number of times when image processing is performed with an image processing program, which is available after the reading by using the scanner, (for example, the number of invocations of the image processing program).","Although only a case in which printing with the image processing apparatus such as the printer, the copier, or the MFP is limited is described in the above embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this case. The present invention can also be applied to a case in which the usage limit is set or the usage fee is charged for the image processing apparatus such as the scanner. Namely, the limited number of sheets scanned with the scanner can be set. An information processing server that can also set processing performed when scanning exceeding the limited number of scanned sheets is required (for example, scanning prohibiting processing or warning processing) is within the scope of the present invention.","The present invention has three aspects. One aspect is to improve the security level of a printing system. Another aspect is to automatically reflect the registration information in the first meaning, that is, the system user information registered in a network system such as a domain, on the user information registered in the job account system in the second meaning and to set the limit value of printing by department. Still another aspect is to distinguishably display such registration states in a display with icons. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments and the present invention is embodied for achieving at least one of the aspects. Embodiments that cannot concurrently achieve all the above aspects are, of course, within the scope of the present invention.","While the present invention has been described with reference to what are presently considered to be the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 18"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
