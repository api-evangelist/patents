title: Dual-modal-shape bed lounge
abstract: Dual-modal-shaping capability is added as a new feature in bed lounges of the type having a fabric slip-cover enclosing foam padding on a main structure formed from plastic sheet material. User adjustment is provided for back tilt, head-rest tilt and height, arm-rest spacing, and back support location. Modal transition is provided by an internal mechanism that interlinks the two arm-rests via a weighted lock-pin that locks the arm-rests in place for normal use but that can be disengaged by merely inverting the bed lounge so the lock-pin drops out from the linkage gravitationally, thus allowing the arm-rests to be folded out to convert to an overall flat modal-shape that can be conveniently stored, e.g. under a bed or hanging in a closet. For re-deployment, when the bed lounge is manually placed in its normal modal-shape in an upright position, as the arm-rests are moved together to their normal spacing, the weighted lock-pin automatically drops back down into place so as to again lock and retain the bed lounge in its chair-like normal modal-shape.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","KNOWN ART","OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to household bedding accessory furniture and more particularly it relates to a dual-modal-shape bed lounge that can be easily user-converted back and forth between (1) a chair-like normal modal-shape that provides back support to a user seated upright on a flat surface such as bed, and (2) a generally flat modal-shape for convenient storage.","For those who spend periods of time sitting in a bed, or even on a floor or against a wall, it is important to provide proper support to the body to avoid discomfort, fatigue and\/or body deformation. Ordinary cushions and pillows fail to provide necessary support, which requires a chair-like bed lounge typically with at least a back portion with two attached arm-rests, one at each side, and preferably a neck support\/head-rest. To accommodate the needs of different individuals with regard to size, weight, age, etc., the bed lounge is preferably provided with several user adjustment capabilities, e.g. relating to tilt-back, arm-rest spacing, lower back support, neck-rest height and inclination.","Bedding furniture in the field of this invention has been known under such names as \u201cbed bolster\u201d, \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cstudy rest\u201d. Typically such items have been made entirely from foam material so that characteristically they lack support, being overly soft and flexible, and\/or they are inconveniently heavy.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,423,098 to the present inventors disclosed an ergonomic BED LOUNGE\u2122 made with a fabric cover enclosing foam padding over a main structure formed from plastic sheet material to provide the required strength while keeping the weight lighter than all-foam construction. The Bed Lounge featured back inclination adjustment, a built-in adjustable lower back pillow, a doubly adjustable neck pillow and side arm-rests whose forward portions can be adjusted for end separation.","U.S. design patent 427,823 to Robinson shows a BED PILLOW WITH ARM RESTS AND COVER.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,829,830 to Maloney discloses a removable SUPPORT INSERT FOR A HIGH CHAIR directed to positioning and supporting the upper torso of an infant seated in the high chair.","It is a primary object of the present invention to provide further advantages and improvements in bed lounges with regard to convenience of storage, in view of the three dimensional shape of known bed lounges and the fact that these are in use only for a small fraction of the time, and must somehow be stored for the great majority of the time.","It is a further object to provide a bed lounge whose normal three-dimensional modal-shape can be easily changed to a flat generally flat two-dimensional modal shape for convenience and versatility regarding storage, e.g. that can be stored unobtrusively under a bed or hanging in a closet.","It is a still further object that the bed lounge be provided with a locking system that enables the user to easily deploy the three-dimensional normal modal-shape wherein the arm-rests are made to be substantially locked in place generally perpendicular to the back portion, and to easily release the locking system and convert to the flat two-dimensional flat modal shape wherein the arm-rest locking is released so the arm-rests can be folded back to the generally flat modal-shape for purposes of convenient storage.","It is a further object that conversion back and forth between the flat modal-shape and the normal modal-shape be made easy for an ordinary unskilled individual to perform manually without the use of any tools.","The above and further objects and advantages have been realized in the present invention of improvements to the bed lounge: an internal mechanism interlinking the two arm-rests includes a weighted lock-pin that holds the arm-rests in place with the bed lounge set up for use in the normal modal-shape. The arm-rest linkage can be disengaged by merely inverting the bed lounge so that the lock-pin drops out of place from the linkage gravitationally thus unlocking and allowing the arm-rests to folded out to convert to the overall flat shape that can be conveniently stored, e.g. under a bed or hanging in a closet. For re-deployment, when the bed lounge is manually set up to its normal upright position, the weighted lock-pin automatically drops back into place engaging the arm-rest linkage so as to again lock and secure the bed lounge and its arm-rests in its chair-like normal modal-shape for usage.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["12","14"]},"Unlike the previous versions of the bed-lounge which were made to be essentially permanent in the fixed three dimensional normal usage modal-shape shown in , the bed-lounge of the present invention is originally stamped out from a sheet of flat material in one piece: the main body  that includes the three main components, i.e. the back portion A and the two arm-rests  which are each attached by a \u201cliving hinge\u201d at the corner. A pair of arm-rest extension portions A, attached in a swivel manner to arm-rests , typically using brass eyelets, are also made adjustable for end separation by \u201cliving hinge\u201d score lines as shown.","A locking mechanism automatically secures the bed-lounge in the normal usage modal-shape shown, but the locking can be readily released by the user to convert the bed-lounge back to its original flat shape for convenient storage.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 3-6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["14","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["12","16","12","16","16","16","14","14"]},"At the lower left of , a mounting flange of a pivot bracket  is attached by a nylon tie strip A extending through a pair of holes provided in each arm-rest portion B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 2"],"b":["12","20","12","12","12","12","12","22","28","28","12"]},"Indicated at the left hand side in broken lines are two alternative arm-rest positions within the separation adjustment range of the arm-rest extension portion A, enabled by bend-line C.","At the center of sloping panel E, an oval opening H exposes the top end of a cylindrical housing A that contains a gravity operated lock pin.

Lock-pin  traverses a lock-hole configured in each link-strip \u2032 and \u2033 as shown, thus locking them in place and preventing them from moving longitudinally while they serve to hold arm-rest portions B in place as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["12","12","28","28","22","22","24","12","24","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","28","28","24","12","26","28","28","12","10"]},"Lock-pin  is constrained to only vertical travel by containment within cylindrical container A affixed to guide plate .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"],"b":["26","28","28"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 10"],"b":["12","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 13"],"b":["14","14","28","28","24","12"]},"User conversion of the lounge between the two modal-shapes requires no tools.","To convert from the normal modal-shape to the flat storage modal-shape, the bed lounge  () is inverted by the user, causing the lock-pin  to drop down out of the link-strip lock-holes  and \u2033 as shown in , causing an audible sound, thus allowing the link-strips \u2032 and \u2033 to move longitudinally, allowing the two arm-rests  to be swivelled apart to where they become aligned with the back portion A, as shown in . The bed lounge  has thus become converted to its flat storage modal-shape ready to be stored on a horizontal surface, e.g. on a floor under a bed, or hanging vertically, e.g. in a closet.","To convert back from the flat storage modal-shape to the chair-like normal modal-state, the bed lounge is manually set up by the user to its normal upright orientation. The lock-pin  now rests on top of the upper link-strip \u2032 (), allowing the link-strips \u2032 and \u2033 to move longitudinally in opposite directions, constrained between guide-bracket  and bottom panel J as the user moves the arm-rests  toward each other. When the arm-rests  reach their normal location, the lock-holes A and A\u2033 in the link-strips \u2032 and \u2033 will line up with each other and with the lock-pin , which will then drop down through lock-holes A and A\u2033 to the position shown in , with an audible sound, thus securing the bed lounge in the chair-like normal modal-shape as shown in , ready for use. This gravity lock-pin system locks the arm-rests in place instantly, automatically, positively and securely, with no special effort, strength or skill required on the part of user other than merely setting the bed lounge up in place. Thus mode-conversion can be readily performed by anyone including users to whom the bed lounge is particularly direction, i.e. those who may be weak, handicapped or otherwise incapacitated by age, arthritis, or other afflictions, and who, absent the present invention would be over-challenged by a need to use tools in converting the bed lounge between the two modes.","The component parts of the dual-modal-shape mechanism described above in connection with , i.e. pivot brackets , link-strips \u2032 and \u2033, guide plate  and lock pin container A may be made from suitably robust plastic material, e.g. \u215b\u2033 thick Lexon or polystyrene, or from metal, preferably aluminum for light weight. For the internal structure , which includes portions A-F, the recommended material is internally-corrugated sheet plastic such as polypropylene, 0.22\u2033 thick, with interior corrugations running vertically.","The dual-modal-shape principle, which has been directed beneficially as an improvement modification of the bed lounge previously patented by the inventors, can also be practiced beneficially as applied to simplified versions and other variations thereof as well as to practically any similar product in the field of endeavor having a back and a pair of arm-rests. If, additionally, a seat portion is involved, that could also be made and arranged to fold out to a flat plane in a similar manner to obtain the benefits of the dual-modal-shape capability in accordance with the principles of the present invention.","The invention may be embodied and practiced in other specific forms without departing from the spirit and essential characteristics thereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description; and all variations, substitutions and changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more fully understood from the following description taken with the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIGS. 5 and 6","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"],"b":["9","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"],"b":["11","11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 13"],"b":["14","14"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
