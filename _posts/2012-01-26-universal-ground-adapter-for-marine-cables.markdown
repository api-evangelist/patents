In particular, the invention relates to embodiments for low-impedance designs of a cable shield ground adapter (CSGA).","The United States Navy currently employs two technologies to provide electromagnetic (EM) protection from coupling to topside (i.e., above-deck) cables; conduit which provides an overall EM shield to cables placed within the conduit, and shielded cables with CSGAs used as termination connectors. Both technologies are viable but components used are expensive and difficult to maintain. The proposed CSGA embodiments deal almost exclusively with shielded cables and conduits. These are not explicitly described herein with respect to further applications, although the technology could be applied to the conduit shell whether flexible or rigid.","Conventional CSGA designs have been proven to be effective at grounding cable shielding when properly installed, achieving grounding effectiveness measures that exceed 80 decibels (dB). The conventional designs are designed for use with swage tubes, also known as stuffing tubes. Glenair\u00ae Inc. of Glendale, Calif. provides the primary conventional design currently in use. The Glenair\u00ae configuration requires the installer to employ CSGA components designed for specific cable sizes and swage tube sizes. Failure to use the exact tube size leads to performance failure for the system. The Glenair\u00ae CSGA also requires the installer to remove and discard the gland nut typically supplied with the swage tube by the swage tube manufacturer.","Once installed, the system is not easily repaired. Repair of a failed adapter can be accomplished through one of two methods. The first method requires the disconnection of the shielded cable from the system interface connector through cutting or de-soldering, removal and replacement of the failed component, and replacement of the interface connector. The second method requires a CSGA called a \u201cSplit Connector\u201d that represents a device used for in situ replacement of the failed CSGA.","The failed CSGA must be removed from the swage tube, and the split connector is installed in its place. The components from the failed connector are then taped to the upper part of the cable and remain in place for the life of the connector, or until the CSGA assembly is replaced during a refit. The Glenair\u00ae system uses an exterior weather proof boot to provide exterior weather protection, but lacks interior protection against water intrusion.

A 3:02-minute video presentation on \u201cMIL-PRF-24758A Conduit Assembly and EMI Shield Termination Procedure\u201d available at Glenair\u00ae at http:\/\/www.glenair.com\/video\/24758a_full_monty.htm and more generally in a 2:57-minute presentation as \u201cMIL-PRF-24758A Shipboard Conduit Assembly\u201d at http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Abmj0IN_A40 (without audio). Airmar\u00ae Technology in Milford, N.H. also provides an installation guide in http:\/\/www.airmartechnology.com\/uploads\/installguide\/17-423-01.pdf.","Another conventional CSGA design, SkinTop\u00ae, is available from LAPP Group Inc. of Florham Park, N.J. The SkinTop\u00ae design incorporates squared-off contact fingers, which in addition to forming an ohmic contact, also perform a cable centering function. Without the squaring off of the contact, the cable would tend to roll off center. The resultant structural loading imposes the requirement of stiffer materials and shorter finger lengths for the SkinTop\u00ae design. The smallest clamping cable diameter for the conventional SkinTop\u00ae design is 0.118 inch (\u2033) with a maximum variation of cable diameter of approximately 0.512\u2033 for their largest design.","Additionally, the conventional Skintop\u00ae requires the use of a machined cable gland assembly and is therefore not adaptable to variances in the inner diameter of the swage tube. This imposes limits in the design as to the exact size of the swage tube's inner diameter, the units of measure (metric or SAE) and thread type of swage tube. The SkinTop\u00ae design also requires the removal and subsequent disposal of the gland nut supplied with the swage tube by the manufacturer. The basic design of the SkinTop\u00ae system appears more robust than the Glenair\u00ae system. However once installed, the SkinTop\u00ae arrangement is not easily repaired. Repair of a failed adapter requires the disconnection of the shielded cable from the system interface connector through cutting or de-soldering, removal and replacement of the failed component, and replacement of the interface connector. The Skintop\u00ae system uses a gland washer to provide exterior weather protection, and a weather proof boot can be added to provide additional exterior weather protection. Interior protection against water intrusion is not provided.","Conventional electrical ground adapters yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide an electrical conduit ground device for electrically and environmentally shielding an electric cable. The device includes a conduit having a receiving end through which the cable passes axially; an internal seal that inserts into the receiving end; a gland boss that inserts into the receiving end; an external seal that inserts into the boss and extends axially outward from the receiving end; and a grounding assembly disposed between the internal and external seals.","The assembly includes an adapter for providing electrical grounding contact between the cable and the swage tube; a space-retainer for structurally supporting the adapter; and a washer for axially separating the internal and external seals. Various exemplary embodiments provide the adapter for electrically connecting an interior surface of a conduit and an external surface of a cable. The adapter includes an electrically conductive and mechanically flexible sheet having first and second edges that can face each other, the sheet being configured to form an annulus that mechanically contacts the external surface of the cable and a periphery that mechanically contacts the inner surface of the conduit.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Various exemplary embodiments related to the invention were developed for the purposes of providing a Cable Shield Ground Adapter (CSGA) with the following characteristics important for use in marine environments and in particular shipboard environments:","Environmental sealing from both interior and exterior weather environments.","Universal Adaptive electrical grounding contact for all sizes of cable or conduit applicable to the maximum interior dimensions of a swage tube whether metric or SAE.","Universal Adaptive electrical grounding contact for minor variances in the interior diameter of swage (stuffing) tubes due to SAE or metric sizing.","Better areal contact with the cable shield and inner wall of swage tube.","Better physical tolerance from pulling or distortion of cable and conduit.","Simplicity of design.","Simplicity of installation, repair and replacement.","At sea component replacement.","Longer lifetime of grounding components.","Ability to use broad selection of conductive materials.","Reduced waste of component materials of common swage tubes.","Reduced cost of installation and repair.","Three potential designs for CSGAs have been developed with maritime utility and exposure to the marine environment as a design driver. These can be notionally referred to as \u201csnowflake\u201d, \u201croll-o-dex\u201d and \u201clantern\u201d for purposes of description. Each of these embodiments incorporates a unique deformable conductive diaphragm as the principle component with additional ancillary components common to all three designs. These ancillary components provide for stability during deformation and environmental sealing along with strain relief.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130","140","120","150","160","170","120","150","180"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","220","230","240","170","250","160"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","315","315","170","320","330","340","350","352","354","356","360","365"]},"Various exemplary embodiments as described by the proposed designs described as follows overcome all of the design shortcomings of the above listed conventional designs. The exemplary CSGA embodiments are each adaptable to both variances in cable size as well as variances in swage tube diameters using a bidirectional deformable contact design not incorporated in either of the above examples. For example, the \u201csnowflake\u201d diaphragm is designed with peripheral flexible contact fingers along the entire circumference of the diaphragm. This feature is not found in any other known design.","Each of the three embodiments utilize the gland nut  supplied with the swage tube  to lock components in place and therefore thread size issues common to both the above listed alternatives can be completely avoided so as to enable universal use of the proposed adapters. Each embodiment incorporates ancillary components that can be reused during repair and replacement of the grounding diaphragm and should last the life of the platform with only maintenance needed during refit periods. The grounding diaphragm is designed to be easily repaired in situ with removal and replacement of same type diaphragm components as used in initial installations. Additionally, fitted gaskets are provided for both exterior and interior water intrusion protection with the inner gasket serving as a stabilizing base for the deformable diaphragm.","All three embodiments employ standard components that include the stuffing or swage tube , the gland nut  that accompanies the swage tube  from the manufacturer, the exterior environmental seal , the stabilizing washer , the conductive retainer , and the internal seal . The following is a description of each common component followed by a description of the unique components of each design. In particular, conventional arrangements do not incorporate the internal seal .","The swage tube  is a flared section of pipe made of an electrically conductive material such as steel or aluminum that provides for a grounded penetration through a wall or bulkhead. These components are generally circumferentially welded to the bulkhead but can be threaded under certain circumstances. The purpose of this component is to provide an access point through the bulkhead for the transiting cable .","The gland nut  is a component provided by the manufacturer to cap the end of the swage tube . These nuts are typically machined from brass to the proper diameter and exterior screw-thread (example shown in ) to ensure a mechanically tight fit with the swage tube . Most gland nut  types have a port machined into their center to permit a cable  to pass through. The gland nut  provides centering for the cable  immediately entering through the nut , but this is not designed to provide either weather sealing or tension relief.","The exterior environmental seal  is employed by each of the designs, which all utilize a hermetic sealing system which also acts as a centering mechanism (as further described in ) for the cable . The outer diameter of the exterior environmental seal  is slightly larger than the inner diameter of the gland nut .  shows views of the interface assembly. The complete assembly view  shows the sleeve formed by inner annulus of the body  of the external seal  enveloped by the gland nut , and an exemplary generic diaphragm  (resembling the \u201csnowflake\u201d embodiment) disposed within the retainer  and sandwiched between a pair of washers . The gland nut  and the interior seal  are inserted into the swage tube  through the bowl end , and the external seal  extends from within the gland nut . A detail view  shows the primary load path  imposed by tightening of the gland nut  within the swage tube . The conductive diaphragm  represents exemplary components of which the configuration shown constitutes one example design.","A reaction load due to the compression of the external seal  on the inner surface of the gland nut  creates a sealing surface thereby preventing leakage. The annular compression of the external seal  causes the inner diameter of the external seal  to slightly decrease. When there is a cable  in the external seal , the jacket of the cable  compresses by the deformation of the external seal , hermetically sealing the region between the cable jacket and inner annulus of the external seal . The tip  of the external seal  is beveled to enable the seal  to easily slide into the axial aperture of the gland nut . The tip  extends slightly above the gland nut  to provide tension relief to the cable .","The bottom of the seal  is flared to form a continuous surface for the gland nut  to compress. The flared section  of the external seal  is filleted to inhibit stress concentrations so as to obviate tearing from pulling the seated cable . Once the assembly is installed, the flared section  compresses between the gland nut  and the stabilizing washer . The compressed flared section  acts a spring-mass-dampening system to enable the internal structure to be resilient to degradation and fatigue failure, initiated from external vibrations.","At least one stabilizing washer , and preferably a pair of these, is also used by all three concepts. The washers  have the same inner diameter as the uncompressed external environmental seal  and outer diameter as the inner diameter of the swage tube . The stabilizing washer  performs several functions: such as to reduce the pressure placed on the external and internal environmental seals ,  by the retainer . When the gland nut  is tightened to seat the system, the load transmits through the external environmental seal  to the stabilizing washer  through the retainer  back through another stabilizing washer  and divides into the internal environmental seal  and swage tube . The curve arrow  indicates the general load path. The small downward arrows indicate the applied load from tightening the gland nut , and the small upward arrows show the reaction load when the lower seal is pressed inward.","Another function of the stabilizing washer  is to perform cable centering.  shows a plan view  of an exemplary diaphragm, corresponding to the \u201csnowflake\u201d configuration. In particular, the left diaphragm  includes a split  for wrapping around a tube  (corresponding to the cable sheath). The right diaphragm  shows the tube  canted towards the bottom left side.","The centering feature is critical to the proper function of the various designs and is provided via the stabilizing washers , the environmental seals ,  and the gland nut . The stabilizing washer  and retainer  provide a centering load to the cable  enabling the diaphragm  in any of the three proposed designs to deform in a symmetric way. Absent this centering component, the cable  would experience \u201crolling\u201d within the diaphragm structure leading to incomplete or sub-optimal ohmic contact of the diaphragm with the cable shield. This type of rolling is depicted for the \u201csnowflake\u201d diaphragm design (shown for the tube  in  within the opening  in ).","The retainer or conductive spacer  performs three primary functions; it provides for consistent contact pressure between the diaphragm , the stabilizing washer  and the interior of the swage tube  enhancing ohmic response; providing for a minimum component mechanical volume for the diaphragm under deformation providing for optimal structural integrity. The retainer  provides for the shaping and controlled deformation of the diaphragm  during installation to ensure optimal ohmic contact between the diaphragm  and an interior surface  in ) of the swage tube .","The internal environmental seal  will compress when coming in contact with the inner surface of the swage tube . The compression causes a deformation of the internal environmental seal , reducing the inner diameter of the cable opening. A cable  that extends within the opening experiences a compressive load, sealing both the interface between the cable  and the internal seal , and the swage tube  and the external seal .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","510","610","620","630","640","650","630","640","660","610","670","630","640","660","670","170"]},"Due to the torsional flexibility of the adapter , the \u201csnowflake\u201d design can be adapted to a variety of cable sizes. The conventional Skintop\u00ae employs a flexible diaphragm similar in concept to the \u201csnowflake\u201d design. Significant physical differences can be noted between the conventional and exemplary \u201csnowflake\u201d designs are manifest in the function of the diaphragms.","The resultant structural loading for the SkinTop\u00ae design imposes the requirement of stiffer materials and shorter finger lengths, thereby limiting its range of applicable cable sizes, as compared to the \u201csnowflake\u201d embodiment. The smallest clamping diameter for the \u201csnowflake\u201d design is limited only by the resolution of the stamping and is likely to be less than 0.04 inches and maximum variation is limited by the maximum cable size that can be transited by the swage tube . The \u201csnowflake\u201d diaphragm is non-load bearing, this feature being ascribed to different components described in detail below. This enables the \u201csnowflake\u201d to be composed of non-structural materials such as foil laminates and to have finger lengths that extend fully to the center of the diaphragm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","610","710","630","640"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIGS. 8 and 9","b":["800","900","610","340","330","610","330","340","320","310","340","350","360","340","900","910","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 11"],"b":["1000","710","170","340","330","340","320","350","1010","1100"]},"For the first or \u201csnowflake\u201d embodiment, the design unique component is the conductive diaphragm or adapter , which operates in conjunction with the retainer . The adapter  constitutes an electrically conductive circular disc. The radial slots  starting from the center  of the adapter  and extending outwards toward the circular periphery or rim . These form the flexible fingers that slide over the shield of a cable . There are also shorter conductive fingers on the perimeter of the diaphragm to enable the adapter  to deform and fit snugly into the swage tube  despite mild variation in the tube diameter providing optimal ohmic contact with the inner surface () of the swage tube .","Because the diaphragm  is non-load bearing, this component can be made from a variety of very thin materials, so long as the material's elastic deformation range is adequate to support the installed component (under load) without yielding to plastic deformation, and possesses electrically conductive characteristics. Foil covered plastic sheets could be used in this particular design. This design characteristic renders the \u201csnowflake\u201d and the other embodiments unique.","A second design feature of the \u201csnowflake\u201d design is the utilization of a split-ring topography. The split  enables the (deformed) adapter  to be removed or replaced after a cable  has been terminated to the equipment interface. This is a unique feature of all three designs, implemented in consideration of the difficulty and considerable cost of repairing a cable shield ground adapter on an installed system. This design feature is not found in any conventional configuration.","A third feature of the \u201csnowflake\u201d design is the ability to stack multiple adapters  within the swage tube , further enhancing the ohmic path from the cable shield to the inner surface () of the swage tube . With each doubling in the number of adapters  in the stack, the ohmic path reduces by the same factor. The stacking could be arranged on either side of the conductive retainer  or with adapters  in direct contact, such as a stack of coins.","The spacer or retainer  may serve two purposes. The retainer  mechanically responds to form a load path to transmit the compressive force developed by the tightening of the gland nut . The distribution of force over the diaphragm's periphery  helps seat the diaphragm  within the stuffing tube bowl  ensuring optimal ohmic contact between the diaphragm  and the inner wall  of the swage tube . The second purpose of the retainer  is to reduce the ohmic path to the swage tube , by providing a larger contact area.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1210","1220","1230","1240","1250","1210","1260","1270"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIGS. 14 and 15"],"b":["1300","1210","1260","1270","1310","1220","1320","1230","1330","1240","1340","1260","1270","1350","1330","1360","170","1400","1500","1310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["1600","330","1310","1310","1330","1340","330","1320","330"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIGS. 17 and 18","b":["1700","1800","1310","340","330","320","310","340","350","360","340"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIGS. 19 and 20","b":["1900","2000","1310","170","340","330","340","320","350","1010"]},"For the second embodiment, the unique component of the \u201croll-o-dex\u201d design is the electrically conductive adapter , being constructed from a single piece of conductive material. The adapter  is not load-bearing, and therefore a thin conductive material can be used for its construction. The tabs  and  are bent in alternating opposing directions, being repeated for all tabs. The \u201croll-o-dex\u201d adapter  is designed to elastically deform into an annular shape with the pointed tabs  facing toward the central axis cavity  of the roll. The adapter  can be placed inside the retainer  and unfurl thereby securing itself inside the retainer . The unique feature of the \u201croll-o-dex\u201d design is that the adapter  can be stacked as a doublet using the retainer  to hold the pair in place. This increases the surface contact area between the adapter  and the interior surface  of the swage tube , thereby providing an enhanced ohmic grounding path.","The outer flexible finger tabs  (in ) contact the inner surface  of the swage tube , thereby providing a good electrical contact, and tolerance to varying sizes of swage tubes . The pointed tabs  are plastically deformed orthogonal to the inner surface of the base ring , toward the center region  of the annulus. These pointed tabs  slide on the shielding of the cable  providing the electrical contact. The flexible nature of the pointed tabs  enables for the use of cables  having varying size diameters.","The conducting retainer  serves three functions. First, the retainer  acts to form a load path to transmit the compressive force developed by the tightening of the gland nut .

The sleeve  is then secured into place either through the use of a crimping tool or a separate retaining ring or strap. That retaining ring can be conductive or non-conductive depending on its size and location relative to the anticipated contact point of the adapter , which can be installed over the sleeve  to complete a grounding path between the conduit shield  and the inner surface  of the swage tube .","The grounding sleeve  can be easily removed and replaced and provides a method whereby the cable jacket need not be cut to allow the adapter  to gain good ohmic contact with the cable shield. The accidental cutting of the shield through poor installation practices constitutes one of the primary causes of installation related failures.

These rings  and  are connected together by a number of ribs , and also include tabs  cut orthogonal to the borders. The ribs  and tabs  can be scored for controlled deformation of the sheet .","The conductive adapter  is designed to elastically deform into an annular cage form. The strip  (cut from a metal sheet) can be rolled along an axis parallel to the slats  to form the annular cage structure for insertion between and secured by two conductive retainers . Tabs  cut into the strip  are bent outward to secure the strip  now rolled into the adapter  and to prevent the conductive retainers  from slipping toward the center of the adapter  under compressive loads. The ribs , when compressed, bend along the scoring marks creating contact fingers that simultaneously extend radially inward and outward as inner edges  and outer edges  while compressing the cage structure. This enables the ribs  to concurrently center themselves on the shield of the cable  and within the swage tube . The simultaneous extension allows this adapter  to accommodate the widest variety of cables and tube sizes.","An additional feature that can be implemented on the \u201clantern\u201d design is the addition of \u201cteeth\u201d to the inner finger contacts. As the inner finger edges  extend and make contact with the cable , the teeth  pierce the cable jacket to make ohmic contact with the conductive cable shield . This implementation of the \u201clantern\u201d design provides a unique means by which a cable  can be grounded without physically cutting away part of the jacket. Removing the necessity to cut away the jacket obviates exposure of the cable shield to the most common source of shield damage. Additionally, this method reduces the areal (i.e., bounded space) exposure of the cable shield to environmental factors that lead to degradation of the ohmic contact between the cable  and the ground adapter .","The retainers  are designed to have an outer diameter to match the inner diameter of the swage tube , which should match the diameter of the adapter  when properly deformed. The retainers , when compressed serve as a load path for the compressive load imparted by the gland nut  when tightened. This also serves to stabilize the adapter  upon full compression.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0115"},"figref":["FIGS. 34 and 35","FIG. 34","FIG. 35"],"b":["3400","3410","3420","3430","3440","3450","3460","3500"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"figref":"FIG. 36","b":["3600","3610","3450","3620","3622","3624","360","3630","3620","3632","3634","3636","3430","3640"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"figref":"FIG. 37","b":["3700","3610","3620","3722","3624","3724","3630","3732","3734","170","3636","3736","3640","3740"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"figref":"FIG. 38","b":["3800","3450","3620","3630","3810","3640","3440","3634","3630","3450","3430","3450","315","3610"]},"Commercial Potential: The commercial potential for the ground shield adapter described within broad and global in nature. The designs can be used for commercial as well as naval ship construction. Due to the inherent design tolerance for either Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) or metric dimensions for swage tubes , the design can be utilized for both domestic and foreign ship construction. Although designed with maritime applications in mind, the designs can also be utilized for general construction practices where swage tubes or breach type fittings might be required for facility cable penetrations that require grounding, stabilization, or weather sealing.","Reason: The United States Navy utilizes hundreds of topside components that require electrical power or signal connections to systems internal to the ship via cable. Because of the complex and system hostile EM environment the connecting cables must be protected from unwanted EM coupling to the signal or power cable. The cables therefore are protected from the EM environment by a conductive cable shield grounded via a CSGA to the ship's bulkhead.","Current CSGA technologies utilized by the Navy are difficult to manufacture due to machining, difficult to install, repair and replace due to design characteristics, have relatively short service life due to poor environmental design, and are very expensive (approximately $300.00 per unit in quantity). The Navy also currently purchases CSGAs in multiple sizes due to the conventional CSGAs inability to adapt to multiple swage tube sizes or cable diameters. This significantly increases acquisition, logistics and design costs. The strategic goal of the proposed design is to provide the Navy a cost efficient technology that can significantly reduce total ownership costs via acquisition maintenance and logistics across the fleet.","Advantages: The new designs utilize relatively few parts with most components being common to all three designs with the exception of the grounding diaphragm. Common components include environmental seals that also perform as stabilizing structural components for cable centering and conductive spacers that perform diaphragm deformation control functions. The grounding diaphragm itself is a cut stamped component made out of conductive sheeting.","The sheeting can be any useable conductive material depending on application such as brass, copper, stainless steel, aluminum or carbon impregnated sheeting. The required thickness of the sheeting depends on the design. The exemplary designs also utilize all components of the stuffing tube assembly. This includes the brass gland nut used as an integrating component and currently unused for shielded cable applications due to design characteristics of conventionally available CSGAs. Conventionally, CSGA assembly discards the gland nut, resulting in waste higher incurred costs to the Navy.","Alternatives include: [1] Use of conventional CSGA designs examples of which are described within this disclosure. [2] Use of a grounding technology proposed by Northrop Grumman Ship Builders (NGSB) known for its use of Double Optimized Braid (DOB) Cable Shielding. This material approach uses bronze or brass wool as the material matrix that provides grounding between the cable shield and the swage tube. The material has a relatively high surface area to volume ratio that lends concern to issues of corrosion and loss of effective grounding. This wool greatly simplifies replacement of the grounding material.","Cut-less Cable Shield Grounding Sleeve: The Cut-less Cable Shield Grounding Sleeve is a device whereby a typical cable shield ground adapter can be provided good ohmic contact with a cable shield without removal of the cable protective jacket. The exemplary device described herein is formed from a single sheet stamping  of an appropriate conductive material such as copper, stainless steel or aluminum. The sheet can be stamped so that at least two rows of small teeth  and  protrude on one side. These teeth, in the exemplary implementation, can be arranged in orthogonal directions to provide stability for the collar when the sheet's ends  and  join together, and the resulting sleeve  is properly installed.","Testing of correctly installed conventional CSGAs in stuffing tube installations has yielded an average direct current (DC) resistance of approximately 10 milliohms (m\u03a9). Testing of early prototypes of the new exemplary CSGA design has yielded an average DC resistance of 7 m\u03a9 or less based on design tested. Early results indicate that the DC resistance of the new design is at least comparable to conventional designs.","Dimensions of exemplary stuffing or swage tubes  are available from Research Tool & Die Works in Carson, Calif. For example, the D-size stuffing tube, as indicated in http:\/\/www.rtnd.com\/catalog\/4-8.pdf, includes an inner diameter of 1\u00bc\u2033, and a throat length of 1\u215d\u2033. The proposed diameter of the first embodiment would be slightly larger to ensure a circumferential contact by an interference fit with the inside of the swage tube .","The length of the second and third embodiments would match the circumference of the inner ring, . This exemplary ring has a diameter that is approximately \u00bc\u2033 less than the diameter of the swage tube . The particular dimensions identified herein represent explanatory examples and are not limiting. Thus, other stuffing tube and conduit sizes can be contemplated within the spirit of the claims.
