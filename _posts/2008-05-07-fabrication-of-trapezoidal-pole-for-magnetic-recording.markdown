title: Fabrication of trapezoidal pole for magnetic recording
abstract: A method for forming a magnetic write pole with a trapezoidal cross-section is described. The method consists of first forming a magnetic seedlayer on a base followed by depositing a removable material layer on the seedlayer, and then a resist layer on the removable material layer. A trench is then formed in the resist, and the resist is heated to cause the cross-sectional profile of the trench to assume a trapezoidal shape. The resist is then capped with another resist layer and further heated to cause the width of the trapezoidal trench to become narrower. The cap layer and removable material layer at the bottom of the trench are then removed and the trench filled with magnetic material by electroplating. The resist and seedlayer external to the trench are finally removed to form a write pole with a trapezoidal cross-section.

The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","The invention relates to magnetic recording heads and more particularly to the fabrication of a trapezoidal write pole.","Magnetic recording heads have utility in a magnetic disc drive storage system. Most magnetic recording heads used in such systems today are \u201clongitudinal\u201d magnetic recording heads. Longitudinal magnetic recording in its conventional form has been projected to suffer from superparamagnetic instabilities at densities above approximately 40 Gbit\/in. It is believed that reducing or changing the bit cell aspect ratio will extend this limit up to approximately 100 Gbit\/in. However, for recording densities above 100 Gbit\/in, different approaches will likely be necessary to overcome the limitations of longitudinal magnetic recording.","An alternative to longitudinal recording that overcomes at least some of the problems associated with the superparamagnetic effect is \u201cperpendicular\u201d magnetic recording. Perpendicular magnetic recording is believed to have the capability of extending recording densities well beyond the limits of longitudinal magnetic recording. Perpendicular magnetic recording heads for use with a perpendicular magnetic storage medium may include a pair of magnetically coupled poles, including a main write pole having a relatively small bottom surface area and a flux return pole having a larger bottom surface area. A coil having a plurality of turns is located adjacent to the main write pole for inducing a magnetic field between the pole and a soft underlayer of the storage media. The soft underlayer is located below the hard magnetic recording layer of the storage media and enhances the amplitude of the field produced by the main pole. This in turn allows the use of storage media with higher coercive force. Consequently, more stable bits can be stored in the media. In the recording process an electrical current in the coil energizes the main pole, which produces a magnetic field. The image of this field is produced in the soft underlayer to enhance the field strength produced in the magnetic media. The flux density that diverges from the tip into the soft underlayer returns through the return flux pole. The return pole is located sufficiently far apart from the main write pole such that the material of the return pole does not affect the magnetic flux of the main write pole, which is directed vertically into the hard layer and the soft underlayer of the storage media.","A magnetic recording system such as, for example, a perpendicular magnetic recording system may utilize a write pole with a square or rectangular cross-section. Under certain circumstances, the increased magnetic field concentration at the sharp corners can cause writing or erasure on adjacent tracks.","Another development that overcomes at least some of the problems associated with the superparamagnetic effect is heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), sometimes referred to as optical or thermal assisted recording. Heat assisted magnetic recording generally refers to the concept of locally heating a recording medium to reduce the coercivity of the recording medium so that the applied magnetic writing field can more easily direct the magnetization of the recording medium during the temporary magnetic softening of the recording medium caused by the heat source. The heat assisted magnetic recording allows for the use of small grain media, which is desirable for recording at increased aerial densities, with a larger magnetic anisotropy at room temperature and assuring a sufficient thermal stability.","More specifically, super paramagnetic instabilities become an issue as the grain volume is reduced in order to control media noise for high aerial density recording. The superparamagnetic effect is most evident when the grain volume V is sufficiently small that the inequality KV\/kT>40 can no longer be maintained. Kis the magnetic crystalline anisotropy energy density of the material, kis Boltzman's constant, and T is absolute temperature. When this inequality is not satisfied, thermal energy demagnetizes the individual grains and the stored data bits will not be stable. Therefore, as the grain size is decreased, in order to increase the aerial density, a threshold is reached for a given material Kand temperature T such that stable data storage is no longer feasible.","The thermal stability can be improved by employing a recording medium formed of a material with a very high K. However, with the available materials, the recording heads are not able to provide a sufficient or high enough magnetic writing field to write on such a medium. Accordingly, it has been proposed to overcome the recording head field limitations by employing thermal energy to heat a local area on the recording medium before or at about the time of applying the magnetic write field to the medium. By heating the medium, the Kor the coercivity is reduced such that the magnetic write field is sufficient to write to the medium. Once the medium cools to ambient temperature, the medium has a sufficiently high value of coercivity and assures thermal stability of the recorded information. When applying a heat or light source to the medium, it is desirable to confine the heat or light to the track where writing is taking place, and to generate the write field in close proximity to where the medium is heated to accomplish high aerial density recording. The separation between the heated spot and the write field spot should be minimal or as small as possible so that the writing may occur while the medium temperature is substantially above ambient temperature. This also provides for the efficient cooling of the medium once the writing is completed.","Accordingly, there is identified a need for an improved write pole with a shape and dimensions that overcome the limitations and shortcomings of known magnetic recording heads and heat assisted magnetic recording heads.","In one aspect of the invention, a method of forming a magnetic write pole with a trapezoidal cross-section is presented. The method comprises forming a magnetic seedlayer on a base, forming a removable material layer on the seedlayer, forming a resist layer on the removable layer and forming a trench in the resist and heating the structure for a first amount of time at a first temperature to form a predetermined slope in the first and second sidewalls of the trench. The method further comprises capping the trench with another resist layer and heating the capped trench for a second amount of time at a second temperature to shrink the separation of the first and second sidewalls of the trench, removing the cap layer and the removable material at the bottom of the trench, electroplating a magnetic material in the trench and removing the resist by stripping the resist and finally removing the seed material outside the pole area by ion-beam etching to form the magnetic pole.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a magnetic write pole with a multilayer structure and a trapezoidal cross-section comprises a base and a multilayer magnetic seedlayer on the base. A magnetic layer on the seedlayer has a trapezoidal cross-section, a bottom width Wless than or equal to about 100 nm, a top width of about 1.25 to 3 times W, a height h, and an aspect ratio h\/Wof about 1:1 to about 10:1.","The present invention relates to the problem of side writing or erasure on adjacent tracks due to magnetic field concentrations at sharp corners in prior art write poles with rectangular cross-sections as seen from the air bearing surface (ABS) of a recording media.  shows a cross-section of prior art write pole  as seen from the ABS. Write pole  has three sections, , , and . The shading on  illustrates magnetic field concentrations capable of side writing or erasure. The embodiment of the invention is to replace sections  and  with a single pole  having a trapezoidal cross-section with a bottom spacing  at its tip and a top spacing  to form write pole  as shown in . Furthermore, by making the spacing of section  in  equal to top spacing , the corners responsible for magnetic field leakage are eliminated. In another embodiment of the invention, the aspect ratio H\/W of the trapezoidal pole  is about 1:1 to about 10:1 to keep the wider portions away from the bottom edge (front edge) of the pole that does the writing. In another embodiment of the invention, the magnetization of the trapezoidal pole  is graded to ensure that the field from the top of the pole is lower than the field from the bottom of the pole since writing is done at the bottom of the pole.","Prior art trapezoidal poles have been fabricated using high angle ion-beam etching with masking to create the trapezoidal shape. This process is not compatible with the process used to form heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) heads. A process that is compatible with the HAMR process is electroplating in a resist trench with a trapezoidal shape.","The disclosed invention solves the following issues. 1) The trench has a trapezoidal shape. 2) The trench width at the bottom is less than 100 nm. 3) The aspect ratio h\/Wis about 1:1 to about 10:1. 4) Removing the seedlayer without leaving a footing or redepositing seedlayer material on the sides of the pole. 5) Backfilling with alumina without leaving voids in the alumina. 6) The process needs to be compatible with standard processes in industry fabs.","The invention discloses how to form a narrow trench with a controlled trapezoidal shape and controllable top and bottom separations. In summary the method is a hybrid thermal flow process consisting of a resist post-development thermal bake treatment process that allows a sub-100 nm high aspect ratio trench with a trapezoidal shape to be formed that can then be used as a template for electroplating writer pole materials.","The steps to form a magnetic pole with a trapezoidal cross-section are given in . First, a substrate is provided (step ). The substrate can be a ceramic composite used to form sliders such as an aluminum oxide\/titanium oxide composite or other materials known in the art. A plating seedlayer is deposited on the substrate (step ). Suitable seedlayers are selected from a group but are not limited to FeCo, NiFe, CoNiFe, Ru, Ta, CoZrTa, CoNbTa, and Cu.","A thin, easily removable, resist layer is deposited on the seedlayer (step ). The removable layer is preferably about 10 nm to about 30 nm thick and is preferably a polymethylglutarimide (PMGI) layer. The removable layer is then given a post-apply bake (step ). A thicker top resist layer is then deposited on the PMGI layer with a thickness of from about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 4.0 \u03bcm depending on the requirements for the top pole design (step ). The resist is then given a post-apply bake (step ). The resist is then exposed using e-beam or other lithographic tools e.g. G-line, I-line, DUV, 193 nm scanner, electron beam direct write, EUV, x-ray lithography or others (step ). The exposed wafer is then given a post exposure bake (step ). The exposed wafer is then developed in standard tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) developer to form a rectangular trench (step ). The developed wafer is then put through a hybrid thermal flow process, described later, to produce the proper trapezoidal shape and spacing of the trench (step ). Magnetic material is then electroplated in the trench to form a magnetic trapezoidal pole (step ).","The hybrid thermal flow process is composed of two processes, a thermal bake process and a thermal shrink process. In the thermal bake process, the resist is baked at a temperature close to the glass transition temperature, Tg, of the resist. This causes the walls of the trench to slope into a trapezoidal cross-section as shown in .  shows resist layer  with trench  on substrate  before thermal bake process.  shows resist layer  after thermal bake. Trench  with rectangular cross-section has transformed into trench  with trapezoidal cross-section after the bake.","The thermal shrink process is illustrated in  where resist layer  on substrate  with a rectangular trench is capped with resist layer . Resist layer  is applied by spin coating and fills the trench during the process. The spacing of the trench is \u201ca\u201d. The resist is then baked at a temperature less than, equal to, or greater than that used for the thermal bake process. This thermal shrink process causes the separation of the two walls of the trench to decrease giving an added dimension to the control of the trapezoidal trench forming process. The new spacing is \u201cb\u201d where b<a. The thermal shrink process can be repeated at will to obtain the required trench separation. The thermal bake process and thermal shrink process can be interchanged as needed to obtain required trapezoidal trench shapes and dimensions. By combining the two processes, trenches with high aspect ratios of 1:1 to 10:1 and sub-100 nm spacing have been produced. The process is very manufacturable. The addition of the hybrid thermal bake process to an overall manufacturing process can be done using resist development track tools that are standard in most industry fabs. The actual time it takes to incorporate these processes into the lithographic step is minimal compared to the results that can be achieved. In addition, the cost of the added material is attractively small in relation to the cost of updating and maintaining advanced lithographic equipment such as DUV, 193 nm scanners, electron beam direct write, or EUV tools that are needed to reduce trench dimensions to the sub-100 nm regime. It should be mentioned that this method or process is not limited to the application of magnetic pole fabrication. In principle it can be used in any device fabrication in the case where a narrow trapezoidal trench pattern is needed.","An example of how a trapezoidal shape is formed in a 1.3 \u03bcm thick resist with a rectangular trench during a thermal bake is shown in . Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the trench are shown at different temperatures after a 60 second bake at different temperatures in . The bottom and top spacing, of the trench as well as the bevel angle are shown in  as a function of temperature for a 60 second baking time. The top spacing and bevel angle are smoothly varying functions of temperature while the bottom spacing remained constant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"]},"The plating process to form a trapezoidal pole starts with step  in , deposit seedlayer.
