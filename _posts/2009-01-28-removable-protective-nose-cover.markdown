title: Removable protective nose cover
abstract: A removable protective nose cover for a submersible structure having a nose section is disclosed. The removable protective nose cover can include a plurality of shell members, each of the shell members having a forward end and an aft end. Each shell member can also be dimensioned to fit adjacent to and around the nose section of the submersible structure and thereby form a protective shell. A central nose member having a locking member can also be included, the locking member being operable to attach the central nose member to each of the forward ends of the shell members. The aft ends of the shell members can be attached to each other using a plurality of attachment clips such that the attachment of the central nose member to each of the forward ends of the shell members and the attachment of the adjacent aft ends of the shell members form the removable protective nose cover for the submersible structure. The attachment clips can be operable to release the plurality of shell members from being held adjacent to the submersible structure when the structure moves through a liquid at a predefined speed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/025,181 filed Jan. 31, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. N00024-02-D-6604 ordered by the U.S. Office of Naval Research. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to a removable protective nose cover for a submersible structure, and more particularly, a removable protective nose cover for a submersible structure.","Weapons such as torpedoes can be dropped into a body of water from a high altitude by a helicopter, fixed wing aircraft and the like in an effort to damage and\/or destroy an intended target. The impact of the water on sensitive array components within a nose section of the weapon can cause damage thereto and result in the failure of the weapon. Heretofore weapons have placed a protective nose cover over the forward end of the weapon in order to mitigate the water impact forces and prevent damage to the instrumentation. This force reduction is achieved primarily through streamlining of the nose shape through the addition of a pointed shape provided by the nose cover. However, for the sensitive array components to function properly, the protective nose cover must come off or be removed after the weapon has entered the water. One method that has been used to accomplish this task has been a cover that breaks up or fragments upon impact of the weapon with the water. However, limited success has been demonstrated by such a method since the nose cover has to be durable enough to protect the instrumentation during transport and from impact by other flying objects such as birds, and yet still provide reliable fracture upon water entry\/impact.","In particular, frangible nose covers rely on the fracture strength of the material of construction in their design in that if the fracture strength is exceeded upon impact and\/or entry into water, the nose cover fractures and the cover falls away from the weapon. However, the fracture strength of a given material can be highly variable, thus making such a protective nose cover that will fracture under specific conditions very difficult.","Heretofore frangible nose covers have been principally made from two types of materials\u2014plastics and ceramics. The fracture strength of a given plastic typically varies with temperature, humidity, and time. Since none of these variables are controllable in an end use scenario, whether or not a plastic frangible nose cover fractures upon impact with water is highly variable. In contrast, ceramics are relatively stable with temperature, humidity and time. However small imperfections within or on a ceramic body can cause very large changes in the body's fracture strength. In summary, previous research and development of removable protective nose covers has been met with limited success.","As such, a protective nose cover that provides adequate protection during transport of the weapon and yet provides reliable removal upon entry into the water would be desirable.","A removable protective nose cover for a submersible structure having a nose section is disclosed. The removable protective nose cover can include a plurality of shell members, each of the shell members having a forward end and an aft end. Each shell member can be dimensioned to fit adjacent to and around the nose section of the submersible structure and thereby form a protective shell. A central nose member having a locking member can also be included, the locking member being operable to attach the central nose member to each of the forward ends of the shell members. The aft ends of the shell members can be attached to each other using a plurality of attachment clips such that the attachment of the central nose member to each of the forward ends of the shell members and the attachment of the adjacent aft ends of the shell members form the removable protective nose cover for the submersible structure.","The removable protective nose cover can have at least one submerged inlet duct that is at least partially within one of the shell members. In some instances, the submerged inlet duct can be formed by two attached and adjacent shell members and may or may not be proximate to the aft ends of the two attached and adjacent shell members. One of the attachment clips can cover at least part of the submerged inlet duct and be shaped such that when a fluid flows through the duct a differential pressure is provided to opposite sides of the clip. The differential pressure can result in the clip being moved from a closed position to an open position, the open position of the clip affording for the shell members being released from positions adjacent to the submersible structure and removal of the nose cover being provided.","A process for removing the protective nose cover from the submersible structure can include providing the structure and providing the protective nose cover as detailed above. The plurality of shell members, the central nose member and the plurality of attachment clips are assembled about the submersible structure in order to form the protective nose cover with a plurality of submerged inlet ducts therewithin. Thereafter, the submersible structure can be placed into a liquid and moved through the liquid at a predefined speed. As the liquid passes through the plurality of submerged inlet ducts, a pressure differential is created on opposite sides of each of the plurality of attachment clips, the pressure differential exceeding a predefined value such that the clips are forced to move from the closed position to the open position. When the clips move to the open position, the plurality of shell members are no longer constrained to fit adjacent to the submersible structure, and in combination with the fluid flow about the structure and the shell members, the protective nose cover is removed.","The present invention discloses a removable protective nose cover for a submersible structure having a nose section. In some instances, the submersible structure can be a weapon. As such, the present invention has utility as a component for a weapon.","The invention can be applied to applications other than weapons and thereby afford protection to any sensitive instrumentation package(s) that needs to be delivered through a gas medium into a liquid at high energy. For example and for illustrative purposes only, oceanographic instrument packages, such as those that monitor water conditions in lakes and oceans, could be dropped from high altitude aircraft and use the removable protective nose cover disclosed herein to protect instrumentation within the package. It can also be applied to a submersed canister containing a weapon or instrumentation package that must break through a barrier in order to be sent on its mission. The protective cover would prevent damage to the package while the barrier is being penetrated and subsequently come off the package after a specified velocity in a liquid (such as water) has been reached.","The removable protective nose cover can include a plurality of shell members, each shell member having a forward end and an aft end. In addition, each shell member has a shape that is complementary to the nose section of the submersible structure and thereby affords for the plurality of shell members to fit adjacent to and around the nose section of the structure. This plurality of shell members, when assembled, forms a protective shell around the nose section of the submersible structure.","A central nose member can also be included, the nose member operable to attach to the forward ends of each of the plurality of shell members and thereby hold the forward ends of the shell members in a desired configuration. In some instances, the central nose member has a locking element that is operable to attach the central nose member to each of the forward ends of the plurality of shell members. Proximate to the aft end of each shell member can be an attachment clip that is operable to attach adjacent aft ends of adjacent shell members such that the aft ends are also held in a desirable configuration.","The attachment clips can be positioned proximate and\/or adjacent to a submerged inlet duct that is proximate to the aft end of the shell member. The clip can have a shape such that the flow of water into the submerged inlet duct provides a high static pressure against the clip. The high static pressure is sufficient to release the clip, i.e. force the clip from a closed position to an open position, the open position resulting in the separation of corresponding shell members away from the nose section of the submersible structure.","Turning now to , an exploded view of an embodiment is shown generally at reference numeral . The removable nose cover can include a plurality of shell members , each shell member  having a front end  and an aft end . Proximate to the aft end  can be a submerged inlet duct , a first clip slot  and a second clip slot . It is appreciated that the first clip slot  and the second clip slot  may or may not be associated with and\/or proximate to the same submerged inlet duct  for a given shell member . The submerged inlet duct  affords for the flow of a fluid exterior to the shell member  to pass through the duct  and enter into an interior side of the shell members . A given submerged inlet duct  can be made from or can span across at least part of two adjacent shell members  as illustrated in , however this is not required. Proximate to the submerged inlet duct  can be an attachment clip  that is operable to fit at least partially within the first clip slot  and the second clip slot . The assembly of the shell members  using a plurality of attachment clips  provides for the securement of the aft ends  of the shell members  about the nose section of a submersible structure (not shown).","A central nose member  can also be included, the central nose member dimensioned such that it affords for attachment to each of the forward ends  of the shell members . Optionally included can be pieces of foam  and\/or  in order to provide cushioning of the shell members  and central nose member  against the nose section of the submersible structure. In addition, the pieces of foam  and\/or  can provide an outer projecting force or pressure to shell members  and\/or central nose member  when the removable protective nose cover  is assembled about a submersible structure. For the purposes of the present invention, the term \u201cfoam\u201d can include any compressible and\/or \u201crubbery\u201d material, illustratively including natural rubber, cork, elastomers, polyurethane foam, extruded polystyrene foam and the like.","In addition, a seal  having a first seal member  and a second seal member  can be located proximate to the aft end  of the shell members  in order to provide the same cushioning and\/or outer projecting force on the aft ends  and limit the amount of fluid flow that can pass or flow from under the shell members  after flowing into the submerged inlet ducts . The seal  also maintains pressure on the submersible structure or an instrument package and thereby resists any tendency for the assembled protective nose cover from sliding off the nose through handling of the structure.","Turning now to , an inner side of the removable protective nose cover  in an assembled configuration is shown wherein the central nose member  and the attachment clips  are shown to be attached to the shell members . An enlarged section of the attachment of the central nose member  to the forward end  of a shell member  is illustrated in . As shown in this figure, the nose member  has an undercut region  and an extending member  which form a slot and allows a tang  on the forward end  to engage and\/or snap into the undercut . The tang  is formed at least partially by a U-shaped recess  at the forward end  of the shell member . The extending member  of the central nose member  fits at least partially within the U-shaped recess  of the forward end . Likewise, fitting within the undercut region  of the central nose member  is the tang  of the shell member . It is appreciated that the U-shaped recess , the extending member , the undercut region  and the tang  are dimensioned such that a snap or interference fit can be provided between the central nose member  and the forward end  of each the shell members .","Turning now to , an enlarged view of the attachment clip  is shown. The attachment clip  can include a top surface  and a bottom surface . The top surface  faces outwardly from the submersible structure, while the bottom surface  is oppositely disposed therefrom. The bottom surface  can include an inclined surface  that adjoins a forward end  of the attachment clip  to a base section . Adjacent to the base section  can be a spring section . At least partially within the attachment clip  can be a spring , the spring  providing tension or resistance to the movement of the attachment clip  relative to the spring .","In some instances, the spring  can pass at least partially through the spring section  as shown in . Although not required, the spring  can be made from an inner member  at least partially surrounded by an outer member . In some instances, the inner member  can be a metal wire and the outer member  can be a tube or pieces of tubing that fit around the metal wire. As shown in , the inner member  can include a plurality of bends  and at least one bend end .","The inner member  can also have a first end and a second end, the first end attachable to a shell member  on one side of the submerged inlet duct  and the second end attachable to a different shell member  on an opposite side of the same submerged inlet duct . It is appreciated that the plurality of bends  afford a U-shaped section , than when molded or placed within the spring section  provides a leverage section to resist movement or twisting of the bottom surface  relative to the spring . Thus holding the ends of the spring  in a fixed position provides resistance to the movement of the bottom surface , and in some instances a pivotal movement about or with respect to the bend end .","Referring back to , it is shown that the attachment clip  having the spring  can be used to attach adjacent shell members  to each other by inserting the ends of the spring  at least partially within the first clip slot  and the second clip slot . After insertion of the attachment clip  at least partially within the clip slots, it is appreciated that the attachment clip at least partially covers or extends across the submerged inlet duct . In addition, it is appreciated that the top surface  of the attachment clip  affords for normal\/typical fluid flow thereacross. In contrast, the bottom surface  with the inclined surface , the optional base section  and spring section  afford for the trapping of fluid that flows through the submerged inlet duct  and under the attachment clip , thereby creating a local high pressure area underneath the attachment clip  and inside the nose cover .","The difference between the fluid flowing normally over the top surface  and the fluid being trapped underneath the bottom surface  creates a pressure difference across the bottom surface  that applies a torque to the attachment clip . When the torque is sufficiently large enough to overcome the retention strength of the spring , the attachment clip  releases and pops up in a direction that is generally perpendicular to and\/or outwardly from the shell member . This release of the attachment clip  results in the two adjacent shell members  separating and the removal of the nose cover  from the submersible structure due to the higher pressure inside the shell and the lifting effect of the attachment clip .","It is appreciated that a pressure difference can exist across the bottom surface  due to the flow of air past the submersible structure and the removable protective nose cover  thereon. However, due to the low density of air, an insufficient pressure difference can be provided in order to release or flip the attachment clip . For example and for illustrative purposes only, air has a density of approximately 1.2 kg\/mat sea level and 20\u00b0 C. As such, the top surface  and the bottom surface  can be subjected to differential in pressure therebetween of 60 kiloPascals (kPa) (8.7 pounds per square inch (psi)) for a weapon traveling at 1,225 kilometers per hour (km\/h) (Mach 1) in air. In contrast, water has a density of approximately 998 kg\/mat sea level and 20\u00b0 C. Therefore, assuming a water entry velocity for the weapon of 60 km\/h (55 feet per second), the differential pressure between the top surface  and the bottom surface  can be approximately 121.3 kPa (17.6 psi). It is appreciated that a spring  can be selected and\/or designed such that the attachment clip  will not be released as the weapon travels through air but will be released as the weapon enters into water.","It is appreciated that the embodiment shown in  illustrates a nose cover shell built from five shell sections around a forward tapered section of a nose, with a sixth disk shaped section covering the front of the nose of a submersible structure. Inside the shell sections and the nose cover are foam inserts that can support the cover and help it to maintain its shape as well as cushion the forces being applied to the nose instrumentation during impact with the water upon entry. The seal  can be a silicon rubber sealing strip that limits the amount of fluid flow that can flow out from under the shell and also helps keep the cover in place during handling. The attachment clips hold the aft ends of the shell sections together and with the use of the foam inserts provides a removable protective nose cover that is held in tension around the submersible structure. After one shell section is removed upon entry of the submersible structure into water, restraining force is no longer present to hold the remaining shell sections in place, thereby resulting in their separation from the nose of the submersible structure also.","A process for removing the protective nose cover from the submersible structure can include providing the structure and providing the protective nose cover as detailed above. The plurality of shell members, the central nose member and the plurality of attachment clips are assembled about the submersible structure in order to form the protective nose cover with a plurality of submerged inlet ducts therewithin. Thereafter, the submersible structure can be placed into a liquid and moved through the liquid at a predefined speed. As the liquid passes through the plurality of submerged inlet ducts, a pressure differential is created on opposite sides of each of the plurality of attachment clips, the pressure differential exceeding a predefined value such that the clips are forced to move from the closed position to the open position. When the clips move to the open position, the plurality of shell members are no longer constrained to fit adjacent to the submersible structure's nose, and in combination with the fluid flow about the structure and the shell members, the protective nose cover is removed from the structure.","The shell members, central nose member and attachment clips can be made from any material known to those skilled in the art that provides the appropriate engineering properties for the given function of each component, illustratively including metals, alloys, plastics, ceramics, wood and the like.","The foregoing drawings, discussion and description are illustrative of specific embodiments of the present invention, but they are not meant to be limitations upon the practice thereof. Numerous modifications and variations of the invention will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the teaching presented herein.
