No. 12\/685,652, filed on Jan. 11, 2010, which claims the benefit and priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/143,755, filed on Jan. 9, 2009; each of these prior applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under Grant 5DPlOD00027605, 5R37MH05938809, and 1RO1MH087986, which were awarded by the National Institute of Health; the Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates generally to the discovery of pro-neurogenic compounds capable of promoting neurogenesis and\/or reducing neuronal cell death.","It is now accepted that the adult vertebrate brain fosters the birth and functional incorporation of newly formed neurons (Goldman and Nottebohm, 1984; Paton and Nottebohm, 1984; Burd and Nottebohm, 1985). However, it was long thought that no new neurons could be added to the adult mammalian brain. This dogma was challenged in the 1960's when autoradiographic evidence of new neuron formation in the hippocampal dentate gyms, olfactory bulb, and cerebral cortex of the adult rat was presented (Altman, 1962, 1963; Altman and Das, 1965, 1966a,b). It is now accepted that within all mammalian species, including humans (Eriksson et al., 1998), there are two major reservoirs of neuronal stem cells, one located in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyms and another in the subventricular zone (SVZ) (Gross, 2000). Neural stem cells in the SVZ facilitate formation of new neurons that migrate rostrally to populate the olfactory bulb, while neural stem cells in the SGZ produce neurons that integrate locally in the granular layer of the dentate gyms, a region of the hippocampus that exhibits lifelong structural and functional plasticity.","The process of new neuron formation in the adult mouse brain can be influenced by environmental, chemical and genetic variables. As demonstrated by Gage and colleagues, neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain is enhanced when animals are exposed to an enriched environment (Kempermann et al., 1998) or able to exercise voluntarily (van Praag et al., 1999). More recently, anti-depressant drugs have been shown to enhance levels of adult neurogenesis in animals, including humans (Schmidt and Duman, 2007; Boldrini et al., 2009). Among many genes reported to impact adult neurogenesis is the gene encoding neuronal PAS domain protein 3 (NPAS3), a central nervous system (CNS)-specific transcription factor that has been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Kamnsasaran et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2005, 2006, 2009; Lavedan et al., 2008). Animals missing both copies of the NPAS3 gene suffer a profound loss of adult hippocampal neurogenesis coupled with significant behavioral deficits (Pieper et al., 2005). Knowing that impaired post-natal neurogenesis elicits unfavorable phenotypic deficits, it is predicted that pro-neurogenic chemical compounds should exhibit favorable therapeutic benefits.","This invention relates generally to compounds that promote the generation or the survival of existing neurons in the mammalian brain. For the purpose of simplicity we refer to these compounds as being pro-neurogenic. In certain embodiments, the compounds promote the generation or survival of neurons in the post-natal mammalian brain. In certain embodiments, the compounds promote the survival, growth, development and\/or function of neurons, particularly CNS, brain, cerebral, and hippocampal neurons.

The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the invention.","In addition to salt forms, the invention provides compounds which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are those compounds that undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the invention when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be more bioavailable by oral administration than the parent drug. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmacological compositions over the parent drug. A wide variety of prodrug derivatives are known in the art, such as those that rely on hydrolytic cleavage or oxidative activation of the prodrug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound of the invention which is administered as an ester (the \u201cprodrug\u201d), but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity. Additional examples include peptidyl derivatives of a compound of the invention.","The invention also includes various hydrate and solvate forms of the compounds.","The compounds of the invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds.

Paquette, ed., , John Wiley and Sons (1995), and subsequent editions thereof.","The processes described herein can be monitored according to any suitable method known in the art. For example, product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means, such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (e.g., H or C), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), spectrophotometry (e.g., UV-visible), or mass spectrometry (MS), or by chromatography such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin layer chromatography (TLC).","Preparation of compounds can involve the protection and deprotection of various chemical groups. The need for protection and deprotection, and the selection of appropriate protecting groups can be readily determined by one skilled in the art.

A given reaction can be carried out in one solvent or a mixture of more than one solvents. Depending on the particular reaction step, suitable solvents for a particular reaction step can be selected.","Resolution of racemic mixtures of compounds can be carried out by any of numerous methods known in the art. An example method includes preparation of the Mosher's ester or amide derivative of the corresponding alcohol or amine, respectively. The absolute configuration of the ester or amide is then determined by proton and\/or F NMR spectroscopy. An example method includes fractional recrystallization using a \u201cchiral resolving acid\u201d which is an optically active, salt-forming organic acid. Suitable resolving agents for fractional recrystallization methods are, for example, optically active acids, such as the D and L forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids. Resolution of racemic mixtures can also be carried out by elution on a column packed with an optically active resolving agent (e.g., dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine).

The interrelationship of dosages for animals and humans (based on milligrams per meter squared of body surface) is described by Freireich et al., Cancer Chemother. Rep. 50, 219 (1966). Body surface area may be approximately determined from height and weight of the patient. See, e.g., Scientific Tables, Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ardsley, New York, 537 (1970). In certain embodiments, the compositions are administered by oral administration or administration by injection. The methods herein contemplate administration of an effective amount of compound or compound composition to achieve the desired or stated effect. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered from about 1 to about 6 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy.","Lower or higher doses than those recited above may be required. Specific dosage and treatment regimens for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity and course of the disease, condition or symptoms, the patient's disposition to the disease, condition or symptoms, and the judgment of the treating physician.","Upon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.","In some embodiments, the compounds described herein can be coadministered with one or more other threapeutic agents. In certain embodiments, the additional agents may be administered separately, as part of a multiple dose regimen, from the compounds of this invention (e.g., sequentially, e.g., on different overlapping schedules with the administration of one or more compounds of formula (I) (including any subgenera or specific compounds thereof)). In other embodiments, these agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together with the compounds of this invention in a single composition. In still another embodiment, these agents can be given as a separate dose that is administered at about the same time that one or more compounds of formula (I) (including any subgenera or specific compounds thereof) are administered (e.g., simultaneously with the administration of one or more compounds of formula (I) (including any subgenera or specific compounds thereof)). When the compositions of this invention include a combination of a compound of the formulae described herein and one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agents, both the compound and the additional agent can be present at dosage levels of between about 1 to 100%, and more preferably between about 5 to 95% of the dosage normally administered in a monotherapy regimen.","The compositions of this invention may contain any conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. In some cases, the pH of the formulation may be adjusted with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, bases or buffers to enhance the stability of the formulated compound or its delivery form.","The compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example, as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, or carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents which are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms such as emulsions and or suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants such as Tweens or Spans and\/or other similar emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation.","The compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, emulsions and aqueous suspensions, dispersions and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions and\/or emulsions are administered orally, the active ingredient may be suspended or dissolved in an oily phase is combined with emulsifying and\/or suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and\/or flavoring and\/or coloring agents may be added.","The compositions of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These compositions can be prepared by mixing a compound of this invention with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the active components. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.","Topical administration of the compositions of this invention is useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application. For application topically to the skin, the composition should be formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water.

Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The compositions of this invention may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable enema formulation.","In some embodiments, topical administration of the compounds and compositions described herein may be presented in the form of an aerosol, a semi-solid pharmaceutical composition, a powder, or a solution. By the term \u201ca semi-solid composition\u201d is meant an ointment, cream, salve, jelly, or other pharmaceutical composition of substantially similar consistency suitable for application to the skin. Examples of semi-solid compositions are given in Chapter 17 of The Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy, Lachman, Lieberman and Kanig, published by Lea and Febiger (1970) and in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 21st Edition (2005) published by Mack Publishing Company, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Topically-transdermal patches are also included in this invention. Also within the invention is a patch to deliver active chemotherapeutic combinations herein. A patch includes a material layer (e.g., polymeric, cloth, gauze, bandage) and the compound of the formulae herein as delineated herein. One side of the material layer can have a protective layer adhered to it to resist passage of the compounds or compositions. The patch can additionally include an adhesive to hold the patch in place on a subject. An adhesive is a composition, including those of either natural or synthetic origin, that when contacted with the skin of a subject, temporarily adheres to the skin. It can be water resistant. The adhesive can be placed on the patch to hold it in contact with the skin of the subject for an extended period of time. The adhesive can be made of a tackiness, or adhesive strength, such that it holds the device in place subject to incidental contact, however, upon an affirmative act (e.g., ripping, peeling, or other intentional removal) the adhesive gives way to the external pressure placed on the device or the adhesive itself, and allows for breaking of the adhesion contact. The adhesive can be pressure sensitive, that is, it can allow for positioning of the adhesive (and the device to be adhered to the skin) against the skin by the application of pressure (e.g., pushing, rubbing,) on the adhesive or device.","The compositions of this invention may be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and\/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.","A composition having the compound of the formulae herein and an additional agent (e.g., a therapeutic agent) can be administered using any of the routes of administration described herein. In some embodiments, a composition having the compound of the formulae herein and an additional agent (e.g., a therapeutic agent) can be administered using an implantable device. Implantable devices and related technology are known in the art and are useful as delivery systems where a continuous, or timed-release delivery of compounds or compositions delineated herein is desired. Additionally, the implantable device delivery system is useful for targeting specific points of compound or composition delivery (e.g., localized sites, organs). Negrin et al., Biomaterials, 22(6):563 (2001). Timed-release technology involving alternate delivery methods can also be used in this invention. For example, timed-release formulations based on polymer technologies, sustained-release techniques and encapsulation techniques (e.g., polymeric, liposomal) can also be used for delivery of the compounds and compositions delineated herein.","The invention will be further described in the following examples.

identify compounds that might stimulate the birth of new neurons, or protect newborn neurons from cell death, a library of 1,000 compounds was screened using an in vivo assay. In the initial screen, compounds were randomly pooled into groups of ten and administered intracerebroventricularly at a constant rate over seven days into the left lateral ventricle of living mice via Alzet osmotic mini-pumps. Compounds were administered at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM for each molecule, making a total solute concentration of 100 \u03bcM. After seven days of infusion at a constant rate of 0.5 \u03bcL\/hour, a total of 84 \u03bcL of volume will have left the pump (0.00084 \u03bcMoles) and entered the cerebrospinal fluid. The average volume of a brain from a 12 week old male, C57\/B6 mouse in our study is 500 mm. The maximal amount of drug was estimated that could potentially be present in the brain, taking the extreme and unlikely scenario of 100% absorbance of the drug into brain tissue and 0% clearance throughout the seven day infusion period. Under these conditions, at the end of one week of infusion each compound would be present at 1.7 \u03bcMolar concentration. Since the actual amount of chemical compound in the brain is likely to be only a fraction of this predicted level, it is reasonable to estimate that compounds were administered at mid to low-nanomolar concentrations.","During compound infusion, animals were intraperitoneally (IP) injected daily with the thymidine analog, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), as a means of scoring the birth and survival of proliferating neural precursor cells in the hippocampus. Because both social interaction and voluntary exercise are known to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis, mice were housed individually without access to running wheels throughout the screening period. Following the week-long period of compound administration, animals were perfused and sacrificed. Dissected brain tissue was fixed, embedded, sectioned, stained with antibodies to BrdU, and evaluated by light microcopy as a means of quantifying neurogenesis and survival of newborn neural precursor cells localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms on the brain hemisphere contralateral to the side of mini-pump cannulation. Every fifth section throughout the entire rostral-caudal extent of the hippocampus was analyzed, and the total number of BrdU+ cells was normalized against the measured volume of the dentate gyms. Because both increased proliferation and survival of newborn neurons are important screening parameters, the screen was conducted over seven days in order to cast a wide net to detect molecules that might augment either process. The choice of parameters for the screen was based on pulse-chase experiments with a single injection of BrdU, under identical conditions to those used in our screen, which revealed that 40% of newborn cells in the dentate gyms die within the first five days of their birth (). Intracranial infusions of either fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) or artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) vehicle via the same, week-long protocol were employed as positive and negative controls. There was no difference in the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyms between mice subjected to surgical pump implantation and infusion with vehicle, and mice having had no surgery (). This confirmed the validity of the in vivo approach to assess the ability of intracerebroventricularly infused compounds to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in the contralateral hemisphere.","We considered it to be important that stimulation of neurogenesis triggered by any compound be localized to the exact region of the brain known to produce new neurons at an enhanced level in response to healthy activities such as wheel running, access to an enriched environment, or access to social interaction. For this reason attention was focused solely on compound pools that stimulated BrdU incorporation only in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyms. Prominent nonspecific incorporation of BrdU in ectopic regions, such as CA3, CA1, cortex, or striatum, was presumed to reflect pathological inflammation, as proliferating cells incorporate BrdU in DNA synthesis, or to indicate other forms of toxicity, as cells also incorporate BrdU during DNA repair. Any compound pools yielding ectopic BrdU incorporation were eliminated from the screen. For an example, see .","Each of the 100 pools was tested on two independent mice. As shown in , ten of the 100 test pools were observed to enhance dentate gyms-specific neurogenesis to an extent roughly equivalent to FGF-2. Each pool that scored positive in the initial two test animals was subsequently re-evaluated in two additional mice, and all ten pools were found to exert their pro-neurogenic effect with statistical significance (). In order to identify single, pro-neurogenic compounds, positive pools were broken down into their ten component molecules, each of which was infused individually at two concentrations (100 \u03bcM and 1000 \u03bcM) in two mice per concentration.  shows the results of break-down assays on pool #7, wherein it was discovered that neurogenesis was selectively stimulated by one of the constituent chemicals of the pool (compound #3), chemicals in the pool demonstrating no effect. We designate this molecule as Example 45 Compound. In breaking down the ten positive pools, eight pools yielded a single pro-neurogenic compound (). To ensure that the pro-proliferative or neuroprotective effect on neural stem cells was not an artifact of storage conditions in the UTSWMC chemical compound library, re-supplied compounds were verified to by 99% pure by mass spectrometry, evaluated in 4 mice each at 10 \u03bcM concentration, and shown to retain either pro-proliferative or neuroprotective properties in neural stem cells ().","Pharmacokinetic analysis of Example 45 Compound in plasma and whole brain tissue was undertaken after single IV, IP and oral gavage administrations. Example 45 Compound was noted to be orally bioavailable, readily able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and endowed with a plasma terminal half life of 6.7 hours after IP delivery. These favorable pharmacological properties facilitated a dose response experiment wherein daily oral administration of Example 45 Compound to adult mice was monitored for both brain levels of the chemical and pro-neurogenic efficacy (). Maximal, pro-neurogenic efficacy was observed at oral doses of 5 mg\/kg and above, and graded reductions in efficacy were observed at doses of 2.5 and 1 mg\/kg. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the brain levels of Example 45 Compound in the dose ranges of 1, 2.5 and 5 mg\/kg revealed corresponding compound concentrations of 213 nM (101 ng\/g brain tissue), 1.13 \u03bcM (534 ng\/g brain tissue) and 1.35 \u03bcM (640 ng\/g brain tissue) five hours after dosing.","In order to further study Example 45 Compound, an in vivo structure activity relationship (SAR) study was conducted using 37 chemical derivatives of the compound for pro-neurogenic activity via direct administration into the brain of adult mice via Alzet minipumps. Compounds were administered for one week at 10 uM into 4 mice per compound, along with daily IP injections of BrdU. Following compound administration, animals were perfused, sacrificed and subjected to sectioning, staining and light microscopy in order to monitor hippocampal neurogenesis localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms. Roughly 10% of the variant compounds retained pro-neurogenic activity indistinguishable from the parent compound. An approximately equal number of compounds yielded slightly diminished activity, yet the majority of variants were of significantly diminished activity (). A variant of Example 45 Compound having a methoxy substitution on the aniline ring (Example 62 Compound) was re-tested for pro-neurogenic activity via direct administration into the brain of adult mice via Alzet minipumps. The compound was administered for one week at 10 \u03bcM into 4 mice which were injected daily with BrdU. Following compound administration, animals were perfused, sacrificed and subjected to sectioning, staining and light microscopy in order to monitor hippocampal neurogenesis localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms. The methoxy derivative exhibited activity comparable to Example 45 Compound. Subsequently, the (+) and (\u2212) enantiomers of Example 62 Compound were prepared (). The two enantiomers were evaluated in the in vivo neurogenesis assay. The (+)-enantiomer of Example 62 Compound retained potent pro-neurogenic activity, and the (\u2212) enantiomer displayed diminished activity ().","The nature of the cells produced in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyms was investigated when Example 45 Compound was administered as follows. Animals were exposed to oral administration of Example 45 Compound for 30 days. Brain tissue was then prepared for immunohistochemical staining with an antibody to doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule-associated protein that serves as a marker of neurogenesis in the dentate gyms by virtue of transient expression in newly formed neurons, but not glial cells, between the timing of their birth and final maturation (Brown et al., 2003). As shown in , the relative abundance of doublecortin-positive neurons increased dramatically as a function of exposure to prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound. Although this observation does not rule out the possibility that the compound might also enhance the formation of glial cells, it clearly shows that Example 45 Compound enhanced the formation of cells destined to become neurons.","Example 45 Compound-mediated neurogenesis was next investigated to see whether it was attributable to increased cell proliferation or protection of newborn cells from cell death during the time between their birth and eventual incorporation into the granular layer of the dentate gyms. This was accomplished by comparing the ability of Example 45 Compound to enhance either short- or long-term increases in the incorporation of BrdU in the dentate gyms (). Animals exposed to orally-delivered Example 45 Compound or vehicle for 30 days were administered a single pulse of BrdU via IP injection. Short-term effects on neuron birth were monitored by sacrificing animals one hour post-BrdU injection, followed by fixation of the tissue, sectioning and immunohistochemical detection of BrdU incorporation into cells localized in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms. Example 45 Compound administration did not lead to an elevation in the level of BrdU-positive cells relative to vehicle in this short-term assay. At one day after BrdU administration both groups still showed no statistically significant differences in number of BrdU+ cells in the dentate gyms. By contrast, at the 5 day time point, by which time 40% of newborn cells in our assay normally die (), animals that received Example 45 Compound showed a statistically significant, 25% increase in BrdU+ cells compared to the vehicle-only control group. This difference between groups progressed with time such that mice that received a daily oral dose of Example 45 Compound for 30 days starting 24 hours after the pulse treatment of BrdU exhibited a 5-fold increase in the abundance of BrdU-positive cells in the dentate gyms relative to vehicle-only controls. Notably, in this longer-term trial, BrdU-positive cells were observed not only along the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms where new neurons are known to be born, but also within the granular layer itself We hypothesize that these cells represent mature neurons that have migrated into the granular layer, completed the differentiation process, and incorporated themselves into the dentate gyms as properly wired neurons. Observations supportive of this interpretation will be presented in a subsequent section of this document. In summary, these experiments give evidence that Example 45 Compound enhances the formation of neurons in the mature hippocampus, and that its mode of action would appear to take place at some point subsequent to their birth.","Mice lacking both copies of the gene encoding neuronal PAS domain protein 3 (NPAS3) suffer a profound impairment in adult neurogenesis (Pieper et al., 2005). By evaluating BrdU incorporation in a short-term assay of neurogenesis by sacrificing animals 1 hours after BrdU pulse, it was observed that NPAS3-deficient animals have no detectable deficit in the birth of neurons in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms (). This is in contrast to our earlier observations of profoundly diminished BrdU labeling in the dentate gyms of NPAS3-deficient animals when BrdU is administered for a longer period of time (12 days) (Pieper et al., 2005). Knowing that the NPAS3 transcription factor is required for proper expression of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) in the hippocampus (Pieper et al., 2005), it is possible that impediments in growth factor signaling might impair the trophic environment critical for the survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyms. As an initial test of this hypothesis, brain tissue prepared from NPAS3-deficient animals was compared with that of wild type littermates for the presence of cleaved caspase 3 (CCSP3)-positive cells in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms. A statistically significant, 2-fold increase in CCSP3-positive (apoptotic) cells was observed in the dentate gyms of NPAS3-deficient animals (). This enhanced rate of programmed cell death is likely to account, at least in part, for the nearly complete elimination of adult neurogenesis in mice lacking the NPAS3 transcription factor (Pieper et al., 2005).","In addition to this quantitative deficit in adult neurogenesis, we have observed abnormalities in both the morphology and electrophysiology of granular neurons of the dentate gyms of NPAS3-deficient animals. Relative to wild type animals, Golgi-Cox staining revealed severe attenuation in dendritic branching and spine density of dentate gyms granular neurons of NPAS3-deficient animals (and ). By contrast, no genotype-dependent differences in these measures were observed in pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Equivalently specific deficits were observed by electrophysiologic recordings of NPAS3-deficient animals compared with wild type littermates (and ). Whole field recordings of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) revealed significant deficits in NPAS3-deficient animals, relative to wild type littermates. In the dentate gyms, stimulating and recording electrodes were positioned in the outer molecular layer, which is innervated by axons of the perforant pathway originating from the entorhinal cortex. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, stimulation and recording electrodes were positioned in the stratum radiatum, which is innervated by the Schaffer collateral axons of CA3 pyramidal cells. Stimulus intensity was increased in 5 \u03bcA increments, the slope of the decreasing part of field potentials was measured, and fEPSP was quantified relative to the amplitude of the fiber volley, which represents firing of action potentials in pre-synaptic axons. This analysis revealed aberrant hyper-excitability of synaptic transmission in npas3 mice both in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyms and in the CA1 region (and ).","Armed with these genotype- and region-specific deficits in both neuron morphology and electrophysiological activity, we set out to test whether prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound might favorably repair either deficit in NPAS3-deficient animals. Before embarking on this effort, we first confirmed that Example 45 Compound was capable of enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis in NPAS3-deficient mice, by demonstrating that Example 45 Compound enhances both BrdU incorporation as well as expression of doublecortin in newborn neurons in the dentate gyms of npas3 mice (). Knowing that formation of the dentate gyms initiates in the late pre-natal mouse embryo around embryonic day 14 (Stanfield and Cowan, 1988), we sought to expose animals to Example 45 Compound for as extended a period of time as possible in order to give the compound the best possible chance for exhibiting favorable effects. Following oral gavage of pregnant female mice, 14 day embryos were recovered, dissected and processed by acetonitrile:water extraction so that Example 45 Compound levels could be measured in the embryonic brain. Daily administration of 20 mg\/kg of Example 45 Compound to pregnant females yielded appreciable levels of the compound in the brain tissue of developing embryos. It was similarly observed that oral administration of the compound to lactating females led to delivery of Example 45 Compound to the brain tissue of weanling pups. In both cases, LC\/MS-based quantitation of Example 45 Compound revealed levels of compound accumulation at or above the 1.35 \u03bcM limit required to support adult neurogenesis (). Finally, it was observed that daily IP administration of Example 45 Compound to weaned pups at 20 mg\/kg was sufficient to yield brain levels of Example 45 Compound at or above the level required to enhance adult neurogenesis.","Female mice heterozygous at the NPAS3 locus were mated to heterozygous males. Two weeks post-mating, females were given a daily oral gavage of either 20 mg\/kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle-only formula. Dosing was continued throughout the last trimester of pregnancy, as well as the two week post-natal period of lactation. Following weaning, pups were given a daily IP dose of either 20 mg\/kg Example 45 Compound or vehicle control. At about 7 weeks of age, mice were switched to oral gavage delivery of the same dose of Example 45 Compound. When mice were 3 months of age they were sacrificed and brain tissue was dissected and subjected to either Golgi-Cox staining or electrophysiological recording. As shown in , prolonged exposure to Example 45 Compound robustly repaired morphological deficits in the dendritic branching of granular neurons of the dentate gyms in NPAS3-deficient mice. Moreover, as shown in , the electrophysiological deficit in the dentate gyms of NPAS3-deficient mice was also corrected following prolonged exposure of mice to Example 45 Compound. The corresponding electrophysiological deficit in CA1 region of the hippocampus, however, was not affected (), underscoring the specificity of Example 45 Compound to improving functioning of the dentate gyms in this animal model.","It is also notable that, relative to vehicle-only controls, administration of Example 45 Compound did not affect any aspect of the health of mothers, embryos, weanlings or young adult mice. Gross histology of brain tissue was normal in both compound- and vehicle-treated animals, and there was no evidence of neuronal cell loss or degenerative changes (cytoplasmic eosinophilia, vacuolization or nuclear pyknosis). The only morphological change, other than normalization of dendritic arborization of granular neurons of the dentate gyms, was a compound-dependent increase in the thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyms itself (). The thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyms is roughly 40% less in NPAS3-deficient animals than wild type littermates. Prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound through late embryonic development, early post-natal development, and two months post-weaning significantly corrected this deficit without affecting the thickness of other hippocampal layers in NPAS3-deficient mice ().","Recognizing that the reduced thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyms in NPAS3-deficient animals could be attributed to elevated levels of apoptosis of newborn hippocampal neural precursor cells, we examined the effect of Example 45 Compound treatment on apoptosis in the hippocampus of NPAS3-deficient animals through immunohistochemical staining of cleaved caspase 3 (CCSP3). As shown in , 12 days of treatment with orally delivered Example 45 Compound (20 mg\/kg) to adult NPAS3-deficient animals significantly reduced CCSP3 staining in the dentate gyms, whereas vehicle-treatment had not effect. We thereby propose that Example 45 Compound facilitated repair of the granular layer of the dentate gyms in NPAS3-deficient mice by ameliorating a genotype-specific exacerbation of programmed cell death.","Apoptosis is implicated in numerous neurodegenerative disorders, and we wondered if Example 45 Compound might protect mature neurons from programmed cell death. Cultured primary cortical neurons have been shown to undergo apoptosis following exposure to \u03b2-amyloid peptide (Loo et al., 1993). Accordingly, we investigated whether Example 45 Compound might protect cultured neurons from this paradigm of cell death. Cortical neurons from embryonic day 18 rats were allowed to mature for 1 week, exposed to 25 \u03bcM A \u03b2peptide fragment for 48 hours, and then assayed for cell viability by light microscopic visualization as well as the cell titer blue viability assay (Promega), which utilizes the indicator dye resazurin to measure the metabolic activity of cultured cells. As shown in , Example 45 Compound protected cultured primary cortical neurons from A \u03b2-mediated toxicity. Dose response testing revealed that Example 45 Compound did not lose maximal neuroprotective activity even when diluted to low nanomolar levels. Importantly, when the (+) and (\u2212) enantiomers of the methoxy derivative of Example 45 Compound (Example 62 Compound) were tested, neuroprotective activity was observed with the same (+) enantiomer of Example 62 Compound that also retained pro-neurogenic activity in living mice, while the (\u2212) enantiomer again displayed diminished activity","In order to investigate its cellular site of action, example 62 compound was modified by attaching a coumarin moiety to the N-phenyl ring according to established methods (Alexander et al., 2006), yielding a fluorescent derivative designated FASDP (fluorescent, anisidine substituted derivative of Example 45 Compound) (). FASDP was confirmed to retain pro-neurogenic activity in adult mice in our standard assay, and cultured osteoblast cells were exposed to FASDP and visualized by fluorescence optics in a light microscope. As shown in , FASDP labeled cells in a punctuate pattern that overlapped with mitochondria as visualized by Mitotracker dye. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the activity and molecular target of Example 45 Compound may reside within mitochondria.","Extensive evidence pioneered by the laboratory of Xiaodong Wang has shown that an intrinsic pathway leading to programmed cell death emanates from mitochondria (Liu et al., 1996; Yang et al., 1997). With the help of the Wang lab, assays were established to test whether Example 45 Compound might protect mitochondria from calcium-induced dissolution (Distelmaier et al., 2008). Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) is a cell-permeant, cationic red-orange fluorescent dye that is readily sequestered by active mitochondria. When loaded with TMRM dye, vehicle-only treated cells released the dye within 15 minutes of exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187. By contrast, dye release was prevented in cells exposed to as little as 10 ng of Example 45 Compound (). As with in vivo neurogenesis assay, as well as the in vitro protection from A\u03b2-mediated toxicity of cultured cortical neurons, preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential in this assay was observed only with the (+) enantiomer of Example 62 Compound ().","A chemical compound sharing structural similarity to Example 45 Compound is 2,3,4,5-Tetrahydro-2,8-dimethyl-5-(2-(6-methyl-3-pyridyl)ethyl)-1H-pyrido(4,3-b)indole (). An anti-histamine, trade named Dimebon, was anecdotally noticed over the decades to ameliorate symptoms of dementia (O'Brien, 2008; Burns and Jacoby 2008). More recently, an American biotechnology company designated Medivation initiated clinical trials to formally test whether Dimebon might improve the symptoms of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The results of FDA-sponsored, phase 2 clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease were recently published, reporting favorable response rates (Doody et al., 2008). Example 45 Compound and Dimebon were compared in three functional assays. The in vivo test for effects on hippocampal neurogenesis revealed activity for both compounds, with Example 45 Compound exhibiting between 10- and 30-fold higher level of potency and a ceiling of efficacy roughly 40% higher than the anti-histamine drug (). Dimebon has previously been reported to protect cortical neurons from A\u03b2-mediated toxicity (Bachurin et al., 2001). As shown in , Dimebon only afforded protection at doses of 3 \u03bcM. Example 45 Compound did not lose neuroprotective activity even when diluted to low nanomolar levels. Dimebon has also been implicated in protecting mitochondria (Bachurin et al., 2003). We therefore compared Dimebon with Example 45 Compound in the calcium-induced mitochondrial dissolution assay. Both compounds were observed to be active, and it was again observed that the relative potency of Example 45 Compound was superior to Dimebon (). Protection of mitochondrial membrane permeability was lost for Example 45 Compound between the 10 and 1 nM doses, whereas that of Dimebon was lost between 10 and 1 \u03bcM.","Example 45 Compound and Dimebon were tested for binding to the H1 histamine receptor. While Dimebon displayed high affinity for this receptor (IC50<100 nM), both enantiomers of Example 45 Compound display low H1 affinity (IC50>10 \u03bcM.","We turned to aged Fisher rats as a means of performing behavioral tests capable of assessing the potential benefits of Example 45 Compound on hippocampus-dependent learning. It is well established that normal rodent aging is associated with attenuation of hippocampal neurogenesis (Kuhn et al., 1996, Driscoll et al., 2006). Reduced neurogenesis in aged rats is likely related to increased neuronal apoptosis in the aged rat brain (Martin et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2010). These changes have been hypothesized to contribute to cognitive decline as a function of terminal aging. We first evaluated whether Example 45 Compound would enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in aged rats as it does in adult mice. Rats were injected with a daily, IP dose of either 10 mg\/kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle, coinjected with a daily dose of BrdU, and then sacrificed after 7 days for immunohistochemistry. As shown in , compound-treated animals revealed a 500% increase in BrdU labeling in the dentate gyms relative to vehicle-treated controls. Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to doublecortin likewise revealed a robust, compound-specific enrichment in this marker of newborn neurons. Having observed proneurogenic efficacy of Example 45 Compound in this short term assay, we then tested whether prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound might ameliorate age-related decline in cognition by subjecting 18-month-old rats to daily administration of either i 0 mg\/kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle only for 2 months. Animals of both groups were further subjected to weekly IP administration of BrdU (50 mg\/kg) for later immunohistochemical measurements of hippocampal neurogenesis. As a control, both Example 45 Compound- and vehicle-treated groups were confirmed to display equal ability to physically participate in the task, and learn the task, as shown by decreased latency times to find the hidden platform over the 5 day training period, both before and after 2 months of treatment (). Moreover, neither swim speed () nor locomotor activity () varied with age or treatment paradigm. After 2 months of compound or vehicle administration, cognitive ability was assessed blind to treatment group by removing the goal platform. Animals of the Example 45 Compound-treated group retained a statistically significant improvement in ability to navigate to the region of the missing platform, as evidenced by performance in the probe test. As shown in , when the platform was removed from the maze, rats treated with Example 45 Compound crossed the precise location previously containing the platform significantly more often than vehicle-treated rats. Furthermore, Example 45 Compound-treated rats spent a higher percentage of time in the general goal area, defined as the quadrant previously containing the platform, than vehicle-treated rats (35.5%\u00b12.2% for Example 45 Compound treated, 28.1%\u00b12.6% for vehicle treated, Student's t Test, p<0.02).","After behavioral testing, animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemical detection of BrdU and CCSP3. As shown in , the dentate gyms of rats exposed to Example 45 Compound showed a 3-fold higher level of BrdU-positive neurons than that of the vehicle group. Moreover, Example 45 Compound-treated animals showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of CCSP3-positive cells relative to vehicle controls (). Unexpectedly, administration of Example 45 Compound helped rats maintain stable body weight with aging, in contrast to vehicle-treated rats, whose weight declined steadily with age (). Example 45 Compound-mediated effects on body weight were independent of food intake (), and treatment of aged rats with Example 45 Compound had no effect on postfasting blood glucose levels (). It will be of interest to determine whether Example 45 Compound-mediated preservation of body weight in aged rats operates via central or peripheral modes of action.","Knowing that P7C3 ameliorates the death of newborn neurons in the dentate gyms in living mice, we wondered whether its function might relate to mitochondrial integrity. Assays were established to test whether P7C3 might protect cultured U2OS cells from calcium-induced mitochondrial dissolution (Distelmaier et al., 2008). Tetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM) dye is sequestered by active mitochondria, and, when loaded with TMRM, vehicle-treated cells released the dye within 15 rain of exposure to the calcium ionophor A23187. By contrast, dye release was fully prevented in cells exposed to as little as 10 nM of P7C3 (). Compound loaown to be inactive in vivo were also inactive in this assay (). Preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential in this assay was observed for the R-enantiomer of one compound (B), but not the S-enantiomer (C). Finally, protection of mitochondrial membrane permeability was observed at an enhanced level for a compound variant, which also exhibited a high level of proneurogenic activity (). Example 45 Compound, but not an inactive compound, was also capable of preserving mitochondrial integrity in cultured primary cortical neurons ().","Recognizing that reduced thickness of the npas3dentate gyms granular layer could be attributed to increased apoptosis of proliferating neural precursor cells, we examined the effect of Example 45 Compound treatment on apoptosis in the hippocampus of npas3mice through immunohistochemical staining of CCSP3. After 12 days of orally delivered Example 45 Compound (20 mg\/kg) to adult npas3\u2212\/\u2212 mice, a statistically significant reduction in CCSP3 staining was observed in the dentate gyms. We thereby propose that Example 45 Compound facilitates repair of the granular layer of the dentate gyms in npas3mice by overcoming a genotype-specific enhancement in apoptosis.","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/143,755, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the invention. A \u201clower alkyl\u201d or \u201clower alkylene\u201d is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms.","The terms \u201calkoxy,\u201d \u201calkylamino\u201d and \u201calkylthio\u201d (or thioalkoxy) are used in their conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur atom, respectively.","The term \u201cheteroalkyl,\u201d by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of the stated number of carbon atoms and from one to three heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N and S may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group.

Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, \u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014OCHand \u2014CH\u2014O\u2014Si(CH).","Similarly, the term \u201cheteroalkylene,\u201d by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified by \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014S\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014 and \u2014CH\u2014S\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014CH\u2014. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied.","The terms \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d and \u201cheterocycloalkyl\u201d, by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of \u201calkyl\u201d and \u201cheteroalkyl\u201d, respectively. Accordingly, a cycloalkyl group has the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., C3-C8 means three to eight carbons) and may also have one or two double bonds. A heterocycloalkyl group consists of the number of carbon atoms designated and from one to three heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like.

Additionally, terms such as \u201chaloalkyl,\u201d are meant to include alkyl substituted with halogen atoms, which can be the same or different, in a number ranging from one to (2m\u2032+1), where m\u2032 is the total number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group. For example, the term \u201chalo(C1-C4)alkyl\u201d is mean to include trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like. Thus, the term \u201chaloalkyl\u201d includes monohaloalkyl (alkyl substituted with one halogen atom) and polyhaloalkyl (alkyl substituted with halogen atoms in a number ranging from two to (2m\u2032+1) halogen atoms, where m\u2032 is the total number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group). The term \u201cperhaloalkyl\u201d means, unless otherwise stated, alkyl substituted with (2m\u2032+1) halogen atoms, where m\u2032 is the total number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group. For example the term \u201cperhalo(C1-C4)alkyl\u201d is meant to include trifluoromethyl, pentachloroethyl, 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-bromo-2-chloroethyl and the like.","The term \u201cacyl\u201d refers to those groups derived from an organic acid by removal of the hydroxy portion of the acid. Accordingly, acyl is meant to include, for example, acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, decanoyl, pivaloyl, benzoyl and the like.","The term \u201caryl\u201d means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, typically aromatic, hydrocarbon substituent which can be a single ring or multiple rings (up to three rings) which are fused together or linked covalently. Non-limiting examples of aryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene.","The term heteroaryl,\u201d refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from zero to four heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of heteroaryl groups include 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl and 6-quinolyl.","For brevity, the term \u201caryl\u201d when used in combination with other terms (e.g., aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term \u201carylalkyl\u201d is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (e.g., a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (e.g., phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).","Each of the above terms (e.g., \u201calkyl,\u201d \u201cheteroalkyl,\u201d \u201caryl\u201d and \u201cheteroaryl\u201d) is meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred substituents for each type of radical are provided below.","Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (as well as those groups referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl and heterocycloalkenyl) can be a variety of groups selected from: \u2014OR\u2032, \u2550O, \u2550NR\u2032, \u2550N\u2014OR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014SR\u2032, halogen, \u2014SiR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014OC(O)R\u2032, \u2014C(O)R\u2032, \u2014COR\u2032, \u2014CONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014OC(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032\u2014C(O)NR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014NR\u2032\u2014SONR\u2032\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033COR\u2032, \u2014NH\u2014C(NH)\u2550NH, \u2014NR\u2032C(NH)\u2550NH, \u2014NH\u2014C(NH)\u2550NR\u2032, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014SOR\u2032, \u2014SONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033SOR, \u2014CN and \u2014NO, in a number ranging from zero to three, with those groups having zero, one or two substituents being particularly preferred.

When R\u2032 and R\u2033 are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6- or 7-membered ring. For example, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 is meant to include 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. Typically, an alkyl or heteroalkyl group will have from zero to three substituents, with those groups having two or fewer substituents being preferred in the invention. More preferably, an alkyl or heteroalkyl radical will be unsubstituted or monosubstituted. Most preferably, an alkyl or heteroalkyl radical will be unsubstituted. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term \u201calkyl\u201d is meant to include groups such as trihaloalkyl (e.g., \u2014CFand \u2014CHCF).","Preferred substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals are selected from: \u2014OR\u2032, \u2550O, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014SR\u2032, halogen, \u2014SiR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014OC(O)R\u2032, \u2014C(O)R\u2032, \u2014COR\u2032, \u2014CONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014OC(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2033COR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032\u2014SONR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014SOR\u2032, \u2014SONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033SOR, \u2014CN and \u2014NO, where R\u2032 and R\u2033 are as defined above.

The substituent R\u2032 in \u2014NR\u2032\u2014 and \u2014S(O)NR\u2032\u2014 is selected from hydrogen or unsubstituted (C1-C6)alkyl."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0342","num":"0894"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0343","num":"0895"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0344","num":"0896"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0345","num":"0897"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0346","num":"0898"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0347","num":"0899"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C"],"sup":["e","e"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0348","num":"0900"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0349","num":"0901"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0350","num":"0902"},"figref":["FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B","FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0351","num":"0903"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0352","num":"0904"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0353","num":"0905"},"figref":["FIG. 12A","FIG. 12B","FIG. 12A"],"b":"12","sup":"\u2212\/\u2212 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0354","num":"0906"},"figref":["FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B"],"sup":["\u2212\/\u2212 ","\u2212\/\u2212 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0355","num":"0907"},"figref":"FIG. 14","sup":["\u2212\/\u2212","\u2212\/\u2212","\u2212\/\u2212"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0356","num":"0908"},"figref":"FIG. 15","sup":"\u2212\/\u2212"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0357","num":"0909"},"figref":"FIG. 16","sup":"\u2212\/\u2212 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0358","num":"0910"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0359","num":"0911"},"figref":"FIG. 18","sub":"(25-35) "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0360","num":"0912"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0361","num":"0913"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0362","num":"0914"},"figref":["FIG. 21A","FIG. 21B","FIG. 21A","FIG. 21B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0363","num":"0915"},"figref":["FIG. 22A","FIG. 22B","FIG. 22C","FIG. 22D","FIG. 22A","FIG. 22B","FIG. 22C","FIG. 22D"],"sub":"(25-35)"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0364","num":"0916"},"figref":["FIG. 23A","FIG. 23B","FIG. 23C","FIG. 23D","FIG. 23E","FIG. 23A","FIG. 23B","FIG. 23C","FIG. 23D","FIG. 23E","FIG. 23E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0365","num":"0917"},"figref":["FIG. 24A","FIG. 24B","FIG. 24C","FIG. 24D","FIG. 24A","FIG. 24B","FIG. 24C","FIG. 24D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0366","num":"0918"},"figref":["FIG. 25A","FIG. 25B","FIG. 25C","FIG. 25D","FIG. 25E","FIG. 25F","FIG. 25A","FIG. 25B","FIG. 25C","FIG. 25D","FIG. 25E","FIG. 25F"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0367","num":"0919"},"figref":"FIG. 26"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
