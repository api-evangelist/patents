title: Method for call answering in a distributed communications system
abstract: A method for call answering in a distributed communications system having a plurality of communications devices, in which a subscriber can be registered on communications terminals associated with the communications devices in the distributed communications system. In this case, incoming calls are allocated to the communications terminals according to prescribable criteria. If a subscriber called by an incoming call is not available, an announcement function is performed which prompts activation of an announcement on a central communications device in the distributed communications system.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application is based on and hereby claims priority to German Application No. 101 322 62.3 filed on Jul. 4, 2001, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","A distributed communications system comprises a plurality of interconnected communications devices (e.g. call processing devices such as telecommunications installations or else data processing devices). Such a distributed communications system normally has one or more connections to public communications networks. Connection requests relating to a called subscriber within the distributed communications system are switched to the called subsriber's associated communications device on the basis of the dialed destination call number of the called subscriber. This communications device sets up a connection to a terminal associated with the called subscriber. The subscriber is associated with his terminal generally by a destination call number associated with the respective called subscriber.","In modern communications systems, a subscriber is frequently not associated with a terminal by a fixed destination call number, however. Instead, a subscriber logs onto a largely arbitrary communications terminal, e.g. by entering a code number, in order to have connection requests intended for him put through.","This method is found to be particularly advantageous for telephone service centers in which a shared collective call number can be used to reach a group of telephone operatives. In such a case, the selection criterion according to which an incoming call is put through would be the availability of a respective operative in this group, for example.","A mark of today's telecommunications is a convergence of telephony and data processing functions. The organization ECMA (European Computer Manufacturer Association) is therefore working on standards which make it possible to support telephony functions on a data processing workstation. The ECMA standard ECMA-269, 4th edition, June 2000: \u201cServices for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA) Phase III\u201d discloses, by way of example, a method for automatic call distribution, known in the technical field by the abbreviation ACD. In this context, for \u201cACD Devices Categories\u201d, that is to say physical (devices) or logical (software applications) telecommunications units, characteristic properties are defined which are described in section 6.1.3.4.3 \u201cACD Device Categories\u201d of said standard. Activities taking place between these telecommunications units are managed by \u201cagents\u201d (cf. section 6.1.3.7, \u201cAgent\u201d) using software, an agent representing a telecommunications unit onto which a subscriber has been logged by a logon process.","Telecommunications functions are incorporated within data processing installations by programming interfaces. The best known programming interfaces of this type are TSAPI (Telephony Service Application Programming Interface), TAPI (Telephony Application Programming Interface) and the CSTA standard (\u201cComputer Supported Telecommunication Applications\u201d).","On the basis of the CSTA standard, in the case described above for a telephone service center, subscribers whose terminals are associated with a group are represented by an agent when a logon process has been performed using a registration function. Using this agent, a connection request arriving is distributed according to prescribable criteria, irrespective of the destination call number of the respective terminal. The registration function is in the form of software which is executed during the logon process, e.g. by entry of a code number by the subscriber who is logging on. This identifier is used to associate the subscriber logging on with a group.","The German patent application carrying the file reference 10102174.7 has proposed a method in which a plurality of communications devices in the same communications system are involved in call distribution, a group being able to comprise a plurality of communications devices within the communications system.","In many communications systems, the need arises for an automated call answering function to be provided. In the case of the aforementioned telephone service centers, this automated call answering has, by way of example, the function of informing a calling subscriber that he has been put in a queue and will be connected to the next available operative. On the other hand, automatic call answering can also have the function of informing the calling subscriber about the location of a called subscriber who is not available, and possibly of providing the calling subscriber with the opportunity to record a voice message.","Automated call answering can be managed and set by a subscriber on his terminal. The communications device to which the terminal of this subscriber is connected thus manages the\u2014possibly subscriber-specific\u2014voice message when this subscriber cannot be reached, and stores voice messages left for him. If a communications system contains a network of installations which comprises a plurality of communications devices, then the problem arises that, although a subscriber can log onto an arbitrary terminal on the basis of the German patent application specification's method described above, in which case he is not tied to a communications device associated with him, he is tied to his associated communications device for the purpose of managing his subscriber-specific, automated call answering.","One aspect of the present invention is based on the object of specifying a method which allows communications-device-independent selection of a communications terminal while at the same time having a subscriber-specific call answering function.","According to one aspect of the invention, if a subscriber is not available, an announcement function held on a central communications device in the distributed communications system is activated.","A fundamental advantage of the method can be seen in the localization of the announcement on a central communications device, which allows simple management of the announcement information for all the subscribers in the distributed communications system.","Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","20","12","14","16","18","12","14","40","28","30","30","10","30"]},"The communications devices , ,  each have automatic call distribution functions in \u201cgroup programs\u201d , ,  which operate on the basis of the ACD functions (Automatic Call Distribution) of the ECMA standard ECMA-269 and are denoted in the drawing by ACD-A, ACD-B, ACD-C. As will be readily apparent, the communications devices , ,  act as switches.","The data processing installation  is in the form of a personal computer (PC) containing a memory unit\u2014not shown\u2014and a central processor\u2014not shown. The memory unit stores an application program  which contains, inter alia, functions for call distribution and for monitoring the messages interchanged in the communications system . The application program  uses a TAPI software interface  (Telecommunication Application Programming Interface) to communicate with a TSP program  (TAPI Service Provider). The TSP program  performs two-way conversion of TAPI commands and CSTA commands (Computer Supported Telecommunication Applications). On the basis of these CSTA commands, the communications units , ,  and the data processing installation  communicate with one another via the data transmission network .","To denote physical or functional categories, \u201cdevices\u201d, identifiers D to D (\u201cdevice\u201d) are used which are used firstly to refer to the respective unit and secondly as identification numbers for software implementation. The line unit  for connecting the line  to the communications device  has an associated identifier D, and the group program  for this communications device  has the associated identifier D. An interface  for this communications device  to the data transmission network  has the associated identifier D, and the interface  for the communications device  to the data transmission network  has the identifier D. A central announcement unit  associated with the communications device  has the identifier D. A terminal  connected to the communications device  has the associated identifier D.","In another embodiment (not shown), it is possible to implement the central announcement unit  as a software module located in the memory unit of the data processing installation , for example.","Connected to the communications devices ,  are a multiplicity of terminals , , , , of which two terminals , ; ,  are respectively shown for the two communications devices , . The terminals ,  connected to the communications device  can be reached using a shared collective call number, i.e. incoming calls are forwarded to one of the terminals , , ,  by the call distribution function of the application program  according to criteria\u2014which are explained in more detail.","A subscriber can log onto an arbitrary terminal by entering an individual identification number ID. A logged-on subscriber is thus involved in automatic call distribution by virtue of calls being put through to the terminal on which he is logged on. The subscriber logged onto the terminal  uses an identification number ID with the value \u201c100\u201d, the subscriber logged onto the terminal  uses an identification number ID with the value \u201c101\u201d, the subscriber logged onto the terminal  uses an identification number ID with the value \u201c110\u201d, and finally the subscriber logged onto the terminal  uses an identification number ID with the value \u201c111\u201d.","A call \u2014shown in the drawing by a dash-dot arrow\u2014arriving on the communications terminal  is forwarded to the central announcement unit  having the identifier D by the call distribution function of the group program  if a called subscriber logged onto the terminal  with the identification number ID  is not available. In the drawing, this forwarding  is shown by a dash-dot arrow.","The telecommunications units , , and  and the data processing installation  communicate with one another using messages based on the CSTA standard which are interchanged via the local data transmission network  using an IP-based (Internet Protocol) transmission protocol, for example. On the basis of the ECMA standard ECMA-269, 4th edition, June 2000, section 11 (\u201cTemplate Descriptions\u201d), these messages are divided into function-calling services and events, which each have identifying arguments (parameters).","To control the switching technology, the \u201ccall control\u201d event messages and the associated service messages are used, in particular, which are described in ECMA standard ECMA-269, 4th edition, June 2000, section 17 (\u201cCall Control Services & Events\u201d). To control the agent states, the \u201cLogical Device Features\u201d event messages and the associated service messages from section 22 (\u201cLogical Device Features\u201d) of said standard are used. Announcements are controlled using \u201cVoice Unit\u201d event messages and associated service messages in line with section 26 (\u201cVoice Unit Services & Events\u201d) of said standard.","Interchange of CSTA messages for the purpose of implementing the method is explained in more detail below with further reference to the functional units in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A","b":["2","2","2","22","40","32","27","50","1","2","5","6","100","102","104","106","108","22","40","32","27","50","1","2","5","6","100","108"]},"It will be assumed that a subscriber has logged onto the terminal  having the code number D, in which case he has entered his identification number ID with the value \u201c100\u201d in the course of the logon process.

This is done using the CSTA message \u201cMonitor Start\u201d described in said ECMA standard, section 15 (\u201cMonitoring Services\u201d). On the basis of the monitoring function initiated by the \u201cMonitor Start\u201d service, the application program  can track the operations in the telecommunications units (\u201cdevices\u201d) involved in the monitoring, that is to say the line unit , the group program , the announcement module  and the terminal .
