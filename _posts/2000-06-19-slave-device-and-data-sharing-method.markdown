Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a slave device, and more particularly, to a slave device which is connected to a host device and shares a storage device with the host device.","2. Description of the Related Art","As memories, particularly, non-volatile memories such as flash memories, increase in capacity and decrease in size, the memory capacity of peripheral equipment such as digital cameras, MP3 players, music video players and portable data terminals tends to increase. Moreover, in the case where an image taken by a digital camera is downloaded to a host device such as a personal computer, or the case where an MP3 file stored in a host device is transmitted to an MP3 player, data stored in the storage device of a terminal must be shared with a host.","Hereinafter, a computer device is referred to as a host device, and devices such as terminals, zip drives, MP3 players and digital still cameras that are connected to the host device are referred to as slave devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"]},"For example, a digital camera is connected to a personal computer by a serial type of coupling device. Image data stored in the storage device of the digital camera is read by the personal computer using an application program, which is provided by a digital camera manufacturing company for the connection between a digital camera and a personal computer. In other words, the host device has application program for a corresponding slave device in order to share data with the storage device of the slave device. Accordingly, conventional technology is disadvantageous in that a host device must have an application program which is exclusively used with a corresponding slave device in order to share the storage device of the slave device. In addition, conventional technology has a problem in that it is difficult to use a universal application program when a host device shares the storage devices of a plurality of slave devices.","To solve the above problem, a first object of the present invention is to provide a slave device with a storage device, in which data in the storage device can be shared by a host device using a universal application program.","A second object of the present invention is to provide a host device having a file system which allows the host device to share data in the storage device of a slave device.","A third object of the present invention is to provide a data sharing method for sharing the storage device of a slave device using a universal application program.","To achieve the first object of the invention, there is provided a slave device which has a storage device and is connected to a host device through predetermined coupling means. The slave device includes a media driver for performing connection to a file system of the host device according to a predetermined protocol such that at least part of the storage device operates as a storage device of the host device.","Preferably, the media driver includes a control and error correction unit for controlling the storage device and detecting and correcting errors.","Preferably, the control and error correction unit includes a predetermined protocol layer for performing connection to a control and error correction unit of the host device.","Preferably, the media driver also includes a logical-to-physical converter for converting logical location information used by the file system into physical location information.","Preferably, the logical-to-physical converter includes a predetermined protocol layer for performing connection to a logical-to-physical converter of the host device.","Preferably, the media driver also includes a file system driver for abstracting data stored in the storage device of the slave device to allow application programs to access the data as a file using the logical location information.","Preferably, the file system driver includes a predetermined protocol layer for performing connection to a file system driver of the host device.","To achieve the second object of the invention, there is provided a host device connected to a slave device having a storage device through a predetermined coupling device.

In the drawings, the same reference numerals denote the same member.","Referring to , a slave device  according to the present invention includes a storage device  and a media driver . The media driver  of the slave device  is connected to a file system  of a host device  by a predetermined coupling device.","The media driver  performs connection to the file system  of the host device  according to a predetermined protocol. Since the storage device  of the slave device  is connected to the file system  of the host device  via the media driver , at least part of the storage device  of the slave device  operates as a storage device of the host device  when a universal application program is used.","The media driver  of the slave device  has a logical protocol architecture for performing connection according to the predetermined protocol. The protocol architecture included in the media driver  of the slave device  may vary with the ability of the slave device . In other words, a procedure of connection to the host device  varies with the protocol architecture within the media driver  of the slave device . Accordingly, the file system  of the host device  preferably includes a top layer identification unit (not shown) for identifying the top layer of the slave device  when initialization for connection with the slave device is performed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["224","22","36","222","204","20","22","30","32","204","34","222","202"],"i":["a ","a "]},"In this case, the slave device  is logically connected to the host device  according to a predetermined protocol between the control and error correction layer  of the slave device  and the control and error correction layer  of the host device .

Preferably, the file system selectively includes one or more protocol layers among a control and error correction layer for detecting and correcting errors, a L-P conversion layer for converting logical location information used by the file system into physical location information, and a file system drive layer for abstracting data stored in the storage device of the slave device to allow application programs to access the data as a file using the logical location information. It is preferable that protocol layers including the top layer and other lower layers are selectively included in the file system. The file system of the host device may be realized as a driver program. If the protocol architectures in all slave and host devices are unified, storage devices in all slaves can be accessed using a single host device driver program regardless of the function of a slave device.","With reference to , a data sharing method between a host device and a slave device according to the present invention will be described. First, a slave device is physically connected to a host device through a predetermined coupling device in step . Next, it is preferable to identify the top layer of the slave device in step . Then, connection between the top layer of the slave device and the file system of the host device is performed according to a predetermined protocol such that at least part of the storage device of the slave device can operate as the storage device of the host device, and the host device accesses the storage device of the slave device via the file system of the host device, the top layer of the slave device and the bottom layer of the slave device.","If the top layer of the slave device is identified as a control and error correction layer which detects and corrects errors in step , connection is performed according to a predetermined protocol between the control and error correction layer, which controls the storage device and detects and corrects errors, of the host device and the control and error correction layer of the slave device in step .","If the top layer of the slave device is identified as a L-P conversion layer which converts logical location information used by a file system into physical location information in step , connection is performed according to a predetermined protocol between the L-P conversion layer, which converts logical location information used by a file system into physical location information, of the host device and the L-P conversion layer of the slave device in step .","If the top layer of the slave device is identified as a file system drive layer which abstracts data stored in the storage device to allow application programs to access the data as a file using logical location information in step , connection is performed according to a predetermined protocol between the file system drive layer of the host device and the file system drive layer of the slave device in step .","Thereafter, the host device accesses the storage device of the slave device via a layer path of the file system drive layer of the host device through the control and error correction layer of the slave device in step .","According to the present invention, at least part of the storage device of the slave device operates as the storage device of the host device when a universal application program is used. In other words, since the storage device within the slave device is regarded as the storage device of the host device, an application program can be made using a standardized application programming interface (API) for use of ordinary files. Therefore, the present invention facilitates formation of an application program and allows formation of an independent application program regardless of the type of slave device. In addition, according to the present invention, files, which are not related to the function of the slave device, can be stored in the storage device of the slave device to carry the files, and those files can be conveniently processed by a host system.","As described above, according to the present invention, a storage device within a slave device is regarded as the storage device of a host device, so that an application program can be easily made using a standardized application programming interface, and the storage device of the slave device can be shared by the host device using a universal application."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above objects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent by describing in detail preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the attached drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIGS. 3 through 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
