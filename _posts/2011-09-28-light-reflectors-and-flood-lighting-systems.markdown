For example, faceted reflectors used as surgical lights illuminate the specific area of surgical importance for the surgeon; faceted reflectors illuminate the road surface for an automobile driver without directing light into the line of sight of the in-coming traffic.","Rigorous mathematical algorithms and computational modeling have been used to increase the uniformity of the singular patch and to improve the sharpness of the border between the singular patch of light and the background. Additionally, reflector designs have been conventionally used for side, flood illumination of parking facilities, such as parking lot or garages. These reflector designs generally include a geometric housing, i.e., parabolic, elliptical, etc. These conventional designs have proven to be highly useful and efficient both energetically and economically. However, the illumination distribution created by these geometric housings is quite limited. As a result, several geometric housings must be incorporated and properly aligned for illuminating a given area to achieve required illumination distribution. Again, there is room for improvement in the field of side, flood illumination reflector design, as well as more generally in the field of light reflectors and flood lighting systems.","In one embodiment, a light reflector includes a housing having a body with a plurality of facets. Each facet has a shape that is a portion of one of a plurality of ellipses sharing a common focus. The first and second surfaces are formed by first and second planes intersecting along a line within a volume of the body. The housing is arranged relative to the light source so that the light source is positioned near the first surface and at the common focus. The housing is angularly oriented relative to the light source such that a majority of light emitted by the light source is directed into the housing, reflected by at least one of the facets, and exits the light reflector out of either the first surface or the second surface.","In another embodiment, a flood lighting system is provided for illuminating a surface. The flood lighting system includes a plurality of light sources and a plurality of light reflectors. Each light reflector includes a housing having a body having a plurality of facets. Each facet has a shape that is a portion of one of a plurality of ellipses sharing a common focus. First and second surfaces are formed by first and second planes intersecting along a line within a volume of the body. One of the light sources is positioned near the first surface, at the common focus, and is angularly oriented relative to the respective housing such that a majority of light emitted by the light source is directed into the housing, reflected by at least one of the facets, and exits the light reflector out of one of the first or second surfaces. The flood lighting system is mounted at a distance from the surface.","In another embodiment, the body of the light reflector may include a free-form surface that is generated as the best fit to the plurality of facets. A free-form surface is used in CAD and other computer graphics software to describe the skin of a three-dimensional geometric element. A free-form surface lacks rigid radial dimensions in contrast to regular surfaces. One approach for generated a free-form surface is lofting, which may involve the interpolation of a set of curves or a set of multiply-connected by a smooth surface and may involve the use of splines as a mathematical solution.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","12","14","12","14"]},"Along the major axis  are two points, or foci , , that are offset from a center  of the major axis . The foci ,  are those points along the major axis  where the sum of the distances from any point along the boundary of the ellipse  to the foci ,  is constant.","Another inherent feature of the foci ,  that is known to those of ordinary skill in the art of optics is that a beam of light leaving one focus  will be reflected at the boundary of the ellipse  in a direction toward the other focus . In other words, light emitted from a point light source positioned at first focus  would be internally reflected by the ellipse and creates an aberration-free image at the second focus . With this feature in mind, and with reference to , the mechanics of a multifaceted reflector may be seen.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["22","24","26","28","30","32","34","36","24","26","28","38","30","30","24","26","28","32","34","36","24","26","28","40","42","44","38","32","34","36","46","24","26","28","22","46","46","30"]},"It would be understood that adjustments to the length of minor axis  () of each of the three ellipses , ,  may affect the area of reflection on the surface of the ellipse , ,  and thus the amount of the reflected light that is incident onto the common plane  at the respective second focus , , .","It would also be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the number of points of light to be generated on the common plane  would be equal to the number of ellipses , ,  comprising the ellipse system .","The ellipse system  may be modeled on a computing system. Briefly, an initial ellipse system  and an initial set of parameters characterizing the ellipse system  are established, where the ellipse system  is comprised of a plurality of ellipses , ,  all sharing the common focus . While the size of each of the plurality of ellipses , ,  comprising the initial ellipse system  may be arbitrarily established, initial parameters of each of the plurality of ellipses , , , for example, the minor axis  of each, are selected to establish a parametric baseline in order to reduce computational time. An initial reflector geometry is then generated from the initial parameters of this initial ellipse system .

In a specific embodiment, the operating system  may be a Unix-like operating system, such as Linux. The memory  may also include at least one application , or other software program, configured to execute in combination with the operating system  and perform a task. It will be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art that other operating systems may be used, such as Windows, MacOS, or Unix-based operating systems, for example, Red Hat, Debian, Debian GNU\/Linux, etc.","In general, the routines executed to implement the embodiments of the invention, whether implemented as part of an operating system or a specific application, component, algorithm, program, object, module or sequence of instructions, or even a subset thereof, will be referred to herein as \u201ccomputer program code\u201d or simply \u201cprogram code.\u201d Program code typically comprises one or more instructions that are resident at various times in memory and storage devices in a computer, and that, when read and executed by at least one processor in a computer, cause that computer to perform the steps necessary to execute steps or elements embodying the various aspects of the invention.","Various program code described hereinafter may be identified based upon the application or software component within which it is implemented in specific embodiments of the invention. However, it should be appreciated that any particular program nomenclature that follows is merely for convenience; and thus, the invention should not be limited to use solely in any specific application identified and\/or implied by such nomenclature. Furthermore, given the typically endless number of manners in which computer programs may be organized into routines, procedures, methods, modules, objects, and the like, as well as the various manners in which program functionality may be allocated among various software layers that are resident within a typical computer (e.g., operating systems, libraries, Application Programming Interfaces [APIs], applications, applets, etc.), it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the specific organization and allocation of program functionality described herein.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the embodiments of the present invention may also take the form of a computer program product embodied in at least one computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code embodied thereon.","The computer readable storage medium may be an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination thereof, that can contain, or store a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.

Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize that other alternative hardware and\/or software environments may be used without departing from the scope of the invention.","The simulation according to an embodiment of the present invention for modeling of the ellipse system  and for determining a resultant shape of a reflector, and the method for such modeling, will now be described with reference to  and continued reference to . While specific reference to the ellipse system  is made throughout the description of the method embodiment, it would be understood that the reference is merely for convenience of illustrating the method, and the method should not be limited to any particular embodiment of an ellipse system shown or described herein.","In block , an ellipse system and an initial set of parameters for the ellipse system are established, where the ellipse system is comprised of a plurality of ellipses all sharing the common focus. While the size of each of the plurality of ellipses comprising the initial ellipse system may be arbitrarily established, one of ordinary skill in the art would understand how to tailor initial parameters of each of the plurality of ellipses, for example, the minor axis of each, to establish an educated guess in order to reduce computational time. An initial reflector geometry is then generated from the initial parameters of this ellipse system.","In block , parameters of one or more of the plurality of ellipses comprising the ellipse system are iteratively adjusted. Each of the plurality of ellipses has one independent parameter\u2014minor axis  (\u201cb\u201d in ). As far as location of the foci ,  are fixed, the value for the major axis  (\u201ca\u201d in ) should be calculated in accordance with the equation associate with .","In block , a reflector geometry is then re-generated from the parameter-adjusted ellipse system. A resultant distribution map of the light intensity is calculated from the ellipse system profile, in block .","In block , a decision is made as to whether the calculated resultant distribution map of the light intensity is equal to a desired distribution map of the light intensity in terms of two-dimensional shape, image size, illumination uniformity, spot size, and so forth. One of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate that the decision could be extended to accept a light intensity distribution map that is within a specified standard deviation of the desired light intensity distribution map. If the resultant light intensity distribution map is not satisfactorily similar to the desired light intensity distribution map, then the process returns to block  to further iterative adjustments to the ellipse system are made. Otherwise, the modeling ends.","With the calculated resultant light intensity distribution map satisfactorily determined, the shape and parameters of the ellipse system used in calculating the satisfactory resultant light intensity distribution map are used to manufacture a reflector that is capable of generating the light intensity distribution map. In one embodiment, a mold for a reflector may be generated from the light intensity distribution map. In another embodiment, instructions for generating the shape of the reflector may be communicated to a The reflector, which is shown and described in yet greater detail below, is constructed such that an inner surface of the reflector is faceted, the facets being formed from the intersecting surfaces of the plurality of ellipses that are sharing the common focus. As a result, each of the facets has a shape that includes at least a portion of an ellipse that is sharing the common focus.","Parameters of one or more of the plurality of ellipses comprising the initial reflector geometry is iteratively adjusted. Each of the plurality of ellipses has one independent parameter\u2014minor axis  (\u201cb\u201d in ) as location of the second foci , ,  are fixed and the value for the major axis  (\u201ca\u201d in ) should be calculated in accordance with equation on . An adjusted reflector geometry is then generated from the iteratively adjusted ellipse system and a resultant illumination profile is calculated from the adjusted reflector geometry. If the resultant illumination distribution is sufficiently similar to a desired illumination distribution (i.e., within a specific standard deviation), then the adjusted reflector geometry is accepted for construction of the reflector. Otherwise, one or more parameters of one or more of the plurality of ellipses , ,  is further iteratively adjusted and a new reflected geometry generated for similar analysis.","The interactive process of designing a reflector shape involves a software algorithm based on an optical software package, such as LightTools (Optical Research Associates, Inc), used to simulate reflector performance and a CAD software package, such as SolidWorks (Dassault Systems), used to develop a model. The algorithm maintains parameters of a plurality of elliptical shapes and provides logic to build a reflector shape based on these ellipses. A model of the reflector shape may be imported into the optical software package to conduct raytracing, which simulates the intensity distribution on a screen for light coming from the reflector. Based on the results of this optical simulation, parameters of plurality of elliptical shapes can be modified and the process of building a model of reflector shape and testing the reflector shape with the optical software package may be repeated. The interactive design process stops when optical simulation of the light distribution on the screen meets or exceeds the design requirements for the reflector.","With a final reflector geometry satisfactorily determined, the shape and parameters of the ellipse system  used in calculating the final reflector geometry are used to create a mold for manufacturing a reflector body that is capable of generating the desired illumination profile. The reflector body , which is shown and described in yet greater detail below, is constructed such that an inner surface of the reflector is faceted, where the facets are formed from the intersecting surfaces of the plurality of ellipses , ,  sharing a common focus . As a result, each of the facets has a shape that includes at least a portion of an ellipse , ,  that is sharing the common focus .","Manufacture of the reflector body  may be accomplished by filling the mold with a suitable polymeric material (acrylics, polycarbonate, polyesters, polyethylene, and so on) and curing, if necessary. The reflector body  may be constructed simply as a unitary structure from the polymeric material, therefore having minimal costs as compared to conventional imaging and illumination systems having separate lenses and objects. The single unit reflector body  therefore is capable of collecting light from a light source and distributing that light for illumination. The reflector body  may also be formed from a glass or a metal.","Alternative types of technology, such as electroforming and thermoforming, may be used to manufacture the reflector. The reflective surface may also be machined, for example, on diamond single point CNC equipment with Slow Tool Servo capability for cutting and shaping free form surfaces.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B","b":["50","52","50","52","54","56","54","56","50","52","58","60","50","52","50","62","52","52","52","52"]},"An opening  is positioned at the closed end (opposite the cut ends , ) of each reflector body , , though this is not specifically shown in the solid reflector body . The opening  allows a light source to be positioned at the common focus  (). One suitable light source may be a light emitting diode (LED) , such as the one schematically shown in . LEDs  are well known and generally include a cathode (designated with a plus sign +), and anode (designated with a minus sign \u2212), a doped semi-conductor material (not shown), and an epoxy dome . Selection of the doping material determines the color (wave length) emitted by the LED . The light source should be selected to have a relatively small volume from which the light is emitted such that the light may be emitted from the common focus  () and considered to be a point light source. Conventional light sources, such as fluorescent or incandescent light bulbs, are much too large in volume to be considered to be point light sources.","Suitable LEDs  may include those ranging in size of light emitting area from about 1 mm to about 25 mm, but should not be limited to only these sizes. An array of individual LEDs assembled on common base can also be used. Suitable constructions for the LED  include, but are not limited to, a white LED, a color LED, or a multi-color LED, as these constructions are understood. In alternative embodiments, the LED  can be replaced by other types of light sources such as an organic light emitting diode (OLED), a laser diode, an arc lamp, an Ultra High Pressure (UHP) lamp, a high-intensity discharge (HID), etc.","In some embodiments it may be advantageous to eliminate the distinct, abrupt boundaries between adjacent facets  of the hollow reflector body  (, B) which in actuality may present themselves as a small radius at the vertex boundary.  illustrate one manner of smoothing the inner surface  of the hollow reflector body  of .  is a model  is created of the hollow reflector body  () having its surface populated with a specified number of points  per unit of the area along the inner surface  which is shown in greater detail in . A spline curve is then fit through all of the points in each cross-sectional plane. With a sufficient number of points , the inner surface  having facets  is replaced with a smooth free-form surface  of a final reflector body , as shown in , which is generated as the best fit to the plurality of facets . In some embodiments, a lofted surface through all spline lines in all cross-sections may provide optimal results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIGS. 8-10","FIG. 10","FIG. 9"],"b":["50","80","80","50","50","81","50","50","80","80","84","86","84","84","50","84","86","62","80"]},"While not specifically shown, another embodiment of a skew faceted elliptical reflector housing may be constructed from the solid reflector body  (). Accordingly, the first and second surfaces would be a planar surface as opposed to an edge, which was described with reference to the hollow reflector body .","The light source, illustrated in  as the LED  is positioned at the point where all elliptical shapes have common focus and directed toward the reflective surface . In this way, light emitted by the LED  is reflected by the reflective inner surface  and exits via the first and\/or second surfaces , . The LED  may be angularly oriented relative to the reflective inner surface , that is to say, the LED  may be oriented relative to the plane of the first surface , by an angle \u03b1, where angle \u03b1 may range from about 0\u00b0 to about 45\u00b0. This angular orientation and selection of \u03b1 affects the amount of light incident a given area of the inner surface  and, thus, the directionality and intensity of light reflected from the reflector .","Referring still to , the angled intersection between first surface  (Plane A) and second surface  (Plane B) may be selected to customize the amount of light capable of leaving the reflector  in the direction of target (target is not shown in ). For example, with acute angles of intersection (i.e., \u03b2<90\u00b0), the likelihood that reflected light will impact a distal edge  of the reflector  is decreased as compared to obtuse angles (i.e., \u03b2>90\u00b0). However, acute angles may also decrease the total area of the inner surface  that is available for reflecting light. Thus, the selection of \u03b2 should be optimized in the computer model, along with the design of the reflector geometry, described in detail above. Typically, the angle \u03b2 may range from about 90\u00b0 to about 150\u00b0, but in some embodiments, \u03b2 may be as high as about 165\u00b0.","In , the reflector  is rotated such that the position of the LED  relative to the inner surface  is more clearly shown. The LED  is mounted onto a support , which may include a heat sink and electrical connectors (not shown) for operating the LED .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 9","FIG. 11A"],"b":["92","68","62","84","86","80","94"]},"Referring now to , there may be some loss of light  (illustrated in green) through direct light leaving the reflector  without interference with the reflecting inner surface (not shown in ), which are those vectors  that will not impact the target surface  (). When there is an increase in direct light , then the reflector  is considered to be less efficient. Accordingly, in some embodiments and as shown in , a mirror  may be positioned outside the reflector  to redirect the aberrant light  back into the reflector  such that it may again be reflected at the inner surface  () and toward the target surface . The size and shape of the mirror  can vary greatly and may be determined, at least in part, by the dimensions most easily accommodated by the reflector . Additionally, one skilled in the art would readily appreciate that angle formed between the mirror  and the second surface  may be altered in order to properly direct the aberrant light  toward the inner surface  ().","The reflector , with its unique ability to provide flood illumination of a large area, makes this geometry widely adaptable for use as a side reflector system , which is shown with greater detail in . The side reflector system  includes a number, n, of the reflectors  (illustrated as -, referred to generally as ) arranged in a one- or two-dimensional array. Each reflector includes a light source, again illustrated as the LED (where n ranges from a-y). The light sources of each of the reflectors may be electrically driven and controlled individually, controlled as a whole unit or as the system , or controlled as a subunit where the total number of reflectors  is divided into two or more subunits (for example, by row or by column). Because of each of reflectors of the system  cause illumination of the entire target area  (), the need for precise alignment of each reflector is greatly diminished as compared to the conventional flood illumination designs. This results in a more simplified construction and saves costs. Accordingly, the reflectors may be mounted onto or into a support (not shown) to create a unitary structure containing all of the necessary hardware and components.
