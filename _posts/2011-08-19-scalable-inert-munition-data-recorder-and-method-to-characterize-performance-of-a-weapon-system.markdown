title: Scalable, inert munition data recorder and method to characterize performance of a weapon system
abstract: A scalable, inert munition data recorder cartridge. This inert cartridge allows users to record data from within a weapon system feed chute, breach, and extractor port. This cartridge is adaptable to any weapon system, packaging unit, environmental chamber, or other ammunition holding and storage device. Although the cartridge is designed to interface with a weapon and ammunition packaging based on its shape, it still functions as designed regardless of its location and application. This would allow the cartridge to be placed anywhere an actual live cartridge of ammunition could be placed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by, or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The present invention relates in general to the field of munitions. More specifically, this invention relates to data acquisition acquired by an ammunition cartridge at firing, exit, and during flight. More specifically this invention pertains to data acquisition within ammunition environments including, but not limited to, the weapon system, ammunition packaging, exposure to meteorological and environmental conditions, and the bare case of the ammunition.","Useful information about a weapon system and associated ammunition can be gathered with external visual observation of the weapon system in action, and the ammunition whether or not it is packaged.","Internally, weapon barrel sensors record chemical reactions that occur in milliseconds of elapsed time. The feed mechanism and loading chamber of the weapon are not, however, simply observed or characterized by available measurement techniques. The nature of the moving parts prevents a static measurement device from being placed within this part of the weapon.","To date, there does not exist a data recorder that is encased in an inert cartridge case, and which is capable of passing though the weapon chamber, taking measurements, and recording these measurements to an internal storage device, before it is ejected along with the cartridge case in which it is encased.","What is therefore needed is a data recorder that can further be packaged similarly to field ammunition, such that measurements could be taken from within the case during desired procedures and operations. As a standalone device, the data observer could be used to analyze ammunition free from its packaging and outside of a weapon environment. Prior to the advent of the present invention, the need for such an inert data recorder has heretofore remained unsatisfied.","The present invention satisfies this need, and describes a scalable, inert munition data recorder assembly and method to characterize the performance of a weapon system, ammunition storage, transportation unit, and bare case enclosure.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inert data recorder assembly includes the following components that are scalable to the weapon system of interest. The internal electronic components include a data sensor, such as one or more 3-axis accelerometer, thermocouple, strain gauge, etc., that is encapsulated in resin and connected to a memory storage device.","A data interface port allows the cartridge to be connected to a computer. An internal power supply powers the electronic components. The housing of the electronic components substantially replicates the outside profile of a cartridge case that is meant to interface with a desired weapon system. For example, an inert data recorder built to work with the M242 autogun will have the outside profile of a 25 mm cartridge.","The data recorder can be manually, remotely, and\/or automatically activated prior to, or at the onset of a data recording session within a weapon system or other ammunition environment. During an ammunition event (i.e., weapon system activity, ammunition container vibration, ejection from a weapon, etc.), the data recorder logs data measurements taken by the internal data sensor. The data recorder records data from within a weapon loading magazine, weapon chamber, and during ejection from the weapon. Data logging ends when the data recorder is triggered to, or meets the proper criteria to cease recording. Recorded data will be transferred to a computer where post-processing will occur.","Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale, and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIGS. 2"],"b":["10","100","3","100","100","10"]},"The cartridge  can be used independently to collect data. Although the cartridge  is designed to interface with a weapon and ammunition packaging based on its shape, it still functions as designed regardless of its location and application. This would allow the cartridge  to be placed anywhere an actual live cartridge of ammunition could be placed.","With further reference to , the cartridge  generally includes a casing (or casing assembly)  and a data recorder assembly . The casing  is comprised of a body  that includes a cover  and a housing , a cartridge extractor cap , a nose , and two screw sets ,  (). The inert data recorder assembly  is generally comprised of an onboard data recorder , a sensor package , a power supply , a data interface port  (), and a set of screws  ().","The data recorder assembly  could be integrated into a single unit where the sensors and memory chips are formed in one package. The single unit design would keep the same function and fit into the cartridge casing  described herein, and consequently it would increases space within the casing  for multiple sensors or additional batteries (or power supplies).","In this particular embodiment, in order to assemble the cartridge , the onboard data recorder  and the sensor package  are independently and separately placed in an axially-oriented cavity  of the electronic housing . It should however be understood that the onboard data recorder  and the sensor package  may alternatively be built into the same casing .","The exterior shape (or profile) of the data recorder  and that of the sensor package  substantially correspond to, or match the interior shape of the cavity , in order to minimize, if not to prevent the movement of the data recorder  and the sensor package  within the casing .","In this particular example, the data recorder  and the sensor package  have generally cylindrical shapes that match that of the cavity .","The cover  is then fitted to the housing  in order to further secure and house the data recorder  and the sensor package , within the chamber that is formed by the cavity  of the housing , a corresponding (or matching as needed for design purpose) cavity in the cover , and an extension  of the housing .","To further secure the data recorder  and the sensor package  within the casing , the housing  is integrally provided with the generally cylindrically shaped extension  that houses, at least in part, the sensor package . In this particular embodiment, the extension  has a generally cylindrically interior shape that substantially matches that of the exterior surface of the sensor package .","In addition, and as more clearly shown in , the casing  includes a forward locking feature  that prevents the rotation of the sensor package  within the casing .  illustrates one or more lateral protrusions  that project inwardly, in order to prevent the sensor package  from sliding, along the axial direction, within the casing . The locking feature  and the protrusion  suspend the sensor package  with zero degrees of freedom, which is a beneficial feature particularly to a 3-axis accelerometer package where a fixed origin must be maintained for data collection.","Similarly, the casing  further includes locking features to suspend the data recorder  with zero degrees of freedom. A rearward anti-rotation feature  that is formed of one or more lateral protrusions that project inwardly, prevents the data recorder  from rotating within the casing . This anti-rotation feature  may be used as an alignment reference for the data recorder , allowing the data recorder assembly  to be used in any orientation. A mid-casing inward lateral protrusion  prevents sliding of the data recorder  in the axial direction along the central axis of the casing .","With reference to , the housing  includes, at its rearward end, a notch  that is formed in a rearward wall  of the housing , enables access to the data captured by the data recorder assembly . A data interface port  protrudes, in part through the notch  and is electrically connected to the onboard data recorder . The data interface port  is secured to the rearward wall  by means of, for example, the set of screws . The cover  has a similar feature to that described in connection with the housing  to accommodate and secure the data interface port . Once assembled, the data interface port  further stabilizes the data recorder  securely in position within the casing .","The sensor package  generally includes one or more sensors, such as one or more 3D accelerometers and\/or other sensors , such as pressure sensors, humidity sensors, temperature, etc. In an exemplary preferred embodiment, the sensors  are enclosed in a capsule . The capsule  can be formed using, for example, a molding process where the sensors  are surrounded by cured resin in a mold, such that the outer profile (i.e., shape and dimensions) of the capsule  is substantially similar or identical to the interior of the extension .","The onboard data recorder  is the main hub of all internal wiring of the data recorder assembly . The onboard data recorder  generally includes one or more electronic components  and wiring that accept, record (or store), and possibly process the data captured by the sensors  and transmitted to the onboard data recorder  by means of the wiring.","With specific reference to , the onboard data recorder  further includes a housing  that houses the electronic components . In another exemplary preferred embodiment, the housing  can be formed using, for example, a molding process where the electronic components  are surrounded by cured resin in a mold, such that the outside housing  shape and dimensions are substantially similar or identical to the interior of the cavity (or chamber) .","In this exemplary embodiment, the housing  of the onboard data recorder  and the capsule  of the sensor package  are generally cylindrically shaped, and have substantially equal radii. As a result, upon assembly of the onboard data recorder  and the sensor package  within the casing , the exterior surface of the assembly fits within the cavity  of the casing . In an alternative embodiment, the onboard data recorder  and the sensor package  may be combined in a single package because they have a similar cylindrical shape.","The cartridge extractor cap , which houses, in part, the data interface port , is securely affixed to the cover  and the housing  by means of a set of screws  (). The cartridge extractor cap  allows external access to the data interface port .","The cover  and housing  of the casing  are made of durable material that withstands shocks and that will not be damaged during the ram\/extract phase on an autogun or during environmental testing. The extractor cap alignment cap  further creates a mechanical lock between the cover  and the housing .","The nose  houses the power supply  of the onboard data recorder . The nose  is affixed to the casing  by means of known or available techniques, but allows access to the power supply . In this embodiment, the nose  is secured to the casing , by for example, threading it to the extension .","In this preferred embodiment, power is supplied to the data recorder assembly  as soon as the nose  containing the power supply  is secured to the extension . Power is terminated once the nose  is unscrewed.","Data is retrieved from the onboard data recorder , using the data interface port , either wirelessly or upon connection to a computer. In this embodiment, all post processing of data is done externally from the data recorder assembly . It should however be understood that some or all the processing could be done onboard the cartridge  and transmitted externally, either wirelessly or by cable.","The embodiments described herein are included for the purposes of illustration, and are not intended to be the exclusive; rather, they can be modified within the scope of the invention. Other modifications can be made when implementing the invention for a particular application."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other features of the present invention and the manner of attaining them, will become apparent, and the invention itself will be best understood, by reference to the following description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
