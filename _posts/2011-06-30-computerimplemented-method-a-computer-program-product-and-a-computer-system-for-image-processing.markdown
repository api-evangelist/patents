The embedded system may be contrasted with a general purpose computer system, e.g. a desktop PC.","A network attached storage (NAS) may be understood as an example of the embedded system that provides file-level computer data storage. The NAS may be connected to a computer network and can provide access to heterogeneous network clients. Moreover, the NAS may include one or more hard disks, where the hard disks may be arranged into redundant arrays of inexpensive\/independent disks (RAIDs).","A \u201cset-top box\u201d (STB) may refer to another example of the embedded system. The STB may be operable to connect to a display device (e.g. a television or a computer) and an external signal source. The STB may be operable to convert a signal received from the external signal source into content which is then displayed on the display device.","An \u201cintegrated circuit\u201d (also known as a microcircuit, microchip, or chip) may refer to a miniaturized electronic circuit that has been manufactured in the surface of a thin substrate of semiconductor material.","A \u201cdigital signal processor\u201d (DSP) may be understood as a specialized microprocessor optimized for certain operations, possibly including the processing (e.g. conversion) of signals. In comparison to a general purpose microprocessor, a DSP may have reduced hardware complexity, reduced functionality, lower cost, better performance, and reduced power consumption.","A \u201csystem on a chip\u201d (SoC) may refer to the integration of the components of a computer system on a single integrated circuit.

In the following text, the term image refers to a still or static image. The image may be rasterized and\/or encoded. Examples of images include pictures and photos. A moving image will be referred to as video.","In the following, a detailed description of examples will be given with reference to the drawings. It should be understood that various modifications to the examples may be made. In particular, elements of one example may be combined and used in other examples to form new examples.","The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as a method or on a device, possibly in the form of one or more computer program products. The subject matter described in the specification can be implemented in a data signal or on a machine readable medium, where the medium is embodied in one or more information carriers, such as a semiconductor memory, or a hard disk. Such computer program products may cause a data processing apparatus to perform one or more operations described in the specification.","In addition, subject matter described in the specification can also be implemented as a system including a processor, and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory may encode one or more programs to cause the processor to perform one or more of the methods described in the specification. Further subject matter described in the specification can be implemented using various machines.","Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the exemplary drawings and description below. Other features will be apparent from the description, the drawings, and from the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","102","102"]},"The embedded system  may be implemented as a NAS that provides file-based data storage services to devices on a network. Alternatively, the embedded system  may be a network access gateway or residential gateway that provides an Internet connection to a user network (e.g. a home network comprising one or more computers). In this case, the embedded system  may also be configured to provide access to networks other than the Internet. In a specific example, the embedded system  may be an asynchronous digital subscriber line (ADSL) modem. Modems supporting other forms of DSL are also possible.","The embedded system  may also be implemented as an STB or as a mobile device.","The embedded system  may include a user interface, e.g. a graphical user interface for managing the embedded system . Moreover, the embedded system  may run services, e.g. an application designed to help a user perform a task or a module enabling another device to be connected to the embedded system . Services that can be run on the embedded system  may or may not be related to providing access to a network connected to the embedded system . The graphical user interface may also be used to manage or control applications on the embedded system .","Some implementations of the embedded system  include a non-volatile memory, such as a flash memory . Alternatively, the embedded system  may include another form of non-volatile memory. The non-volatile memory of the embedded system  may be electronically addressable. In some cases, the non-volatile memory of the embedded system  may be another form of solid-state memory, such as a Silicon-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon (SONOS) memory, or a non-volatile Random Access Memory. Other types of non-volatile memory are also possible.","The flash memory  may be fixed to the embedded system . In particular, the flash memory  may be built into a chip and the chip may be wired to the embedded system . The contents of the flash memory  may be referred to as a firmware.","In some cases, the firmware stored by the flash memory  may include an operating system for the embedded system . The firmware stored by the flash memory  may also include services that can be run on the embedded system , and the graphical user interface for managing the embedded system . Specifically, the operating system may be Linux, e.g. Linux kernel 2.6 including uClibc libraries. More specifically, the operating system could be implemented using Debian Etch for MIPS with Linux kernel 2.6.1. The operating system may have been stripped of unnecessary components and may include only what is necessary to manage the embedded system . The applications may be suitable for performing networking tasks such as routing, firewall maintenance, domain name service (DNS), and dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP).","In some embodiments, the operating system allows a supporting service (e.g. drivers) for a further device to be added. For example, the operating system may support linking further functionality to the operating system kernel on demand. In other words, it may be possible to link a dynamically loadable module to the operating system. Accordingly, linking the dynamically loadable module to the firmware may be understood as linking the dynamically loadable module to the kernel of the operating system of the embedded system . Different kernel modules may be used to support different embedded system architectures and operating system kernels.","In addition to applications, services that may be executed on the embedded system  can include kernel modules, device drivers or other software that extends the functionality of the embedded system .","The embedded system  may include minimal hardware, e.g. hardware required to execute basic networking tasks and no other hardware, in order to lower costs. Moreover, the contents of the flash memory  (e.g. operating system and applications) may be stored on the embedded system  in a monolithic approach, i.e. as a single closed block.","For example, the contents of the flash memory  may be stored as a single closed block, e.g. as a binary image or as a compressed binary image. In other words, the flash memory  may contain a binary firmware image or a compressed binary firmware image. This may reduce the amount of flash memory  required on the embedded system , and thus reduce the cost of producing the embedded system . In addition, the use of the binary image on the embedded system  may be advantageous for a manufacturer or maintainer of the embedded system . Moreover, use of the binary image may make it simpler for a user to update the embedded system .","The binary image may be understood to contain the complete contents and structure representing a storage medium, e.g. the flash memory . A binary image may be stored in a single file.","However, storing the contents of the flash memory  as a binary image may have the effect that the only way to upgrade applications stored on the embedded system  is to perform a full firmware upgrade, as carried out in prior art methods. In other words, there has been no way to independently upgrade a single application. Instead, the full firmware upgrade has been required even for small changes to one application on the embedded system .","It may be difficult or undesirable to perform the full firmware upgrade for an arbitrary update of software on the embedded system . The full firmware upgrade may result in the use of more bandwidth, possible errors may have more sever consequences, and the full firmware upgrade may disrupt operations of the embedded system . For example, downloading the full firmware in order to make a small change to a single application may require more bandwidth than downloading the part of the application that is changed or the application itself. Furthermore, it is possible that the full firmware upgrade can fail, causing the embedded system  to become unusable. Also, the full firmware upgrade often causes an interruption of operation of the embedded system , since reboot of the embedded system  is normally required.","The embedded system  may further include a volatile memory, such as random access memory (RAM) .","Furthermore, the embedded system  may include a means of access connectable to an external network, such as a telephone port . The means of access could also be a fiber port or an Ethernet port depending on a type of the external network. The external network may be the Internet or another network.","The embedded system  may also include a means of access connectable to a local network, such as an Ethernet port . The embedded system  may also support wireless access, e.g. by means of wireless fidelity (WiFi). The local network may be a home network or an internal network or another network.","In addition, the embedded system  may include a reset button  that can be used to return the embedded system  to a standard or default configuration. The embedded system  may further include a power connector  that can be used to connect the embedded system  to a power source.","Moreover, the embedded system  may include a hard disk . The hard disk  may be implemented as a RAID.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","204","202","100","202","204"]},"The client  may include a number of modules, such as a presentation module implemented as a graphical user interface , a client image processing module , client storage , and a client communication module . The client  may send images to the server , and may also handle user requests. For example, the client  may be operable to receive images. An image received from a user, e.g. received by the client , may be referred to as a user image.","The client image processing module  may include functionality to control client operations and to manage interactions between the GUI  and the client storage . The client image processing module  may also be operable to perform preliminary operations on images to be analyzed by the server , and to facilitate manual annotation of images. In addition, the client image processing module  may be operable to manage image retrieval operation, e.g. browsing images and searching for images.","The client storage  may be used to store images. The client storage  may also be used to store image classification elements (also referred to as image metadata) extracted by the server . In addition, the client  may be operable to assign an initial classification to an image based on temporal data associated with the image. The temporal data may be a time when the image was created. For example, if the image is a picture the temporal data could refer to the time the picture was taken. The initial classification of the image may refer to classification performed by the client .","The client  may communicate with the server  using the SOAP protocol (e.g. as specified in \u201cSOAP Version 1.2 Part 1: Messaging Framework\u201d (Second Edition) W3C Recommendation 27 Apr. 2007, available at http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/soap12-part1\/), by means of the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).","The server  may be implemented using one or more application servers.","An orchestrator  may perform workflow management functions. In particular, the orchestrator  may call other modules of the server  in order to process images. The orchestrator  coordinates interaction between the elements of the image and semantic process module , thereby enabling image correlation and data enrichment. In particular, the orchestrator  may improve the reliability of other modules by correlating information and discarding results that do not make sense when analyzed in combination. The orchestrator  is described in more detail with regard to .","An image and semantic processing module  may include the bulk of functionality of the server . In particular, the image and semantic processing module  may include image segmentation functionality to segment an image and extract image classification elements. An exemplary image classification element is an image component, i.e. a part of the image such as a sea, a beach, a person, or a tree. Image components may be extracted (i.e., identified) using image segmentation algorithms. Image components may also be referred to as objects or segments. Other examples of image classification elements include a label that globally identifies the image, temporal data associated with the image, a category of the image, and a classification of an image component.","Image classification elements may also include low-level image information, such as image spectrum, color variants, or intensity, as well as more complex high-level image information such as image components, faces, signs, and geographic features. Low-level information may be used for content based image retrieval (CBIR), such as a query by example search. The query by example searches may be implemented by finding an image similar to a provided image; the provided image may also be referred to as a query image. For instance, in a query by example, the user might display an image using the graphical user interface  and request all images similar to the image displayed. The query by example search may also be performed based on a set of images. High-level image information may be used for annotation based image retrieval.","An image annotation (also referred to as an image tag) is an example of an image classification element. Image annotations may be understood as words that describe the content of an image.","The image and semantic processing module  may also determine the most significant component of the image, possibly based on a combination of chromatic characteristics in the image, as well as objects, monuments, people, faces, and facial expressions depicted. Techniques used to determine the most significant component of the image may include extraction of low-level features, image texture, color distribution, image segments, shapes detected, salient points, facial recognition, and edge detection. The image and semantic processing module  may include a label identification module and a component identification module.","Moreover, classification elements extracted from the image may be stored along with a reference to the image by the image and semantic processing module . All the classification elements associated with the image may be referred to as a final classification of the image. The final classification may be performed by the server . The final classification may be based on the initial classification.","The final classification and the reference to the image may be sent back to the client . The image and semantic processing module  may include functionality to collect image annotations and to enrich the image annotations with further information from semantic processing. This further information may be referred to as semantic information or context information. Enrichment of the image annotations with further information may involve the use of an ontology and\/or dictionaries. According to a specific example, a particular image annotated with certain image annotations (e.g. the sea, a beach, people, a tree) may be enriched by applying a semantic rule to categorize the particular image as a summer holiday. Thus, continuing the example, enriching the particular image with semantic information may involve assigning a category to the particular image based on image annotations assigned to components of the image.","The image and semantic processing module  may enable techniques of image segmentation, automatic image annotation, and multiple types of image searching to be integrated in a way that allows the enrichment of image tags using semantic analysis of the images themselves. This may facilitate retrieval of an image in response to a user query expressed in a natural language (i.e. without using predefined terms or queries). Because of the image and semantic processing module , a user does not necessarily need to enter keywords into the graphical user interface , but can instead request images using expressions in human language. The image and semantic processing module  may analyze the user query, e.g. by deriving one or more concepts from terms of the user query and matching the derived concepts to image classification elements (e.g. image annotations). The image and semantic processing module  may also match query concepts derived from the user query with image concepts derived from the image classification elements.","The image and semantic processing module  may be the most complex part of the image processing system. Also, image and semantic processing module  may be realized as a learning machine able to get feedback from users in order to improve its results. For example, image and semantic processing module  may be implemented by means of a support vector machine. The support vector machine (SVM) may be understood as a set of related supervised learning methods that can be used for classification. The SVM may be provided with a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories. A training algorithm may then be used to build a model that determines whether a new example falls into one category or another. Training examples may be understood as a subset of training data.","Server storage  may be operable to store image information such as image classification elements and references to associated images. For example, the server storage  may include mappings between geographic location information and place names, mappings from events to geographic locations and temporal data, lists of points of interest, semantic concepts, training data, user account information, etc. The geographic location information may be obtained in a number of ways. For example, the geographic location information may be captured by a GPS device integrated with a camera, a stand-alone GPS device or may be manually entered by a user.","A web services module  may facilitate access to the server  by the client . The web services module  may also include a web server and a server communication module. In some cases, the orchestrator  may be implemented as part of the web services module .","The image and semantic processing module  may also include a community crawler module (not shown) operable to retrieve content from an image sharing network, i.e. a network that facilitates the sharing of images. The image sharing network may be a social network, such as Facebook (Facebook is a trademark of Facebook Inc.). In some cases, the community crawler may be implemented as part of a social network adapter. The image sharing network may also be a photo sharing network such as Google Picasa (Google and Picasa are trademarks of Google Corporation), flickr, or Kodak. Gallery (Kodak and Kodak Gallery are trademarks of the Kodak Corporation). Specifically, an adapter component of the web services module  may be operable to gather images from albums of a social network (SN) to which a user is registered, and index the gathered images together with the images stored in the client storage .","Advantageously, when the user searches for an image, the user does not need to access multiple accounts (e.g. the social network account) but can search for the image using the graphical user interface . Accordingly, the client  and the server  will retrieve all images matching the user search regardless of the storage location of the images. Thus, content from different sources is realized in a single view.","Moreover, the orchestrator  may be configured to orchestrate all communication flows involving the server . This may improve scalability and modularity of the server . In particular, the image and semantic processing module  may be implemented as a closed, proprietary system. Accordingly, using the orchestrator , it is possible to incorporate new modules into the image processing system without modifications to the image and semantic processing module ; only the orchestrator  would be impacted.","In some cases, a large number of images may be stored using the client storage . The client  may be connected to a display device, such as a television, in order to show a catalog of stored images, automatically organized by category. Automatic classification may be performed by means of the extracted image classification elements. Furthermore, the graphical user interface  can be used to search for images using a variety of methods, for example using natural language queries or query by example as described above.","Moreover, the server  may process images and store image classification elements for multiple users, e.g. a home network community. Possibly in conjunction with other applications, such as a photo album service, a user may be able to retrieve photos from various members of the home network community by means of interaction with the client . The server  may include access lists to ensure that users only accesses images that they are entitled to access.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["202","202"]},"The graphical user interface (GUI)  may enable a user to interact with the client . In some cases, the GUI  may be dependent on the hardware implementation of the client . For example, if the client  is implemented as a NAS or a network access gateway, the GUI  may be realized as a set of dynamic web pages accessible through the Ethernet port . If the client  is implemented as an STB, the GUI  may be realized as a graphical application to be displayed on a television and controlled through a remote control.","The client communication module  may manage communications with the server . In particular, the communication module  may use the SOAP protocol as part of a web service paradigm, e.g., Extended Markup Language (XML) requests over HTTP.","The client  may also include application logic . The application logic  may be used to control operations on the client  by managing interactions between the GUI  and other modules of the client .","In addition, the client  may include a preprocessor . The preprocessor  can perform preliminary operations on an image. In particular, the preprocessor  may include an initial classification module, operable to assign an initial classification to the image. Classification performed by the preprocessor  may serve as a basis for further classification performed by the server . In other words, the initial classification of the image may server as a basis for a final classification of the image.","The initial classification assigned by the preprocessor may be based on temporal data (e.g. a timestamp including a day, a month, and a year that the image was created) associated with the image. For example, if the image is a picture, an initial classification of the picture may be derived from a date when the picture was taken.","In some cases, a received image timestamp is compared with timestamps of previously stored images. The previously stored images may be associated with one or more events, where each event may refer to an occurrence during which multiple images were created. Examples of events include personal events such as a summer holiday, a birthday, or an anniversary. Events may also refer to publicly recognized occurrences, such as the Oktoberfest.","If the received image timestamp is found to be sufficiently close to a timestamp of one of the previously stored images, an event associated with the previously stored image may also be associated with the received image. For example, if the received image and a previously stored image were taken within three days of each other, the received image and the previously stored image may be associated with the same event. Moreover, image classification elements associated with the event may also be associated with the received image. If the received image timestamp is not sufficiently close to any previously stored image timestamp, a new event may be created for the received image. If multiple images are received, and the multiple images have associated timestamps that are sufficiently close to each other, the multiple images may be associated with the same event.","Accordingly, assigning an initial classification to a received image may include associating the received image with a previously stored image, i.e. associating the received image and the previously stored image with the same event.","For example, Alice, using the image processing system, has already produced a final classification of user images associated with the summer holidays of Alice and Bob. The images have associated temporal data indicating a date between 1 and 15 Aug. 2009. The final classification includes correlated image components with annotations such as \u201choliday, summer, sea, Capri, Alice, Bob\u201d. Thus, each image may have multiple image components and multiple image annotations.","Continuing the example, Bob sends Alice his pictures of the summer holidays and Alice uploads Bob's pictures to the client . The preprocessor  determines that the temporal data associated with Bob's pictures indicates a date between 1 and 15 Aug. 2009. The preprocessor  may assign an initial classification to Bob's pictures that includes image classification elements of the final classification produced for Alice's images. The initial classification assigned to Bob's pictures may provide the server  with a starting point for analysis and disambiguation. For instance, if during the course of identifying image classification elements, the image processing system is unable to distinguish between Bob and another person, the system could exclude the other person, since the set of pictures is associated with holidays for Alice and Bob.","Thus, it may be an advantage that limitations in certain modules, e.g. a facial recognition module, can be compensated for by correlating newly identified image components, such as a recognized face, with a previously stored final classification.","The initial classification may be verified by presenting a result of the initial classification to a user. The user may accept the initial classification or associate the received image with another event. Also, the user may create a new event and associate the received image with the new event. Once verification has been performed, the received image may be stored in image storage . The previously stored images referred to above may be retrieved from the image storage .","The client  may also include an annotation tool . The annotation tool  can be used to facilitate manual tagging of images. In other words, the annotation tool  may be used to associate descriptive terms with an image. The annotation tool  may be used before initial classification, after initial classification, before final classification, or after final classification. Input obtained by the annotation tool  may be used by the server .","An image retrieval module  may enable the user to obtain images from the image storage . In particular, the image retrieval module  may provide several ways to browse images. For example, one of the following image searching methods may be used:\n\n","The image searching methods can be combined and may be accessible from the same page of the GUI . In one example, a user can start browsing by event, then refine the search using the tag cloud, natural language query or the query by example. The image searching methods will be explained in more detail in connection with .","The image retrieval module  may also interface with the server , e.g. for semantic analysis of a natural language query. In some cases, semantic analysis may involve replacing natural language terms with ontology concepts. The ontology concepts may capture semantics such as words that have the same meaning, concepts that are part of other concepts, subconcepts, or self-defined relations. The ontology concepts derived from the query may be refined using available classification elements and in view of interrelations with other ontology concepts.","The image retrieval module  may include a search engine.","A database  may be used to store image classification elements derived from image analysis, personal user information, or another source. Image classification elements in the database  may include birthdays, anniversaries, face-name associations, etc.","Accordingly, an image may be received (e.g. uploaded) at the client  in a number of ways.","In a first example, the GUI  may be accessed from a personal computer (PC). In this case, a user may have images stored on the PC. For example, the images may have been copied from a digital camera to a folder on the PC or downloaded from the Internet or placed on the PC in another manner. The GUI  may receive user input by means of a connection of a standard web browser to the GUI . The GUI  may be used to select single images or entire folders to be uploaded to the client . Once the selection is confirmed, the selected images are transferred to the client , possibly for initial classification by the preprocessor . Once the initial classification has been performed, the GUI  may display a verification page to enable the user to confirm the initial classification or select an alternative classification.","In a second example of how an image may be received, a shared folder on the client  may be accessed, and images may be copied from a PC to the shared folder (e.g. by drag-and-drop, copy and paste, use the command line, etc.). Once the copying of images has been completed, the GUI  may receive an external connection. In response to the external connection, the client  may generate a notification that new content needs to be processed. The client  may receive a response to the notification which activates the preprocessor  and starts initial classification of the images.","In a third example of how an image may be received, a USB storage device such as a digital camera may be connected to the USB port . Accordingly, the client  recognizes the USB storage device using a previously installed driver. The client  may scan the USB storage device for images, which are then transferred to the image storage . Once the transfer process is complete, the preprocessor  may be activated via the GUI  in order to perform initial classification of the images.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0104"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["204","204","204"]},"The server  includes the web services module . The Web services module  may be understood as the counterpart of the client communication module  and facilitates communication with the client . Also, the Web services module  may include a server communication module operable to receive an image from the client . The server  may receive the image along with the initial classification of the image from the client . Alternatively, the server  may receive the image along with one or more image classification elements. For example, the server  may receive the image with along with temporal data (e.g. a time when the image was created), and geographic coordinates (e.g. latitude and longitude).","The web services module  may include a dedicated web service operable to receive the image via HTTP.","The received image may be passed from the web services module  to an image semantic search framework (ISSF) orchestration module . The ISSF orchestration module may be understood as a specific implementation of the orchestrator . The ISSF orchestration module  performs workflow management functions. In particular, when a new image is received by the server , the ISSF orchestration module  calls other modules of the server  in order to analyze the image; the ISSF orchestration module  may aggregate results of the image analysis and enhance image comprehension. The ISSF orchestration module  may include a final classification module. The results of the image analysis may be combined in a final classification.","The final classification may include one or more of the following image classification elements:\n\n","In one example, the ISSF orchestration module  may send the received image to a scene detector .","The scene detector  may be operable to determine a general meaning of the received image. In other words, the scene detector  may identify a label that globally describes the received image. Thus, the label describes the entire content (i.e. all image components) of the received image. The scene detector  may be further operable to calculate a label correctness value for the label.","An object identifier  may be operable to recognize components of the received image. In particular, the object identifier  may segment the received image and determine information about recognized components, e.g. as elaborated in the description of . Extracted information may include a location of each recognized component in the received image. Also, the object identifier  may calculate component correctness values for each recognized component.","A goal of the scene detector  and the object identifier  is to calculate the probability that a particular concept is actually represented in the received image. Both modules may be understood to use similar approaches. A difference between the scene detector  and the object identifier  is the objective of analysis. In the case of the scene detector , the received image is considered and analyzed as a whole in order to identify a label that globally describes the received image. In contrast, with regard to the object identifier , the received image is first segmented into smaller regions and then analyzed in order to recognize individual components of the received image.","A methodology that can be common to the scene detector  and the object identifier  involves extracting a set of characterizing features from the received image and matching the set of extracted characterizing features with a dictionary (also referred to as a codebook). Each characterizing feature may be understood as a mathematical representation of the image. An example of a characterizing feature is a color histogram, i.e. the distribution of colors in the image. The dictionary defines mappings between values of characterizing features and concepts. Also, the dictionary may define mappings between values of characterizing features and image components.","Depending on the characterizing feature to be extracted, image processing by the scene detector  and the object identifier  may involve performing some computations on the received image in full-color, while other computations may be performed on a black and white version of the received image. Still further computations may be performed on single color channels of the received image.","For example, the elements of the dictionary can be represented as {characterizing feature values, concept} pairs. According to the example, the characterizing feature values relate to components extracted from reference images, and the concept is an annotation associated with those values. By evaluating the difference between the values of characterizing features extracted from the received image and the characterizing feature values in the dictionary, a probability that the concept is associated with the received image may be calculated.","In another example, there are a number of images depicting the sea and others depicting fire. Color histograms for images of the sea will have higher values for blue and green components, while color histograms for images of the fire will have higher values for the red components. According to the example, the number of entries in the dictionary is equal to the number of images. Each entry will include the color histogram of an image and a manually associated concept (i.e. sea or fire in this example). Once built, the dictionary will be used as a reference for classifying new pictures: for each new image, the color histogram is computed and compared with those in the dictionary through a learning machine classifier, such as a support vector machine (SVM). The output of the SVM is the probability that the color histogram associated with the new image is similar to the color histogram associated with a reference image in the dictionary. Since color histograms are associated with concepts in the dictionary, the output of the SVM is the probability that an image represents a concept (e.g. the concept associated with the reference image). Note that a color histogram is only one example of a characterizing feature.","In the case of the scene detector , the overall picture is analyzed, focusing on the background. In one example, before extracting the features, the scene detector  applies a Gaussian filter to the received image in order to smooth discontinuities. The visual effect of a Gaussian filter is to blur the received image, so that it appears flattened; in this way, foreground elements are blended with background elements, providing a more homogenous image.","After filtering, characterizing features (e.g. the color histogram) are calculated and matched to the characterizing features in the dictionary. A perfect match is generally impossible, except in the case where the received image is identical to an image in the dictionary. Thus, matching may be performed using a machine learning classifier, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) or a Fisher classifier. In some cases, a set of training examples is supplied. Training examples may also be referred to as model or template images. Each training example is marked as belonging to one of two categories, and an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other. In this case, categories are concepts and the SVM is extended to support more than two categories (Multiclass SVM). The SVM may output a label correctness value.","The object identifier  may use an approach similar to that of the scene detector . A goal of the object identifier  is to determine if an image component belongs to an image, instead of analyzing the whole image. Accordingly, the object identifier  may analyze smaller segments of the received image. The segments can be compared to reference objects (also referred to as visual words). Thus, in an isolation phase, the received image may be decomposed using techniques such edge detection and corner detection. These techniques can be used to isolate shapes through a gradient analysis. A principle behind the isolation phase is that edges of image components may be located where the gradient has a maximum; this is the opposite of the situation with the scene detector , where a Gaussian filter is applied to minimize differences in the gradient. After the isolation phase, characterizing features of each region of the received image (e.g. color histogram and contours) can be computed. These characterizing features can then be matched with those characterizing features extracted from images of reference objects. Matching can be performed using a machine learning classifier as described above with respect to the scene detector . The machine learning classifier may output component correctness values.","A number of training examples may exist for each image label and each image component. In general, the more training examples there are for an image label or an image component, the more likely it is that the label or component can be identified with a high probability. In other words, as the number of training examples associated with an image label increases; the label correctness value for received images that can be globally described with that image label may increase (i.e. go toward a perfect match). The same applies for an image component correctness value. Advantageously, the number of training examples can be increased as more images are received by the client  and processed by the image processing system. Moreover, feedback from the user can be used to improve determination of image labels and recognition of image components, e.g. by associating identification data with training examples.","An example involving the object identifier  may help illustrate the use of training examples by the object identifier  and the scene detector . If the received image is a picture of a hummingbird (or a picture including a hummingbird), and there are no pictures of birds in the set of training examples, then the object identifier  may not recognize that there is a bird in the received image. If there are pictures of birds in the set of training examples, and the pictures are generally classified as birds without any more specific classification, then the object identifier  may recognize the hummingbird as a bird and the associated image component correctness value may be proportional to the number of pictures of hummingbirds in the set of training examples. Thus, the image component correctness value and the label component correctness value may depend on the number of images in the set of training examples and how the images are classified (e.g. the annotations associated with the training examples).","In some cases, the label correctness values and the component correctness values may be implemented as percentages. A label correctness value may indicate a likelihood that the corresponding label accurately describes the received image. In other words, the label correctness value is a probability that the image represents a particular scene (e.g. outdoor, indoor, sea, forest, cityscape) identified by the label. A component correctness by may indicate a likelihood that the corresponding component has been accurately identified.","A semantic correlation module  may correlate labels with image components using the label correctness values and the component correctness values. The semantic correlation module  may identify at least one correlated label and at least one correlated image component. In other words, the semantic correlation module  disambiguates the output of the scene detector  and the output of the object identifier .","A facial recognition module  may be operable to identify faces in an image and associate names with the identified faces. For example, if the object identifier  recognizes a plurality of image components, the facial recognition module  may identify a face within the plurality of components. Different image components may be recognized using different techniques. For example, faces may be recognized using different techniques in comparison to other image components. In some implementations image component classifications are only associated with faces and not with other image components.","In some cases, names are associated with faces based on training data, e.g. training examples. Similar to the scene detector  and the object identifier , the facial recognition module  may require more than one training example (possibly photos taken from different angles) in order to recognize a face. The computations performed by the facial recognition module  may be made more efficient by utilizing known characteristics of faces (i.e. facial features). Training data for the facial recognition module  will be discussed in more detail below.","In addition, the facial recognition module  may also be operable to determine moods based on facial expressions of the identified faces.","A semantic expander  processes image classification elements identified by other modules of the server  in order to enrich them. In particular, the semantic expander  may apply a rule in order to determine a category of the received image. The rule may be applied using the temporal data, each correlated image label and each correlated image component. Moreover, the semantic expander  may add contextual information based on semantic analysis of text-based image classification elements. The semantic expander  may also resolve query terms in a query received from the client . The rule applied by the semantic expander  (i.e. the semantic rule) and the added contextual information are elaborated in more detail below via the discussion of a specific example.","The server  may also contain object classifiers . For certain types of image components, the object classifiers  may be operable to associate an image component classification with an image component. For example, if the image component is a car, the object classifiers  may be operable to associate a model designation with the car. The object classifiers  may be expanded to classify further image components simply by modifying a workflow in the ISSF orchestration module . In this context the workflow may be understood as a sequence of connected steps. Thus, because of the particular architecture of the server , adding new object classifiers may merely require performing additional steps to classify components associated with the new object classifiers. The operation of other components and the rest of the image processing may be unaffected.","The object classifiers  may also allow the server  to be used in a number of different contexts, such as a consumer context or a business context. For example, in the consumer context, the client  may be part of a home network. Alternatively, in the business context, the client  may be part of a corporate network. Other contexts are also possible.","A geographic database  may include mappings between geographic locations and place names. A place name may refer to a city (e.g. Seattle), a region (e.g. Shaw Island), a building (e.g. the Sistine Chapel), etc. The geographic database  may also include a list of points of interest as well as contextual information associated with the geographic locations. A point of interest may be understood as a location that someone may find useful or interesting (e.g. a point on the Earth representing the location of the Space Needle). The contextual information may include material of interest to a traveler visiting the corresponding geographic location. The information in the geographic database  may facilitate the identification of image labels and image components. Geographic locations may be represented as geographic coordinates, possibly including one or more of the following:\n\n","A social network (SN) adapter  may facilitate communication between the server  and an image sharing network associated with the user. The image sharing network may be a social network such as Facebook or a photo sharing network such as flickr. The SN adapter  may enable content of the image sharing network to be indexed by the server . The SN adapter  may also be operable to retrieve images from the image sharing network. The SN adapter  may be integrated with a particular type of image sharing network. Other adapters may be used to facilitate communication with different image sharing networks, e.g. image sharing networks with different APIs. Each image sharing network communicated with by the SN adapter  may have a set of public application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow access to a user's image gallery. The user's image gallery may refer to images associated with the user on the image sharing network.","In order to register with the image sharing network, the user can access the GUI . The user can then select one or more image sharing networks, and provide authentication information (e.g. a username and a password) for each selected network. The client  may forward the authentication information to the ISSF orchestration module  which may verify the validity of the user name and password with the selected image sharing network and activate the SN adapter .","After activation, the SN adapter  can be configured to connect to the image sharing network at regular intervals (e.g. once a day) using the user's authentication information. After a successful connection, the SN adapter  may access the image gallery of the user. Each image in the image gallery that does not have a final classification is retrieved by the SN adapter  and passed to the ISSF orchestration module . The ISSF orchestration module  may then identify classification elements in order to produce a final classification of the retrieved image. Once the final classification has been produced, the final classification and a reference to the retrieved image can be sent to the client  and stored in the database .","The process of retrieving an image from the image sharing network may be performed in the background, e.g. at night in order to reduce network and system load. Optionally, the client  may be operable to prompt the user to verify classification elements of the final classification of the retrieved image when the user connects to the GUI .","In some cases, identified image classification elements are automatically verified after a predetermined period of time.","Advantageously, the SN adapter  can enable a user to have a unique and consistent view of all his images. Thus, the user can access all of his images through the graphical user interface . The user does not need to separately access each of the image sharing networks he is registered with, but can instead access all images from one place. In other words, with a single search the user gets access to his whole image library, resulting in a simplified search process.","An event DB  includes information about occurrences, such as public events (e.g. a contest, a festival, or a sporting event). The event DB  may also include personal event information associated with particular, e.g. a birthday, or an anniversary. Events may be part of the context of an image. Events may also be associated with temporal data or with a geographic location.","After the server  finishes processing a received image, the final classification may be sent to the client . The final classification may include some or all of the identified image classification elements. Accordingly, the received image may be displayed using the GUI . In some cases, identified image classification elements (e.g. image components such as faces) of the received image are highlighted and described.","The client  may be operable to receive verification of identified image classification elements from a user. In this case, the identified image classification elements are stored in the database  and made ready for future retrieval. In addition, a positive indication may be sent to the ISSF orchestration module , which in turn notifies other modules of the server  regarding the outcome of the verification. Accordingly, the modules of the server  may update their training data based on the verification.","Also, the client  may be operable to receive modifications and\/or additional details from the user. In this case, the user can modify identified image classification elements, e.g. the user can modify names associated with faces or change an identifier of a recognized image component. Thus, if an image component is recognized incorrectly, a face is incorrectly named, or a face is not named at all, the client  can receive corrections from the user. The user may submit changes, which can be stored in the database , and forwarded to the ISSF orchestration module . The ISSF orchestration module  can pass the modifications to the other modules of the server , which can update their training data accordingly.","A specific example of the processing of a user image received by the server  from the client  will now be described. According to the example, the image may be transferred from the web services module  to the ISSF Orchestration module . The ISSF Orchestration module  may also receive temporal data associated with the image (e.g. in the case of a picture, the time the picture was taken), and a geographic location associated with the image.","The received image may depict a coast with people in the foreground. The scene detector  may determine five image labels, where each image label globally describes the content of the received image. Each image label may be associated with a label correctness value. For example, image labels and associated label correctness values are depicted in the following table:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0157"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Image label","Correctness Value"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Coast","70%"]},{"entry":[{},"Sky","65%"]},{"entry":[{},"Mountain","30%"]},{"entry":[{},"Forest","\u20025%"]},{"entry":[{},"Highway","\u20023%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Accordingly, the highest label correctness value is associated with the \u201cCoast\u201d image label, whereas the lowest label correctness value is associated with the \u201cHighway\u201d image label. As can be seen from the table above, there is some ambiguity in the received image. In this case, the scene detector  cannot definitively determine whether the coast or the sky is predominant since both image labels have similar label correctness values.","Continuing the example, once the image labels and corresponding label correctness values have been determined, the received image may be passed to the object identifier . The object identifier may generate a set of image components and component correctness values similar to set of labels and values depicted in the table above. In the example, the object identifier  may determine that the image contains \u201cpeople\u201d, \u201crocks\u201d, and \u201ca boat\u201d, with high associated correctness values.","The ISSF orchestration module  may correlate the results generated by the scene detector  and the object identifier  using the semantic correlation module . For example, the ISSF orchestration module  may be able to use the people, rocks, and the boat identified by the object identifier  in order to exclude the possibility that the \u201cSky\u201d image label globally describes the content of the received image. For example, if the highest label correctness value and the second highest label correctness value are similar, the image components identified by the object identifier  can be used to exclude one of the image labels.","Alternatively, if during the processing of an image a definitive image label is identified with a much higher correctness value than any other identified image label, the ISSF orchestration module  and the semantic correlation module  may be able to use the definitive image label to identify ambiguous image components. In this case, ambiguous image components may have similar associated correctness values (e.g. within 10% of each other) and may corresponding to the same depicted object. For example, if object A is recognized as a bird with a 50% associated correctness value and object A is also recognized as a hanging light with a 45% associated correctness value, then the definitive scene label of \u201cbeach\u201d could be used to exclude the \u201changing light\u201d.","After correlation, the ISSF orchestration module  may use the geographical database  to determine a place name associated with the geographic location of the image. According to the example, the image is a picture taken in Capri. The ISSF orchestration module  may also determine at least one point of interest based on the geographic location. In this case, the Faraglioni is identified as a point of interest associated with Capri. Faraglioni may be associated with the rocks previously identified as an image component. Thus, the ISSF orchestration module  identifies Capri and Faraglioni as image classification elements of the received image. These image classification elements may be incorporated into the final classification.","In addition, the ISSF orchestration module  may derive a weather indicator from the temporal data associated with the received image. For example, the weather indicator may be a season (e.g. summer) corresponding to the temporal data. Moreover, the ISSF orchestration module  may search the event database  for events related to the temporal data and the geographic location. The events may be public events, e.g. the Faraglioni Capri Prize, or personal events, e.g. a wedding or a party. Personal events may be configured by a user. Events found to be related to the temporal data and the geographic location may be identified as classification elements and incorporated into the final classification. At this stage, identified image classification elements may include the following (component position and other low-level image features have been omitted for clarity):\n\n","Accordingly, the ISSF orchestration module  may pass the received image to the facial recognition module . The facial recognition module  detects faces among the recognized image components and attempts to associate a name with each face. The facial recognition module  may extract a facial expression from an identified face, and may also determine a mood (e.g. happy, sad, crying, laughing) based on the facial expression. Thus, after the received image has been processed by the facial recognition module , the identified image classification elements may include the following:\n\n","Subsequently, the identified image classification elements may be passed to the semantic expander . The semantic expander  may apply one or more semantic rules to the identified image classification elements in order to determine a category of the received image. According to the example, since the received image was taken in the summer and near a point of interest associated with tourism, the received image is categorized as a holiday. The category may be added to the identified image classification elements. Moreover, additional contextual information may be associated with the received image based on the category, e.g. similar concepts such as vacation, journey and travel.","A semantic rule may defined using XML. For example an image meeting the criteria of the following semantic rule may be categorized as a \u201choliday\u201d,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0169"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<concept name=\u201dholiday\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"<includes type=\u201doptional\u201d name=\u201dsea\u201d>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<includes type=\u201doptional\u201d name=\u201dbeach\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<includes type=\u201doptional\u201d name=\u201dboat\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<includes type=\u201doptional\u201d name=\u201dumbrella\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"..."]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<\/includes>"]},{"entry":[{},"<includes type=\u201doptional\u201d name=\u201dmountain\u201d>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<includes type=\u201doptional\u201d name=\u201dwood\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<includes type=\u201doptional\u201d name=\u201dlake\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<includes type=\u201doptional\u201d name=\u201danimal\u201d\/>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<\/includes>"]},{"entry":[{},"<includes type=\u201dmandatory\u201d>people<\/includes>"]},{"entry":[{},"..."]},{"entry":[{},"<\/concept>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"After processing is complete, a final classification of the received image is produced based on the identified image classification elements. The final classification is sent to the client , which stores the final classification in the database , along with the image.","Multiple image searching methods enabled by the image retrieval module  in view of the final classification will now be discussed in more detail.","A simple way to search for images is to choose a group of image classification elements to use for navigating images in the image storage . Once a group of image classification elements (e.g. all events) has been selected, a list of the image classification elements in the selected group are displayed (i.e. all events are displayed). An image classification element (e.g. Alice's birthday) can then be selected, and it is possible to browse images associated with the selected image classification element. Groups of image classification elements that can be selected include:\n\n","Other groups of image classification elements may also be selected, such as moods or image labels.","Another way to search for images is to browse by tag cloud. Statistics about classification elements may be maintained in the database . Each time a new final classification is added to the database , statistics for each image classification element in the new final classification can be updated. A subset of the classification elements in the database  may be presented in a cloud, where each image classification element has a font size proportional to the number of occurrences of that classification element in the database . In response a selection of a classification element presented in the cloud, the GUI  may show previews of images associated with the selected classification element. In other words, the images previewed may have a final classification that includes selected the classification element. Also, in response to the selection, the tag cloud can be updated so that only the classification elements most relevant to the previewed images are displayed. The tag cloud can be refined further and the number of previewed images can be decreased in response to additional user input.","Yet another way to search for images is by means of a natural language query. A user can type a query (e.g. a sentence) comprising at least one query term into a text box. For example one query might be \u201cshow me all the photos of me at the sea\u201d. The client  can pass the query to the ISSF orchestration module , which may send the query to the image and semantic processing module . The image and semantic processing module  may process the query and return a list of image classification elements that can reasonably be associated with the query. Upon receipt of the list of image classification elements, the client  may search the image storage  for images with a final classification including at least one of the listed image classification elements.","A further way of searching for images is query by example. The query by example involves finding a response image similar to a query image. The query by example may be performed by comparing image classification elements such as low-level image features (e.g. spectrum, color variance, intensity). Thus, the response image found in response to a query by example may include an image classification element of the query image.","Architectures different from the architecture depicted in  are also possible. However, the architecture of  has the advantage that the processor intensive tasks of image segmentation, as well as semantic enrichment and semantic searching are carried out by the server . Accordingly, a service provider offering services corresponding to those performed on the server  could be in a position to obtain more revenue in comparison to a service provider offering different services. The architecture depicted in  may also be more scalable and provide more optimized use of resources than alternative architectures. For example, if more tasks were performed by the client , the embedded system  could require additional capability, thereby becoming more complex and expensive. Concentrated computing power at the embedded system  could also remain unused for long periods, since it might only be required during the automatic tagging process. Moreover, concentrating computing power at the server  allows the computing power to be shared between a plurality of client applications.","The client server system described above may offer a user simplicity and efficiency.
