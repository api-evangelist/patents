No. 6,347,307; and (iv) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/703,198.","This invention relates generally to the field of interactive and automated Web-based financial transaction applications, and in particular to interactive and automated systems and methods for conducting financial transactions and managing portfolios and related financial information in capital markets.","During the evolution of the Internet, including the World Wide Web, there has been a continual introduction of applications and services to enable individuals and organizations to conduct financial research, manage their financial portfolios, and engage in certain types of financial transactions. The wide array of applications and services ranges from on-line banking to stock quote and financial information services to sites that enable users to engage in on-line, real-time market trades involving various instruments such as stocks, stock options, bonds, and mutual funds. The trading services, for example E*TRADE Securities, Inc.'s \u201cE*TRADE\u201d<www.etrade.com>, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.'s \u201cSchwab.com\u201d<www.schwab.com>, and Fidelity Brokerage Services, Inc.'s \u201cFidelity.com\u201d<www.fidelity.com>, permit trading of standard instruments in recognized markets. In such services, the investor uses credit or an account set up through the trade service to engage in trades through the service's proprietary system and interfaces. Such services, which are geared towards individual investors, do not permit seamless integration with users' internal or back-end systems or the creation and trading of customized transactions. These services, and many others like them, do not enable trading between parties in currency derivatives or foreign exchange, or the pricing and modeling of other capital market transactions.","Some steps have been taken to tap into the potentially vast market of institutional investors wishing to engage in complex transactions via the Internet. The \u201cOpen Financial Exchange\u201d (Intuit Inc., Microsoft Corp., CheckFree Corp.) <www.ofx.net> was created to provide a common specification for the electronic exchange of financial data between financial institutions, businesses, and consumers via the Internet that enables financial data exchange among disparate systems, in order to support online banking, bill payment and presentment, and the trading of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The Open Financial Exchange does not, however, provide a vocabulary, platform, and communication protocol to enable the creation, negotiation, and execution of complex, capital market transactions among financial institutions and institutional investors.","What is needed is a system and method that enables institutional investors and financial institutions to seamlessly create, price, negotiate, execute, settle and analyze complex, capital market transactions, including interest and currency derivatives, foreign exchange, loans and deposits, and fixed-income instruments, in an online environment, using a standard vocabulary and messaging system that enables seamless integration with the proprietary, existing systems of the users.","The present invention provides a system and method that enables users, such as \u201cMembers\u201d (e.g., institutional investors) and \u201cProviders\u201d (e.g., banks, financial institutions), to engage in capital market transactions, including the trading of Over-the-Counter financial products, via the Internet (including the World Wide Web). The system includes a variety of servers, applications, and interfaces that enable users to interactively communicate and trade financial instruments among one another and to manage their portfolios. Interactive communications supported by the system include: establishing credit relationships, structuring financial transactions, requesting price quotes, monitoring and reviewing transaction requests, issuing price quotes, monitoring and reviewing price quotes, negotiations between Members and Providers, acceptance and confirmation of price quotes, reporting, portfolio management, analysis of financial information and market data, and communications among Members, Providers, and\/or system administrators, including e-mail, chat, and message boards.","The present invention also supports communications with the server side in an automated manner via an automated processor (the \u201cConnect Processor\u201d and \u201cConnect Messaging Server\u201d). Such automated communications enable connectivity with users' internal, back-end systems to execute automated, straight-through processing, including transaction pricing, payment scheduling and journaling, derivatives trading, trade confirmation, and trade settlement. Such communications are facilitated using a novel XML-based syntax (\u201cFinXML\u201d) and XSL-based processing language (\u201cFinScript\u201d). FinXML provides a standard data interchange language for capital market transactions and supports a broad set of elements and attributes that represent a wide variety of financial transactions, reference data, and market data. The common description of the FinXML syntax can be used for all aspects of straight-through-processing, including deal creation, confirmation, settlement, payment, risk management, and accounting.","A. System Functionality","The technology of the present invention can be embodied in various forms to provide a platform for conducting interactive and automated financial transactions and management of portfolios and related financial information in capital markets. The platform enables members, including end-users and providers of financial products and services, to engage in the trading of standard and customized financial instruments in capital markets. System functionality includes: capture and pricing of financial instrument trades; presentation of real-time market data; saving of completed trades to a portfolio; management of trading workflow; transmission of trades to end-users' proprietary, back-end systems for pricing, trading, payment processing, confirmation, and settlement; performance of portfolio analysis; performance of risk management analysis; and inter-user communications.","In the present embodiment of the invention, the system includes both server-side and client-side functionality. The server-side functionality enables system users to interactively and seamlessly: engage in financial instrument trades; perform portfolio management, analysis, and reporting; obtain real-time market data and news; communicate with the system and other users via electronic mail, chat, and message boards; and maintain a calendar. The server-side includes interactive system servers that host such user activities, as well as one or more system databases, and an automated messaging server that controls communication with the automated back-end systems of clients.","The client side functionality includes an automated processor that communicates with the automated messaging server of the system side and serves as a seamless interface to the automated back-end systems and proprietary databases of clients. Thus, the system enables organizations with disparate systems and data to engage in transactions using the common functionality and interfaces of this invention. The client side also includes client web browsers that enable interactive communication with the system servers.","The invention described herein provides a standard, XML-based vocabulary to represent and facilitate the financial transactions, as well as a system and method for converting users' data and information to\/from the standard vocabulary and communicating such information through the system in an automated manner.","1. Manual Transaction Process",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0178","num":"0177"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},"a. Pre-Transaction","When a company and bank decide to engage in financial transactions, the parties first establish their relationship by executing certain standardized agreements (step ). Such agreements govern the rules of engagement, rate sources, confirmation and settlement procedures, and other information that can be reused over a series of transaction between the parties. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (\u201cISDA\u201d) <http:\/\/www.isda.org> provides certain standardized agreements (e.g., \u201c1992 ISDA Master Agreement\u201d) that may be used by the parties for these purposes. The company and bank may engage in multiple iterations of this step, depending upon the number of standardized agreements that the parties will execute.","Next, the company and bank negotiates one or more lines of credit to be assigned by the bank to the company for future transactions (step ). In assigning a credit line to a company, the bank analyzes the company's asset portfolio, credit ratings, and type of financial transactions to be executed by company.","b. Transaction","Once the company and bank have established their relationship and negotiated a credit line, the company can commence the process of engaging in a financial transaction. The company must decide on the type of transaction it wishes to execute (e.g., Foreign Exchange Spot, Foreign Exchange Forward, Interest Rate Swap, etc.) and structure the desired transaction (step ), including the various details and parameters. For example, the company might specify a Foreign Exchange Spot transaction in which the company desires to buy 1 million Euro currency for U.S. Dollars, with the transaction request set to expire on Dec. 1, 2000 at 11:59 P.M. Pacific Standard Time.","After structuring the transaction, the company communicates a request for pricing of the transaction to one or more banks (step ). Each such bank, in turn, receives and reviews the company's pricing request (step ). If interested in the company's transaction, the bank can create a pricing offer for the transaction (step ) and submit the pricing offer (i.e., price quote) to the requesting company (step ). Each pricing offer typically has an expiration period because of constantly changing market conditions, and the bank may submit modified pricing offers to the company, based on market conditions and negotiations.","The company receives and reviews any pricing offers submitted by banks (step ). The company selects one or more pricing offers (step ) and negotiates with the particular bank(s) who provided the offer(s). The number of iterations of negotiations depends upon the market volatility and other conditions. Upon completion of such negotiations regarding pricing offers, the company accepts a pricing offer and communicate its acceptance to the offering bank (step ).","c. Post-Transaction","Upon receipt of the company's acceptance of its pricing offer, the bank sends confirmation of the transaction to the company (step ), including specific terms, payment dates, and amounts. Following confirmation, the company and bank schedule settlement of the transaction and future payments related to the transaction (step ).","2. System Architecture Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0189","num":"0188"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In describing the present embodiment of this invention, the descriptive terms \u201cMember\u201d and \u201cProvider\u201d are used to identify the parties on the opposite sides of financial transactions (e.g., buyer and seller of foreign exchange). In this and other embodiments of this invention, however, users defined as \u201cMembers\u201d can engage in transactions with other \u201cMembers\u201d, and users defined as \u201cProviders\u201d can engage in transactions with other \u201cProviders\u201d; in such transactions, one user will occupy the position of \u201cMember\u201d and utilize the \u201cMember\u201d functionality, and the other user will occupy the position of \u201cProvider\u201d and utilize the \u201cProvider\u201d functionality.","a. Server Side","The server side (sometimes referred to as the \u201cCFOWeb System\u201d in this embodiment) communicates with the client side (consisting of users known as \u201cMembers\u201d, e.g., corporations and institutional investors, and \u201cProviders\u201d, e.g., financial institutions) via the Internet (including the World Wide Web) . The server side includes a variety of interactive system servers that provide functionality to users. Web server  enables communications (through the Internet via a transfer protocol such as, e.g., HyperText Transfer Protocol (\u201cHTTP\u201d) or TCP\/IP) between users who connect to the server side through their web browsers  and the various system servers. Trading server  provides a graphic user interface and applications that enable users to interactively trade financial derivatives among each other. Portfolio management server  provides a graphic user interface and applications that enable users to manage their portfolios of financial derivatives. Reports server  provides a graphic user interface and applications that enable users to run and produce standard and customizable reports regarding their portfolios, including mark to market, upcoming events, and trade lists. Analysis server  provides a graphic user interface and applications that enable users to run analytics against their portfolios, including valuation, and interest rate sensitivity. Calendar server  provides a graphic user interface and applications that enable users to automatically calendar key dates regarding settlement, payments, cash flows, and other details related to their financial derivative transactions and portfolios. News and research server  provides a graphic user interface and applications that enable users to obtain real-time market data and financial and other news, as well as proprietary third-party data feeds. News and research server  includes connections to real-time market data feeds and news services  and third-party data feeds .","The interactive system servers also include servers that enable communication among system users and administrators. Chat server  provides real-time chat, thus enabling users to engage in discussion forums related to financial derivatives. Paging server  enables users to build a messaging community and determine which users are online and available to receive messages at a given instance (i.e., instant messaging). E-mail server  provides an intra-system electronic mail vehicle, enabling communications among users and system administrators, including all aspects of a financial trade from quote requests to settlement. Message boards server  provides an arena for users and system administrators to post and read system-wide messages, as well as quote requests and quotes.","Automated messaging server  (sometimes referred to as the \u201cConnect Messaging Server\u201d in this embodiment) controls communications (through the Internet via a transfer protocol, e.g., HTTP or TCP\/IP) between the various system servers of the server side and users whose internal, back-end systems  execute automated processes that require communication with the server side. Such automated processes could include transaction pricing , payment scheduling and journaling , derivatives trading , trade confirmation , and trade settlement . Communications between Connect Messaging Server  and the client side pass through automated processor  (sometimes referred to as the \u201cConnect Processor\u201d in this embodiment)\u2014which shares the same functionality as automated messaging server \u2014and automated message broker  and are facilitated using the \u201cFinXML\u201d vocabulary and the \u201cFinScript\u201d processing language, as described below.","The CFOWeb System includes one or more system databases , which store data related to the processing of financial transactions, as well as user communications and interactions with the system servers.","b. Client Side","The client side includes functionality that enables users\u2014Members and Providers\u2014to communicate, either interactively or in an automated manner, with the various system servers. Web browser  enables interactive communications (through the Internet via a transfer protocol, e.g., HTTP or TCP\/IP) between users and the CFOWeb System with connection made on the server side at web server . Interactive communications might include: requesting price quotes (Members), monitoring and reviewing quote requests (Providers), issuing price quotes (Providers), monitoring and reviewing price quotes (Members), negotiation between Members and Providers, acceptance of price quotes (Members), reporting, portfolio management, analysis of financial information and market data, calendaring, and communications among Members, Providers, and\/or system administrators, including e-mail, chat, and message boards.","Alternatively, users can communicate with the server side in an automated manner via Connect Processor  (and automated message broker ) which communicates (through the Internet via a transfer protocol, e.g., HTTP or TCP\/IP) with Connect Messaging Server . Such automated communications enable users' internal back-end systems  (which include one or more back-end databases ) to execute automated processes, which could include transaction pricing , payment scheduling and journaling , derivatives trading , trade confirmation , and trade settlement . Such communications are facilitated using the \u201cFinXML\u201d vocabulary and the \u201cFinScript\u201d processing language, as described below.","3. Financial Transaction Functionality","For system users\u2014Members and Providers\u2014the functionality included in an embodiment of this invention can be categorized as follows: pre-transaction, transaction, post-transaction, and general. The present invention (i) automates and\/or (ii) provides an interactive interface for such functionality.","a. Pre-Transaction","Members and Providers (or in other embodiments of this invention, Members and Members) that engage in a financial transaction of a type enabled by this invention proceed through a series of steps illustrated in . When a Member and Provider decide that they may engage in financial transactions in the future, the parties establish their relationship by executing certain agreements (step ). Such agreements (e.g., \u201c1992 ISDA Master Agreement\u201d) govern the rules of engagement, rate sources, confirmation and settlement procedures, and other information that can be reused over a series of transaction between the parties. The parties can carry out this step by using the interactive e-mail function of the system (provided by e-mail server  in ) to exchange information to be included in the agreements. In addition, by combining off-the-shelf electronic signature software with the system, the parties can electronically sign and exchange the standardized agreements. Members and Providers may engage in multiple iterations of this step, depending upon the number of standardized agreements that the parties will execute.","Next, the Member and Provider will negotiate one or more lines of credit to be assigned by the Provider to the Member for future transactions (step ). Each Member will negotiate such line(s) of credit with each Provider with which the Member intends to engage in future transactions. In assigning a credit line to a Member, the Provider will analyze the Member's asset portfolio, credit ratings, and type of financial transactions to be executed by Member. The parties can carry out this step via the \u201cCredit Relationships\u201d interactive user interface shown in  (described below), in which a Member can specify one or more Providers to receive electronic requests via the system to establish credit relationships. Alternatively, the parties can carry out this step using the interactive e-mail function of the system (provided by e-mail server  in ), the paging (instant messaging) function of the system (provided by paging server  in ), or the chat function of the system (provided by e-mail server  in ) to exchange information during the credit line negotiations.","b. Transaction","Once the Member and Provider have established their relationship and negotiated a credit line, the Member can commence the process of engaging in a financial transaction. The Member must decide on the type of transaction it wishes to execute (e.g., Foreign Exchange Spot, Foreign Exchange Forward, Interest Rate Swap, etc.) and structure the desired transaction (step ). In this step, the Member will use the interactive trading function of the system (provided by trading server  in ), including graphic user interfaces and tools. Depending upon the type of transaction, the structure might include pricing variables, an expiration period, a list of Providers to whom the Member would like to request pricing, and any other particulars specific to the Member and the desired transaction. For example, a Member might specify a Foreign Exchange Spot transaction in which the Member desires to buy 1 million Euro currency for U.S. Dollars, with the transaction request set to expire on Jul. 30, 2000 at 11:59 P.M. Pacific Standard Time.","After structuring the transaction, the Member submits a request for pricing of the transaction to one or more Providers (step ), using the interactive trading function of the system (provided by trading server  in ). Alternatively, the Member might communicate a request for pricing directly to a particular Provider using the interactive e-mail function of the system (provided by e-mail server  in ). Such an e-mail communication would include a URL to the structured transaction and request for pricing.","Providers monitor and review the Member's pricing request (step ) via communications between the automated messaging server  and automated processor , as will be described below. Such communications result in the posting of pricing requests on a request-monitoring interface hosted by the system. Upon reviewing the transaction and pricing request on the interactive monitoring interface, including information about the particular Member (unless the Member's identity was not disclosed), a Provider can create and submit a pricing offer (i.e., price quote) to the requesting Member (step ). The Provider creates the pricing offer using the interactive interfaces (described below) controlled by trading server . The submission of the pricing offer occurs via a communication between the automated processor  and automated messaging server , as will be described below. Each pricing offer typically has an expiration period because of constantly changing market conditions, and the Provider may submit multiple iterations of modified pricing offers to the Member. In some embodiments of this invention, the Provider can modify the structure of the Member's transaction (e.g., change the transaction amount) (step ) before creating and submitting the pricing offer to the Member. Such modification may proceed through multiple iterations.","The Member can monitor and review any pricing offers submitted by Providers (step ) on an interactive monitoring interface hosted by the system. The Member will select one or more pricing offers (step ) and negotiate with the particular Provider(s) who provided the offer(s). In the present embodiment, such negotiations may occur using the interactive e-mail function of the system (provided by e-mail server  in ), the paging (instant messaging) function of the system (provided by paging server  in ), or the chat function of the system (provided by chat server  in ), or through traditional methods (e.g., telephone calls). The number of iterations of negotiations will depend upon the market volatility and other conditions. In other embodiments of this invention, such negotiations may be unnecessary if certain parameters are met by a Provider's pricing offer. Note that at this stage in the process, the Member may decide to modify the structure of the Member's original transaction (e.g., change the transaction amount) (step ) and submit a new pricing request to one or more Providers (step ). Such modification may proceed through multiple iterations.","Following negotiations regarding pricing offers, the Member will accept the best pricing offer (step ) and communicate its acceptance to the Provider using the interactive trading function of the system (provided by trading server  in ). The Provider will receive the Member's acceptance via communications between the automated messaging server  and automated processor , as will be described below. Such communications result in the posting of the Member's acceptance of the pricing offer on the request monitoring interface hosted by the system.","c. Post-Transaction","Upon receipt of the Member's acceptance, the Provider sends confirmation of the transaction to the Member (step ), including specific terms, payment dates, and amounts. The Provider sends the confirmation information to the Member via communications between the automated processor  and the automated messaging server , as will be described below. The Provider's back-end system  provides automated processing of this information.","Following confirmation, the Member and Provider will submit the transaction to their respective back-end systems  (step ) for purposes including internal accounting and payment scheduling. This step can be handled by the system via an automated connection between the automated processor  and the back-end system . Using their respective back-end systems , the Member and Provider schedule settlement of the transaction and future payments (step ).","d. General","Interactive system functionality that can be accessed and implemented at any time by the Member and Provider includes: reporting; portfolio management; risk management; analysis of financial information and market data; e-mail communication with Members, Providers, and system administrators; chat with Members and Providers; message boards; calendaring; and paging. This functionality is made available to Members and Providers via buttons and\/or pull-down menus on the system's interactive user interfaces (described below).","B. Automated Processing and Transferring of Financial Information","The present embodiment of this invention supports financial transactions between Members and Providers by providing automated processing and transfer of the underlying financial information between the messaging server of the server side and the automated processor of the client side. The system enables such processing and transfer by using a novel tag-based language\u2014FinXML\u2122\u2014that describes financial instrument trades, including transaction-specific data, reference data, and market data. FinXML conforms to the () 1.0 (Feb. 10, 1998), World Wide Web Consortium (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique, Keio University) <http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/REC-xml>. The XML Recommendation describes a set of rules for conforming documents that is based around the use of element tags which mark the components of a document or describe the structure of data files as textual documents.","FinXML also conforms to the 1991 (and 1998 ) of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (\u201cISDA\u201d) <http:\/\/www.isda.org>. The ISDA Definitions provide a set of standard terms for use in privately-negotiated financial derivatives transactions. The element tags and attribute names and values defined in FinXML, as described below, correspond to the terms defined in the ISDA Definitions.","FinXML, as a type of XML vocabulary, is ideally suited to electronic transmission over corporate intranets, extranets, and the Internet (including the World Wide Web), using a transfer protocol such as HTTP or TCP\/IP. The HTTP protocol is intended to transmit text documents such as the HyperText Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d) documents used to describe the pages to be displayed in a Web browser. XML documents\u2014and, thus, FinXML documents\u2014are similar to HTML documents in that both types of documents are text-based, both consist of a mixture of element tags and data content, and both may include references to other external material.","In a basic financial transaction between two organizations, a financial transaction encoded in XML is sent using a transfer protocol such as HTTP or TCP\/IP from a client application of one organization to a server of the other organization. The server, in turn, sends back a response that is also encoded in XML.","As will be described below, the present embodiment of this invention includes a novel method of encoding\/decoding financial objects to\/from FinXML (or other XML) documents using the automated processor  (also known as \u201cConnect Processor\u201d) and automated messaging server  (also known as \u201cConnect Messaging Server\u201d). In a financial transaction between two organizations, one organization (e.g., a Member) submits a Java object to automated processor  which, as will be described below, uses a XML mapping and FinScript\u2122\u2014proprietary stylesheets created in Extensible Stylesheet Language (\u201cXSL\u201d)\u2014to create a FinXML (or other XML) document that can be sent using a transfer protocol such as HTTP or TCP\/IP to the automated messaging server  for conversion to an object and processing on the server side. Following processing, the automated messaging server  converts objects to a FinXML (or other XML) document and sends the document to the automated processor  which, as will be described below, uses FinScript to create a JavaScript program from the FinXML (or other XML) document. In turn, Java objects are created from the JavaScript program and sent to the other organization (e.g., a Provider). XSL, which serves as the foundation for FinScript, is described in the () 1.0 (Mar. 27, 2000), World Wide Web Consortium (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique, Keio University) <http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/xsl>.","1. FinXML","In the present embodiment of this invention, FinXML documents are distributed between servers in order to communicate the details of financial transactions and related data. The FinXML syntax provides a general structure for all financial transactions. The financial transactions, in turn, consist of underlying elements, each of which contains attributes and\/or other elements.","a. Trade Structure","The basic financial transaction element of the FinXML syntax is a \u201cTrade\u201d, of which there are multiple types (described below). The Trade element is the root element for the description of each financial transaction object. The Trade element is contained within the Connect message \u201cpayload\u201d component (described below).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0224","num":"0223"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["500","510","510","515","520","500","530"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0225","num":"0224"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["(1)","Foreign Exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) Spot"]},{"entry":["(2)","FX Forward"]},{"entry":["(3)","Interest Rate Fixed Float Swap"]},{"entry":["(4)","Interest Rate Float Float Swap"]},{"entry":["(5)","Cap"]},{"entry":["(6)","Floor"]},{"entry":["(7)","Fixed Deposit"]},{"entry":["(8)","Fixed Loan"]},{"entry":["(9)","Float Deposit"]},{"entry":["(10)","Float Loan"]},{"entry":["(11)","FX Option"]},{"entry":["(12)","FX Swap"]},{"entry":["(13)","Cross Currency Fixed Fixed Swap"]},{"entry":["(14)","Cross Currency Fixed Float Swap"]},{"entry":["(15)","Cross Currency Float Float Swap"]},{"entry":["(16)","Forward Rate Agreement"]},{"entry":["(17)","Customized Trade"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"In the present embodiment of this invention, Trade element  has the following XML definition:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0227","num":"0226"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"308pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<!ELEMENT trade (% parties;, (fxSpot | fxForward | interestRateFixedFloatSwap |"},{"entry":"interestRateFloatFloatSwap | cap | floor | fixedDeposit | fixedLoan | floatDeposit | floatLoan | fxOption |"},{"entry":"fxSwap | crossCurrencyFixedFixedSwap | crossCurrencyFixedFloatSwap | crossCurrencyFloatFloatSwap |"},{"entry":"forwardRateAgreement | customizedTrade))>"},{"entry":"<!ATTLIST trade tradeId CDATA #REQUIRED isBuiltFromParameters CDATA #IMPLIED >"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"b.

Messaging middleware client application  sends the information, in the form of XML streams  to Connect Processor . Connect Processor  converts  the XML information into \u201cConnect\u201d message objects (including trade objects)  (as will be described below). Connect Processor  processes  the message objects  and, if related to trades, sends the message objects  to the CFOWeb System , including the content  provided by the Member or Provider. Alternatively, if the message objects  do not include information regarding specific financial transactions and relate to non-trade functions on CFOWeb System , Connect Processor  will send the message objects  as actions or events to be performed at one of the system servers.","Connect Processor  processes  messages  (which may include trade information) to Members or Providers by converting them into message objects . In addition, Connect Processor  processes actions and events  occurring at any of the system servers by converting them into message objects . Next, Connect Processor  converts  the message objects  into XML documents  (which may be in the form of FinXML documents). Connect Processor  sends the resulting XML documents  (e.g., a price quote or price quote request) to messaging middleware client application . Messaging middleware client application  sends the XML documents  to the automated message broker  of the appropriate Member or Provider through automated connection , for conversion into objects. Note that in parallel to the processing and conversion of messages and objects from CFOWeb System , Connect Processor  routes the appropriate destination  and addressing information  for the particular Member or Provider that will receive the XML documents . The XML documents (which may be in the form of FinXML documents) will be converted into objects appropriate for processing by the Member or Provider (as described below).","b.

The Member\/Provider system  communicates with Message Handler  by sending a synchronous response . The Member\/Provider system  sends an asynchronous response  to Message Constructor Servlet . Message Constructor Servlet  enables the Member\/Provider system  to asynchronously construct messages for the CFOWeb System  by sending parameters via transfer protocol (e.g., HTTP or TCP\/IP) calls.

In the present embodiment of this invention, the Connect Processor enables the communication of information related to financial transactions between users (i.e., Members and Providers) and the CFOWeb System by converting FinXML (or other XML) documents to\/from proprietary financial (Java) objects\u2014as used on the users' internal systems\u2014using proprietary stylesheets created in XSL, known as \u201cFinScript\u201d. The Connect Processor  (as shown in ) creates a FinXML document that can be sent using a transfer protocol (e.g., HTTP or TCP\/IP) to the Connect Messaging Server  for conversion to objects that can be processed on the server side. Following processing, the Connect Messaging Server  converts the objects to a FinXML (or other XML) document, using XSL stylesheets, and sends the FinXML (or other XML) document to the Connect Processor , which uses FinScript to create a JavaScript program from the FinXML (or other XML) document. In turn, Java objects are created from the JavaScript program and sent to the other organization (e.g., a Provider).","a. Conversion (Encoding) of Financial Objects to FinXML Documents","When a user (Member or Provider) wishes to send information (e.g., a quote request or a price quote) to the CFOWeb System, the Connect Processor must convert the proprietary financial objects used by the user's internal system into FinXML (or other XML) documents that can be used by the CFOWeb System.  illustrates the components of the conversion (or encoding) process and  shows the steps to be executed by the system to perform such conversion, in an embodiment of the present invention.

Conversion of non-XML Documents to Financial Objects","In other embodiments of this invention, the Connect Processor enables the communication of information related to financial transactions between users (i.e., Members and Providers) and the CFOWeb System by converting documents in non-XML formats, such as binary data streams, byte streams, other digital information streams, or hash tables, to\/from proprietary financial (Java) objects\u2014as used on the users' internal systems\u2014using the FinScript stylesheets described above. The Connect Processor  (as shown in ) can create a non-XML-format document that can be sent using a transfer protocol (e.g., HTTP or TCP\/IP) to the Connect Messaging Server  for conversion to objects that can be processed on the server side. Following processing, the Connect Messaging Server  converts the objects to a non-XML-format document, using XSL stylesheets, and sends the document to the Connect Processor , which uses FinScript to create a JavaScript program from the document. In turn, Java objects are created from the JavaScript program and sent to the other organization (e.g., a Provider).","4. Multi-Portal \u201cConnect\u201d Processor","In an embodiment of the present invention, the above-described Connect Processor can be modified to enable multiple, separate portals to communicate with the Connect Processor, and in turn each other, simultaneously. Such portals can include banks (i.e., Providers) and corporate entities (i.e., Members) that desire to engage in financial transactions of the type described herein using the system.","There are several scenarios under which multi-portal transactions can occur using the Connect Processor. First, a single corporate entity can conduct transactions with one or more banks, where the corporate entity and each bank use the same message set (e.g., XML-based or non-XML-based message set) and protocol. Second, one or more corporate entities can conduct transactions with a single bank, where the parties to a transaction may use different message sets and protocols; the Connect Processor will translate the parties' transaction messages into a common message set (e.g., FinXML) and aggregate them into a single message flow for processing by the bank, as well as translate messages from the bank into the message set and protocol applicable to each corporate entity. Third, one or more banks can conduct transactions with a single corporate entity, where the parties to a transaction may use different message sets and protocols; the Connect Processor will translate the parties' transaction messages into a common message set (e.g., FinXML) and aggregate them into a single message flow for communication with the corporate entity, as well as translate messages from the corporate entity into the message set and protocol applicable to each bank.","a. Architecture","The architecture of the multi-portal embodiment of the Connect Processor, as modified to enable multi-portal transactions, is shown in . Multiple external portals (portals , , ) from banks and corporate entities connect to Connect Processor  via public or private networks. Each portal has an associated client (clients , , ) that receives incoming messages from the portal, as well as response messages sent from Connect Processor . Each client is connected to an associated bridge (bridges , , ).","Each bridge is a \u201cplug-in\u201d adapter that, in turn, consists of an incoming \u201creceiver\u201d adapter and an outgoing \u201csender\u201d adapter and performs a certain function. Such plug-in adapters may be included with the system Connect Processor  or created by a corporate entity or bank for interface with Connect Processor . The bridge serves to convert between the native message format of the associated portal (XML-based or non-XML-based) and the standard format of Connect Processor  (e.g., FinXML), and tie together the transport protocol (e.g., DLL, FTP, JMS, etc.) of the associated portal with that of Connect Processor . Each bridge is connected to an associated bus client (bus clients , , ) that serves to send\/receive messages to\/from and communicate with Bus . The bus clients can use filters to control the delivery and receipt of messages by a particular entity. Such filters can be specified in the form of message header properties applied to each message, where such properties include information such as system identifier, entity name, message type, transaction type, time zone, currency type, and other profile information provided by the entity.","Bus  connects the various bridges, services, translators, message builders and other plug-in adapters connected to Connect Processor . Bus  determines the appropriate bus client to which each message will be dispatched, using a dispatch registry. The dispatch registry is a database that includes, for each bank and corporate entity connected to Connect Processor , the address of a specific bus client for each type of message that the bank or corporate entity indicated it is willing to receive in its system profile information. Note that the different \u201cchannels\u201d (i.e., portals, services, translators, message builder, etc.) for which Bus  enables inter-communication may not know about each other. For example, corporate entities and banks can communicate through a common set of \u201ctopics\u201d, by sending messages to the topic and specifying the topics for which messages should be received. An entity could send a message to the topic without knowing whether any other entities or banks were currently \u201clistening\u201d to the topic; conversely, an entity could subscribe to receive messages related to a particular topic without knowing whether any other entities or banks were currently \u201cpublishing\u201d to the topic. Bus  determines how to route such topic messages to the appropriate destinations.","In addition to portals, other functionality may be connected to Connect Processor , such as a database containing information necessary for generating certain response messages, for example, exchange or interest rate information. Database , for example, is connected to Connect Processor  via Database Client . Database Client  receives data from Database , as well as data request messages sent from Connect Processor . Database Client  is connected to Cache Service , a plug-in adapter that creates data request messages from FinXML messages received from Connect Processor . Cache Service  is connected to Cache Bus Client  that serves to send\/receive messages to\/from and communicate with Bus .","Message Builder , in combination with Message Builder Bridge , creates FinXML response messages to messages sent by portals via Connect Processor . Message Builder Bus Client  serves to send\/receive messages to\/from and communicate with Bus .","One or more translators (, ) serve to transform one application language into another, independent of portals and bridges, as necessary for exchanging transaction messages. For example, a translator might translate XSL stylesheets into XML-based or non-XML-based objects. Translator bus clients (, ) serve to send\/receive messages to\/from and communicate with Bus .","b. Message Flow","The message flow of the multi-portal embodiment of the Connect Processor, as modified to enable multi-portal transactions, is shown in . In a typical transaction, such as a request for a quote submitted by a corporate entity to one or more recipient banks using the system, the corporate entity\u2014e.g., Portal 1  in FIG. \u2014submits a quote request for a particular type of transaction (e.g., swap, spot, etc.) to the system, i.e., Connect Processor . Client 1  receives the incoming message from its associated Portal 1  (step  in ). Bridge 1  converts the message from the native format used by the corporate entity in Portal 1  into a \u201cConnect Message,\u201d i.e., a message in the format used by Connect Processor , e.g., FinXML (step ). Next, associated Bus Client 1  sends the Connect Message via Bus  to the appropriate destination, as determined by Bus  (step ). In this particular example, the destination is Message Builder ; with respect to other messages, the destination might be another portal, or a service, such as Cache Service , or a language translator, such as Translator 1 .","Message Builder Bus Client  receives the Connect Message from Bus  and Message Builder , in combination with Message Builder Bridge , constructs a FinXML response message to the Connect Message (step ). Message Builder Bus Client  sends the response message via Bus  to the appropriate portal(s), for example the portals of one or more banks. In this example, Message Builder Bus Client  sends the response message via Bus  to Bus Client 2  (step ). Bridge 2  (associated with Bus Client 2 ) converts the response message from FinXML to the native message format utilized by destination Portal 2  (step ). Finally, Bridge 2  sends the response message in the native format to Client 2  (step ) for processing by Portal 2 .","5. \u201cAuto Dealer\u201d Processing Engine","In an embodiment of the present invention, the system includes the \u201cAuto Dealer\u201d processing engine that enables banks to provide instantaneous responses to requests for quotes placed by entities that desire to engage in financial transactions using the system described herein. The \u201cAuto Dealer\u201d processing engine integrates a bank's internal processing systems and automates one- and two-way pricing, margining, and credit checking mechanisms.","The message flow of the Auto Dealer processing engine is shown in . In a typical transaction, a corporate entity will submit a request for a quote (via the entity's system integrated with Auto Dealer) which is received by one or more recipient banks using the system (step ). The recipient banks will be those banks that set their profile information to allow receipt of a quote request based on the specified type of transaction, the specified currency, the amount of the request, and\/or the identity of the requesting entity. Upon receipt of the quote request, the processing engine will check the requesting entity's profile in order to determine whether the entity is permitted to engage in \u201cauto\u201d trading and receive auto quotes (step ). If not, manual intervention will be required (step ), whereby the bank (i.e., an employee) will make the decision to create and send a manual quote to the requesting entity (step ) or decline to send a quote (step ).","If the requesting entity is permitted to engage in \u201cauto\u201d trading, the processing engine will perform credit verification regarding the entity (step ), in order to determine whether the entity has an established line of credit with a particular bank or whether, based on the entity's financial status, the bank is willing to provide a credit line to the entity, engage in a financial transaction with the entity, and offer it a price quote. The credit relationship and amount will be confirmed if a quote acceptance is subsequently received for an issued price quote. The credit amount will be withdrawn in the event that a quote request expires or is withdrawn by the requesting entity. If the credit verification is not successful, manual intervention will be required (step ), whereby the bank (i.e., an employee) will make the decision to create and send a manual quote to the requesting entity (step ) or decline to send a quote (step ).","If the credit verification of the requesting entity is successful, the processing engine will access raw market data (step ), for use in creating a price quote. In an embodiment of this invention, this step may be performed by accessing an electronic spreadsheet containing currency pairs, spot and forward dates, and continually-updated currency rates (bid and offer) for those dates. If, because of a technical problem or lack of an updated rate, market data related to the quote request cannot be accessed, manual intervention will be required (step ), whereby the bank (i.e., an employee) will make the decision to create and send a manual quote to the requesting entity (step ) or decline to send a quote (step ).","If the market data access is successful, the processing engine will check the trade parameters of the quote request (step ), in order to determine whether the transaction specified in the quote request is executable, e.g., whether the specified currency is tradable and whether the specified notional amount is within the bank's acceptable bid\/offer range. If not, manual intervention will be required (step ), whereby the bank (i.e., an employee) will make the decision to create and send a manual quote to the requesting entity (step ) or decline to send a quote (step ).","If verification of the trade parameters is successful, the processing engine will initiate the calculation of spreads and margins, as applicable (step ), which are necessary for the creation of a price quote. Such calculation will incorporate the following factors: transaction currency pair, trade type, trade tenor, notional amount, and margin level. A bank can define multiple margin types, such as sales margin, branch margin, and volume margin, each of which would be applicable in different situations. Margins could also be customized for particular trading entities. Typically, each margin type would have two versions: a bid-side version and an offer-side version.","After calculating the margin, the processing engine will then prepare the auto quote response containing the price quote (step ) and send the auto quote response to the requesting entity (step ).","Note that in another embodiment of this invention, the credit verification (step ), access of raw market data (step ), and verification of trade parameters (step ) steps are not inter-dependent and should all be processed independently, regardless of whether any of those steps were not successful. If any of those steps were not successful, then the processing engine will route the request to manual intervention (step ) prior to initiating the calculation of spreads and margins (step ).","The processing engine also enables the bank to create and send multiple price quotes for each quote request received. For example, if a price quote expires but the underlying quote request is still valid (i.e., not expired or withdrawn), the processing engine can be set to automatically issue a new price quote from the bank (if the bank set its profile for such automatic quote issuance).","The Auto Dealer processing engine includes user interfaces for the input of transaction parameters.  illustrates the \u201cTrader Price Maintenance\u201d user interface that enables a bank trader to change, at any moment, the parameters for a given currency pair and trade type combination, including the following: tenor, bid and offer amount, bid and offer currency, trader margins (bid and offer), default expiry time, and currency tradable indicator. The trader could also add or remove currency pairs for a particular trade type using the \u201cTrader Preferences\u201d interface illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0597","num":"0946"},"figref":"FIG. 129"},"The processing engine also provides interfaces for the generation of manual price quotes, in situations in which certain steps of the auto quote process were not successful (e.g., credit verification, access of market data, trade parameter verification). Such interfaces show quote request details, credit verification details, and market data details, and enable the bank to input and modify the price quote and margins.  illustrates such an interface for a Spot transaction; similar interfaces exist for other types of transactions.","C. Interactive Processing of Financial Information","The present embodiment of this invention includes a web-based system that enables users (e.g., Members and Providers) to interactively communicate and trade financial instruments among one another and to manage their portfolios. Interactive communications supported by the system include: establishing credit relationships, structuring financial transactions, requesting price quotes, monitoring and reviewing quote requests, issuing price quotes, monitoring and reviewing price quotes, negotiations between Members and Providers, acceptance and confirmation of price quotes, reporting, portfolio management, analysis of financial information and market data, and communications among Members, Providers, and\/or system administrators, including e-mail, chat, and message boards.","When a user (e.g., a Member or Provider) accesses the web-based system, the system presents the user with a home page as shown in . This page includes a registration link for new users and member login interface  for existing users, which requires entry of the user's account ID and password. The home pages also includes market data and news headlines, as well as links to the following system functionality (each of which will be described below):\n\n","1. Transaction-Specific Functionality","The functionality provided by the present embodiment of this invention enables users to conduct interactive and automated financial transactions in capital markets. The types of transactions that may be conducted are described above. The functionality and interactive user interfaces that support the creation and execution of such transactions enable users to engage in pre-transaction, transaction, and post-transaction activities. Note that the functionality and interfaces described in this embodiment could be combined with other functionality and interfaces, or certain of such functionality and interfaces (or portions thereof) could be isolated in separate systems, in various other embodiments of this invention. The system can be implemented as a stand-alone central system or as a distributed system, with separate versions of the functionality and interfaces distributed to multiple users' platforms or portals. In other embodiments, portions of the system functionality and interfaces could be divided into separate systems (e.g., a transaction structuring system, a price quote system, a transaction acceptance system) with a communication links that enable the different systems to exchange data. Other embodiments will be apparent to and could be implemented by practitioners skilled in this art.","a. Pre-Transaction","The present embodiment of this invention enables Members and Providers to interactively establish certain defaults and parameters that will facilitate the on-line financial transactions.","i. Filtering","As will be described below with respect to the present embodiment, this invention provides each user (Member or Provider) of the system with the ability to customize their interaction with the trading community through the use of automated filters. By selecting user-defined and\/or system-defined criteria from an interactive filtering interface, a user can set limits and restrictions on (i) which other users will receive communications, such as messages, transaction requests, and\/or price quotes, from the user via the system and (ii) which communications, such as messages, transactions requests, and\/or price quotes, the user will receive from other users via the system.","Example filtering criteria for limiting recipient users include:\n\n","Example filtering criteria for restricting receipt of communications include:\n\n","For example, a user could set a filter such that only price quotes from U.S. banks for FX Swap transactions be sent to the user via the system.

Indicative quotes may also be used where the Member does not yet have a credit relationship with the Provider. The Provider can identify an indicative price quote as such using the comments field of the quote.","v. Execution of Transaction","Using an embodiment of this invention, Members and Providers can engage in the online execution of financial transactions. An example of such a transaction\u2014a Foreign Exchange Spot (\u201cFX Spot\u201d) transaction\u2014is described below with reference to the flowchart set forth in . Note that these steps could be executed using this invention for each of the different types of transactions described herein.","(a) Preliminary Steps","This example presupposes that the Member and Provider have executed the standardized agreements necessary for online trading using the system (step  in ) and that they have negotiated a credit line to be assigned to the Member (step ). As described above, these steps can be performed using the \u201cTrading Documentation\u201d interface shown in , which includes credit relationship functionality, as well as the various communication mechanisms provided by the system.","(b) Structuring of Transaction and Request","The Member must first structure and create the desired transaction request (step  in ). The \u201cNew Request\u201d interface, shown in , is the starting point for that task, as it provides a road map to the various new request interfaces included in the present embodiment of the invention. In this example, the Member desires to create a FX Spot transaction, so the Member clicks on \u201cFX Spot\/Forward\u201d button , which causes the system to display the \u201cNew Request: FX\u201d interface, shown in .

On this interface, the Member can review the details and parameters of the transaction request before sending it to one or more Providers (by clicking \u201cSend\u201d button ). If, after review, the Member wishes to modify any of the transaction request details or parameters, the Member can return to the \u201cNew Request: FX\u201d interface () or \u201cParameters\u201d interface (), as necessary.","Upon submission of the transaction request to one or more Providers (step  in ), the Member can review the transaction request and its status, including any price quote information, via the \u201cRequest Detail: FX Spot\u201d interface, shown in  and described above.","(c) Monitoring and Review of Transaction Request","The next step in the execution of the trade is the receipt and review of the Member's transaction request by one or more Providers (step  in ). Using the system, Providers monitor incoming transaction requests using the request monitor interfaces described above. In addition, if specified as a preference, a Provider can receive automatic notifications (e.g., e-mail messages) from the system upon receipt of a new transaction request. The \u201cRequest Monitor: Current\u201d interface, shown in  and described above, displays the new transaction request. In the present example, the Member's FX Spot request is displayed with the system-assigned identification number \u201c5064\u201d. Clicking on that identification number (button ) will cause the system to display the \u201cRequest Detail: FX Spot\u201d interface, shown in  and described above, from which the Provider can create a responsive price quote. Alternatively, the Provider may choose to decline the transaction request, by clicking \u201cDecline\u201d button  in , which will trigger a system notification to the Member that the Provider declined the request. The new FX Spot transaction request will also be displayed on the Provider's (i) \u201cRequest Monitor: New\u201d interface, shown in  and described above, and (ii)) \u201cRequest Monitor: Active\u201d interface, shown in  and described above.","(d) Creation and Submission of Price Quote","After receiving and reviewing the Member's transaction request, if desired, the Provider may create and submit a responsive price quote (step  in ) using the \u201cRequest Detail: FX Spot\u201d interface, shown in  and describe above. Using this interface, the Provider inputs the foreign exchange quote rate (\u201c0.920000\u201d in field ) to be offered to the Member. This step may go through multiple iterations during negotiations between the Provider and the Member, with such negotiations occurring via the communication mechanisms provided by the system (chat, e-mail, instant messaging) or traditional means such as telephone. After submitting its quote, the Provider can monitor the status of the quote using the \u201cRequest Monitor: Active\u201d interface, shown in  and described above. The Provider may withdraw the quote at any time while the quote is \u201cActive\u201d.","(e) Monitoring and Review of Price Quotes","The next step in the execution of the trade is the receipt and review of price quotes from one or more Providers by the Member (step  in ). Using the system, Members monitor incoming quotes using the request monitor interfaces described above. In addition, if specified as a preference, a Member can receive automatic notifications (e.g., e-mail messages) from the system upon receipt of a new transaction request. The \u201cRequest Monitor: Current\u201d interface, shown in  and described above, displays the new quote. In the present example, the Member's FX Spot request and the Provider's quote is displayed with the system-assigned identification number \u201c5064\u201d. The display indicates that the member has received one quote in response to its transaction request. Clicking on the request identification number (button ) will cause the system to display the \u201cRequest Detail: FX Spot\u201d interface, shown in  and described above. This interface displays the details of the Member's request as well as the details of the Provider's quote.","(f) Selection and Acceptance of Price Quote","After receiving and reviewing the price quote(s) from one or more Providers, unless the Member withdraws its request (as described above), the Member will select the price quote(s) of one or more Providers and likely negotiate with the Provider(s) to obtain a more favorable quote (step  in ). Such negotiations may occur via the communication mechanisms provided by the system (chat, e-mail, instant messaging) or traditional means such as telephone. For example, the Member could click on \u201cChat\u201d button  shown in  to engage in negotiations with the Provider regarding the price quote for that FX Spot transaction. Following such negotiations, the Member will accept the quote from one of the Providers (step  in ). The Member can automatically perform this step by clicking \u201cAccept\u201d button  shown in . This will cause the system to display the \u201cAcceptance: FX Spot\u201d interface shown in . This interface displays the details of the accepted quote and transaction, including terms and counterparty information.","The Member's action of clicking \u201cAccept\u201d button  shown in  will also update the respective request monitors of the Member and the Provider. The Member's \u201cRequest Monitor: Accepted\u201d, shown in  and described above, displays the aggregated details of the Member's accepted transaction requests, including the FX Spot transaction (\u201c5064\u201d) of the present example.","(g) Verification of Accepted Transaction","The Provider's \u201cRequest Monitor: Current\u201d interface, shown in  and described above, will display the aggregated details of the Provider's active price quotes accepted by Members, including the FX Spot transaction (\u201c5064\u201d) of the present example. In addition, if specified as a preference, a Provider can receive automatic notifications (e.g., e-mail messages) from the system upon receipt of acceptance of a quote by a Member. At this stage, and using this interface, the Provider could attempt to further communicate or negotiate with the Member (e.g., by initiating a chat session by clicking \u201cChat\u201d button ) or verify (i.e., confirm) the Member's acceptance of the Provider's quote. This verification step (step  in ) can be performed by clicking \u201cVerify\u201d button  shown in . Upon verification, the system will re-categorize the transaction from an Active\u201d request to a \u201cRecently Completed\u201d quote, as shown in . In this example, the FX Spot transaction (\u201c5064\u201d) is shown with a status of \u201cVerified\u201d. The transaction will also be displayed on the Provider's \u201cRequest Monitor: Verified\u201d interface, shown in  and described above. In addition, this verification will be displayed on (i) the Member's \u201cRequest Monitor: Verified\u201d interface, shown in  and described above, and (ii) the \u201cRequest Monitor: Current\u201d of other Providers, on which the transaction request will be displayed with a status of \u201cDealt Away\u201d.","(h) Settlement and Back-End Processing","Following acceptance and verification of the transaction and quote, the Member and Provider can use the system of this invention to automatically update their proprietary back-end systems regarding the transaction (step  in ), as described above, and to communicate with each other regarding settlement and payment (step  in ). The system also enables the Member and Provider to continue to track and manage the transaction, including cashflows and fees, as will be described below.","2.

Multi-Bank Pricing","The inventions described herein can be implemented to process transactions involving multiple bank users, for example, a bank-to-bank-to-bank-to-corporate user transaction. By way of example, as shown in , corporate user  seeks a price quote for a particular currency-pair transaction from regional bank  and sends Request for Quote 1. Unknown to corporate user , upon receipt of Request for Quote 1, regional bank  automatically generates and sends Request for Quote 2 to money centre bank , using the same terms and parameters as Request for Quote 1. Note that regional bank  can send Request for Quote 2 to more than one money centre bank in order to receive the best price quote from multiple money centre banks.","If money centre bank  does not make a currency trading market in the particular currency pair of Request for Quote 2, money centre bank , unknown to regional bank , automatically generates and sends Request for Quote 3 to local bank , using the same terms and parameters as Request for Quote 2. Note that money centre bank  can send Request for Quote 3 to more than one local bank in order to receive the best price quote from multiple local banks.","If local bank  makes a currency trading market in the particular currency pair of Request for Quote 3, local bank  automatically generates and sends Price Quote A to money centre bank , which represents the price at which local bank  will deal with money centre bank  for the requested currency-pair transaction. If local bank  does not make a currency trading market in the particular currency pair of Request for Quote 3, local bank , unknown to money centre bank , automatically generates and sends a request for quote to one or more other banks (not shown), using the same terms and parameters as Request for Quote 3. This process could be repeated until the system located a bank that made a currency trading market in the particular currency pair of Request for Quote 3.","Upon receipt of Price Quote A from local bank  (or if money centre bank  makes a currency trading market in the particular currency of Request for Quote 2), money centre bank  automatically generates and sends Price Quote B to regional bank , which represents the price at which money centre bank  will deal with regional bank  for the requested currency-pair transaction. If money centre bank  received Price Quote A from local bank , Price Quote B would reflect the application of a spread function to the rate of Price Quote A.","Upon receipt of Price Quote B from money centre bank , regional bank  automatically generates and sends Price Quote C to corporate user , which represents the price at which regional bank  will deal with corporate user  for the requested currency-pair transaction. Price Quote C would reflect the application of a spread function to the rate of Price Quote B.","Note that the number of (i) levels of banks (e.g., regional bank, money centre bank, local bank) (ii) and banks per level that participate in such a transaction can be greater or lesser than the example described above. Furthermore, the flow of a transaction need not follow the path illustrated by  but instead may pass through one or more of the bank levels in a different order or direction than shown.","F. Continuous Pricing Auction","The present embodiment of this invention includes a system that provides customized, continuous price quotes specific to a particular customer (e.g., corporate user) for certain financial products. The banks providing such price quotes compute the quotes based on information regarding the particular customer including, for example, the customer's transaction history or credit history with a particular bank. The system provides customers with continuously-available prices that enable a customer to select and accept a specific, \u201cbest\u201d rate (buy or sell) for a specific financial product and execute a transaction for that product with a particular bank, without having to negotiate with the bank regarding the transaction. The system provides the quotes to a particular customer based on the customer's profile criteria, for example, particular types of financial products for which the customer chooses to receive price quotes, and particular banks from which the customer choose to receive such quotes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0867","num":"1792"},"figref":"FIG. 123","b":["9700","9705","9710","9715","9720"]},"Pricing server  distinguishes the offers to sell (Quotes 1 & 3) from the offers to buy (Quotes 2 & 4) and processes them separately. In step , pricing server  determines the best offer to sell by comparing Quote 1 with Quote 3. Upon determining the best offer to sell\u2014Quote 1 in this example, as the Euro rate is lower\u2014pricing server  will perform a credit check on the bank that provided the best offer to sell\u2014Bank 1\u2014in order to determine whether the particular customer has a current credit relationship with that bank (step ) and that the daily notional amount of credit between the customer and the bank has not been exhausted. If such a credit relationship exists and is not exhausted, pricing server  will display the best offer to sell (Quote 1) to the customer on an interactive display interface (step ); if not, pricing server  will return to step  in order to determine the next best offer to sell, and then perform a credit check on that offer.","Similarly, with respect to the offers to buy (Quotes 2 & 4), in step , pricing server  determines the best offer to buy by comparing Quote 2 with Quote 4. Upon determining the best offer to sell\u2014Quote 2 in this example, as the Euro rate is higher\u2014pricing server  will perform a credit check on the bank that provided the best offer to buy\u2014Bank 2\u2014in order to determine whether the particular customer has a current credit relationship with that bank (step ). If such a credit relationship exists, pricing server  will display the best offer to buy (Quote 2) to the customer on an interactive display interface (step ); if not, pricing server  will return to step  in order to determine the next best offer to sell, and then perform a credit check on that offer.","Once pricing server  displays to the customer the respective best offers to buy and\/or sell, the customer can select and execute a purchase and\/or sale of currency up to the amounts specified by the offering bank(s). For example, if the customer selected to execute Quote 1, the customer could purchase up to US $6,000,000 from Bank 1 at the rate of 0.8510 Euro. If the customer elected to purchase only US $4,000,000 at that rate, the particular offer to sell would continued to be displayed, except the amount of currency for sale would be modified by pricing server  in order to reflect the customer's purchase (i.e., US $2,000,000 instead of US $6,000,000); if the customer elected to purchase the entire amount of currency offered for sale, pricing server  would remove the offer to sell from the customer's display interface. The best offer to buy would be processed in the same manner.","Pricing server  will display each of the best offers to the customer until one of three events occurs: (1) the offering bank withdraws the particular offer or it automatically expires; (2) the entire amount of currency offered for purchase or sale is exhausted, whether in one or multiple transactions; or (3) pricing server  receives a new offer and determines that it is the \u201cbest offer\u201d and removes the current \u201cbest offer\u201d from that display position. Note that in certain embodiments of this invention, the customer could choose to have more than one best offer displayed for each type of transaction (e.g., purchase or sale of currency), in which case pricing server  would perform the best offer determinations and credit checks accordingly.","G. \u201cBest Price\u201d Rules","In an embodiment of the present invention, the system includes a method and mechanism for enabling an entity requesting a price quote to define the \u201cbest price\u201d rules used to highlight the price quotes displayed to the entity when quotes are returned from banks in response to a request for price quote. The rules that can be defined using the system include: highest bid\/lowest offer, tightest spread of bid\/offer, fastest initial price, fastest current price, and specified bank.","The entity can define such rules using the \u201cBest Price Rules\u201d preference user interface, as shown in . Using that interface, the entity can define the best price criteria (e.g., \u201cHighest bid and lowest offer\u201d, \u201cTightest bid\/offer spread\u201d, \u201cSelected bank\u201d) and specify the rank for application of each definition by clicking on the appropriate indicator (e.g., \u201cFirst\u201d , \u201cSecond\u201d , \u201cThird\u201d ). The system will apply the entity's ranked definitions in order to display the best price as price quotes are returned from banks. In the case of a tie between price quotes under the \u201cfirst\u201d definition, the system will use the \u201csecond\u201d and \u201cthird\u201d definitions to break the tie and determine the best price. If the price quotes are still tied under all three definitions, the system will choose the best price based on alphabetical order of the banks' names. Note that in different embodiments of this invention, the number of definition levels could be lower or higher, the \u201cbest price\u201d criteria could be different, and the \u201ctie-breaking\u201d rules could be different.","With respect to the highest bid\/lowest offer rule, the \u201cbest price\u201d is defined as either the highest bid or the lowest offer, depending on whether the entity is looking to sell or buy the base currency in the requested currency pair. When the entity is looking to buy the base currency, the \u201cbest price\u201d will be the lowest offer quoted by a bank; conversely, when the entity is looking to sell the base currency, the \u201cbest price\u201d will be the highest bid quoted by a bank.","With respect to the tightest bid\/offer spread rule, the \u201cbest price\u201d is defined as the set of price quotes with the narrowest bid-offer spread.","With respect to the fastest initial price rule, the \u201cbest price\u201d is defined as the first price quote made most quickly in response to the request for quote. As a bank may change or refresh its price while the corporate entity is waiting for other banks to respond, the \u201cbest price\u201d definition under this scenario will still take the first price quote made most quickly as the best price, even if an equivalent price was actually a subsequent change to a price quote. As the quotes on the screen are listed in the order in which the initial quotes are made, the \u201cbest price\u201d will thus be the first line of the price quote for the particular transaction.","With respect to the fastest current price rule, the \u201cbest price\u201d is defined as the fastest submitted price quote among all the available price quotes. Once there are updates made to the quotes, the amended quotes will be moved to the end of the displayed queue. If this happens to the current \u201cbest price\u201d, the next-in-line quote will then be used as the current \u201cbest price\u201d.","With respect to the specified bank rule, the \u201cbest price\u201d is defined as the price quote being submitted by the specified bank identified by the corporate entity on its preference user interface. This selection will not be considered for the particular request if the bank selected on the preference interface is not included on the list of banks to which the request for price quote is being sent.","H. Additional Features","In addition to the features described herein, embodiments of this invention may include further features integrated into the system.","1. Price Improvement","In certain embodiments of this invention, as described above, (i) users (e.g., Members) submit transaction requests that are aggregated and displayed to one or more other users (e.g., Providers) and (ii) one or more of the recipient users (i.e., Providers) submit responsive price quotes that are aggregated and displayed to the requesting user (i.e., Member). The participating users negotiate with each other regarding such transaction requests and quotes via the system-supported chat, instant messaging, e-mail communications, and text included with the requests and quotes, or other traditional means such as telephone or Internet-wide e-mail.","Price \u201cimprovement\u201d occurs when a price quote changes or \u201cimproves\u201d for certain trading partners, either publicly or confidentially, using automated software routines or manual intervention. Price improvement may occur on the basis of existing relationships between certain users (e.g., a particular Member always receives a discount from a Provider), transaction type (e.g., \u201cFX Spot\u201d), transaction size (e.g., volume discount), credit ratings of potential partners, industry of potential partners, or other trading policies or parameters.","2. Automated Trading Policies","In certain embodiments of this invention, Providers can execute custom, user-defined trading policy templates or utilize system-defined buying pattern templates (or a mix of user-defined and system-defined templates) that will automatically modify price quotes according to the parameters detected. Similarly, in certain embodiments, Members can execute custom, user-defined trading policy templates or utilize system-defined buying pattern templates (or a mix of user-defined and system-defined templates) that will automatically respond to price quotes by modifying them and submitting such modifications to the quoting Providers, according to the parameters detected. Automated trading policies (or templates) can also be implemented to conduct block transactions. Such automated policies may include:\n\n","breaking a transaction into pieces over multiple time increments","3. Price Push","In certain embodiments of this invention, Providers or other users may \u201cpush\u201d tradable price quotes to an aggregated, real-time display for review by potential trading partners (i.e., Members). The \u201ctradable\u201d quotes submitted by Providers are at price levels at which the Providers are willing to execute transactions, though the prices may be \u201cimproved\u201d or negotiated down. Such quotes may be targeted to and customized for certain trading partners and enable potential trading partners to view transaction price quotes before submitting requests for price quotes. The \u201cpushing\u201d users may include individual banks and financial institutions, as well as consortiums of multiple banks and financial institutions. The aggregated display of tradable quotes, which may be in the form of a product matrix (including product (e.g., FX Spot), price or rate, currency, Provider, transaction limits, expiration date\/time), may also include a filter to display only the \u201cbest\u201d price for a particular type of financial transaction. The tradable price quotes are determined by sending a market data message through a set of workflow rules, which may consider transaction type, notional amount, date and time, and\/or category and credit rating of the potential trading partners.","Upon review of such price quotes in the aggregated, real-time display, recipient trading partners may: (i) accept a quote, as is, and execute a transaction; (ii) accept an \u201cimproved\u201d quote and execute a transaction; or (iii) communicate with the \u201cpushing\u201d user and negotiate the price down. Quote acceptance occurs when a trading partner \u201chits\u201d a price at an acceptable level, either (1) manually by clicking on the quote in the display and triggering acceptance, verification, and settlement with the pushing user, or (2) automatically via a software routine (or \u201crobot\u201d) programmed to accept quotes at a certain level.","4. Multi-Party Transactions","Embodiments of this invention can support multi-party transactions. In such a transaction, a user (i.e., Member) structures the transaction so that it is divided among more than one other parties (i.e., Providers). Each of those other parties will provide a portion of the traded asset, in an amount determined by the user's structured transaction. For example, a Member may seek an exchange of 1 Million Euro for U.S. Dollars where one Provider will exchange a certain amount of U.S. Dollars for 400 Thousand Euro and the other Provider will exchange a certain amount of U.S. Dollars for 600 Thousand Euro. The system enables the user to accept multiple price quotes for the transaction with one acceptance and it displays such acceptance on the various display monitors, in the same way that a single party transaction is displayed. In other embodiments, the system enables the user to accept multiple price quotes for the same transaction with multiple acceptances.","5. User Alerts","Embodiments of this invention include automated alerts whereby the system providers a user with customized notifications or \u201calerts\u201d based on the particular user's portfolio, trading activity, or profile information. Such alerts may be in the form of e-mail messages or auto-refreshing pop-up windows that are displayed while a user is engaged with the system. Alerts may be sent to notify users of events, including without limitation: a new transaction request or price quote; a change in an interest, market, or foreign exchange rate or equity price; an upcoming event relating to the user's portal, e.g., payment due date, option date; or an upcoming economic event.","6. Aggregation of Pricing Orders","Embodiments of this invention include functionality that enables Providers, such as individual banks and financial institutions, to automatically aggregate or net buy and sell orders from requesting users (e.g., Members) for execution, in order to eliminate the step of having such orders transmitted to the Provider's trading desk for execution. For example, for a particular foreign exchange transaction, a Provider may offer at a particular moment in time a \u201cbid\u201d (i.e., buy) price of $34 and an \u201cask\u201d (i.e., sell) price of $36, which produces a \u201cspread\u201d of $2 ($36-$34). Typically, the Provider will pass that spread on to its trading desk which, in order to make a profit, will increase the spread by $1 on each side: i.e., bid price=$33, ask price=$37, spread=$4. The trading desk will, in turn, pass the spread on to individual salespersons who, in order to make a profit, will increase the spread when they offer the foreign exchange transaction to customers. The offers may also vary by customer, based on factors that may include creditworthiness, relationship with the Provider, and industry. Thus, in this example, a salesperson may offer a bid price of $31 and an ask price of $39 (spread=$8) to a particular customer, but on average will offer a bid price of $32 and an ask price of $38 (average spread=$6). The trading desk will pass the spread offer to the salesperson with for a set duration of time (e.g., 10 seconds) during which the trading desk will honor the offer, even though the market prices for the transaction continue to move. The salesperson will accept orders from customers based on the offer and submit each order separately to the trading desk (less the salesperson's profit included in the offer spread) for execution.","Using the functionality included in embodiments of this invention, during the time period (e.g., 10 seconds) during which the trading desk will honor the offer to the salesperson, the system will automatically aggregate the customers' orders to buy and sell based on the trading desk offer and transmit the net difference to the trading desk for execution. The opportunity to net the trades will occur where different customers have accepted offsetting offer prices but where the offer duration (e.g., 10 seconds) for the first accepting customer has not yet expired. This functionality will eliminate overhead salesforce costs in that most orders will be aggregated without requiring separate execution of trades by the trading desk.","The foregoing description of a preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obviously, many modifications and variations will be apparent to practitioners skilled in this art. One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other applications may be substituted for those set forth herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the invention should only be limited by the claims included below."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF
