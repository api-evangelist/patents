More particularly, the present invention relates to method and system of transmitting predetermined contents data, which require digital rights protection, to a portable device, wherein a contents providing system and a synchronization information system are connected with a synchronization client installed in a personal computer to which the portable device is connected.","A method for managing data recorded in a portable device such as a MP3 player, a PDA, a handheld PC, a mobile communication device, etc, generally, includes a method of synchronizing data or files between a personal computer (PC) and the portable device. This method includes a method of connecting the personal computer to the portable device by using a wired method such as a serial port which is called as cradle synchronization, a universal serial bus (USB) port, etc, or a method of connecting the personal computer to the portable device by using a wireless method such as an infrared port, Wi-Fi, etc. Also, as for a method of transmitting data to the portable device, there is currently widely used a USB mass storage method that recognizes the portable device connected through the universal serial bus (USB) or the like in a computer as one mass storage and transmits a file or data freely. It is apparent to those skilled in the art that transmission of files or data using this USB mass storage method transmits only files or data simply, wherein there is not supported algorithm that can secure the transmitted file or data, or can protect digital rights thereof.","Various methods are being conceived to protect an owners copyright. There is growing understanding that digital contents itself is a copyright and should be protected. With this, it is also true that users who used to consider digital contents as free of charge start to change their attitudes. Methods of protecting digital contents rights are suggested as below.","A digital rights management (hereinafter, DRM) system is suggested as one method for protecting digital contents rights. This DRM system is a kind of technology embodying a system which safely transmits various contents of a network from a contents provider (CP) to a client and prevents the client from distributing the contents illegally. An encrypting technique is most important in the DRM system. This technique encrypts\/decrypts digital contents using a client's password or computer ID number as key data. Therefore, although the digital contents are copied unauthorized and distributed to the third person, he\/she may use the digital contents only with the key data. A method of using this key data may include 1) a method of transforming a client's computer ID or 2) a method of using a client's public key infrastructure (PKI) key or a personal key cache.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["120","110","130","140","140","120","140","120"]},"Like above, although various technologies are being developed for protecting various digital contents rights on Internet, the technologies are digital right protection methods that are performed by contents providers.
