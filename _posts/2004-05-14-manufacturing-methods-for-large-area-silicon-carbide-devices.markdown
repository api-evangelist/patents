No. 09\/952,064, filed Sep. 12, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,770,911 entitled \u201cLARGE AREA SILICON CARBIDE DEVICES,\u201d the disclosure of which is incorporated herein as if set forth fully.","The present invention was made with Government support under contract number 530-1360-03 awarded by the United States Office of Naval Research. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates to microelectronic devices and fabrication methods therefor, and more particularly to two electrical terminal silicon carbide devices, such as light activated silicon carbide thyristors, and manufacturing methods therefor.","Silicon carbide thyristors are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,539,217 (the '217 patent) the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully. The thyristors described in the '217 patent are three terminal devices having a gate and one of an anode or a cathode on a first side of the device and the other of the anode and the cathode on the opposite side of the device. Such silicon carbide thyristors may exhibit improved power handling capabilities over similar silicon thyristors.","Light-activated thyristors having an integrated light source and a silicon carbide active layer have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,663,580. Such devices may include four terminal devices and include anode and cathode terminals for a light emitting diode which acts to trigger a thyristor having its own anode and cathode terminals.","Silicon thyristors which are light activated have been utilized in high power applications. For example, optically triggered parallel lateral thyristors are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,779,126.","While silicon carbide thyristors may provide improved power handling capabilities over comparably sized silicon devices, it may be difficult to create large scale thyristors in silicon carbide. For example, in silicon a single thyristor may be made on a wafer such that the thyristor is substantially the same size as the wafer. However, manufacturing defect free silicon carbide wafers may be difficult, if not impossible. Thus, a device which consumes an entire wafer may have defects incorporated into the device which may limit its performance.","Embodiments of the present invention provide light-activated silicon carbide thyristors and methods of fabricating light-activated silicon carbide thyristors. In particular embodiments of the present invention, a first layer of silicon carbide having a second conductivity type is provided on a silicon carbide substrate having a first conductivity type.

Alternatively, the second region of silicon carbide may be a plurality of fingers configured to expose a corresponding plurality of finger portions of the first region of silicon carbide to light from a light source external to the silicon carbide thyristor so as to provide a light-activated gate region interdigited with the second region of silicon carbide.","In further embodiments of the present invention, a silicon carbide thyristor, is provided having a silicon carbide substrate having a first conductivity type and a first layer of silicon carbide on the silicon carbide substrate and having a second conductivity type.

In such embodiments, the deposited contact material may provide first contacts on the selected ones of the plurality of light-activated silicon carbide thyristor cells such that corresponding first surfaces of the first contacts for the selected ones of the plurality of light-activated thyristor cells are substantially coplanar and extend beyond corresponding surfaces of contacts of the ones of the plurality of light-activated silicon carbide thyristor cells which are not selected.

This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the thickness of layers and regions are exaggerated for clarity. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. Moreover, each embodiment described and illustrated herein includes its complementary conductivity type embodiment as well.","Referring now to the drawings,  are schematic partial top views and cross-sectional views of various embodiments of light-activated, two terminal, SiC thyristors according to the present invention. Silicon carbide thyristors according to embodiments of the present invention may be formed of silicon carbide having a polytype of 3C, 2H, 4H, 6H, and 15R. In the illustrated embodiments, the n and n regions, as well as the p and p, are designated \u201c+\u201d and \u201c\u2212\u201d to symbolize different doping levels respectively of the same material in a manner well understood to those of ordinary skill in this art. The p-type silicon carbide is preferably doped with aluminum or boron and the n-type silicon carbide is preferably doped with nitrogen or phosphorous.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["10","12","12","12","10","12","12","10"],"sup":["+","18 ","20 ","\u22123","18 ","20 ","\u22123"]},"As is further seen in , an optional second layer  of second conductivity type silicon carbide, such as p conductivity, may be provided on the first layer  so as to provide an asymmetric thyristor. The optional second layer  may be doped to provide a carrier concentration of from about 10to about 10cm. The optional second layer  may, typically, have a thickness of from about 0.1 \u03bcm to about 5 \u03bcm. A third layer  of the second conductivity type, such as p conductivity, is provided on the second layer  to provide a drift layer for the light-activated, two terminal, thyristor. The third layer  preferably is doped to provide a carrier concentration less than a carrier concentration of the second layer . The third layer  may be doped, for example, to provide a carrier concentration of up to about 5\u00d710cm. The third layer  may, typically, have a thickness of from about 10 \u03bcm to about 300 \u03bcm.","A fourth layer  of the first conductivity type, such as n conductivity, is provided on the third layer  to provide a gate layer. The fourth layer  may be doped to provide a carrier concentration of from about 10to about 10cm. The fourth layer  may, typically, have a thickness of from about 0.1 \u03bcm to about 5 \u03bcm. The fourth layer may be formed as a mesa with a junction termination extension (JTE) region  surrounding the periphery of the mesa so as to provide edge termination for the device. Alternatively, edge termination of the device may be provided by a guard ring or by the first, second, third and fourth layers being formed as a mesa having sidewalls which extend to the substrate  as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,539,217 which has been incorporated herein by reference.","A region  of second conductivity type silicon carbide, such as p conductivity, is provided on the fourth layer  and is formed having an opening  so as to expose a portion of the fourth layer  to provide a gate region which activates the thyristor when light  having energy of greater than the bandgap of silicon carbide is incident upon the gate region. The region  of second conductivity type silicon carbide may be doped to provide a carrier concentration of from about 10to about 10cm. The region  may, typically, have a thickness of from about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 5 \u03bcm. As seen in , the gate region may also include an optional region  of first conductivity type silicon carbide, such as n conductivity, which has a higher carrier concentration than the drift layer . A contact  may also be provided on the region  and a contact  may be provided on the substrate  to provide anode and cathode contacts for the light activated thyristor. The exposed portion of the gate layer may take various shapes, including the pinwheel configuration illustrated in .","As is illustrated in , the first conductivity type silicon carbide may be n-type silicon carbide and the second conductivity silicon carbide may be p-type silicon carbide. In such embodiments, the contact  provides an anode contact and the contact  provides a cathode contact. Furthermore, the contact  and the contact  are on opposite sides of the substrate  such that only an anode or a cathode contact is provided on either side of the substrate . As described above, embodiments of the present invention may also include the complementary device to that illustrated in .","The operation of the light-activated thyristor may be understood as follows. When a large positive bias is applied on the contact  with respect to contact , the junction between the drift layer and the gate layer is reverse biased and supports the applied voltage in the p drift layer. At this stage, the thyristor is non-conducting and very little leakage current flows through it. It can be turned-on by shining light, such as ultraviolet (UV) light, with energy in excess of about 3.25 eV (e.g. wavelengths of about 0.382 \u03bcm or greater), in the gate region. The UV light creates electron-hole pairs by photo-generation in the reverse biased junction. The photo-induced electrons flow towards the contact  and holes flow towards the contact . In this process, both the pn junction between the layer  and the layer  and between the epitaxial  and the layer  are forward biased and inject more holes and electrons in the p drift layer. These injected holes flow to the contact  and the injected electrons flow to the contact  causing further forward biasing of the pn junctions. If the light intensity is sufficient, a positive feedback process is started, which eventually results in the latching of the thyristor in this \u201con\u201d state. In the latched state, a high current density can flow from anode to cathode at a relatively small forward voltage drop across the thyristor. Thus, the UV light turns on the thyristor and allows the current to flow. Once the thyristor is turned on, it can be turned-off by reversing the polarity of the voltage applied to the contact , by reducing the applied voltage to zero and\/or by using other conventional techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":"14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 4","FIGS. 2 and 3"],"b":["10","12","34","32","34","20","32","32","20","34","22","20","24","10","34"],"sup":["+","\u2212","+"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIGS. 5 and 6","FIGS. 5 and 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["55","62","64","66","60","60","68","64","64"]},"The interdigited embodiments illustrated in  correspond to the device of . However, as will be appreciated in light of the present disclosure, each of the embodiments illustrated in , as well as the complementary devices, may also be embodied utilizing an interdigited structure.","In particular embodiments of the present invention, the light-activated silicon carbide thyristors have device size or cross-sectional area based on a desired yield for the devices, where the cross-sectional area is defined as the area circumscribed by the edge termination of the device. Thus, for example, the cross-sectional area may be determined based on the area circumscribed by the JTE regions  for embodiments utilizing JTE, the area of the mesa for mesa edge terminated embodiments or the area circumscribed by a guard ring for guard ring edge terminated devices. Such a device size may be determined, for example, by determining how many individually isolated devices of a given size may be provided on the portion of the silicon carbide wafer and what percentage yield would be associated with such devices. It may then be determined if a sufficient number of devices on the portion of the silicon carbide wafer would be expected to be of sufficient quality so as to provide the desired number of devices which may be interconnected in parallel to provide the desired operating characteristic (e.g. current handling capability). For example, light-activated silicon carbide thyristors may have a cross-sectional area of up to about 20 cmor greater.","As mentioned above, light activated silicon carbide thyristors according to embodiments of the present invention may be provided on wafers having a cross-sectional area greater than the area of the silicon carbide thyristors, such that a plurality of light-activated silicon carbide thyristors may be provided on a single wafer or portion of a wafer. Such a plurality of light-activated silicon carbide thyristors according to embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in . As is seen in , because the light-activated thyristors have only a single terminal on any give side of the devices, the light-activated thyristors may be readily connected in parallel without the need for a complex interconnect system. Thus, while embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to light-activated silicon carbide thyristors, the techniques described herein for selectively interconnecting silicon carbide devices may be utilized with any silicon carbide device having a single terminal on any given side of the device. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention may be applicable to silicon carbide diodes or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIGS. 7 and 8","FIGS. 7 and 8"]},"The good cells may be selectively connected by selectively varying the thickness of the contact material for good cells such that the contacts extend past the contacts for bad cells. Such an adjustment of the contact thickness may be made either prior to formation of the contacts by, for example, selective deposition of contact material, or after formation of the contacts by, for example, selective removal of contact material.","In particular, photolithography may be utilized to connect only the good cells by exposing only the good cells such that a mask over contact regions of the good cells is removed and the mask remains over the contact regions of the bad cells. A thick metal (for example, from about 6 to about 25 \u03bcm) may then be deposited on the exposed contact regions of the good cells, such as on the anode terminals of the good cells. Alternatively, all the cells may receive thick metal on, for example, the anode terminal, and be tested to select the good and bad cells. The thick metal may then be selectively removed from the bad cells by various techniques known to those of skill in the art, such as masking the contacts of the good cells and selectively etching the contacts of the bad cells. Similarly, a lift-off technique may also be utilized where a first material is deposited on the bad cells and then a blanket deposit of contact material is provided. The contact material may then be lifted off of the bad cells while remaining on the good cells. Furthermore, an automatic technique could be utilized where failure of the electrical test causes a contact of a bad cell to be electrically isolated from the thyristor cell or to change in thickness with relation to good cells, for example, by melting a contact of a thyristor cell. In any case, a pressure contact using a flat plate will only contact the good cells with the thick metal. The UV light can be routed by a fiber inside the assembly.","Such an interconnection of selected cells of the plurality of thyristors is illustrated in  which is a cross-section along lines C\u2013C\u2032 of . As seen in , the thick metal  is provided on cells which have passed the electrical test while a thinner metal , or even no metal at all, may be provided on cells which fail the electrical test. The thick metal  may provide a substantially coplanar first surface of the contacts which extends past the corresponding surface of the thinner metal . Thus, the cells which have passed the electrical test may then be interconnected by a connecting plate .","As is known to those of skill in the art, the connecting plate  may be attached by pressure, such as that applied by a spring clip or other such device or may even be attached through, for example, a permanent solder connection. The connecting plate  may be any conductive material of suitable strength to bridge the gaps between the metal contacts  of the good cells and may be a single conductive material, such as aluminum, copper or the like a composite of materials, for example, a steel plate with a conductive coating.","A UV light source external to the thyristor cells provides UV light into the openings , for example, through the use of fiber optics, a light pipe, reflective surfaces, free space, and\/or other such light distribution mechanisms known to those of skill in the art. The connecting plate  may also be reflective to facilitate distribution of UV light in the openings .","The present invention has been described with reference to particular layers of silicon carbide. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure, such layers may be provided by epitaxial growth, ion implantation or other such techniques for producing layers of silicon carbide. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention are intended to include structures having layers of silicon carbide as described herein however they are fabricated.","While the present invention has been described with reference to the particular structures illustrated in , as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure, various modifications may be made to such structures while still benefiting from the teachings of the present invention.

Thus, other forms of silicon carbide device cells may be selectively interconnected utilizing a connecting plate to provide a large area silicon carbide device made up of a plurality of silicon carbide device cells. Accordingly, the present invention should not be construed as limited to light activated thyristors.","In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
