title: Correlation and 3D-tracking of objects by pointing sensors
abstract: A method and system for tracking at least one object using a plurality of pointing sensors and a tracking system are disclosed herein. In a general embodiment, the tracking system is configured to receive a series of observation data relative to the at least one object over a time base for each of the plurality of pointing sensors. The observation data may include sensor position data, pointing vector data and observation error data. The tracking system may further determine a triangulation point using a magnitude of a shortest line connecting a line of sight value from each of the series of observation data from each of the plurality of sensors to the at least one object, and perform correlation processing on the observation data and triangulation point to determine if at least two of the plurality of sensors are tracking the same object. Observation data may also be branched, associated and pruned using new incoming observation data.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Correlation of Events Seen by Multiple Pointing Sensors"],"p":["This invention was developed under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present disclosure relates object tracking. More specifically, the present disclosure is directed to two-dimensional (2D) correlation and three-dimensional (3D) tracking of objects.","Object tracking is commonly used in satellite, aerospace and other applications (e.g., land, sea), where sensors are arranged to track one or more objects. When a plurality of sensors are used, pointing errors may often cause sensors to misalign in their line-of-sight (LOS), which in turn causes tracking errors, since the two sensors do not recognize they are pointing at the same object. During 3D tracking, this may further introduce velocity errors in a tracking system. Accordingly, there is a need in the art to provide more efficient and\/or accurate 2D and 3D tracking.","In view of the foregoing and other exemplary problems, drawbacks, and disadvantages of the conventional methods and structures, a robust, novel approach is disclosed for determining whether two pointing sensors are detecting the same object. As mentioned above, pointing errors cause the LOS from the sensors to miss each other even when pointing to the same object. Knowledge of sensor pointing errors provides an estimate of the miss distance distribution and a confidence that the sensors are detecting the same object. Weighted least squares triangulation may be used to estimate the position of the object and its standardized residual is used to estimate final confidence that the objects are the same.","For moving objects, observations can be used to estimate position and velocity. Triangulation points from fits of the observations from the individual sensors are used to update the tracks of moving objects. This significantly reduces the velocity errors of the resulting 3D track estimates. The correlation algorithm is deployed in a new system and in a tracking system being developed that uses the triangulation updates of tracks.","A robust, novel approach is also disclosed for determining whether two pointing sensors are detecting the same object. In addition, for moving objects, a 3D track is disclosed using triangulation of the pointing vectors from the different sensors. The correlation of observations from different pointing sensors depends on characterization of the pointing errors of the sensors and the fact that without pointing errors the lines of sight from the object to the sensors would intersect in the point that is the current location of the object.","In first order effects, the distribution of the miss-distance of pointing vectors from two sensors can be determined from the pointing errors of the sensors and is normally distributed. The realized miss-distance for a pair of observations can thus be used to assess the consistency with the hypothesis that the sensors are detecting the same object. Furthermore, if one wants to accept as correlated at least 95% of those that actually are correlated, then the pair of observations should be accepted as correlated if the miss-distance is less than the top 5% of miss-distances according to the estimated distribution.","If second order effects cannot be ignored or if refraction significantly bends the lines of sight, weighted least squares iteration for the triangulation point can be used starting with the estimated intersection point from the miss-distance calculation. The standardized residual from the least squares triangulation is normally distributed and thus can be used to assess whether the sensors are detecting the same object. Using pointing errors expected from the sensors of interest, the correlation confidence based on the normalized miss-distance and based on the standardized residual may be very close. The correlation cases that are relevant include both moving and nonmoving objects.","For pairs of non-moving objects, the correlation calculation in one embodiment is done for a single time point in the middle of the observation set overlap for the two sensors. Fits are used, if possible, to smooth out the random errors with fit errors and tighten the miss-distance distribution. For a moving object and a nonmoving object, there are three cases: non-mover before, during or after-mover. For the non-mover during the mover case, fits are used to obtain observations at a common time and assessment is the same as for two non-movers. For the non-mover before or after the mover a fit to the mover 2D track is used to extrapolate backward or forward to the time of the non-mover and the assessment is performed using the extrapolated point. For two moving targets that overlap in time, a time near the beginning and a time near the end of the overlap are used to assess correlation and the correlation confidences are fused to make the final assessment of correlation. When two movers do not overlap in time and the gap between them is not too large, correlation is assessed by extrapolating from one to the other both ways, assessing correlation confidence for both extrapolations and fusing them to make the final assessment of correlation.","A 3D tracker is also disclosed for combining 2D observations from multiple sensors into 3D tracks. First, 2D observation tracks from one sensor are correlated to 2D observation track from another sensor using the correlation algorithm described above for movers that overlap in time. Assessing the correlation of 2D tracks significantly reduces the computation load from that required to assess the correlation of individual observations from the sensor and allows smoothing of the observations sets, which can reduce the state vector errors for the resulting 3D track. A set of triangulation points are generated to initialize an Extended Kalman Filter based 3D track. After track initialization, the track can be extended by adding 2D observations one at a time or by adding additional triangulation points. It has been found that adding triangulation points instead of single 2D observations reduces the error in estimated object velocity because the random observation error has been replaced by fit error from the triangulation. This also tends to reduce the position error in the estimated 3D track.","Further scope of applicability of the present disclosure will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.","The figures and descriptions provided herein may have been simplified to illustrate aspects that are relevant for a clear understanding of the herein described devices, systems, and methods, while eliminating, for the purpose of clarity, other aspects that may be found in typical devices, systems, and methods. Those of ordinary skill may recognize that other elements and\/or operations may be desirable and\/or necessary to implement the devices, systems, and methods described herein. Because such elements and operations are known in the art, and because they do not facilitate a better understanding of the present disclosure, a discussion of such elements and operations may not be provided herein. However, the present disclosure is deemed to inherently include all such elements, variations, and modifications to the described aspects that would be known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","Turning to , an exemplary embodiment is illustrated showing a plurality of pointer sensors (A-) that may be incorporated in one or more sensor arrays  that may be part of a satellite-based, aeronautical-based, land and\/or water-based system comprising a processor-based tracking system . The sensors of  in this example may be tasked with detecting objects (OBJ1-OBJ3) and tracking and\/or correlating specific objects of interest  (OBJ1, OBJ2) any of which may be still and\/or or moving in specific directions (illustrated by arrows in ).","The processes for determining whether detections from separated pointing sensors are due to the same physical event are described below. Observation errors may lead to a statistical approach for assessing correlation, and different time bases for the sensors require methods to estimate observation data from each sensor at common time. The minimum distance between the pointing lines of sight from two sensors at the common time is used in a screening step. Candidate correlations that pass the screen are accessed using the standardized residuals from weighted least squares triangulation for the location of the event at the common time.","In one exemplary embodiment, for each target (object), the pointing sensors (e.g., A-B) under consideration produce a series of observations each of which contains sensor position, pointing vector and observation error characterization at a specified time. If there were no observation errors, the line of sight from one sensor would intersect the line of sight from the other sensor at the target location for any specified time. The observation errors lead to a finite minimum distance between the lines of sight even if the sensors are pointing at the same target. Similarly, least squares triangulation using the sensor position and pointing vectors has non-zero residual errors because of the observation errors. Since the time base and observation frequency of the separate sensors are independent, appropriate techniques, depending on the particular case, should be selected to obtain observations at a common time to perform the correlation assessment.","The sections below disclose various aspects of operation, including component uncertainties that contribute to the observation error and how they are combined into final covariance matrix for the sensor pointing vectors, screening based on the minimum distance between lines of sight, correlation assessment by weighted least squares triangulation of the pointing vectors and the application of the algorithms to various cases of stationary and moving targets (objects) where the observation sets from the sensors overlap in time and where the observations are separated in time.","Uncertainties","Sources of uncertainty for the pointing sensors of interest are\n\n","The position, attitude and instrument pointing error vary slowly compared to the duration of observations for a typical target and can be treated as bias errors. The centroiding and distortion errors tend to vary with each observation and can be treated as random errors. The 3D errors can be projected onto a plane perpendicular to the pointing vector to determine the effective 2D covariance matrices which then can be combined with the other 2D errors to calculate the total pointing error covariances. An advantageous representation of the pointing error covariance matrix under one embodiment is as a 2D ellipse, where the axes are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (i.e. the standard deviations) and the orientation angle, \u03b8, is the rotation that diagonalizes the matrix. In the applications below it is assumed that component errors are independent and normally distributed. Bias errors may dominate for the sensors of interest.","When enough observations are available, numerical fits to the data are used to synthesize observations at a common time for correlation assessment. For interpolation cases where the observations from the sensors overlap in time small order polynomial fits are used and the resulting fit errors replace the random errors in the calculation of pointing error covariance. These fit errors follow a t-distribution rather than normal distribution under one embodiment. However, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution if the number of fit points is large, and the normally distributed bias errors are dominant for the sensors of interest. This will be discussed further in the sections on applications to cases with temporally overlapping observations.","Kalman filters are used in one embodiment to predict an observation from one sensor at a time for which there is an observation from the other sensor when the sets of observations from the sensors do not overlap in time. In these cases, the Kalman estimation of the covariance matrix is used in place of the random error covariances in the calculation of total observation error covariance. This will be discussed further in the sections on applications to cases with temporally separated observations.","Screening Based on Lines of Sight Intersection Distance","Two different reported lines of sight for the same event would intersect if there were no measurement errors to form an epipolar plane that can be defined by the focal centers of the two sensors vand v, and the location of the event (i.e., object), or triangulation point T.","Measurement errors may cause the lines of sight not to intersect. Due to the two-axis configuration of many gimbaled sensor systems, pointing errors are often measured in two orthogonal angular directions about a computed pointing vector pand expressed in terms of a zero-mean bivariate normal distribution about p. A confidence region associated with a bivariate normal distribution can be geometrically represented by an angular error ellipse centered at vhaving normal p. The following discussion assumes that atmospheric refraction can be ignored so that the pointing vector reported for a sensor observation of an event represents a straight line of sight. A later section will discuss some approaches for dealing with the bending of the light path due to refraction.","Minimum Distance Between Lines of Sight","Given measurement errors and assuming the lines of sight are not parallel, there will be a single shortest line connecting them. A closed form solution for that line exits and a selected point on the line will be used to initialize the full least squares determination of the intersection point.","For purposes of explanation, it is assumed that all vectors in the following discussion are expressed in a common coordinate system unless otherwise specified. Consider n>1 satellite (or spacecraft, or any suitable vehicle, craft or device utilizing tracking) each having a sensor viewing a potential common target. Further let v, i=0 . . . n-1, be the Cartesian coordinates of the focal center of each of the respective sensors and p, i=0 . . . n-1, the unit pointing vectors to the target from each of the respective satellites. There are 2\u22121 pairs of sensors. The following considers only single pairs.","Two unique points may be determined, one on each of the three-space lines emanating from vand v, 0<=j<k<n, along the pointing vectors pand prespectively such that the distance between these points is a minimum. It should be noted that the line joining these two unique points is perpendicular to both of pand p.

Consider pair-wise distinct pointing vectors pand p, with scalars tand tdefined as above. Then, an error ellipse corresponding to pcan be obtained by intersecting the elliptic error cone eecwith a plane located a distance t(in the direction of p) from the satellite and normal to p. Similarly, define an error ellipse corresponding to p. The convenient error axes for analyzing the j and k lines of sight are the normal to the epipolar plane, and a normal to pin the epipolar plane for j and the normal to the epipolar plane, and a normal to pin the epipolar plane for k.

Then since \u03b3and \u03b3are from different sensors, they are assumed to be independent. This leads to\n\n\u03b3\u03b3(0,\u03c3+\u03c3)=(0,\u03c3)\n\nThus, the normalized minimum distance between the lines of sight\n\n\/\u03c3(0,1)|\n\nprovides a statistic for estimating the confidence that particular measured Dfrom intersection of Land Lis consistent with the hypothesis that two observations from different sensors are from the same event.\n","The confidence that nDis consistent with correlation of the two observations\n\n1()=1(\/\u221a{square root over (2)})\n\nwhere x is the random variable for the normalized minimum distance between lines of sight and erf(s\/\u221a{square root over (2)}) is the cumulative probability for the absolute value of a normally distributed variable, s. For example, 5% confidence implies that 95% of the time actually correlated observations would have a normalized minimum distance between the lines of sight less than or equal to the observed nD.\n","The final assessment under one embodiment of whether of the Land Lpoint to the same event must still wait until the full least squares procedure is completed because the pointing errors in the epipolar plane have not yet been taken into account and nor have possible refraction effects which bend the line of sight violating the straight line assumption of the minimum intersection distance calculation. Here, the confidence is set lower than the desired confidence cutoff because the minimum distance calculation is used as a screen to determine whether to perform the least squares triangulation that is employed to perform the final assessment of correlation. The screening calculation also provides an estimate of the triangulation point to initialize the least squares calculation, and estimates of parameters such as range from target to sensors that are used in refining some calculations.","Assessment Based on Triangulation Standardized Residuals","Weighted least squares approaches are particularly advantageous in multiple-image data point triangulation. In this section, a summary of the weighted least squares formulation is provided below followed application to the triangulation points for multiple sensors seeing the same event.","Exemplary Formulation","In one exemplary embodiment, assume\n\n\n\nwhere l is a vector of n unperturbed observations, e is a vector of a priori unknown residuals and the actual observations {tilde over (l)} are normally distributed observations with\n\n(),\n\nwhere  is the mean of the distribution and \u03a3denotes the covariance matrix. Letting x be a vector of u model parameters, the maximum likelihood estimators for model parameters are found by solving the nonlinear equality constrained problem\n\nminimize[\u0398=]subject to ()=0.\n\nwhere Qis the cofactor matrix found from a normalization \u03a3=\u03c3Q, \u03c3is the a priori standard deviation of a unit weight observation. The inverted cofactor matrix can be interpreted as a weight matrix. Linearization of the problem allows an iterative solution given an initial guess of the model parameters {circumflex over (x)}(0) and with a first estimate {circumflex over (l)}(0)={tilde over (l)} for the unperturbed observations. The iteration is stopped if the improvement (s)={circumflex over (x)}(s+1)\u2212{circumflex over (x)}(s) at step s is smaller than a specified threshold. The estimates for the unperturbed observations are updated at each step by (s)={circumflex over (l)}(s+1)\u2212{circumflex over (l)}(s). When stopping the iteration at step s*, the final estimates of the unknowns are {circumflex over (l)}(s*+1) and {circumflex over (x)}(s*+1). A final estimate for the residuals e is obtained through e={circumflex over (l)}(s*+1)\u2212{tilde over (l)}.\n","The linearized form of the constraint functions is\n\n0,\n\nwhere A=\u2202f\/\u2202x is an r\u00d7u matrix and B=\u2202f\/\u2202l is an r\u00d7n and w=\u2212f({circumflex over (x)}(s),{circumflex over (l)}(s)) is a vector of r function residuals.\n","The solutions for  and  are\n\n=()\n\nand\n\n=(\u2212())\n\nwhere Q=BQBsimplifies the notation and can be interpreted as the cofactor matrix of the function residuals. The cofactors Qcan be converted to covariances \u03a3by multiplying

Assessment Based on Least Squares Statistics","Once the best triangulation point is found through iteration, the assessment of whether events seen by more than one sensor are the same event can be made. If the standardized residuals from triangulation are too large the lines of sight must not be from the same target. The assumption of normally distributed standardized residual leads to the same confidence calculation for the standardized residuals as is used for the normalized minimum distance between the lines of sight:\n\n1()=1(\/\u221a{square root over (2)})\n","In practice, when observations from just two sensors are used, the least squares procedure results in all four standardized residuals (,,,) being equal. The confidence level required for a determination of correlation depends upon application needs but is typically set to 5%.","When the target density is high, the line of sight for a target on one sensor may be close to the lines of sight for more than one target on the other sensor and therefore more than one set of assignments could pass the confidence test. In this case, a means is provided to resolve the ambiguity and make a consistent set of assignments. An extended Munkres algorithm may be particularly advantageous to make assignments that minimize normalized square residuals.","When the covariances become large, the size of the residuals and equivalently the minimum distance between the lines of sight that will pass a confidence test grows increasing the possibility of spurious correlations. For example, at a 5% confidence level, the standardized residual or normalized distance between lines of sight that passes the test is about 1.96. This means that any D<1.96\u03c3will pass the confidence test. Thus, \u03c3is a good indicator of how close events can be together without causing a spurious correlation.","Consideration of Refraction","The discussion presented so far has assumed that the path of light from the detected event is a straight line. However, if the elevation angle from the event to the sensor is small enough \u03a6<\u03a6, where \u03a6\u224820, refraction of light through the atmosphere become significant and must be addressed.

Even if the calculation of the bending due to refraction is accurate, these inputs to the calculations are not known. Seasonal and diurnal variations for these inputs can be estimated from historic data bases as a function of latitude and longitude but the residual errors are not yet estimated.","Simulations indicate that the least squares triangulation procedure can accommodate the bending of light due to refraction using numerically calculated A matrix. But the lack of residual error estimation for the refraction calculation prevents assessment of correlation for targets where refraction correction and its residual error are significant for one or both of the paths from the target to sensor.","Temporally Overlapping Observations","When observations overlap in time, generation of test observations at a common time for correlation assessment involves interpolation. A fit used for the interpolation can smooth the random variations and the associated prediction error would replace the random error in the calculation of observation covariance. If there are too few observations from a sensor to obtain a good fit, a raw observation is used in the correlation assessment. If raw observations are used from both sensors, additional error is introduced due to the difference in observation times. However, such additional error may be negligible if the observation frequencies are high enough.","The cases under consideration for temporally overlapping observations include: stationary observation sets from both sensors, moving observation sets from both sensors, and a stationary observation set from one sensor and a moving set from the other sensor.","Results of simulation testing indicate that if there are enough points to generate a fit for both sensors, selection of the center of the observation overlap interval as the common observation time works well for correlation assessment for all three cases. Otherwise, use of the closest observation to the center of the overlap works well if the number of observations is too small for a good fit.","Temporally Separated Observations","There may be several instances where the observation sets from the sensors do not overlap in time: (a) a short stationary target from one sensor followed by a moving target from the other sensor, (b) a moving target from one sensor followed by a short stationary target from the other sensor, and (c) a moving target from one sensor followed by a moving target from the other sensor.","In each case, Kalman filters are used to generate a predicted observation from one sensor at a time for which an observation (e.g., generated with a polynomial fit) is available from the other sensor. The Kalman predicted covariance replaces the random error covariance in the calculation of total covariance for the correlation assessment in one embodiment. For the case of a stationary target followed by a moving target, the Kalman extrapolation is backward in time to a possible initiating event seen by the other sensor. For the case of a moving target followed by a stationary target, the Kalman extrapolation is forward in time to a possible termination event seen by the other sensor. For the case of two moving targets, two extrapolations are performed (one from each sensor to the other) and the resulting confidences are fused to provide a single estimate of the confidence that the observations are from the same physical target.","Linear Kalman Filter Embodiment","Kalman filters implement a recursive least squares approach for estimating the state of a system based on a series of observations.

The calculation of the predicted Kalman covariance has a strong dependence on this gap. The growth of the predicted Kalman covariance with duration of the gap limits practical size of the size of the gap that can be accommodated because large covariance increases the chance of spurious correlations.","Fusion of Confidence","For the case of two moving targets separated in time, two confidences are obtained: one extrapolating from each set of sensor observations to the other. Although statistically correlated, these confidences are not the same. They need to be fused into a single confidence that the observation sets are from the same event. For this application, a gamma probabilistic fusion approachis used. A statistic is defined, in terms of the two confidences, that has a gamma distribution, which is then used to evaluate the fused confidence.","Let N be the number of confidences to be fused (N\u22672) and define",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0136","num":"0143"},"maths":[{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00037","num":"00037"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["Y","i"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["Conf","i"]}}}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00037-2","num":"00037.2"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"S","mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["Y","i"]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00037-3","num":"00037.3"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["\u03c1","ij"]}}}}}}}],"br":{},"sub":["ij ","i ","j"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0137","num":"0144"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00038","num":"00038"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"r","mo":"=","mfrac":{"msup":{"mi":"N","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mi":["N","C"],"mo":"+"}}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"shape"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03bb","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mi":"N","mrow":{"mi":["N","C"],"mo":"+"}}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"scale"}}]}]}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["Conf","\u2212G","S;r"],"sub":"f"},"In the fusion of the two confidences from extrapolation between the sensor observation sets, the correlation between the confidences, \u03c1, is a function of the gap between the observation sets and must be estimated for the particular application.","Implementation Parameters","Several sets of tuning parameters are required to implement multiple pointing sensor correlation.

of 2D Tracks from Different Sensors","2D tracks for pointing sensor provide no range information and therefore must be associated with another 2D track from another sensor to determine where the lines of sight intersect. This intersection can provide an estimate of the position of the observation source position. Pointing errors cause the lines of sight to miss intersection. The miss distance can be converted into a confidence that the observations are consistent with being caused by the same source.  illustrates an exemplary general geometry under one embodiment. Here, Dis shortest distance between lines of sight, eis angular error, tis range from sensor to target, T is target position, pis sensor pointing vector, vis sensor position vector. For small angular errors, we have:\n\n|\n\nLetting\n\n\u03c3=(\u03c3)+(\u03c3)\n\n(0,\u03c3)\n\nwhere \u03c3is projection of error ellipse onto line between lines of sight. Then the normalized distance between the line of sight is\n\n\/\u03c3(0,1)|\n","This normalized distance allows a first order confidence based assessment of whether the two lines of sight are from the same source. This is used as a preliminary screen for association of the observations (). The final assessment of association is based on the standardized residual of the triangulation of the two lines of sight to find the target position.","Track Initiation and Extension","Observation sequences from sensors are considered in one embodiment for track initiation when they have at least a user specified number of observations (e.g., 5-10) or a user specified duration (e.g., 4-8 seconds). 3D observation sequences are used directly to initiate a 3D track with the EKF.","A 2D sequence is checked for association with 2D sequences from different sensors that overlap in time with it. If the time overlap is short, the association calculation is performed for the midpoint time of the overlap. If the overlap is long enough (a user specified duration), the association calculation is performed twice: at 0.1 of the overlap and at 0.9 of the overlap. The confidence values are then fused to make the determination of association. Since the observations from different sensors are not synchronized, fits are used to synthesize observations at the time of the association evaluations.","A 3D track hypothesis is initiated for each pair of observation sequences that pass the association test. To initiate a track from associated 2D sequences, a sequence of 3D points is synthesized by triangulation of 2D observations synthesized using fits of the 2D observation sequences from the different sensors. The frequency of synthesized 3D observations and the length of the track initiation sequence are user specified. Pruning methods for eliminating 3D track hypotheses are described in further detail below.","After track initiation, the track can be extended using the 2D observations from the individual sensors one at a time or by continuing the triangulation scheme used to initiate the track. Normally, for the sensors of current interest, the triangulation approach to extending the track leads to smaller velocity and position errors in the estimated track. This is due to the fact that the fitting of observation sequences to synthesize points from the sensors at a common time replaces the random portion of the pointing errors with the smaller fit error.","Association of 2D and 3D Tracks to 3D Fusion Tracks","A track sequences from a sensor can be associated with an existing 3D fusion track if the 3D fusion track does not yet have a contributing track sequence from that sensor. This association is accessed using the normalized square residual of a 2D or 3D observation when adding it to the EKF for the 3D fusion track. Each passing 3D Fusion track is branched into two track hypotheses\u2014one with the sequence observations added and one without.","When there are three 2D sensors that see a target, association calculations can generate track hypotheses for the three possible pairs of sensors and the branch 3D track that contains all three 2D tracks. Logic is used to identify this case and keep only the 3D track that incorporates all three 2D tracks.","Closely Spaced Objects","Closely spaced objects may present challenges to a 3D fusion tracker. The input tracks from individual sensors may pass association gates for multiple tracks from the other sensors and selecting the right association can be difficult. For example, two targets of the same type may stay close together for an extended time so that the gating calculations cannot reveal which of the associations are correct. Furthermore, resolution differences may cause one sensor to not be able to resolve two targets into separate tracks, while another sensor reports two tracks. Similarly, geometry may cause one sensor to resolve multiple targets into separate tracks well after another similar sensor is able to resolve them.","Intermittent Detection","Tracking may be affected by the sensitivity of contributing sensors. The delectability of the target varies over the track and a sensor's ability to detect the target may be intermittent or very different from that of other contributing sensors. This can lead to disconnected track fragments from contributing sensors or time gaps in the reported observations for a single track. The fusion tracker should be able to deal with various combinations of these situations.","When two 2D sensors are contributing to a 3D track and one of them has a gap in detections, updates of the track are due to the other sensor's observations which provide no range information. The 3D track estimate can accumulate large errors along the line of sight of the contributing sensor. When the other sensor starts adding observation again, the 3D track estimate can require a large correction which can make the track estimate experience a large error transient as it re-stabilizes.","Likelihood Pruning","Multi-hypothesis tracking may be employed for single sensor tracks. In the case of single sensors, the bias is the same for each track hypothesis and therefore does not affect the scoring of the hypotheses using likelihood arguments. In the case of multiple sensor miss-associations, the difference in the scores for one candidate association and another cannot be isolated from the bias. The low score for one hypothesis may be due to its non-physical nature or the fact that the bias errors work against it.","Bias Consistency Pruning","If boresites for the sensors are small enough, then it would be expected that the net bias error effect on the line of site miss distance would be the same for all targets seen by both sensors in the overlapping area of their boresites. In this case, one can invoke a bias consistency technique. The miss distance would be distributed about the constant net bias error according to a variance that reflects the variance in the zero sum net random errors. In tests, it was found that if there are only a few closely spaced targets among a large number of targets in the overlapping boresites, outliers could be reliably rejected as false associations if their miss distance was not consistent with a distribution about the mean miss distance due to the random errors. However, if there are a large percentage of closely spaced objects or the random errors are large with respect to the bias errors, outlier selection is not reliable and the mean miss distance due to net bias errors cannot be determined.","Track Feature Assessment","Feature based classification may be advantageous in target recognition applications and can play a role the pruning of track hypotheses in 3D track fusion applications. For example, maximum acceleration and velocity might be specified by target type, and miss-association of 2D tracks from different sensors can lead to negative calculated altitudes, which can be rejected.","3D Fusion Tracker Process Flow","After initialization, the basic flow for the 3D Fusion Tracker is illustrated in the exemplary embodiment of  and comprises the following nested loop:\n\n","Various functions described herein can be implemented in hardware, software, or any combination thereof.
