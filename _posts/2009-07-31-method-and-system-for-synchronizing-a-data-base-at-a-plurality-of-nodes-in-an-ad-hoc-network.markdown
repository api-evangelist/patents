It is difficult task to ensure that data stored at all nodes in the network is the same.","Earlier solutions to ensuring the same data is stored on various nodes in a network involves predefining master and slave relationships. Such relationships may be established and enforced in a fixed network. However, in dynamically changing network (e.g., in ad hoc networks) predetermined master and slave relationships are substantially meaningless and substantially unenforceable if ever defined.","There is a need for a method and system method for synchronizing a data base at a plurality of nodes in an ad hoc network.","A method for synchronizing a data base at a plurality of nodes in an ad hoc network including at least one authentication node group; each authentication node group including a leader node and at least one member node; the method includes: (a) in each respective authentication node group, comparing and identifying differences between the data base at the respective leader node and the data base at each respective member node; (b) for each comparing, if the differences are identified, exchanging data bases between the leader node and the member node; and (c) for each comparing, in no particular order: (1) merging the leader node data base with the member data base at the leader node to create a leader node merged data base; and (2) merging the member node data base with the leader data base at the member node to create a member node merged data base.","A system for synchronizing a data base at a plurality of nodes in an ad hoc network including at least one authentication authority node group; each respective authentication authority node group of the at least one authentication authority node group including a respective group leader node and at least one group member node; the system includes: (a) in each respective node, a respective comparing unit; the respective comparing unit in each respective node of each respective authentication authority node group comparing and identifying differences between at least one predetermined aspect of the data base at the respective group leader node and the at least one predetermined aspect of the data base at each respective group member node; (b) in each respective node, a respective communicating unit; if the differences identified exceed a predetermined measure, the respective communicating units for the respective group leader node and the respective group member node effect an exchanging of data bases between the group leader node and the group member node; and (c) in each respective node, a respective data base server unit; each respective data base server unit being employed to effect, in no particular order: (1) merging the group leader node data base with the group member data base at the group leader node to create a group leader node merged data base; and (2) merging the group member node data base with the group leader data base at the group member node to create a group member node merged data base.","It is, therefore a feature of the present invention to provide a method and system method for synchronizing a data base at a plurality of nodes in an ad hoc network.","Further features of the present invention will be apparent from the following specification and claims when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which like elements are labeled using like reference numerals in the various figures, illustrating the preferred embodiments of the invention.","In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.","When the terms \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201cconnected\u201d, along with their derivatives, are used herein, it should be understood that these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other.

Components ,  communicate with data base server  via data base Application Programming Interface (DB API) units , .","Some static persistent data in network  may need to be communicated across Mobile Network Nodes (MNNs) , , . A database synchronization subsystem is used to propagate data from one MNN to another MNN within the same administrative authority group in a cluster within network .","During initialization when a cluster or network  (network  may include only one cluster) is just being formed, it is important to bring the data on all the MNNs within the same organization \u201cup-to-date\u201d. Synchronization of the existing data only takes place when there are at least two nodes in the same authentication authority (organization). A group leader is elected by an Autoconfig process (a process known to those skilled in the art of communication network design) in each organization. The group leader in each organization or group merges all the data and distributes the merged data to all group member MNNs. The Autoconfig process on the Primary Services Node (PSN)  sends the group leader information to data base server unit  on PSN . In the exemplary cluster or network  of , node  is designated as a Group Leader Node (GLN) and may be regarded in the simplified arrangement illustrated in  as the PSN and as the group leader node. Whenever a new node is joining cluster , the Autoconfig process on PSN  provides data base server unit  on PSN  with the new node information. Data base server unit  on PSN  constructs a route table and distributes the route table to all nodes , ,  in cluster . The Autoconfig process determines the group leader in each organization and sends that information (determination of group leader) to data base server unit  on PSN . Data base server unit  on PSN  then distributes that information (determination of group leader) to each node , ,  in the same organization.","Each authentication authority group (cluster) may have a group leader node (GLN), and some group member nodes (GMN). As a practical matter, the number of nodes in a group may vary from 1 to 20 or more. Each GMN sends its table checksums to the GLN for comparison. If all table checksums match, a CHECKSUM_MATCH acknowledgement may be sent back to the GMN and no initialization synchronization is needed. If any of the table checksums do not match, the data base server unit of the GLN would send a CHECKSUM_MISMATCH acknowledgement to the GMN. The GMN would send the table to the GLN. After the GLN receives the table, the GLN compares the contents of the tables, merges the tables, and updates all the databases on all the nodes in the same organization. If there were any mismatches on any entry in a table, the data base server unit compares the timestamps, and the newest entry is entered into the final master table.","When any new node joins before initial synchronization is completed in a cluster, the new node is processed in the same fashion. If there are multiple nodes belonging to the same group joining a cluster at the same time, the multiple nodes are preferably processed substantially simultaneously. Multiple copies of a table may be compared and merged simultaneously. A Flag (e.g., initialSyncFlag=0 by default) is used for each organization to indicate whether an organization has completed initial synchronization, and the Flag may be set to \u201c1\u201d when initial synchronization has been completed.","If any node joins the group after the completion of initial synchronization (e.g., initialSyncFlag=1), instead of merging tables with the GLN a joining node may merge tables with one of a neighboring node in its organization.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["80","82","1","1","1","2","1","82"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
