No. 61\/336,653, filed 25 Jan. 2010, which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. National Science Foundation 0925757 and Los Alamos National Labs OVPR 22494 and. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","The invention relates generally to digital image processing and image analysis.","Image segmentation is one of the most important and difficult tasks in digital image processing and image analysis. It represents a key stage of automated image analysis and interpretation. Segmentation algorithms for gray-scale images utilize basic properties of intensity values such as discontinuity and similarity. Detection of discontinuities in gray-scale images is typically based on spatial masks whose response at any pixel in the image can be thought of as a finite difference approximation of a differential operator. A mask, which can be used in a typical spatial feature extraction techniques and may also be referred to as kernel, can be realized as a function that operates on pixel values in a predefined neighborhood M\u00d7N of a pixel with spatial coordinates (i, j). Examples of some of the most popular gray-scale edge detectors include Canny, Sobel, and Prewitt detectors. However, it is possible to enhance edge-detection capability by means of using spectral information provided by multispectral (MS) or hyperspectral (HS) imagery. A multi-spectral imagery captures image data at specific frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum. Hyperspectral imagery captures image data from across the electromagnetic spectrum.","Transition from a gray-scale to a multi-color image complicates edge detection significantly. Standard definition of a gray-scale edge as a \u201cramp,\u201d or \u201cridge\u201d between two regions is no longer appropriate since a multi-color image has multiple image planes, one for each spectral band. More importantly, depending upon the scene, two distinct regions may exhibit the same intensity for one or more bands. In other words, with respect to such iso-luminant bands, the edge between the two regions is characterized by a jump in color rather than intensity. Clearly, iso-luminant edges cannot be detected by a standard gradient operator. Extension of other gray-scale processing techniques to multi-colored images, such as those based on differential operators, faces similar difficulties.","Extension of differential edge detection to multi-color images has followed two principal paths. A straightforward approach is to apply differential operators such as the gradient separately to each image plane and then somehow integrate this information to obtain edge and segmentation information. It has been previously pointed out that this can result in undesirable segmentation because information in separate channels is treated as independent whereas in actuality it is not. A second approach to multi-color edge detection is to embed the variations of all color channels in a single measure, which is then used to obtain the edge maps. Typically, this approach is developed by starting from a given gray-scale operator, which is then extended consistently to multi-color images. By \u201cconsistently\u201d it is mean that the extended multi-color operator reduces to its original gray-scale prototype when applied to a single color image. Two representative examples of this approach are the multi-color gradient (MCG) and the morphological color gradient (MoCG). While multi-color gradient and related ideas have been used with great success computation of the multi-color gradient for multi-color images with large numbers of bands can be quite expensive.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration and not limitation, various example embodiments of the invention. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice these and other embodiments. Other embodiments may be utilized, and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made to these embodiments. The various embodiments are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as some embodiments can be combined with one or more other embodiments to form new embodiments. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.","For multi-color, MS, or HS images, such an image is a three-dimensional array of real numbers, also called an image hypercube:\n\n()\u03b5:111\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nFor fixed i and j, the k-dimensional vector u(i, j)=(u(i, j), . . . , u(i, j)) is called hyper-pixel. The indices i and j denote the spatial position of the hyper-pixel within a Focal Plane Array (FPA), and k is the band number. The value of u(i; j) is referred to as the intensity of the k-th band. Alternatively, for a fixed k, the two dimensional array u(i, j) is the k-th image plane, or color slice, of the multi-color image. For MS images the number of bands K is typically between 10 and 15. For hyperspectral images K can be as high as several hundred bands.\n","In various embodiments, image segmentation algorithms for multi-color images with an emphasis on detection of multi-color edges can be provided. In an example embodiment, an algorithm for joint spatio-spectral (JSS) feature selection can be implemented. By \u201cjoint,\u201d it is meant that spatial and spectral characteristics of a given multispectral (MS) or hyperspectral (HS) image are simultaneously taken into consideration. JSS feature selection can offer unique opportunities for image processing and remote sensing as it enables taking advantage of the correlation between spatial and spectral features.","Spectral ratio signatures can be used in an approach for JSS-based edge detection, termed spectral ratio contrast (SRC) edge-detection algorithm. The SRC can be verified using MS and HS imagery from a quantum-dot in a well (DWELL) infrared (IR) focal plane array (FPA), and the Airborne Hyperspectral Imager (AHI), respectively. The DWELL FPA is a special type MS imager, characterized by the unique property that its spectral bands are selected electrically by altering the applied bias as shown in .","In an example embodiment, spectral ratio contrast, namely band ratios, can be used to define an edge signature for an edge between two materials. The edge signature provides an index. The edge signature represents an optimized combination of spectral ratios calculated using bands that enhance the spectral contrast between the two materials. In conjunction with a spatial mask, the edge signatures give rise to a multispectral operator that can be viewed as non-separable with respect to the spectral and spatial domains, three-dimensional extension of the spatial mask. In the extended mask, the third (spectral) dimension of each hyper-pixel can be chosen independently. Such a mask does not operate in a single image plane but instead fuses information from multiple planes.  shows an example of a non-separable spatio-spectral mask.","In an example embodiment, a SRC approach can include two stages. The first stage can be implemented as a training stage, which identifies the bands that maximize the spectral contrast between two given materials. A small subset of ratios that can reliably discriminate the edge between two materials from other spatial features is selected. Such a subset can be referred to as a spectral ratio index or signature of the edge. In order to extract spatial features such as edges, the edge signatures can be combined with a suitable spatial mask to obtain a joint spatio-spectral SRC mask. Obtaining the joint spatio-spectral SRC mask provides a second stage of SRC, that is, the second stage provides a feature extraction step using the three-dimensional mask defined by the bands selected at the training stage. Note that in SRC, a spatial mask is used in a fundamentally different manner from the standard use of a mask as used in the context of gray-scale images. Whereas in gray-scale edge detection the response is single-valued, in SRC the response is multi-valued, returning the ratios of suitably defined pixel pairs from that structuring element. Starting from a given spatial mask, a JSS SRC mask can be defined by retaining the spatial domain of the former and redefining its action in terms of spectral ratios corresponding to the bands from a given edge signature.","The presence of two stages in SRC provides an important distinction from the MCG-based edge detection and other unsupervised edge detection algorithms. A second difference arises from the fact that SRC is not derivative based, i.e., in SRC edge detection is effected by matching a given edge signature rather than by measuring the gradient magnitude. Because the edge signatures and the associated tolerance values are determined independently for each pair of classes of materials, the edge extraction depends only on the quality of the selection criteria used to obtain the edge signature for a given pair and not on the strength of the edge as measured by its MCG value. As a result, the SRC approach is particularly well suited to situations where the edge between two given materials is \u201cweak,\u201d as measured by its MCG value.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-C","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B","FIGS. 3B and 3C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-E","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4D","FIG. 4E","FIGS. 4A-E","FIG. 4B"],"b":["417","417"]},"In various embodiments, application of spectral ratios to define MS and HS operators for edge detection can be implemented. Besides the potential for significant data compression in HS and MS image processing, spectral ratios appear to be particularly well-suited for intelligent sensing modalities using a spectrally tunable sensor, such as the electrically tunable DWELL FPA. For example, a training stage in a SRC approach can extract information about the most informative, with respect to edge detection, bias voltages (bands) in the sensed image. Image acquisition for a scene can then be carried out using only the relevant biases, thereby significantly reducing the amount of data necessary for the image segmentation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["510","520","530"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["610","620","630","640","650","660"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","755","702","725","702","702"]},"Memory  can include instructions stored thereon to operate according to algorithms and techniques discussed herein including, but not limited to, the methods associated with .

A similar effect can be achieved by setting {tilde over (S)}=S and increasing or decreasing the number of ratios in the edge signature \u03b5.","Extension of the above approach to three or more materials is straightforward. For the case of three distinct materials A, B and C, there are three possible edge classes: between A and B, between A and C, and between B and C. Accordingly, at the training stage three edge signatures, \u03b5, \u03b5, and \u03b5, three tolerance values \u03b5, \u03b5, and \u03b5, and three joint spatio-spectral masks K, K, and Kcan be defined.","At the feature extraction stage, the responses of K, K, and Kcan be used to identify the hyper-pixels belonging to edge Ebetween A and B, edge Ebetween A and C, and edge Ebetween B and C. The final image segmentation is obtained by the union of the three edges:\n\n\u2003\u2003(21)\n\nThe training and testing phases of the SRC algorithm are shown schematically in , respectively. Because the edge signatures and the associated tolerance values are determined independently for each pair of classes, the feature extraction depends only on the quality of the selection criteria used to obtain the edge signature for this pair and not on the strength of the edge, as measured by its MCG value. As a result, the SRC approach is particularly well suited to situations where the edge between two given materials is \u201cweak,\u201d as measured by its MCG value, compared to the edges between the other materials in the scene. For scenes that contain both \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d edges, as measured by their MCG gradients, an MCG-based feature extraction would require sophisticated locally adaptive threshold strategies to capture the \u201cweak\u201d edges. If a single, non-adaptive threshold is used, in order for MCG to pick the weak edges one has to increase the tolerance to a point where the noise level may become unacceptable.\n","The processing complexity of the SRC algorithm can be estimated by an estimate of the complexity of the feature extraction stage in the SRC algorithm, since the training stage is not included in the SRC complexity estimate because it is usually done off-line, before the actual image processing commences. Consider an HS or an MS image given by a hypercube with dimensions I\u00d7J\u00d7K. Recall that I\u00d7J is the dimension of the image plane whereas K is the number of spectral bands, which ranges from tens for MS images, to hundreds for HS images.","The cost of the feature extraction stage of SRC includes (1) the cost to compute the response K(i, j) of the SRC mask at every pixel, including the reciprocal ratios (K(i, j, s))needed in equation (18), (2) the cost to form the indicator matrix (5.12), and (3) the cost to compute the edge map according to equation (20). From these three steps the first one is the costliest, as it involves floating point arithmetic. The second and the third steps require mostly integer arithmetic and logical operations that are faster than floating point arithmetic. Nonetheless, for simplicity, in the cost estimate all operations can be counted as being the same, without regard to the fact that some of them take less CPU time to execute.","Computation of the response K(i, j) at a single pixel (including the computation of the reciprocal ratios) takes 2MS operations. Thus, the total operation count for Step 1 is 2(I\u00d7J)\u00d7MS. Forming the indicator matrix at Step 2 is based on equation (18) and requires at most four comparisons. Therefore, the cost of forming a single entry of \u03bb(i, j) is 4 operations, the cost of forming \u03bb(i, j) is 4MS and the cost of forming \u03bb(i, j) for all pixels is 4(I\u00d7J)\u00d7MS.","Finally, Step 3 requires computation of the matrix infinity norm of \u03bb(i, j) for every pixel location {i, j}. Recall that the matrix infinity norm is the maximum absolute row sum of the matrix. Summing up the elements in a single row of \u03bb(i, j) takes S\u22121 operations and so, computation of all row sums requires M(S\u22121) operations. In the worst-case scenario, finding the largest of these sums takes M\u22121 comparisons. It follows that the per-pixel cost of Step 3 is M(M\u22121)(S\u22121) operations, and the total cost of this step is (I\u00d7J)\u00d7M(M\u22121)(S\u22121).","An edge signature can be formed as a pairwise ratio edge index. In this section, a strategy is described in which the selection of the spectral ratios forming the edge signature \u03b5is restricted to the diagonal elements of the spectral ratio index A\/B defined in equation (4). These ratios correspond to spectral bands with the same numbers, thus the term \u201cpairwise ratios\u201d.","To motivate this strategy note that in the ideal case the spectral ratio index A\/A for two identical materials has diagonal elements equal to one. Therefore, hyper-pixels from the same class will have nearly constant pairwise ratios close to 1, while hyper-pixels from different classes will have at least some of their pairwise ratios away from 1.","Variability of pairwise band ratios can play the same role for multi-color images as gray-scale discontinuity and similarity for gray-scale images. The objective is to define the pairwise ratio edge signatures using a small number of ratios (S<<K) that can discriminate the edges between the different class types. Roughly speaking, diagonal elements of the spectral ratio index A\/B are sought that best capture the \u201cshape\u201d of its diagonal.","One fairly straightforward approach that performs well in practice, is to use the maximum and the minimum pairwise ratios, i.e., set\n\n\u03b5={(,\u03c1),(,\u03c1)}\u2003\u2003(22)\n\nwhere kand kare the band indices corresponding to the minimum and maximum diagonal elements of A\/B, respectively. Note that for consistency with the notation in equation (5) both bands forming the ratio are stated explicitly even though they are the same.\n","The associated tolerances can be determined in several different ways.

More complex pairwise signatures can be created by including additional band ratios in a recursive manner as follows. Starting from a basic 2-band min-max signature, a 3-band signature can obtained by adding the band corresponding to the next maximum ratio. Alternatively, a 4-band signature can be obtained by adding 2 bands for the next maximum and minimum ratios, or another 3-band signature by adding the band for the next minimum ratio. This process can be repeated until a satisfactory signature is obtained. Also, sensitivity to noise can be further reduced by increasing the number of pairwise band ratios in the signature, i.e., the number S in equation (20).","Because the choice of ratios in the pairwise strategy is limited to the diagonal elements of the spectral ratio index A\/B in equation (4), it is clear that in some cases this strategy may not perform as well as a more general strategy that allows one to choose from all possible ratio combinations in A\/B. For example, if two materials have hyper-pixels that are translations of each other, i.e., differ by a constant intensity factor, then the pairwise strategy will fail if the data is normalized. Likewise, a \u201cweak\u201d edge will have pairwise ratio close to one and so, its pairwise signature will be close to that of identical materials. Consequently, the pairwise approach will tend to miss weak edges.","An alternative ratio selection strategy that is not restricted to the diagonal elements of A\/B can be realized by a cross-ratio edge index.

This is an important result because it enables potentially significant data compression with minimal loss of the ability to extract the spatial features.","In various embodiments, a joint spatio-spectral approach can be implemented for image segmentation of MS and HS images. The SRC algorithm differs from the existing edge detection methodologies for such images in several important ways. Unlike the multi-color gradient (MCG) or the morphological color gradient (MoCG) approaches, the SRC algorithm is not an extension of an existing gray-scale processing methodology, instead it is designed from the onset as a dedicated MS\/HS edge detection algorithm. In particular, the SRC algorithm fuses a given spatial mask with the spectral band ratios from a given edge signature into a non-separable, three-dimensional spatio-spectral mask.","Another equally important distinction is that an SRC approach utilizes the concept of the spectral ratio contrast to estimate similarity and discontinuity in a given HS\/MS image, rather than measuring the rate of change in the image, as in the MCG and MoCG algorithms. Among other things, by requiring only a few bands per edge signature, the use of spectral ratios in the SRC enables unprecedented levels of data compression at the feature extraction stage. This aspect of the SRC approach is particularly attractive for HS images, for which the number of bands can be as high as several hundred. Another distinction between the SRC technique and other approaches is that the SRC technique is a two-stage procedure comprising a training phase and a feature extraction phase.","Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement that is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiments shown.
