{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments generally relate to computer systems, and more particularly to methods and systems for extrapolating tabular structure in a freeform document to facilitate manipulation of elements in the freeform document.","One of the primary factors considered in the design and development of software applications is ease of use. Often the difference between a successful software application and an unsuccessful software application is decided by the user's experience when interacting with the software. One such competitive segment of software applications is Business Intelligence (BI) applications, such as, Crystal Reports\u00ae by SAP\u00ae. A report is a document that includes information automatically retrieved (i.e., in response to computer executable instructions) from a data source (e.g., a database, a data warehouse, and the like), where the information is processed, structured, and formatted in accordance with a report schema. The schema is the template of the report, defines a base query, and specifies the form in which the information should be presented. In creating and updating reports, users are given the ability to include content or elements or objects on a freeform canvas\/document. Such freeform documents enhance the understanding of the business model by providing professional reports suited to individual and\/or business needs.","Freeform canvas or document does not force users to layout the elements in a predefined way. Therefore, the freeform documents facilitate users to layout the elements as per their desire for spotting and analyzing business data. In general, the freeform document facilitates providing historical, current, and predictive views of business operations in a user friendly way. However, the freeform documents have one or more following limitations during modification or manipulation of the elements in the freeform documents.","Currently, the freeform documents lack structural associations among elements as they do not force the user to layout the elements in the predefined way, which makes creation and modification of tabular layouts tedious. Conversely, enforcing a structure such as a table or a grid does not allow flexibility in layout of a strict structure. Therefore, a method to provide structured interactions without enforcing structure in the freeform document, i.e., to extrapolate tabular structure in a freeform document, would be desirable to facilitate easy manipulation of elements in the freeform document.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for extrapolating tabular structure to facilitate manipulation of elements in the freeform document are described herein. The freeform document includes an unstructured canvas providing users the ability to place one or more elements on the canvas. A primary column is determined by the selection of at least one element in the freeform document. Further, one or more secondary columns in the freeform document corresponding to the primary column are determined. A tabular structure in the freeform document is extrapolated based on the determined primary column and the one or more secondary columns to facilitate manipulation of elements in the freeform document, such as reordering, resizing and deleting the one or more elements, and inserting one or more new elements in the freeform document.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for extrapolating a tabular structure in a freeform document to facilitate manipulation of elements in the freeform document are described herein. Freeform document includes a canvas such as PowerPoint\u00ae document by Microsoft\u00ae, an Illustrator\u00ae document by Adobe\u00ae, an AutoCAD\u00ae document and the like, which provides a user with the ability to place contents or elements or objects on the canvas such that the elements can occupy any position within the canvas as desired by the user. The user refers to an agent, a human, a computer, other mechanism or actors capable of creating and manipulating the freeform document. In other words, the freeform document includes the canvas which does not force the elements to layout in a predefined way like a Microsoft\u00ae Access\u00ae document or define a finite set of locations to place the elements like a Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae document. Example of freeform documents includes, a Business Intelligence (BI) documents such as reports and dashboards. Examples of report include the documents created in a Crystal Reports\u00ae and SAP\u00ae Business Objects\u2122 Web Intelligence\u00ae. Examples of dashboards are created by Xcelsius\u00ae, SAP\u00ae Crystal Dashboard Design\u2122, and SAP\u00ae Crystal Presentation Design\u2122. The degree to which a freeform canvas is freeform varies with embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments, the canvas can be segmented into sections, e.g., horizontal bands in the report, a tab in the dashboard and the like. In some embodiments, the sections are placed freeform. In some embodiments, the formatting within the section, the layout is freeform.","The tabular structure in the freeform document is extrapolated to manipulate the elements in the freeform document such as to reorder the elements, resize the elements, delete the elements, insert new elements, and the like. In one embodiment, the tabular structure is extrapolated based on an element selected by the user in the freeform document. A primary column is determined for the selected element in a freeform document. Further, one or more secondary columns in the freeform document corresponding to the primary column are determined. Further, the tabular structure in the freeform document is extrapolated based on the determined primary column and the one or more secondary columns to facilitate manipulation of elements in the freeform document. In addition, one or more spanning elements which span a plurality of columns including the primary column and the secondary columns in the freeform document are identified to extrapolate the tabular structure in the freeform document.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. As well, while certain methods described with separately delineated steps these should not be construed as necessarily order dependent or being separate in their performance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","120"]},"At step , one or more secondary columns in the freeform document corresponding to the primary column are determined. In one embodiment, the secondary columns are determined by identifying a top border or a bottom border for each of the elements in the primary column. Further, the one or more additional elements with the identified top border or the bottom border in the freeform document are identified. Furthermore, the secondary column for each of the identified additional elements is determined by identifying a left side border and a right side border of each of the identified additional elements. The determined secondary columns may include duplicates of the secondary columns as one or more additional elements may include same secondary column. Therefore, the duplicate secondary columns from the determined secondary columns are removed.","At step , the tabular structure in the freeform document is extrapolated based on the determined primary column as in step  and the one or more secondary columns as in step , to facilitate manipulation of elements in the freeform document. In addition, one or more spanning elements in the freeform document corresponding to the primary column and the secondary columns are determined. The spanning elements are elements that span horizontally across a plurality of columns including the primary column and the secondary columns. In one embodiment, a computer display, displaying the freeform document, is updated to include the extrapolated tabular structure. The manipulation of elements may include reordering, resizing, and deleting the elements in the freeform document, and also to include one or more new elements.","The number of processing steps varies with embodiments of the invention. In an embodiment, further processing operations can be included. In an embodiment, at step  after an element has been selected, a vertical search is made for a primary column. Then, in step , a horizontal search is made for one or more secondary columns. This search includes another vertical search. In some embodiments, a further horizontal search is made. In some embodiments, a further vertical search is made. In some embodiments, both are done. In an embodiment, in step , a horizontal and vertical search is made for primary and secondary columns. Extrapolating the tabular structure is illustrated with an example in , A to C, , and .
