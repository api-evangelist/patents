title: Patent analytics system
abstract: In an example embodiment, there is a method of maintaining a database of patent claim entries. The patent claim entries are associated with one or more patent documents as well as one or more parameters characterizing a patent claim. The database may be accessed to retrieve a selection of one or more patent claim entries. This may be accomplished by retrieving the one or more parameters associated with the selection of the one or more patent claim entries. Additionally, one or more of the parameters characterizing a patent claims may be selected. A report chart is presented on a display device. The report chart depicts relationships between the selected parameters and the one or more patent claim entries retrieved from the database. The relationships are depicted as a plurality of data points. Also a visualization option may be selected and the report chart may be modified based on the selection. The visualization options may include highlighting related data points, presenting claim language associated with a data point, and presenting more parameters associated with the data point.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This patent application claims the benefit of priority, under 35 U.S.C. Section 119(e), to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/113,114, entitled \u201cPATENT DATABASE AND ANALYTICS ENGINE,\u201d filed on Nov. 10, 2008 which is hereby incorporated by reference. This patent application also claims priority, under 35 U.S.C. Section 119(e), to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/115,284, entitled \u201cPATENT CLAIM REFERENCE GENERATION,\u201d filed on Nov. 17, 2008 which is hereby incorporated by reference.","This patent document relates generally to patent claim information as implemented in software, and more specifically, but not by way of limitation, to a patent claim reference and analytics system.","The value of a patent and the technology disclosed therein, to some extent, hinges on the ability to identify patents, printed publications, and other data within the same technology space as the patented technology. Once identified, the relative strength of the patent and its claims may be determined.","The following detailed description includes references to the accompanying drawings, which form a part of the detailed description. The drawings show, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments, which are also referred to herein as \u201cexamples,\u201d are illustrated in enough detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. The embodiments may be combined, other embodiments may be utilized, or structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","In this document, the terms \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d are used, as is common in patent documents, to include one or more than one. In this document, the term \u201cor\u201d is used to refer to a nonexclusive or, unless otherwise indicated. Furthermore, all publications, patents, and patent documents referred to in this document are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, as though individually incorporated by reference. In the event of inconsistent usages between this document and those documents so incorporated by reference, the usage in the incorporated reference(s) should be considered supplementary to that of this document; for irreconcilable inconsistencies, the usage in this document controls.","Various embodiments illustrated herein provide computerized patent analytics systems, methods, data structures, and encoded instructions. Some such embodiments provide methods of storing patent reference data, subjective patent data, methods of presenting patent reference data, methods of presenting subjective patent data, and method of presenting a combination of the subjective and reference data.","Pharmaceutical companies, like many companies, need to make determinations of where best to spend their resources. In particular, there is particular value in being the first company to genericize a commercial drug as there exists a 180-day period of exclusivity for the first company to file under the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process. The process for filing for filing an ANDA may involve the financial, technical, regulatory, and legal departments of a company. The business department may need to identify those drugs that represent significant revenue potential (e.g., those that satisfy suitable sales and market share). The technical department may possess the technical capabilities to develop the generic drug, including the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API). The regulatory department may need to demonstrate bioequivalence. Finally, the legal department may need to show non-infringement or invalidity of existing patents.","There may be many challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome in order to successively bring a generic drug to market. For example, the business development group (BDG) may to need to consider past and future sales and past and future market share to determine if it is financially worthwhile to move into a particular market. The BDG may also wish to know which drugs have been already genericized and the sales of those drugs. For example, it may still be useful to genericize a commercial drug if there is a low number of a generic drugs relative to the total market share for the commercial drug.","The legal department may need to decide whether to certify under paragraph III or paragraph IV. Also, the breadth of patent protection may vary depending on the patent specification and claims of the patent. Subjective determinations of a patent may be made to determine the value of the patent to a given company. For example, an analysis of a patent may include determining whether each patent claim is broad, narrow, or somewhere in between. This information may help to determine whether or not the breadth of patent protection makes it feasible to genericize a particular drug. Other important information may include when relevant patents expire, as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) periods of exclusivity. In some instances, a company may seek an opinion letter from a law firm to determine non-infringement or invalidity positions. However, opinions may expensive and time consuming to obtain. The legal department may also be used to conduct a freedom-to-operate (FTO) clearance review for non-Orange Book (e.g., \u201cprocess\u201d or third-party) patents.","In an example embodiment, methods and systems are developed to help streamline the ANDA process. The systems and methods may also be used in other aspects of business or patent analysis, as one skilled in the art will appreciate. In an example embodiment, a web-based solution is developed to help senior management, business development personnel, financial personnel, in-house counsel, opinion counsel, litigation counsel, and licensing and transactional counsel with the ANDA process. In an example embodiment there are three main components used to facilitate this process: database creation through the gathering of patent and drug reference information, analytics, and report\/chart generation based on merging information in the database with the applied analytics. Each main component may include one or more additional components as described below.","In an example embodiment, at a high level, the database creation component may include an automated process of gathering objective patent reference information into a database that may include, but is not limited to, claim language, patent expiration data, intrinsic evidence, and extrinsic evidence associated with the patent. It may further include gathering information from regulatory, legal, technical, and financial sources including, but not limited to, the Orange Book, United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Orange Book patents, Drug Information, and SEC filings. A user of the resulting database may search and filter results to quickly find information related to any number of drugs and see patents associated with the drug. Reports may be generated from the database that take the raw data and present it in a form that non-legal and non-technical personnel can utilize. For example, business personnel may inquire as to the number of patents related to drug X and the expiration dates of the patents. As the database may be constantly updated in real-time, the report may also include the most up-to-date information.","In an example embodiment, the analytics component may include ranking and rating patent claims by applying subjective criteria to the gathered patents. The subjective criteria may include, but is not limited to, if a claim is listable in the Orange Book, the breadth of claims in patents, whether or not a claim covers a commercial product, the type of claim, and claim category. Determining whether or not a drug is listable in Orange Book may include information relating to \u201coff label\u201d use, metabolite, pro-drug, processing claims, key synthetic intermediates, etc. The claim breadth or scope may be based on criteria such ease of design-around ability and anticipated validity. There may also be a subjective analysis of a patent claim to determine whether a claim has been drafted narrowly or broadly. Claim types may include, but are not limited to, compound, method of use, polymorph, hydrate, and method of medical use. Claim categories may include, but are not limited to core, ancillary, and evergreen. In an example embodiment, a legend or key is provided that defines each term used in the subjective criteria as well as why a patent was given a particular rating.","In an example embodiment, once the database has been populated with reference information, and the claims have been analyzed using the various subjective criteria, charts may be generated by using one or both of the resulting data sets. This may be done by displaying objective data from the database against subjective criteria from the analytics component together on a chart. For example, a user of the system may search the database to find all patents related to a drug such as Crestor\u00ae. The user may further wish to see the expiration dates of all patents related to Crestor\u00ae against the breadth of their claims. In this manner non-technical personnel can quickly see what patents either need to be licensed or designed around in order to bring a generic drug to market. If a business knows it is not planning on launching the new drug for three years, a user can look at the chart and quickly determine which patents may safely be ignored. Other combinations of the objective data and subjective criteria are explored more fully below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","110","110","106","110","102","104","104","106","108","102","110"]},"In some embodiments, a data request (e.g., a search query)  is made by the patent analytics system  seeking data relating to chemical molecules, compounds or other patentable subject matter. As may be more fully illustrated below, this data request may take the form of the execution of a Web crawler or other application designed to elicit information from, for example Web pages or other sources of data available on the network . In some cases, direct queries may be made of a specific drug website (e.g., the Orange Book Website). Once a data request  is made, then drug data  may be returned from each of the Websites in response to the query. In some cases, the drug data  (e.g., retrieved data or data) may be pulled from the Website by, for example, a Web crawling application, while in other cases it may be pushed by the Website in response to a direct query by the patent analytics system . Similarly, the data request  may formatted to request patent data  from the USPTO website . This patent data may include, but is not limited to, prosecution history, patent claims, patent claim revisions, and patent reference data (e.g. filing date, expiration date, etc.). Further, this drug and patent data may be in the form of, for example, a Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) based web page, a Portable Document Format (.pdf) formatted file, or some other suitable file (e.g., .tiff, .png, .gif. etc.). As will be more fully illustrated below, upon retrieval, this drug and patent data may be parsed based upon claim language, limitations, and stored for future use.","In some example embodiments, ranking data  is transmitted from the client computer  to the patent analytics system . As explained above, this ranking data may include data associated with the scope, type, and category or patent claims stored in the patent analytics system . Further illustrated is a report request  that is communicated to the patent analytics system  via the network . An example report request  may include a request for information stored in the patent analytics system  such as ranking data, drug data, patent data, or any combination thereof. In response to a report quest , the patent analytics system may retrieve the requested data, transform it into a graphic representation, and transmit it as report data  to the client computer  where it may be presented on a display device.","In some embodiments, Website and associated data stores relating to arts other than the chemical and biological arts may be accessed for the purpose of obtaining information relating to a patent. For example, when obtaining information relating to the patent in the electrical or software arts, web site Web sites run by organizations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) or the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) may be accessed for the purpose of obtaining extrinsic evidence. The use of Website and data sources related to the chemical and biotechnology arts is merely for illustrative purposes and is not meant to limit the scope of the system and method illustrated herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","102","202","204","206","208","210","212","222","202","204","206","208","210","202","204","206","208","210","222","222"]},"One or more client computers  may be communicatively coupled to the patent analytics system  via a network . The network  may include a single LAN or WAN, or combinations of LANs or WANs, such as the Internet. The various devices coupled to the network  may be coupled to the network  via one or more wired or wireless connections. One or more public data warehouses  and one or more private data warehouses  may also be communicatively coupled to the patent analytics system  via the network .","The Web server  may communicate with the file server  to publish or serve files stored on the file server . The Web server  may also communicate or interface with the application server  to enable Web-based presentation of patent-related information. For example, the application server  may consist of scripts, applications, or library files that provide primary or auxiliary functionality to the Web server  (e.g., multimedia, file transfer, or dynamic interface functions). In addition, the application server  may also provide some or an entire interface for the Web server  to communicate with one or more of the other servers in the patent analytics system , e.g., the messaging server  or the database management server .","The application server  may also contain one or more software programs capable of searching, collecting, or organizing references from disparate sources. One example of such a program includes a Web crawler, also known as a Web spider or robot. Web crawlers include programs that are specifically designed to browse the World Wide Web in an automated, methodical manner. Some Web crawlers are programmable, such as being able to filter on a particular subject matter area or restrict crawling to a particular group of Web sites. Another example of a software program that may be hosted on the application server  for such an operation includes a script or a dedicated program to periodically or regularly search one or more specific Web sites. Such a script or dedicated program may be available from a content provider. For example, a content provider may grant licenses to proprietary content for a fee. As a provision of the license, the licensee may be given a program, such as a client program, to access the proprietary content. The client program may be configurable to automatically search or retrieve data from the content provider's data store and save resulting data, such as to the patent database .","In some embodiments, this Web crawler application may have a selection policy geared toward downloading Web pages and the content contained therein relating to pharmaceutical industry drug data. This policy may provide a uniform policy for revisiting certain Web sites displaying pharmaceutical industry drug data where all Web sites are re-visited with the same frequency, regardless of the rate of content or Web page change taking place on the site. In some embodiments, a proportional policy may be invoked where Web sites are re-visited based upon the frequency of Web page or content change on a particular Web site. In some embodiments, the crawler application itself engages in, for example, path-ascending crawling, focused crawling, deep Web crawling, and\/or may restrict the number of followed links that it analyzes. Some embodiments may include some other suitable Web crawler application(s).","Public data warehouses  may include an online interface and a data storage mechanism. For example, a Web-based interface may be provided such that a user may access the public data warehouse  to search for patents or publications related to an issued patent. Examples of a public data warehouse  include the USPTO Web site (www.uspto.gov), the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Web site (www.fda.gov), and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Web site (www.wipo.int).","Private data warehouses  may include online or offline data stores. Online data stores may be configured similar to public data warehouses , such as by providing an interface (e.g., a Web browser interface) to a data source (e.g., a database). Examples of private data warehouses  include Thompson WESTLAW\u00ae (www.westlaw.com) and LEXISNEXIS\u00ae (www.lexis.com). Typically private data warehouses  include a membership or subscription to browse, view, or search data. Other private data warehouses  may use a \u201cpay per use\u201d fee structure.","The patent database  may include data such as published patent applications, issued patents, publications, objective and subjective patent data and the like. The patent database  may be implemented as a relational database, a centralized database, a distributed database, an object-oriented database, a flat database, or other database type depending on the specific embodiment. In some embodiments, the patent database  includes one or more databases (e.g., a patent database, a publications database, a user database, a search terms database, a claim limitations database, a ranking database), such that the combination of the one or more databases may be referred to as a patent database.","During operation, in one embodiment, patent reference information is collected and stored in the patent database . A user (not shown) may access the patent analytics system , such as by using a client computer  over the network . The user may select a patent application or publication of interest and review one or more references related to the patent application or publication. In some embodiments, summary reports or other information may be sent to the user, for example at the user's request or periodically, via the messaging server . The user may further submit subjective patent data (e.g., claim breadth) and objective patent data (e.g., type of a patent claim) to the patent analytics system . The patent analytics system  may then store the received subjective and objective patent data in the patent database  such that it is associated with the patent reference information. Messages distributed by the messaging server  may include one or more of e-mail, voice, text messaging, or other communication protocols or mediums. Further capabilities of the patent analytics system  are illustrated herein.","Database Component","Patents in the United States are granted to inventors of new processes, devices, manufacturable objects, and compositions. An issued patent gives the inventor the right to exclude others from practicing what is claimed in the issued claims of the patent for a period of time, in exchange for disclosure of information related to the invention such as the best mode known of practicing the invention and sufficient description in the specification portion of the patent for someone skilled in the area of the patent to practice what the patent claims. The claims of a patent are therefore used to define the scope of what the patent covers, and the remainder of the patent supports or explains what is covered in the claims.","Obtaining a United States patent involves filing a patent application with the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), which is a government entity within the Department of Commerce. The patent application is examined for proper form, for novelty, and for other purposes. The process of examination is also referred to as patent prosecution. Patent prosecution may include one or more official PTO correspondences between the PTO and the inventor or the inventor's representative. Such correspondence may include assertions regarding suspected problems with the patent application by a PTO Examiner, as well as responses, which may include arguments or amendments, by inventors or their representatives. Information exchanged during this patent prosecution process is often useful in determining the scope of a patent, because amendments, arguments, or disclosures made during prosecution may limit the scope or validity of patent claims under some patent laws.","In certain situations, such as during litigation or re-examination, evidence may be used to interpret or limit the claims. During prosecution, a record is created. This prosecution record, including the patent itself, is considered \u201cintrinsic evidence.\u201d In addition to intrinsic evidence, some \u201cextrinsic evidence\u201d may be referenced. Extrinsic evidence, such as dictionary definitions of terms and published papers or articles, may also be used to interpret or define terms or phrases used in claims. Gathering and evaluating intrinsic and extrinsic evidence is time consuming and burdensome. Typically, to determine relevant intrinsic evidence, the patent prosecution record and references used during prosecution may be obtained and carefully evaluated by legal personnel. Additionally, to obtain extrinsic evidence, publications (e.g., papers, books, dictionaries, technical manuals, etc.), or experts may be consulted.","The process of gathering and organizing intrinsic and extrinsic evidence related to a patent application's prosecution is expensive and time-consuming. Various factors including the volume of information that must be considered and the expertise and training required to provide a thorough legal analysis contribute to this burden.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","112","102","112","302","110","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","114","112","114","112","114","401","402","404","403","114","114"]},"Example Logic and Interfaces",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","504","506","508","510","512","514","516","518","520","522","500"]},"At , a patent of interest is identified. Using the patent, a drug name of interest is identified through the implementation of operation . For example, if a user is attempting to evaluate the validity or position of infringement of a pharmaceutical patent, the drug name may include the primary operation of the patent. Using the drug name, a regulatory database (e.g., the Orange Book) may be searched and information retrieved via the implementation of an operation  to produce related patents. Related patents may include patents in a \u201cpatent family\u201d (e.g., parents or descendents based on continuation, divisional, or other related applications). In addition, periods of exclusivity may also be collected. The related patents provide additional search criteria for further searching of other data sources, such as the ANDA filings or other technical information databases. At , an operation is illustrated such that the related patent numbers are used to search and information retrieved from these sources for additional drug filings, drug, formulation, or ingredient information. The combined collection of search results (e.g., retrieved information) from block  and block  is filtered or \u201cscrubbed\u201d at , such as to remove irrelevant information with regard to one or more claim limitations included in the identified patent from block . Filtering may include actions such as removing duplicate search terms, consolidating search terms, determining synonyms of search terms, comparing search terms to terms found in the patent of interest or its claims, or other steps to pare down terms to a core of relevant search terms.","The relevant search terms may then be used in one or more progressive searches, such as to search the USPTO (see e.g., operation ) for additional U.S. patents or patent applications not found in the Orange Book, search international patent databases (see e.g., operation ) for relevant non-U.S. patents or patent applications, or search information databases (e.g., technical database or the World Wide Web) for relevant non-patent literature (see e.g., operation ). The relevant patents obtained from searches of domestic  or international  databases may be further processed by extracting relevant claims via the implementation of operation . Relevant claims may include claims that recite the composition or formulation of an active ingredient, including those that include a drug carrier, methods of manufacturing the active ingredient in the drug, methods of manufacturing the active ingredient in the drug, methods of using the active ingredient (e.g., methods of treatment), or specific formulations of the active ingredient (e.g., formulations including a salt, solvate, polymorph, or metabolite of the active ingredient, or a pro-drug of the active ingredient). The augmented collection of information from the various sources may be stored in the patent analytics system , such as in the patent database . Once the relevant claims are extracted, an operation  is carried out that assembles retrieved information into a file, data stream, or the like. Further, the operation  may assemble the retrieved information and extracted relevant claims, and to place this information and extracted claims into some type of file (e.g., an XML based file) for future use or display. As reflected in the implementation of operation , portions of the U.S. patents and applications, non-U.S. patents and applications, and non-patent literature may be presented to a user in one or more forms, as illustrated herein, including clean claims, marked up claims, and various versions of claim charts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","600","600","600","600","600","600","600","600","600","600","600","602","602","604","606","606","606","608","608","608","608"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIGS. 7-10","FIG. 2","FIGS. 7-10","FIG. 7"],"b":["102","700","702","704","706","708","702","704","706","708"]},"In addition to the navigation links -, the directory screen  includes a search input control . The search input control  may be implemented as an HTML form control in some embodiments. The user may provide one or more search strings and activate the \u201csubmit\u201d control  to initiate the search. In some embodiments, the search's domain includes the annual edition of the Orange Book, any cumulative supplements to the Orange Book, and a patent reference database (e.g.,  in ). When a user submits a search, one or more fields may be automatically searched, such as active pharmaceutical ingredient (e.g., chemical name), proprietary name (e.g., trademarked name), molecular formula, names of any commercially marketed formulations having the specified active ingredient, indication of use, sales of drug (e.g., $USD per year), type of formulation (e.g., gel, lotion, ointment), route of administration (e.g., topical, oral, IV, IP, rectal, buccal), patent holder (e.g., assignee, licensee), marketing company (NDA\/ANDA Holder), application number (FDA), patent number, claim terms, patent expiration date, or FDA period of exclusivity. In some embodiments, a user may be provided one or more controls, such as HTML form controls, to select or choose which of the one or more fields to search.","Finally, an example run report control  is displayed on the directory screen . By activating the run report control  a user may generate a formatted report, such as illustrated in more detail below, using one or more search terms provided in the search input control .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","710","712","800","212","802","804"]},"In some embodiments, when a search is detected to possibly return a large number of results, the user may be notified of such a condition and be provided a control to terminate the search.  illustrates an example of a search in progress screen . The search in progress screen  may be programmatically set to appear when a threshold number of results are determined to exist. For example, when over 1,000 results are found, a user may be presented with the search in progress screen , where the user may terminate the search or allow it to continue. In the example shown, in response to an interrupted search, a user may activate a continue control , a stop and view control , or a terminate search control . If the user activates the continue control , the search may continue to its normal completion, possibly returning a large number of search results. If the user activates the stop and view control , the search may immediately cease operation and the user may be presented with the results found at the point when the search was ceased. If the user activates the terminate search control , the search may be canceled and, in one example, the user may be provided a search input control to provide additional search terms for a successive search.","After performing one or more searches, a user may determine a particular drug of interest.  illustrates an example of a report generation screen . In some embodiments, using the run report control  in , the user may navigate to the report generation screen . The user may enter a particular drug name in the search input control  in . The system can then use the provided drug name to perform a background search of the patent database . The user is then presented with the report generation screen  and can check one or more detail checkboxes  to indicate what information to include in the report. After selecting the desired output options, the user can activate the submit control  to initiate the report generation. Report output may be in a tabular, list, or other format. The output may include links to documents, (e.g., .pdf documents, spreadsheet documents) or plain text. In some embodiments, .pdf documents are in a searchable text format. In some embodiments, when information is incomplete regarding a particular detail, the detail checkbox and description may be presented differently to indicate to the user that the option is not available in the report. For example, in , the dosages detail control  is disabled and indicated as such using italic font. In other examples, other font effects or user interface indications, such as a grayed-out font or control may be used.","In some embodiments, the system and method illustrated herein may provide a user with multiple ways to search a dynamically linked database of patent reference information; provide intelligent filtering, categorization, and organization of patent information from disparate sources; and provide a powerful and flexible reporting feature.","In the examples and embodiments illustrated above, the references, whether associated with a claim limitation manually, automatically, or by some combination thereof, may all be useful in a variety of applications. Certain processes may be largely automatic, such as where data, related to a pharmaceutical name, is automatically collected by a program or other automated agent. Other processes may include manual processes, such as search techniques used to find relevant business method patents, which are typically more abstract and may use less standardized language.","The evidence regarding the meaning and scope of claim limitations is useful to patent attorneys and others for a multitude of purposes, including determination of the scope or extent of a patent, which may be used to determine patent validity, questions of infringement, or patent value. These determinations are examples of what are often investigated when patent attorneys draft opinions or opinion letters. For example, a person marketing an invention may wish to have the validity of another inventor's patent covering the new product investigated, in hopes that the patent may be found to be invalid for some reason. As another example, a patent owner assessing whether to assert a patent against a potential infringer may wish to confirm the validity of the patent before contacting the potential infringer regarding licensing fees or possible litigation.","Formal opinions regarding patent infringement can be particularly valuable, as a party having an opinion issued in good faith indicating a particular method, article, or composition does not infringe another's patent is generally shielded from triple or treble damages for willful infringement should the party later be found to infringe the other's patent. Similarly, the party wishing to assert a patent may often investigate not only the validity of their own patent before asserting it, but may also obtain an infringement opinion to determine whether the suspected infringing product in question is in fact infringing on the patent to be asserted.","In various embodiments, extraction and organization of claim limitations and related intrinsic and extrinsic evidence may provide one or more advantages to users (e.g., patent attorneys), such as assisting in determination of the scope or extent of a patent to evaluate validity, infringement, or patent value. Such evaluations may be useful when forming legal opinion, considering lawsuits, or assessing licensing opportunities.","In some embodiments, a method is illustrated as including receiving a search query (see e.g., operation ), the search query relating to a patent, retrieving (see e.g., operations -) data relating to a term contained in a claim limitation in the patent, the data including at least one of intrinsic or extrinsic evidence associated with the term by a hyperlink, and displaying the claim limitation and the hyperlink (see e.g., operation ). In some embodiments, the hyperlink includes a mechanism to present a popup menu containing a plurality of references defining the term contained in the claim limitation. Additionally, the popup menu may display the intrinsic evidence. A further hyperlink to an electronic document containing the intrinsic evidence may also be displayed. The popup menu may also display extrinsic evidence. Also, a further hyperlink to an electronic document containing the extrinsic evidence may also be displayed. The hyperlink may include a mechanism to present a first popup menu containing the intrinsic evidence, and a second popup menu containing the extrinsic evidence.
