title: Method and apparatus for object pose estimation
abstract: A pose of an object is estimated from an from an input image and an object pose estimation is then stored by: inputting an image containing an object; creating a binary mask of the input image; extracting a set of singlets from the binary mask of the input image, each singlet representing points in an inner and outer contour of the object in the input image; connecting the set of singlets into a mesh represented as a duplex matrix; comparing two duplex matrices to produce a set of candidate poses; and producing an object pose estimate, and storing the object pose estimate. The estimated pose of the object is refined by: inputting an image of an object in an estimated pose, a model of the object, and parameters of a camera used to take the image of the object in the estimated pose; projecting the model of the object into a virtual image of the object using the parameters of the camera and initial pose parameters to obtain a binary mask image and image depth information; and updating the initial pose parameters to new pose parameters using the binary mask image and image depth information and updating the new pose parameters iteratively to minimize an energy function or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["In the many industrial settings today, robots are used for parts assembly and manufacturing. These robots are equipped with one or more cameras, e.g. CCD and CMOS, which give them vision. Often, objects (i.e. parts) are contained in a bin. The robot must recognize the object\/part in the bin so it can pick it up to assemble the product. However, the object can be in any number of poses (position, orientation, rotation). So, the robot must be trained to recognize the part regardless of its pose. The present invention relates to estimating the pose of a three-dimensional (3D) object from two-dimensional images (e.g. camera images) so that a robot can be trained to recognize the object regardless of its pose as seen from its on-board camera. As is known in the art, robots include software that attempt to identify the object from the camera image. Therefore it important for such software to have a robust and accurate database of object images with which to compare to the image captured by the robot camera.","One aspect of the present invention is a method and apparatus for estimating a pose of an object from an input image and storing an object pose estimation, comprising: inputting an image containing an object; creating a binary mask of the input image; extracting a set of singlets from the binary mask of the input image, each singlet representing points in an inner and outer contour of the object in the input image; connecting the set of singlets into a mesh represented as a duplex matrix; comparing two duplex matrices to produce a set of candidate poses; and producing an object pose estimate, and storing the object pose estimate.","In an embodiment of the invention, a plurality of images of the object are input, each image containing a view of the object that is different than a view in each other of the plurality of images. One aspect comprises generating the view in each of the plurality of images of the object using a CAD model for the object. Another aspect comprises generating the view in each of the plurality of images of the object using a robot equipped with a camera.","A further aspect of the invention comprises detecting the object in the input image and calculating a bounding box of the object. Another aspect comprises extracting inner and outer contours of the object.","In another embodiment of the invention, the object pose estimate is refined by modeling the pose estimate as an optimization of an energy function. In one aspect, the invention calculates pose estimates iteratively to minimize an energy value in the energy function. Another aspect calculates a velocity screw to iteratively calculate pose estimates. Another aspect projects a model contour curve of the object into a virtual image using a rendering application programming interface (API) such as OpenGL, DirectX, ray tracing, etc.","In a further embodiment of the invention, the object pose estimate is refined by: inputting an image of an object in an estimated pose, a model of the object, and parameters of a camera used to take the image of the object in the estimated pose; projecting the model of the object into a virtual image of the object using the parameters of the camera and initial pose parameters to obtain a binary mask image and image depth information; updating the initial pose parameters to new pose parameters using the binary mask image and image depth information and updating the new pose parameters iteratively to minimize an energy function or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.","Another aspect of the invention comprises: calculating a mean value inside and outside the object using a cost function; and calculating a contour C of the object from the binary mask image and 3D contour points using the image depth information.","A further aspect comprises: calculating a gradient \u2207T(x,y) in x and y direction for the contour points; calculating the image Jacobian matrix; and calculating a gradient flow and velocity screw using a Gaussian Newton method.","Another aspect of the present invention comprises calculating a relative displacement using the velocity screw and a given stepwise.","Other objects and attainments together with a fuller understanding of the invention will become apparent and appreciated by referring to the following description and claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, example embodiments of the invention. In the drawings, like numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. Moreover, it is to be understood that the various embodiments of the invention, although different, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in one embodiment may be included within other embodiments. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.","In general, example embodiments relate to methods, devices, and computer-readable media for examining an image, particularly a digital image of one or more objects. The image is examined to estimate the pose (position and orientation) of a corresponding 3D object represented in the 2D image. Example embodiments create a binary mask of an image and extract a set of singlets from the binary mask. Each singlet will represent points in an inner and outer contour of the object. The set of singlets are connected into a mesh represented as a duplex matrix. Two duplex matrices are compared to produce a set of candidate poses. An object pose estimate is then produced and stored for later use, for example in a vision system for robotic parts assembly.","A schematic representation of an example object processing device  is shown in . The object processing device  exchanges data with a host computer  by way of an intervening interface . Application programs and an object processing device driver may also be stored for access on the host computer . When an image retrieve command is received from the application program, for example, the object processing device driver controls conversion of the command data to a format suitable for the object processing device  and sends the converted command data to the object processing device . The driver also receives and interprets various signals and data from the object processing device , and provides necessary information to the user by way of the host computer .","When data is sent by the host computer , the interface  receives the data and stores it in a receive buffer forming part of a RAM . The RAM  can be divided into a number of sections, for example through addressing, and allocated as different buffers, such as a receive buffer or a send buffer. Data, such as digital image data, can also be obtained by the object processing device  from the capture mechanism(s) , the flash EEPROM , or the ROM . The capture mechanism(s)  can be a camera, for example, and generate a digital image by photographing one or more objects, such as a part to be used in manufacturing and\/or assembly of a device such as a printer. A camera  can be controlled by robot , for example, or a human, or can be automatically controlled by computer , for example. The digital image of the object(s) can then be stored in the receive buffer or the send buffer of the RAM .","A processor  uses computer-executable instructions stored on a ROM  or on a flash EEPROM , for example, to perform a certain function or group of functions, such as the method  () for example. Method  will be discussed in greater detail later herein. Where the data in the receive buffer of the RAM  is a digital image, for example, the processor  can implement the methodological acts of the method  on the digital image to extract features in the digital image and further analyze the image based on the extracted features. Further processing in an imaging pipeline may then be performed on the digital image before the image is displayed on a display , such as an LCD display for example, or transferred to the host computer , for printing on printer , projected with projector , or stored on hard disk , for example.","The example method  and variations thereof disclosed herein can be implemented using non-transitory computer-readable media for carrying or having computer-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a processor of a general purpose or special purpose computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store program code in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a processor of a general purpose or special purpose computer. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","Computer-executable instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data that cause a processor of a general purpose computer or a special purpose computer to perform a certain function or group of functions. Although the subject matter is described herein in language specific to methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific acts described herein. Rather, the specific acts described herein are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims.","Examples of special purpose computers include image processing devices such as digital cameras (an example of which includes, but is not limited to, the Epson R-D1 digital camera manufactured by Seiko Epson Corporation headquartered in Owa, Suwa, Nagano, Japan), digital camcorders, projectors, printers, scanners, copiers, portable photo viewers (examples of which include, but are not limited to, the Epson P-3000 or P-5000 portable photo viewers manufactured by Seiko Epson Corporation), or portable movie players, or some combination thereof, such as a printer\/scanner\/copier combination (examples of which include, but are not limited to, the Epson Stylus Photo RX580, RX595, or RX680, the Epson Stylus CX4400, CX7400, CX8400, or CX9400Fax, and the Epson AcuLaser\u00ae CX11NF manufactured by Seiko Epson Corporation) or a printer\/scanner combination (examples of which include, but are not limited to, the Epson TM-J9000, TM-J9100, TM-J7000, TM-J7100, and TM-H6000III, all manufactured by Seiko Epson Corporation) or a digital camera\/camcorder combination.","Input Image Specifications","Referring to , the first step in method  is inputting an image (step ). The input images can be generated by robot  operating a camera (capture mechanism) . If the input image contains one object, then it should preferably occupy at least 10% of the image area. If there is more than one object in the scene, the object of interest should preferably be at least two times larger than any other object in the image (scene). The input image can also be a CAD model of the object stored, for example, in RAM  or hard disk . In a preferred embodiment, a plurality of images of the object are input and analyzed as described below. Each of the plurality of images preferably contains a view of the object that is different than a view shown in each of the other images. These plurality of images can be generated using the CAD model and\/or robot  operating a camera.","Object Localization and Extraction","The Object Localization (step ) and Object Extraction (step  stages of the present invention detect the object present in the image or scene and calculate its bounding-box. The Object Extraction stage also extracts the contours, both inner and outer, of the object. These steps\/stages are shown in greater detail in .","Generally speaking, these steps process single-channel images  () that contain one or more objects on a plain background. These steps essentially discover areas of activity in the image and therefore may be sensitive to artifacts in the background. Objects in the input image are preferably single-color and with a minimum of contrast between the background and the objects. There is no additional limitation on the color of the background or that of the different objects. Some of the objects may be darker than the background and some may be brighter than it. Objects may have similar or different colors.","Activity Calculation (, step )","During the Activity Calculation step, the image  is divided into blocks of size S\u00d7S. S, which is a number of pixels. As an example, S is 8, but a different value can be selected according to the particular environment. This configuration parameter S is referred to herein as ACTIVITY.SCALE. This step then calculates the standard deviation and the average intensity for each block and returns the outputs as the two matrixes, standard (std) and average (ave).","Active Area Selection (step )","In this step, the present invention compares the elements of the matrix std to a threshold and identifies those elements that exceed a threshold, which can be selected for a particular environment. For example, this could be a color threshold. If 8 bits are used to represent a color depth, then the threshold would be set to somewhere between 0 and 255. As will be appreciated, the active area selection step identifies pixel blocks corresponding to the color object as contrasted to the plain background. The elements identified as exceeding a selected activity threshold are input to an Activity Map.","Region Analysis (step )","The Region Analysis step  performs blob analysis on the Activity Map produced in previous step . The parameters used in this step are size, controlled by OBJECTS.SIZE.MIN (default value is 0.001) and OBJECTS.SIZE.MAX (default value is 0.1), and number of candidate regions OBJECTS.COUNT (default value is 8). The size limitations are first divided by the square of ACTIVITY.SCALE in order to convert these configuration parameters from pixels to blocks. The Region Analysis step returns the bounding box for each object, as well as its first- and second-order means and area.","During the Region Analysis step each region is given an index. The indexes of the regions start from one but are not necessarily subsequent. In other words, there are missing index values, corresponding to regions which have not matched the size constraints. An index map carries the index assigned to each block. This map is called the Boundary Map. Any block given a non-zero index in the Boundary Map is a boundary block. The rest of the blocks are either background or represent the interior of an object. The interior blocks are detected in step  described hereinafter.","Threshold Calculation (step )","The threshold calculation step  determines an optimal threshold for separating the contents of the boundary blocks for each region into foreground and background. This procedure is carried out through the following stages, done separately for each region. Here, I is the set of all the points that fall into one of the boundary blocks for the region.\n\n","The Threshold Calculation step  also determines if the object is darker than the background or vice versa. This determination is based on inspecting the pixels at the boundary of the bounding-box for each object and determining the number of them that exceed the threshold. If this number is over half the total number of pixels tallied, then it is determined that the object is darker than the background. This information OSMX_INVERSE is used in later steps. For example OSMX_INVERSE could be set to 1 if the object is darker than the background and 0 if it is lighter.","Interior Detection ()","The Interior Detection step  uses the Boundary Map and builds an Interior Map. This procedure starts with an all-zero Interior Map and for each region performs the following operation for each block in its bounding-box.\n\n","Boundary Closure (step )","It is possible that the Boundary Map does not enclose the Interior Map. As a result, and according to the nature of the Object Extraction stage, described next, unwanted \u201cdents\u201d may appear in the extracted object. In order to resolve this issue, the Boundary Closure step  closes the Boundary Map for each region by performing the following operation within the bounding-box of each region,\n\n","Object Extraction (step )","The Object Extraction step  extracts the objects based on the Boundary Map and the Interior Map. This procedure performs the following operations for each object, within its own bounding-box.\n\n","Duplet Creation (, step )","Duplet Creation is the last step in the present invention where the actual images are used. After this stage, the work is done on Duplet Matrixes and other feature points and vectors.","Duplet Creation contains three sub-blocks of Contour-Tracing, Singlet Detection, and Duplet Creation, each described below.","Contour-Tracing","Contour-Tracing is the procedure that traces all the contours returned by the Object Extraction stage. The information collected at this stage is used in the Singlet Detection procedure. Any known contour-tracing algorithm can be used in the present invention, which is not limited to a particular algorithm. Examples of contour-tracing algorithms that may be utilized include Square Tracing, Moore-Neighbor, Radial Sweep. In a preferred embodiment Theo Pavlidis' algorithm is used.","Singlet Detection","This stage depends on the two parameters TRACE_WINDOW and SINGLET_DISTANCE, which can be selected for a particular environment. The default value for both of these parameters is 12 pixels. For all the contours which are longer than two times TRACE_WINDOW, the following procedure is carried out for each point on the contour:\n\n","Duplet Creation","Duplet Creation is the procedure that combines the detected singlets into duplets. The process of creating the duplets contains the following steps:\n\n","Duplet Comparison (, step )","Duplet Comparison is the process of comparing the items in two Duplet Matrixes and producing a list of matches, and therefore a first list of candidate poses. Assuming that the two Duplet Matrixes are D1 and D2, the process is performed as follows:\n\n","Candidate Clustering (, step )","Candidate Clustering is the process taking in the pose candidates produced through Duplet Comparison and estimating a limited number of poses which are each represented by a large set of the candidates. This procedure contains two stages, Scale-Angle Clustering, and X-Y Clustering, both described below.","Scale-Angle Clustering","The aim of this stage is to produce a list of candidate (scale,angle) pairs based on the candidate poses produces through Duplet Comparison.","Assume that S and A are two 1\u00d7N carrying the candidate scale and angles. The Scale-Angle Clustering procedure is done as follows,\n\n","X-Y Clustering","The output of the Scale-Angle Clustering stage is a set of (scale,angle) candidates. The X-Y Clustering stage is the process of adding translation information to the candidates, as follows for each (scale,angle) candidate.\n\n","Overlap Consideration","Overlap Consideration is only functional if OVERLAP is non-negative. The Overlap Consideration is done as follows,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0021","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0021-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0022","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.

Find the smallest rectangle that covers both the modified bounding-box of the reference and the bounding-box of the query. Call the area of this rectangle A.","3. Mark this candidate as inappropriate if min(A1,A2)\/A is below OVERLAP. Here, A1 and A2 are the area of the modified bounding-box of the reference and the area of the query.","4. Eliminate candidates marked as inappropriate from the list."]}}}},"Contour-Duplets Database (, )","A Contour-Duplets Database (CDDB) file contains a list of Duplet Matrixes, each accompanying an elevation and azimuth. For generating a CDDB file the algorithm described above will perform Duplet Creation on the training images (, ) and will then store the resulting Duplet Matrixes in the CDDB  each accompanied with the elevation-azimuth representation. These samples are called the views.","CDDB files in practice are accompanied with a file that contains details about the training images. These details are necessary for producing different visualizations and are not needed for the regular operation of the algorithm.","When a query is run, the procedure is repeated for each view in the database. The final output of the algorithm is the CDDBC.SEARCH.CANDIDATES.TOTAL number of candidates with the highest corresponding confidence values. The angular representation of the views that have produced each candidate are then appended to each candidate, thus producing the (elevation, azimuth, angle, scale, dx, dy, confidence) representation of the pose. The results of the object detection steps outlined above are these representations of the pose, which are pose estimates, and are stored in memory, e.g. RAM  or hard disk . These pose estimates can then be used in robot recognition of the object\/part in the assembly of a product.","Output Visualizations (, )","Different visualizations can be produced. Two of these visualizations are the Model View and the Overlay. Model View is the image of the matching training image modified to reflect scale, angle, and translation as well. Overlay is the overlay of the Model View on the query image.","Object Model Specifications","Currently, the training procedure requires images showing the object of interest in different poses, as governed by different parameters. A practical and more convenient method for producing these images is through the sample simulator , which is a three-dimensional visualization tool that produces the 3D views of the objects.","Configuration Utility (, )","As described above, different parts of the method of the present invention use different configuration parameters. Some exemplary (default) values of these parameters have been given in the forgoing description. However, these values can be set by a user to fit a particular environment. The Configuration Utility is an interactive tool thatfinds the proper values for these parameters and sets them accordingly using minimum intuitive input from the user.","The following sections describe the aspect of the present invention that refines the pose estimate of the object especially where the image of the object is a camera image.","The pose refinement of the present invention is modeled as an alignment problem. We start with a 3D model of the object of interest, i.e. the part that the robot has to identify and pick up, and camera parameters of the camera  that is used to image the object. The goal is to find the 3D (Euclidean, 6 degrees of freedom) transformation that is to be applied to the model so that it coincides with the object of interest in the image. As a result, the pose refinement is implemented as iterative optimization problem of a cost function. Apart from the object foreground covering cost, the cost function may involve an image matching cost that aligns or matches local feature points or boundaries feature points.","In order to better understand the algorithm, the camera project model, OpenGL virtual camera model and image Jacobian matrix will be derived before the definition of cost function and relaxation solution.","Camera Projection Model","The camera projective model of the present invention is based on a pinhole camera model. The pinhole camera is the simplest, and the ideal, model of camera function. It has an infinitesimally small hole through which light enters before forming an inverted image on the camera surface facing the hole. As shown in , the perspective projection is the projection of a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional image plane. In reality, one must use a lens to focus an image onto the camera's focal plane. The focal plane is one particular plane that is parallel to the image plane.
