For example, the application processor in a cellular phone may be obtained from a first manufacturer, while the display for the cellular phone may be obtained from a second manufacturer. Moreover, multiple standards are defined for interconnecting certain components of the mobile devices. For example, there are multiple types of interface defined for communications between an application processor and display and camera components of a mobile device. Some components employ an interface that conforms to one or more standards specified by the Mobile Industry Processor Interface (MIPI) Alliance. For example, the MIPI Alliance defines protocols for a camera serial interface (CSI) and a display serial interface (DSI).","MIPI CSI-2 and MIPI DSI or DSI-2 standards define a wired interface between a camera and application processor, or an application processor and display. The low-level physical-layer (PHY) interface in each of these applications can be MIPI C-PHY or MIPI D-PHY. Optical media can be used to extend the range of the MIPI C-PHY or D-PHY physical layers. However, some interfaces require that bidirectional and\/or low-power modes of operation be implemented, neither of which requirements can be met by a conventional optical interface, which is unidirectional by nature.","Accordingly an improved range-extending interface is needed.","Embodiments disclosed herein provide systems, methods and apparatus that enable an application processor to communicate with a display using any of a plurality of interface standards bidirectionally, and in a low-power mode.

However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.","Several aspects of data communication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, modules, components, circuits, steps, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as \u201celements\u201d).

One or more channels  may be bidirectional, and may operate in half-duplex and\/or full-duplex modes. One or more channels  and  may be unidirectional. The communication link  may be asymmetrical, providing higher bandwidth in one direction. In one example described herein, a first communications channel  may be referred to as a forward channel  while a second communications channel  may be referred to as a reverse channel . The first IC device  may be designated as a host system or transmitter, while the second IC device  may be designated as a client system or receiver, even if both IC devices  and  are configured to transmit and receive on the communications channel . In one example, the forward channel  may operate at a higher data rate when communicating data from a first IC device  to a second IC device , while the reverse channel  may operate at a lower data rate when communicating data from the second IC device  to the first IC device .","The IC devices  and  may each have a processor or other processing and\/or computing circuit or device , . In one example, the first IC device  may perform core functions of the apparatus , including maintaining wireless communications through a wireless transceiver  and an antenna , while the second IC device  may support a user interface that manages or operates a display controller . In the example, the second IC device  may be adapted to control operations of a camera or video input device using a camera controller . Other features supported by one or more of the IC devices  and  may include a keyboard, a voice-recognition component, and other input or output devices.

Communication between each processor ,  and its corresponding storage media  and  and other modules and circuits may be facilitated by one or more bus  and , respectively.","The reverse channel  may be operated in the same manner as the forward channel , and the forward link  and reverse channel  may be capable of transmitting at comparable speeds or at different speeds, where speed may be expressed as data transfer rate and\/or clocking rates. The forward and reverse data rates may be substantially the same or differ by orders of magnitude, depending on the application. In some applications, a single bidirectional channel  may support communications between the first IC device  and the second IC device . The forward channel  and\/or reverse channel  may be configurable to operate in a bidirectional mode when, for example, the forward and reverse channels  and  share the same physical connections and operate in a half-duplex manner.

The drivers ,  may include encoding devices that can be configured to encode multiple bits per clock transition, and multiple sets of wires can be used to transmit and receive data from the SDRAM, control signals, address signals, and other signals.","The forward and reverse channels  and  may comply with, or be compatible with application-specific industry standards. In one example, the MIPI standard defines physical layer interfaces between an application processor IC device  and an IC device  that supports the camera or display in a mobile device. The MIPI standard includes specifications that govern the operational characteristics of products that comply with MIPI specifications for mobile devices. In some instances, the MIPI standard may define interfaces that employ complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) parallel busses.","The MIPI Alliance defines standards and specifications that may address communications affecting all aspects of operations in a mobile device, including the antenna, peripherals, the modem and application processors. For example, the MIPI Alliance defines protocols for a camera serial interface (CSI) and a display serial interface (DSI). The MIPI CSI-2 defines a wired interface between a camera and Application Processor and the MIPI DSI or DSI-2 defines a wired interface between an Application Processor and a display. The low-level physical layer (PHY) interface in each of these applications can be MIPI C-PHY or MIPI D-PHY.","MIPI C-PHY Interface","According to certain aspects disclosed herein, systems and apparatus may employ multi-phase data encoding and decoding interface methods for communicating between IC devices  and . A multi-phase encoder may drive a plurality of conductors (i.e., M conductors). The M conductors typically include three or more conductors, and each conductor may be referred to as a wire, although the M conductors may include conductive traces on a circuit board or within a conductive layer of a semiconductor IC device. In one example, the MIPI Alliance-defined \u201cC-PHY\u201d physical layer interface technology may be used to connect camera and display devices  to an application processor device . The C-PHY interface employs three-phase symbol encoding to transmit data symbols on 3-wire lanes, or \u201ctrios\u201d where each trio includes an embedded clock.","The M conductors may be divided into a plurality of transmission groups, each group encoding a portion of a block of data to be transmitted. An N-phase encoding scheme is defined in which bits of data are encoded in phase transitions and polarity changes on the M conductors. Decoding does not rely on independent conductors or pairs of conductors and timing information can be derived directly from phase and\/or polarity transitions in the M conductors. N-Phase polarity data transfer can be applied to any physical signaling interface, including electrical, optical and radio frequency (RF) interfaces.","In the C-PHY example, a three-phase encoding scheme for a three-wire system may define three phase states and two polarities, providing 6 states and 5 possible transitions from each state. Deterministic voltage and\/or current changes may be detected and decoded to extract data from the three wires.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["220","220","222","224","226","210","240","220","220","210","240","220"]},"In the depicted C-PHY example , an M-wire, N-phase polarity encoding transmitter is configured for M=3 and N=3. The example of three-wire, three-phase encoding is selected solely for the purpose of simplifying descriptions of certain aspects of this disclosure. The principles and techniques disclosed for three-wire, three-phase encoders can be applied in other configurations of M-wire, N-phase polarity encoders, and may comply or be compatible with other interface standards.","When three-phase polarity encoding is used, connectors such as signal wires , and on a 3-wire bus may be undriven, driven positive, or driven negative. An undriven signal wire , or may be in a high-impedance state. An undriven signal wire , or may be driven or pulled to a voltage level that lies substantially halfway between the positive and negative voltage levels provided on driven signal wires. An undriven signal wire , or may have no current flowing through it. In the example , each signal wire , and may be in one of three states (denoted as +1, \u22121, or 0) using drivers . In one example, drivers  may include unit-level current-mode drivers. In another example, drivers  may drive opposite polarity voltages on two signals transmitted on the signal wires and while the third signal wire is at high impedance and\/or pulled to ground. For each transmitted symbol interval, at least one signal is in the undriven (0) state, while the number of signals driven positive (+1 state) is equal to the number of signals driven negative (\u22121 state), such that the sum of current flowing to the receiver is always zero. For each symbol, the state of at least one signal wire , or is changed from the symbol transmitted in the preceding transmission interval.","In the example, , a mapper  may receive 16 bit data , and the mapper  may map the input data  to 7 symbols  for transmitting sequentially over the signal wires , and . An M-wire, N-phase encoder  configured for three-wire, three-phase encoding receives the 7 symbols  produced by the mapper one symbol  at a time and computes the state of each signal wire , and for each symbol interval, based on the immediately preceding state of the signal wires , and . The 7 symbols  may be serialized using parallel-to-serial converters , for example. The encoder  selects the states of the signal wires , and based on the input symbol  and the previous states of signal wires , and ","The use of M-wire, N-phase encoding permits a number of bits to be encoded in a plurality of symbols where the bits per symbol is not an integer. In the simple example of a three-wire, three-phase system, there are 3 available combinations of 2 wires, which may be driven simultaneously, and 2 possible combinations of polarity on any pair of wires that is driven simultaneously, yielding 6 possible states. Since each transition occurs from a current state, 5 of the 6 states are available at every transition. The state of at least one wire is typically required to change at each transition. With 5 states, log(5)\u22452.32 bits may be encoded per symbol. Accordingly, a mapper may accept a 16-bit word and convert it to 7 symbols because 7 symbols carrying 2.32 bits per symbol can encode 16.24 bits. In other words, a combination of seven symbols that encodes five states has 5(78,125) permutations. Accordingly, the 7 symbols may be used to encode the 2(65,536) permutations of 16 bits.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","450","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","310","408"],"i":["a","b ","c","a","b","c","a","b","c ","a","b","c ","a","b ","c "]},"At any phase state in the illustrated three-wire example, exactly two of the signal wires , , carry a signal which is effectively a differential signal for that phase state, while the third signal wire , or is undriven. The phase state for each signal wire , , may be determined by voltage difference between the signal wire , or and at least one other signal wire , and\/or , or by the direction of current flow, or lack of current flow, in the signal wire , or . As shown in the state transition diagram , three phase states (S, Sand S) are defined. A signal may flow clockwise from phase state Sto phase state S, phase state Sto phase state S, and\/or phase state Sto phase state Sand the signal may flow counter-clockwise from phase state Sto phase state S, phase state Sto phase state S, and\/or phase state Sto phase state S. For other values of N, transitions between the N states may optionally be defined according to a corresponding state diagram to obtain circular rotation between state transitions.","In the example of a three-wire, three-phase communications link, clockwise rotations (Sto S), (Sto S), and\/or (Sto S) at a state transition  may be used to encode a logic 1, while counter-clockwise rotations (Sto S), (Sto S), and\/or (Sto S) at the state transition  may be used to encode a logic 0. Accordingly a bit may be encoded at each transition by controlling whether the signal is \u201crotating\u201d clockwise or counter-clockwise. For example, a logic 1 may be encoded when the three signal wires , , transition from phase state Sto phase state Sand a logic 0 may be encoded when the three signal wires , , transition from phase state Sto phase state S. In the simple three-wire example depicted, direction of rotation may be easily determined based on which of the three signal wires , , is undriven before and after the transition.","Information may also be encoded in the polarity and\/or changes of polarity of state  of the driven conductors , , , or in the direction of current flow or changes in the direction of current flow between two signal wires , , . Signals , , and  illustrate voltage levels applied to signal wires , , , respectively at each phase state in a three-wire, three-phase link. At any time, a first signal wire , , is coupled to a more positive voltage (+V, for example), a second signal wire , , is coupled to a more negative voltage (\u2212V, for example), while the third signal wire , , may be open-circuited. As such, one polarity encoding state may be determined by the current flow between the first and second signal wires , , or the voltage polarities of the first and second signal wires , , . In some embodiments, two bits of data  may be encoded in each state transition . A decoder may determine the direction of signal phase rotation to obtain the first bit. The second bit may be determined based on the polarity difference between two of the signals ,  and . In some instances, the second bit may be determined based on a change or lack of change in polarity of the differential signal transmitted on a pair of the signal wires , , . The decoder having determined direction of rotation can determine the phase state and the polarity of the voltage applied between the two active signal wires , and\/or , or the direction of current flow through the two active signal wires , and\/or ","In the example of the three-wire, three-phase link described herein, one bit of data may be encoded in the rotation, or phase change in the three-wire, three-phase link, and an additional bit may be encoded in the polarity or changes in polarity of two driven wires. Certain embodiments, encode more than two bits in each transition of a three-wire, three-phase encoding system by allowing transition to any of the possible states from a current state. Given three rotational phases and two polarities for each phase, 6 states are defined, such that 5 states are available from any current state. Accordingly, there may be log(5)\u22452.32 bits per symbol (transition) and the mapper may accept a 16-bit word and convert it to 7 symbols.","In one example, an encoder may transmit symbols using 6 wires with two pairs of wires driven for each state.
