title: Nonvolatile semiconductor memory using an adjustable threshold voltage transistor in a flip-flop
abstract: An object of this invention is to provide a rewritable nonvolatile memory cell that can have a wide reading margin, and can control both a word line and a bit line by changing the level of Vcc. As a solution, a flip-flop is formed by cross (loop) connect of inverters including memory transistors that can control a threshold voltage by charge injection into the side spacer of the transistors. In the case of writing data to one memory transistor, a high voltage is supplied to a source of the memory transistor through a source line and a high voltage is supplied to a gate of the memory transistor through a load transistor of the other side inverter. In the case of erasing the written data, a high voltage is supplied to the source of the memory transistor through the source line.

To finish the precharge, voltage of PRET, PREB is raised back to Vcc at the time t, and then, the source voltage SL starts to reduce gradually to 0V at the time t. At this time, MCN turns on state instead of MCN, in the case that the data of the memory cell is \u201c1\u201d, in another words, the threshold voltage of MCN is lower than that of MCN; thus, nodeT is reduced to 0V and nodeB becomes Vcc, which means that the flip-flop data is fixed at \u201c1\u201d. On the other hand, in the case that the data of the memory cell is \u201c0\u201d, MCN turns on state instead of MCN, thus, nodeB is reduced to 0V and nodeT becomes Vcc, which means that the flip-flop data is fixed at \u201c0\u201d.

Here, Vthn is threshold voltage of MP and MP. NodeT and nodeB are set floating state by reducing the voltage of the word line WL from Vcc to 0V at the time to; then, the flip-flop data is fixed by the discharge differential from MCN and MCN. In the case of data \u201c1\u201d, the voltage of nodeT becomes lower than that of nodeB because the resistance value of MCN of lower threshold voltage is lower than that of MCN; thus, the data of the nonvolatile memory cell is fixed at \u201c1\u201d after raising voltage of VPS from 0V to Vcc at the time t.

NodeT and nodeB are precharged to Vcc\u2212Vthn through a transfer gate MN or MN by the bit line BLT or BLB that is charged up to Vcc, due to fixing PRET and PREB at Vcc as well as setting a word line WL, the bit lines BLT and BLB at Vcc and setting VPST and VPSB at 0V to cut off MP through Mp. Here, Vthn is threshold voltage of MP and MP. NodeT and nodeB are set floating state by reducing the voltage of the word line WL from Vcc to 0V at the time t; then, the flip-flop data is fixed by the discharge differential from MCN and MCN. In the case of data \u201c1\u201d, the voltage of nodeT becomes lower than that of nodeB because the resistance value of MCN of lower threshold voltage is lower than that of MCN; thus, the data of the nonvolatile memory cell is fixed at \u201c1\u201d after raising voltage of VPST and VPSB from 0V to Vcc at the time t. On the other hand, in the case of data \u201c0\u201d, the voltage of nodeB becomes lower than that of nodeT because the resistance value of MCN of lower threshold voltage is lower than that of MCN; thus, the data of the nonvolatile memory cell is fixed at \u201c0\u201d after raising the voltage of VPST and VPSB from 0V to Vcc at the time t. Then VPS is raised to Vcc at the time t.","In addition, as described in the second embodiment with reference to  and , the nonvolatile memory device of the fourth embodiment permits a different length or a different width of channel of the memory transistors MCN, MCN, and the load transistor MP, MP. the nonvolatile memory device of the fourth embodiment also permits asymmetric circuit configuration of the flip-flop by connecting a capacitor to one of inverters.","Additionally, when the nonvolatile memory cell with the VPS separating type 12-transistor configuration is used, the configuration of voltage shown in  makes it possible to measure the threshold voltage of the memory transistor. This method enables to measure at least one of the values including the incipient threshold voltage fluctuation, a variation of the threshold voltage in the time of programming operation or erase operation, and a retention characteristic of the threshold voltage under high temperature after rewriting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0303","num":"0302"},"figref":"FIG. 68","b":["1","1","1","1","4"]},"The load transistor MP becomes power-on and supplies nodeT with a MAP voltage in the case that VPSB voltage is not less than Vthp because the gate voltage PRET is set at 0V. Also, the load transistor MP becomes power-on and is able to supply nodeB with a MAP voltage in the case that VPSB voltage is not less than Vthp because the gate voltage PREB is set at 0V. The Vthp is the threshold voltage of the p-type MOS transistor shown as MP\u02dcMP, and a threshold voltage of the transistor produced by a conventional CMOS process is about 0.7V. Accordingly, the threshold voltage (required gate voltage for a certain current flow) of MCN can be measured. During the measurement of the threshold voltage of MCN, BL can stay at 0V because transistors MN, MP, MN and MP are not set conduction state and both a pass from nodeT to SL and a pass from nodeB to SL are cut off.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0305","num":"0304"},"figref":"FIG. 68","b":["1","2"]},"In addition, it is not necessary to divide the precharge line into two lines PRET, PREB to measure the threshold voltage.","A nonvolatile memory device and a semiconductor integrated circuit device therewith of the fifth embodiment will now be described with referent to  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0308","num":"0307"},"figref":"FIG. 69"},"The memory cell has a static latch type flip-flop formed by connecting an inverter (true-side-inverter) formed by series connection of a p-type MOS transistor MP and an n-type MOS transistor MCN and an inverter (bar-side-inverter) formed by series connection of a p-type MOS transistor MP and an n-type MOS transistor MCN. The p-type MOS transistors MP and MP are referred to as load transistors, and n-type MOS transistors MCN and MCN are referred to as memory transistors. The memory transistors MCN and MCN can be injected and erased electrons in a side wall of a gate.

This procedure is preformed under the condition of setting a word line WL, bit lines BLT, BLB, and RESN at 0V and setting RESP, VPS, and VPM at Vcc. To begin with, the memory transistors MCN and MCN are made to turn off state by raising a source voltage SL from 0V to Vcc at the time t. Then, reducing precharge control signals PRET and PREB from Vcc to 0V at the time t leads to power on of the precharge transistors MP and MP. At the same time, Vcc is applied to nodeT and nodeB.","Voltage of PRET, PREB reverts back to Vcc at the time t, and the source voltage SLT is started to reduce gradually to 0V at the time t. The source voltage of SLB is started to raise gradually to 0V at the time t. At this time, The voltages SLB and SLT are controlled so as to satisfy the formula SLB\u2212SLT=\u0394Vs (e.g. \u0394Vs=0.2V). Consequently, the voltage between the source and the drain of the memory transistor MCN is controlled to be \u0394V higher than that of the memory transistor MCN, thus the threshold voltage of MCN appears \u0394Vs higher than that of MCN.","At this time, the flip-flop data is fixed at \u201c1\u201d in the case that the data of the memory cell is \u201c1\u201d, because voltage of nodeT is reduced to 0V and voltage of nodeB becomes Vcc by MCN of lower threshold voltage turning on instead of MCN. On the other hand, in the case that the data of the memory cell is \u201c0\u201d, the flip-flop data is fixed at \u201c0\u201d because voltage of nodeB is reduced to 0V and voltage of nodeT becomes Vcc by MCN of lower threshold voltage turning on instead of MCN.","Moreover, in the case that the data of the memory cell is \u201cindetermination\u201d, i.e. both threshold voltages of MCN and MCN are Vth, the flip-flop data fixed at \u201c1\u201d; nodeT is reduced to 0V and nodeB becomes Vcc by MCN turning on instead of MCN, that is because the threshold voltage of MCN appears \u0394Vs lower than that of MCN.","The voltage to take into account incipient fluctuation of threshold voltage of the transistor is appropriate for the \u0394V; for example 0.2V. It is because most of memory cells that both threshold voltages of MCN and MCN are Vth have not written data yet and memory transistor MCN, MCN are not deteriorated by writing data.","The voltage applying procedure shown in  is for applying voltage to fix the initial data of the memory cell at \u201c1\u201d.
