No. 7,664,463 by the current inventor titled Portable Loss Prevention System describes a BLUETOOTH loss prevention system. The described system does not provide automatic login and single logon functionality.","U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/177,495 by Ketari et al. describes a Proximity Access and Alarm Apparatus that uses a proximity device. Ketari does not describe intelligent login. Similarly, patent applications by Ketari Ser. No. 12\/203,049, Ser. No. 12\/17,752, Ser. No. 12\/198,218 and Ser. No. 12\/488,611 describe Bluetooth access and proximity alarm devices with no intelligent login function.","Portable electronic devices such as cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), wireless email devices, instant messaging devices, pagers, portable compact disk (CD) players, portable MP3 players, and others are often forgotten, lost, or stolen (a \u201cPED\u201d includes any portable device that can be used for communication, performing intellectual and\/or physical work, and\/or entertainment). Existing wireless device loss detection approaches focus primarily on remotely accessing a device after it is lost. This allows prohibiting the device, such as a cell phone, from placing phone calls. It also allows hiding the device owner's information or erasure of sensitive data. This strategy aims to increase the user's chances of recovering the device and to protect data stored in the device. This method does not allow users to quickly recover their lost devices.","Other methods for tracking and locating a lost cell phone include network triangulation and GPS interrogation. These methods do not allow users to automatically and\/or instantaneously recover their lost devices.","The most common model for PC application login generally relies on a set of user name and password that the user enters in a login screen. Once the user name and login are authenticated, the user gains access to the application.","This model has presents a few security problems. For example:","Multiple users can login with the same username\/password,","A person can steal a username and password combination without the account owner noticing. The person can login into the system undetected.","For mobile phone applications, the phone generally goes to sleep mode after one minute of user inaction, and later, the user has to login again. For frequent users of mobile applications, this process is inconvenient and wastes them a lot of time.","The current invention utilizes features of BLUETOOTH to provide secure automatic access to mobile payment, mobile banking and mobile CRM applications thus increasing usability, convenience and efficiency to users while maintaining higher security standards. This new technology also provides an alarm when the user mobile terminal is away from the device of the invention, thus preventing loss and theft of mobile terminals.","Another method and apparatus for reducing the likelihood of losing a portable electronic device is disclosed in U.S. Pat.

So, if the PED is already removed from its retaining device for use or the retaining device and PED are left behind together or move out of a desired range, this apparatus does not protect users from losing their PEDS.","US patent application publication 20050280546 by Ganley et al. titled Proximity aware personal alert system discloses two mobile transceivers that are linked through a BLUETOOTH link. The BLUETOOTH enabled RF link between the first and second mobile transceiver units forms a monitoring piconet. The second mobile transceiver unit provides an alarm indication when the first mobile transceiver unit moves beyond a distance of approximately ten meters from the second mobile transceiver unit. The second device repeatedly pages the first device, and waits for a response. If a response is not received, an alarm is issued. This system does not use sleep modes effectively. It uses paging which consumes 40 mA, a rate that would inconvenience the user by requiring an expensive and\/or heavy battery or frequent recharging. The system of the current invention relies on HFP or SPP link, and alerts on link drop.","Ganley teaches a two part system, whereas the current invention teaches a unitary system. Ganley does not teach a system for getting login parameters from a BLUETOOTH device and automatically logging the user to an application.","U.S. Pat.

The described system does not provide automatic locking and unlocking for vehicles based on BLUETOOTH proximity.","Thus, a need exists for systems for monitoring mobile phones and for providing automatic login functionality to applications, automatic screen unlocking functionality, and automatic user authentication for transaction processing. Such systems should provide an alarm to users upon detecting that a phone is not within a desired proximity, wherein the alarm is appropriate to the circumstances. Further, there is also a need for more automatic login to applications and services while reducing the risk of loss and unauthorized access, and to make such systems ubiquitous as standard accessories.","A unitary mobile apparatus with a volume smaller than 30 cm3, comprising: a memory wherein said memory is less than 10 Mega Bytes, a short wireless transceiver, wherein upon pairing to a predefined number of authorized devices or upon detection of a predetermined number of unsuccessful pairing attempts, or upon passing of a predetermined period of time since last update, said unitary mobile apparatus goes to a non-discoverable mode, wherein upon updating said unitary mobile apparatus using a computer and a data cable, said unitary mobile apparatus can go to a discoverable mode, wherein on receipt of a connection request from a paired second apparatus said unitary mobile apparatus establishes a secure two-way wireless connection with the paired second apparatus, wherein said unitary mobile apparatus can store a first code selected from the group consisting of: one or more digital keys, one or more encrypted digital keys, user information, wherein said unitary mobile apparatus can store at least a first function with a first identity, wherein on receipt of a transformation directive message from the paired second apparatus, wherein when said transformation directive identifies a first function stored on said mobile apparatus, the first function is applied to the first code to encode the first code, wherein said unitary mobile apparatus automatically transmits the encoded first code to said second apparatus wirelessly.","A method comprising: pairing with a remote unitary mobile apparatus having a short wireless transceiver, a memory less than 10 Mega Bytes and a volume less than 30 cm3, upon receiving a user request for access, if a connection drop was detected after the last time the user entered a user code, or if the time period elapsed since the last time the user entered a user code exceeds a predetermined period of time, requesting a user code from the user, validating said user code, sending a message comprising a transformation directive to said remote unitary mobile apparatus, wherein said transformation directive message identifies at least one first function stored onboard said remote unitary mobile apparatus, wherein said at least one first function is applied to at least one first code to encode the at least one first code, wherein upon receipt of a reply from said remote unitary mobile apparatus, applying at least one first reverse function to extract said at least one first code from said reply.","A method for automatic authorization comprising: pairing with a remote unitary mobile apparatus having a short wireless transceiver and a volume less than 30 cm3, upon receiving a user request for access, if a connection drop was not detected after the last time the user entered a user code, and if the time period elapsed since the last time the user entered a user code did not exceed a predetermined period of time, obtaining a second code from said paired remote unitary mobile apparatus, on validation of said second code, automatically authorizing the user access.","The most common model for PC application login generally relies on a set of user name and password that the user enters in a login screen.

This new technology also provides an alarm when the user mobile terminal is away from the device of the invention, thus preventing loss and theft of mobile terminals.","The following provides further details of the present inventions summarized above and illustrated in a schematic fashion in the Figures. In accordance with a first aspect of the present inventions,  is a schematic illustration of a system for intelligent authentication  comprising a short wireless transceiver  for short-range communication operatively connected with at least one Button or switch , a visual indication center (or display) , a battery (or power supply) , an communication\/alarm center  and an antenna . Display  can be used to indicate the status of the device, such as whether it is powered, if the BLUETOOTH transceiver system (BT) is discoverable or non-discoverable, if the BT is pairing or paired with another BT, the BT mode, inter alia.","In a preferred embodiment, the components of the system for intelligent authentication  can fit in a volume less about 30 CM3 (centimeter cube).","In another embodiment, the system for intelligent authentication  can fit into a housing having an interior with dimensions of 60\u00d730\u00d710 mm or no more than 18 CM3.","In another embodiment, system for intelligent authentication  can fit into a volume 10 CM3, and weigh about 50 grams or less, and preferably less than about 10 g. Devices of the present invention should take up minimal volume and be light weight. For example, each device of the present inventions will preferably fit into a space having a volume of 56 cubic centimeters, 25 cubic centimeters, 22.5 cubic centimeters, 18 cubic centimeters, 10 cubic centimeters, or 1 cubic centimeters, and each device of the present inventions preferably has a weight less than about 200 grams, less than about 50 grams, or less than about 10 grams.","An attachment mechanism or system, including but not limited to a hook, harness, notebook security lock, insert, pin, clip, badge, clip, key chain, ring, tee, dog collar, Velcro, ring, fastening mechanism, sticky surface are optionally attached to the system for intelligent authentication .","Control or activation switches  can be any type of button, switch, remote sensor, touch sensor, contact sensor or activation system. Activation switches  are used to turn the system for intelligent authentication  ON\/OFF, to shut off the alarm, to change the BLUETOOTH system mode to pairing mode, and\/or to start voice transmission for embodiments that have a microphone and\/or speaker. For example, a single control button can cycle through a menu of functions by changing the length of time that the button is held and\/or the speed with which a first press is followed by a second press (analogous to the single and double click on a computer mouse). One or two control buttons coupled with a simple display screen can adjust a variety of operational parameters.","BLUETOOTH system  enables connectivity over the 2.4 GHz radio frequency (RF) band. BLUETOOTH system  includes a radio and base band IC for BLUETOOTH 2.4 GHz systems. In a preferred embodiment, BLUETOOTH system  includes ROM, Flash memory or external memory or any other type of memory.","In a preferred embodiment, memory is less than 10 Mega Bytes.","In another preferred embodiment, memory is less than 1 Mega Byte.","In an alternative embodiment, BLUETOOTH system  includes a power amplifier (PA) and\/or low noise amplifier (LNA) for increasing the BLUETOOTH transmission range. BLUETOOTH system  is an integrated","BLUETOOTH system  comprises a BLUETOOTH chip with on-chip microcontroller (such as the one supplied by CSR), Flash memory and antenna.","The BLUETOOTH specification (a de facto standard containing information required to ensure that devices supporting BLUETOOTH can communicate with each other worldwide) defines two transmission ranges for personal area networking. The range is between 10 m and 100 m without a line of sight requirement. The radio link is capable of voice and data transmission up to a maximum capacity of 720 kbps per channel. Any other range can be designed.","A BLUETOOTH network is completely self organising, and ad hoc personal area networks (PANs) can be established wherever two or more BLUETOOTH devices are sufficiently close to establish radio contact. Equipment capable of BLUETOOTH connectivity is able to self-organise by automatically searching within range for other BLUETOOTH-enabled devices. Upon establishing a contact, information is exchanged which determines if the connection should be completed or not. During this first encounter, the BLUETOOTH devices connect via a process of authorisation and authentication.","BLUETOOTH Pairing happens when two BLUETOOTH enabled devices agree to communicate with one another. When this happens, the two devices join what is can be referred to as a trusted pair. When one device recognizes another device in an established trusted pair, each device automatically accepts communication, bypassing the discovery and authentication process that normally happen during BLUETOOTH interactions.","When BLUETOOTH pairing is being set up, the following usually happens:","1. Device A (such as a handheld) searches for other BLUETOOTH enabled devices in the area.","How does A find these devices? The devices that are found all have a setting that makes them discoverable when other BLUETOOTH devices search. It's like raising your hand in a classroom: the discoverable devices are announcing their willingness to communicate with other BLUETOOTH devices. By contrast, many BLUETOOTH devices can toggle their discoverability settings off. When discoverability is off, the device will not appear when other devices search for it. Undiscoverable devices can still communicate with other BLUETOOTH devices, but they must initiate all the communications themselves.\n\n2. Device A detects Device B (e.g. a second handheld that's discoverable). During the discovery process, the discoverable devices usually broadcast what they are (such as a printer, a PC, a mobile phone, a handheld, etc.), and their BLUETOOTH Device Name (such as \u201cBob's Laptop\u201d or \u201cdeskjet995c\u201d). Depending on the device, you may be able to change the Device Name to something more specific. If there are 10 BLUETOOTH laptops and 5 BLUETOOTH mobile phones in range, and they are all discoverable, this can come in handy when selecting a specific device.\n\n3. A asks B to send a Passkey or PIN\n\nA passkey (or PIN) is a simple code shared by both devices to prove that both users agree to be part of the trusted pair. With devices that have a user interface, such as handhelds, mobile phones, and PCs, a participant must enter the passkey on the device. With other types of devices, such as printers and hands-free headsets, there is no interface for changing the passkey on the device, so the passkey is always the same (hard coded). A passkey used on most BLUETOOTH headsets is \u201c0000\u201d. The passkeys from both parties must match.\n\n4. A sends the passkey to B\n\nOnce you've entered the passkey on A, it sends that passkey to B for comparison. If B is an advanced device that needs the user to enter the same passkey, it will ask for the passkey. If not, it will simply use its standard, unchanging passkey.\n\n5. B sends passkey back to A\n\nIf all goes well, and B's passkey is the same entered by A, a trusted pair is formed. This happens automatically when the passkeys agree. Once a trusted pair is developed, communication between the two devices should be relatively seamless, and shouldn't require the standard authentication process that occurs between two devices who are strangers. Embodiments of the present inventions take advantage of the reduced power requirements of certain BLUETOOTH modes following pairing of two BLUETOOTH enabled devices.\n","BLUETOOTH has several types:","i) Class 2: a class 2 BLUETOOTH transceiver can discover pair and communicate with any BLUETOOTH transceiver within a radius of 10 meters seamlessly.","ii) Class 1: A class 1 BLUETOOTH transceiver can discover pair and communicate with any BLUETOOTH transceiver within a radius of 100 meters.","iii) Class 3: A class 3 BLUETOOTH transceiver can discover pair and communicate with any BLUETOOTH transceiver within a radius of 2 meters.","iv) Non standard devices: can be designed to discover pair and communicate with any BLUETOOTH transceiver within any distance less than 300 meters.","In any wireless networking setup, security is a concern. Devices can easily grab radio waves out of the air, so people who send sensitive information over a wireless connection need to take precautions to make sure those signals aren't intercepted. BLUETOOTH technology is no different\u2014it's wireless and therefore susceptible to spying and remote access, just like WiFi is susceptible if the network isn't secure. With BLUETOOTH, though, the automatic nature of the connection, which is a huge benefit in terms of time and effort, is also a benefit to people looking to send you data without your permission.","BLUETOOTH offers several security modes, and device manufacturers determine which mode to include in a BLUETOOTH-enabled gadget. In almost all cases, BLUETOOTH users can establish \u201ctrusted devices\u201d that can exchange data without asking permission. When any other device tries to establish a connection to the user's gadget, the user has to decide to allow it. Service-level security and device-level security work together to protect BLUETOOTH devices from unauthorized data transmission. Security methods include authorization and identification procedures that limit the use of BLUETOOTH services to the registered user and require that users make a conscious decision to open a file or accept a data transfer. As long as these measures are enabled on the user's phone or other device, unauthorized access is unlikely. A user can also simply switch his BLUETOOTH mode to \u201cnon-discoverable\u201d and avoid connecting with other BLUETOOTH devices entirely. If a user makes use of the BLUETOOTH network primarily for synching devices at home, this might be a good way to avoid any chance of a security breach while in public.","In the current application, once system for intelligent authentication \/ is paired, it becomes \u201cnon-discoverable\u201d. Also, to further avoid any chance of a security breach, system for intelligent authentication \/ does not have a reset button or reset function.","If reset is needed, an administrator may flash a new program file to system for intelligent authentication \/ thus re-enabling the pairing capability. This feature is important as it prevents anybody from hacking the device or learning how it functions, or what protocols it uses.","Battery  provides power to some of the components of system for intelligent authentication . Battery  can be a fuel cell, nickel-cadmium, lithium, lithium polymer, lithium ion, alkaline or nickel-hydride battery or any other portable source of electric power. Battery  can also be replaced with photovoltaic cells, a rechargeable battery, or a battery rechargeable from a distance (such as by induction). When system for intelligent authentication  is not exchanging data or alarming, it remains in a dormant state (\u201csleep-mode\u201d) to conserve the energy of battery . On event selected from: receiving request for data, disconnect event detected, receiving request to establish voice channel, system for intelligent authentication \/ leaves the sleep mode and wakes up.","For example, small 1.5 volt batteries, and the like, such as those used in small devices like hearing aids, calculators and watches are widely available and can be used as for a power source. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine the battery size and power requirements for different embodiments of the present inventions. It is envisioned that other low power specifications can be used in connection with the present inventions. For example, an ultra-low-power wireless technology called Wibree has been developed. Wibree addresses devices with very low battery capacity and can be easily integrated with BLUETOOTH technology.","Visual indication center  is one or more LED. The LED can turn on and off periodically to indicate the system is on. The color and frequency of the LEDs can indicate different events such as normal mode, pairing mode, alarm mode, low battery mode, voice mode, etc.","In another embodiment, visual indication center  can be an LED, LCD or any other indication means, and alarm center  includes an alarm audible from a distance greater than 6 feet. A regular alarm is between 65 and 120 decibels at 10 feet. Noise levels above 85 decibels can harm hearing over time. Noise levels above 140 decibels can cause damage to hearing after just one exposure. In a preferred embodiment, alarm center  has more than 50 decibels or 50 dBA at 10 feet or exceeds ambient sound level by 5 decibels minimum. In a preferred embodiment, the alarm provides an audible signal of at least 60 decibels to notify the user of a designated event, such as user leaving proximity of mobile phone. The human ear does not respond equally to all frequencies: humans are much more sensitive to sounds in the frequency range about 1 kHz to 4 kHz (1000 to 4000 vibrations per second) than to very low or high frequency sounds. Sound meters are usually fitted with a filter that has a frequency response similar to the human ear. If the \u201cA weighting filter\u201d is used, the sound pressure level is given in units of dB(A) or dBA. In residential areas, most noise comes from transportation, construction, industrial, and human and animal sources. Road traffic noise is the leading source of community noise. The noise can be highly variable. It is common that Day-Night sound levels in different areas vary over a range of 50 dB. The outdoor level in a wilderness area may occur as low as 30 to 40 dBA, and as high as 85-90 dBA in an urban area. Most urban dwellers lives in areas of noise level more than 48 dBA.","It is noted that system for intelligent authentication \/ may include an onboard motion detector or tilt detector and may activate alarm if motion is detected using the onboard motion detector or tilt detector, and if motion is not detected, a short alert may be issued. The case where motion is not detected generally corresponds to the user staying at home, office or coffee shop . . . , and leaving system for intelligent authentication \/ on a table while the mobile phone leaves proximity. These cases do not require an alarm and are therefore associated with a short alert.","System for intelligent authentication \/ can provide intelligent alarm on loss of the mobile device that depends on the motion state. This is important as it enables to reduce the number of false alarms when the user is at home or in the office, and the BLUETOOTH device which generally is attached to keys is laying on the table. This enables the user to use the mobile phone, and leave proximity of the BLUETOOTH device without triggering an alarm. To be safe, a short alert can be issued.","Alarm center  can be any type of audio, video, tactile or mechanical user interface means capable of conveying information to the user. Audio means can be any audio device such as a speaker, a buzzer, a Piezo buzzer, omni-directional speaker, directional speaker, an ultrasound or any other audio device. Visual means can be an LED, or any visual information display device. Tactile means can be any tactile sensor such as a vibrator, or a heat-generating device.","Antenna  can be any type of antenna including chip antenna, patch antenna, PCB antenna and dipole antennas.","In an embodiment, system for intelligent authentication  can be inserted beneath the skin of a human or animal or included inside the housing of objects such as portable computers. In an embodiment, system for intelligent authentication  is contained within a capsule formed of an implant-grade material that has minimal risk for rejection by mammalian immune systems and the capsule inserted under the skin. It can also be carried as a keychain or attached to people, animals or objects through a hook, harness, notebook security lock, insert, pin, clip, badge, clip, key chain, ring, tee, dog collar, Velcro fastener, ring, fastening mechanism, sticky or adhesive surface or any other attachment mechanism. Many notebook computers have a security slot on the side, which can be utilized by inserting a notebook security lock; the lock can be attached to an external device, such as a cable or desktop securing mechanism.","System for intelligent authentication  can also be encased in waterproof packaging and attached to clothes. The packaging can also be shock or impact resistant. System for intelligent authentication  can be incorporated in any other plastic or portable electronic device or object, including for example a cell phone, PDA, a wireless email device, an instant messaging device or pager, a portable computer, an MP3 player, a portable music player, a portable radio device, or any portable electronic device. System for intelligent authentication  can also be sewn into clothes. Preferably, system for intelligent authentication  is as small as is practical so as to avoid distracting or annoying the person or animal carrying it. In an embodiment, the present invention includes clothing that has at least one pocket for holding the remote proximity sensor; the pocket has a closure that can be repeatedly opened and closed to operate the device and\/or to remove it for other uses and\/or users. Preferably, system for intelligent authentication  has dimensions of less than 10 cm\u00d710 cm\u00d75 cm (otherwise stated as \u201c10\u00d710\u00d710 cm\u201d) and is less than 200 g in weight. In an embodiment, there are no manually operated controls (e.g., off-on or activation button is magnetically operated, so the housing is not provided with button or switch access), and the device may not have a display. In an embodiment, the housing of the device includes at least one seal and\/or is waterproof so that immersion in water, or preferably even running the device through laundering machines, does not damage the electronic components. In a preferred embodiment, system for intelligent authentication  has a size equal to or smaller than 5 cm\u00d73 cm\u00d71.5 cm or 22.5 cubic centimeters (\u201ccc\u201d).

A preferred device has no than four manually operated buttons or switches, and preferably has only one manually operated button or activation switch and no more than one display","A user application running on a mobile device or a PC can be programmed to verify that the system for intelligent authentication \/ is within proximity, and if so, the user is logged in automatically without entering information in a login screen. The login parameters are transferred wirelessly when they are needed by the application and authenticated by either the application or a RADIUS server.","If the user does not have the device with him\/her, a login screen may be used to enter authentication parameters and gain access to the application.","This feature allows the client to gain more convenience and efficiency, especially in the case of an enterprise, banking, payment application, NFC (Near Field Communication) payment running on a mobile phone or PDA, where:","User login security is required","Device goes to sleep every 1 to 5 minutes of inactivity and user has to login again","In the PC\/laptop world, the user can be logged in for a long period of time even when the device is inactive. This is because energy is not scarce and loss and theft are not a big concern.","In the mobile device world, batteries are very limited in size, and device must go to sleep to conserve it. Furthermore, device loss and theft risk is much higher than a PC. Therefore, system must go to sleep frequently, and user must login after every period of sleep so that if the device falls in the wrong hands, the new user cannot access data. In the case of a person that uses an enterprise CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application that requires frequent data input, the login process is cumbersome.","In the case of a payment application, mobile banking, client-server application, web application where the user has to enter a login every time a transaction is made, the login process is also inconvenient and may turn off customers from using the application. In the case of NFC payment, device-assisted authentication is necessary because speed of transaction is important for merchants, and mobile phone security is important for the user. With system for intelligent authentication \/, we can make the system seamless, provide fast authentication, and secure the terminal, all at the same time.","On connection drop, the system for intelligent authentication \/ may attempt to reconnect and can issue an intelligent alarm. Furthermore, the application or device may logout the user, may lock, may report the event to a remote server, or issue an alarm.","System for intelligent authentication \/ may request user data such as username, password, digital key, public key, private key, encryption key, (the user data may be encrypted) and if the user data is received and authenticated, access is granted to the user.

Those parameters can be flashed on system for intelligent authentication \/ by connecting it to another programming device (e.g. programmer, vehicle computer). Those parameters can also be transferred wirelessly and stored.","System for intelligent authentication \/ automates the login process, increases usability and convenience, and makes access more secure. That is because device authenticated access does not suffer from short comes of password authenticated access. For example, username and password can easily be shared between multiple users as oppose to access devices. When a username\/password combination is stolen, the user may not notice it, however, when an access device is stolen, the user will notice it and take appropriate actions.","System for intelligent authentication \/ is a good alternative to the Solution to Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO). Users do not memorize any password. Users carry an access device, and that access device remembers all the rest (for example passwords to multiple applications), providing a truly automated login experience that is superior to Single Sign-On.","System for intelligent authentication \/ may store multiple login parameters corresponding to multiple client applications, and when client application requests login parameters, system for intelligent authentication \/ automatically determines login parameters corresponding to the client application and sends those parameters wirelessly.","Furthermore, system for intelligent authentication \/ can remove the risk of device loss and theft for enterprise users and frequent users, as the system will intelligently alarm if the associated mobile device is not within proximity or is left behind, i.e. without causing many false alarms.","It is noted that system for intelligent authentication \/ may sense motion using a motion detector, and therefore provide intelligent alarming based on motion state. For example, if the device has recently sensed motion, then an alarm is required on connection drop. If the device has not sensed motion for a while, it may be understood that the user is not carrying the device and therefore a soft alarm is required. For example, when the user is at home or office, and leaves the keychain on a counter, the user can move the mobile phone out of proximity of the system for intelligent authentication \/ without triggering a strong alarm.","In an alternative embodiment, the client application is accessed from a PC, a mobile device or a web browser running on a Personal Electronic Device (PED) may send a wireless message to system for intelligent authentication \/ and request user parameters.

Microphone  is any device capable of capturing voice.","Turning now to , the flowchart illustrates the steps involved in detecting that a portable electronic device (PED) is outside a desired range of a base device (a base device may be referred to as a master and the monitored remote devices referred to as slaves). The PED can be for example a mobile phone, a PDA, a wireless email device, an instant messaging device, a pager, a portable computer, an MP3 player, a portable music player, a portable radio, or any PED. In step , the user activates system for intelligent authentication \/ by pressing activation switch or button or switch .","Switch  has several modes. In a preferred mode, a long press of activation button or switch  on the base unit  indicates ON\/OFF event. A long press may be defined by either the length of time that Button or switch  is manually held in a second position against a bias that holds the switch in a first position when at rest, or a signal may be given to indicate that a desired mode of operation or desired action has been initiated. For example, a very long press can cause a switch to pairing mode. Button or switch  can be used to dial a number, or to perform actions such as accept\/reject a call, or play\/stop\/forward\/back.","In step , BLUETOOTH system  in a base unit establishes a BLUETOOTH connection with a monitored remote device. The wireless connection can be an HSP (headset profile) connection, a HFP (Hands-Free profile) connection, iAP (iPhone SPP). Other connection profiles may be possible. BLUETOOTH system  does not redirect voice calls from the mobile phone to itself as a headset would do, thus the mobile phone operations remain intact. BLUETOOTH system  uses a BLUETOOTH operational mode that uses minimal power, e.g., one of sniff, hold, or park modes. In a preferred embodiment, only BLUETOOTH sniff mode is used after pairing to assure low power usage and optimize convenience to the user by reducing the frequency of battery recharging or replacement.","In sniff mode, a device listens only periodically during specific sniff slots, but retains synchronization with the paired BLUETOOTH device onboard the monitored device. In other embodiments, BLUETOOTH system  can use hold mode wherein a device listens only to determine if it should become active, or park mode wherein a device transmits its address. Sniff mode assures very low power consumption and thus extends battery life. In sniff mode, a BLUETOOTH master radio frequency unit (e.g., base) addresses a slave radio frequency unit (e.g., remote), which enables the slave to synchronize to the master by sending poll packets and optionally null packets over an active link, the master being arranged so that receipt of a response from the slave unit to a poll packet is sufficient to maintain the active link. The slave unit does not have to respond to all poll packets. This approach can allow the slave to preserve more (transmit) power by going into a deep sleep mode in which a low power oscillator may be used while still allowing the master unit to detect whether the slave has resynchronized or not (and thus to update a Link Supervision Timer, for example).","BLUETOOTH Wireless Technology Profiles: In order to use BLUETOOTH wireless technology, a device must be able to interpret certain BLUETOOTH profiles. The profiles define the possible applications. BLUETOOTH profiles are general behaviors through which BLUETOOTH enabled devices communicate with other devices. BLUETOOTH technology defines a wide range of profiles that describe many different types of uses.","At a minimum, each profile specification contains information on (1) dependency on other profiles, (2) suggested user interface formats, and (3) specific parts of the BLUETOOTH protocol stack used by the profile. To perform its task, each profile uses particular options and parameters at each layer of the stack. This may include an outline of the required service record, if appropriate.","Hands-Free Profile (HFP). HFP describes how a gateway device can be used to place and receive calls for a hands-free device. A typical configuration is an automobile using a mobile phone for a gateway device. In the car, the stereo is used for the phone audio and a microphone is installed in the car for sending outgoing audio. HFP is also used for a personal computer to act as a speaker phone for a mobile phone in a home or office environment. HFP uses SCO to carry a mono, PCM audio channel.","Headset Profile (HSP). The HSP describes how a BLUETOOTH enabled headset should communicate with a computer or other BLUETOOTH enabled device such as a mobile phone. When connected and configured, the headset can act as the remote device's audio input and output interface. The HSP relies on SCO for audio and a subset of AT commands from GSM 07.07 for minimal controls including the ability to ring, answer a call, hang up and adjust the volume.","Serial Port Profile (SPP). SPP defines how to set-up virtual serial ports and connect two BLUETOOTH enabled devices. SPP is based on the ETSI TS07.10 specification and uses the RFCOMM protocol to provide serial-port emulation. SPP provides a wireless replacement for existing RS-232 based serial communications applications and control signals. SPP provides the basis for the DUN, FAX, HSP and LA\/V profiles. This profile supports a data rate up to 128 kbit\/sec. SPP is dependent on GAP. iAP is similar to SPP.","RFCOMM. The RFCOMM protocol emulates the serial cable line settings and status of an RS-232 serial port and is used for providing serial data transfer. RFCOMM connects to the lower layers of the BLUETOOTH protocol stack through the L2CAP layer. By providing serial-port emulation, RFCOMM supports legacy serial-port applications while also supporting the OBEX protocol among others. RFCOMM is a subset of the ETSI TS 07.10 standard, along with some BLUETOOTH-specific adaptations.","Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP). A2DP describes how stereo quality audio can be streamed from a media source to a sink. The profile defines two roles of an audio source and sink. A typical usage scenario can be considered as the \u201cwalkman\u201d class of media player. The audio source would be the music player and the audio sink is the wireless headset. A2DP defines the protocols and procedures that realize distribution of audio content of high-quality in mono or stereo on ACL channels. The term \u201cadvanced audio\u201d, therefore, should be distinguished from \u201cBLUETOOTH audio\u201d, which indicates distribution of narrow band voice on SCO channels as defined in the base band specification.","Audio\/Video Control Transport Protocol (AVCTP). AVCTP describes the transport mechanisms to exchange messages for controlling A\/V devices.","Audio\/Video Distribution Transport Protocol (AVDTP). AVDTP defines A\/V stream negotiation, establishment and transmission procedures.","Audio\/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP). AVRCP is designed to provide a standard interface to control TVs, hi-fi equipment, or other A\/C equipment to allow a single remote control (or other device) to control all the A\/V equipment that a user has access to. It may be used in concert with A2DP or VDP. AVRCP defines how to control characteristics of streaming media. This includes pausing, stopping and starting playback and volume control as well as other types of remote control operations. The AVRCP defines two roles, that of a controller and a target device. The controller is typically considered the remote control device while the target device is the one whose characteristics are being altered. In a \u201cwalkman\u201d type media player scenario, the control device may be a headset that allows tracks to be skipped and the target device would be the actual medial player.","iPhone has a proprietary protocol (similar to SPP) for communicating with BLUETOOTH devices. iPhone requires an Apple proprietary chipset on other BLUETOOTH devices in order to use the proprietary protocol. For that reason, in another preferred embodiment, the system for intelligent authentication \/ has an Apple proprietary chipset for enabling communication through BLUETOOTH or for enabling usage of iAP protocol.","In step , BLUETOOTH system  monitors the BLUETOOTH connection automatically. In this step, BLUETOOTH system  is in sniff mode, and power consumption is below 1 mA. A significant benefit of this system is the ability to monitor a connection while keeping power consumption to a very low level. This enables one of ordinary skill in the art to build portable devices in accordance with the present inventions that use small batteries (100-200 mAh), which can last for at least 2 or 3 weeks before being recharged or swapped. In step , on detection of connection drop, i.e., disconnection, BLUETOOTH system  attempts to reconnect in step . For example, when a connection is dropped while the system is in sleep mode or sniff mode, a BLUETOOTH system can automatically generate an event indicating connection drop. In the base and\/or remote devices of the present invention, upon the BLUETOOTH system indicating a connection drop either the base and\/or the remote will attempt to reconnect to one another or an alarm will be triggered in the base and\/or the remote, as illustrated by issuance of an alarm in step . For a mobile phone proximity detector, a connection drop is generally due to the distance between BLUETOOTH system  and the mobile phone being too large, an obstacle between the two devices, and\/or the mobile phone powered down. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand from the foregoing that the programming of the system for intelligent authentication can be adjusted to include instructions to reconnect and\/or to trigger an alarm in accordance with the present invention. Automatic reconnection minimizes false alarms and makes the systems of the present invention more reliable and easy to use. An exemplary benefit of the automatic reconnect feature is that when a user comes into proximity of the mobile phone from out of range, the alarm automatically shuts off without requiring any additional input from the user.","In an embodiment of the present inventions, the system for intelligent authentication will generate an indication or message on detection of a connection drop. For example, firmware running on a BLUETOOTH chipset, or on a virtual machine which in turn runs on a BLUETOOTH chipset, can receive or capture that disconnect indication or message. The present invention includes programming that instructs one or more responses to a disconnect indication. For example, the program will instruct a reconnection attempt and\/or instruct issuance of an alarm. One of ordinary skill in the art can use market available development tools to write programming to perform the desired functions. It has been discovered by the present inventor that the disconnect event indicator is reliable for detecting that a monitored device is outside a desired range. The claimed invention has an automatic reconnect attempt feature, so that upon detection of a disconnect event, reconnection is attempted; this can avoid many false alarms. Preferably, in an embodiment, an alarm instruction is not given until at least one active reconnect attempt is made and fails. Upon the alarm issuing, periodic reconnect efforts are made, and upon reconnection the alarm will not continue. Avoidance of false alarms makes the invention more convenient for the user.","Turning now to , the flowchart illustrates the steps involved in initializing the system for intelligent authentication . In step , the user pushes Button or switch  for a sufficiently long duration, or presses a button a predetermined number of times, to indicate that the user wants to \u201cpair\u201d the system for intelligent authentication  with a new device to be monitored (i.e., the user makes a \u201clong press\u201d). In step , the system for intelligent authentication  enters pairing mode. Visual indication center  can indicate pairing mode using a combination of LED effects, for example, alternating colored LEDs. When BLUETOOTH system  is set to discoverable mode, in accordance with step  the user uses a second BLUETOOTH mobile device to be monitored to search for BLUETOOTH devices in range and to select the system for intelligent authentication  from the search list. In a preferred embodiment, the system for intelligent authentication  appears as a headset to other BLUETOOTH mobile devices. When the user initiates a pairing request, as shown in step , the system for intelligent authentication \/ receives a pairing request from the device to be monitored, and requests a PIN code. On successful pairing in step , the system for intelligent authentication  obtains the BLUETOOTH address of the device to be monitored and stores it in memory as shown by step . BLUETOOTH system  changes to non-discoverable mode and visual information center  changes to normal mode.","Turning now to , the flowchart illustrates an alternative embodiment using an application.

System for intelligent authentication \/ may comprise an LCD.","In another preferred embodiment, system for intelligent authentication \/ comes with an API (application programming interface) that allows developers to integrate wireless authentication in their applications based on BLUETOOTH proximity. Wireless authentication means automatic login function or single log-on function based on BLUETOOTH proximity. The login may involve verifying the user credentials against a local database or sending them to a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server. The developer application can be any PC, server or mobile terminal application including web applications that run in a browser. When system for intelligent authentication \/ is within proximity, the user is logged in automatically. When system for intelligent authentication \/ is out of proximity, the user is not logged in automatically. This provides a secure platform for enterprise applications where access is granted to people that carry system for intelligent authentication \/, however, unauthorized users that do not carry system for intelligent authentication \/ are not granted access. This feature also prevents identity theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, since mobile phones and mobile terminal can be lost stolen and forgotten, this system prevents loss and theft, and at the same time prevents access by unauthorized users.","In another preferred embodiment, the web application API makes a call to a browser plug-in.

If the hashes match, the data was not tampered with.","Since the present invention seeks to protect PED as well as data onboard PED, Public Key infrastructure (PKI) is used to generate a set of Public Key and Private Key unique for each user. A proximity access and\/or alarm device\u2014system for intelligent authentication \/ is assigned to each user for storing the Public Key (or alternatively the Private Key), and an application\/driver\/program\/chipset\/plug-in\/file manager\/data base manager containing the Private Key (or alternatively the Public Key) is installed on the user PED.","Sensitive data on PED storage medium (hard drive, solid state memory, Flash, network drive, CD Rom, Zip drive, BLUETOOTH drive) is kept encrypted at all time, using Private Key (or alternatively the Public Key). A hash may be generated and stored every time the data is updated.","On user request to read data, a request is made to system for intelligent authentication \/ to get the Public Key, and the requested data is decrypted using the key. The requested data is presented through an authorized application. The hash may be generated again and compared with the stored hash key to ensure the data has not been tempered with.","When the user request data, the hash key for the data may be validated against the old hast key to ensure the data has not been tempered with.","Turning now to , the flowchart illustrates using system for intelligent authentication \/ as a BLUETOOTH wireless headset. In step , the user removes system for intelligent authentication \/ from attachment capsule. Attachment capsule can be a ring for attaching to a key chain, a clip, Velcro, an attachment system for attaching to a badge, etc.","In step , the user moves a housing comprising the earpiece relative to system for intelligent authentication \/. The housing can fold up, slide, pull up, slide, twist, detach relative to the main body in order to expose an earpiece that can fit in the ear. In step , when the housing containing the earpiece move, the BLUETOOTH wireless headset is activated, and voice can transmit from PED to system for intelligent authentication \/ speaker or from system for intelligent authentication \/ microphone to PED.","Cars nowadays offer voice solutions when the user is inside the car, and it would be more interesting for car manufacturers to provide a total solution, regardless of where the user is. Thus system for intelligent authentication \/ can complement voice service through the car key when the user is outside the car. System for intelligent authentication \/ is flat when it is not inserted in the ear, and can have the shape of a headset when folded. System for intelligent authentication \/ can include a metal key to be used in case onboard battery is out of charge. It can also include a second transceiver, an MP3\/MP4 player, a recorder, a bio sensor, a comb, a flash light, a lighter, a Swiss knife, an induction charger,","In another embodiment, system for intelligent authentication \/ can charge its battery from a vehicle's ignition system, whereby when system for intelligent authentication \/ is placed in the ignition system, it recharges. In a preferred embodiment, the system for intelligent authentication has an induction charger. Further, for more security, the user may provide biographic authentication such as be not limited to voice recognition, password entry, retinal scan, finger print, or other information, thus system for intelligent authentication \/ only function if user is validated.","Since most people carry a wallet, a mobile phone and keys, system for intelligent authentication \/ provides a user with valuable all in one features and at the same time does not require the user to carry an extra device, all this thanks to BLUETOOTH. The features include:","Proximity alarm for mobile phone","Headset for mobile phone","Locator for parked vehicle","Vehicle keys","Door keys","In an alternative embodiment, a GPS system onboard a vehicle sends GPS information to system for intelligent authentication \/. GPS information is sent on detection of vehicle going into parking position. Alternatively, said GPS information is sent regularly. System for intelligent authentication \/ over-writes old positions with new GPS position. System for intelligent authentication \/ stores the GPS information representing the last known position of the vehicle. When the user walks away from the parked vehicle, system for intelligent authentication \/ will have the last known GPS position of the vehicle stored on it.","When the user wishes to receive instructions on returning to his\/her parked vehicle, said user activates an application onboard his\/her PED. PED sends a request for information to system for intelligent authentication \/. System for intelligent authentication \/ sends GPS information representing the last known vehicle position. System for intelligent authentication \/ also obtains heading information from an onboard electronic compass and sends heading information.","PED obtains a response from system for intelligent authentication \/ containing GPS and heading information. PED uses an onboard GPS receiver to obtain new user GPS position information.","It is common knowledge that given 2 GPS positions, the distance between them can be calculated. Also, it is known that given 2 positions (origin and destination), the angle between True North and destination from origin can be calculated.","Therefore, given current heading relative to True North, a vector pointing to destination can be drawn.","PED displays distance from origin to destination. Furthermore, PED displays an arrow pointing toward destination to user. This information helps the user to return to his\/her parked vehicle.","Turning to , the flowchart illustrates the operation of system for intelligent authentication. In step , a user tries to access a lock system. A lock system can be an electronic lock that activates a mechanical lock, an electro-mechanical lock, a door lock, a vehicle lock, an actuator, a software interface that activates a lock screen or a password screen, a software interface that encrypts data, a software interface that blocks user from accessing a personal electronic device, any other locking system. For example, user activates handle of locked door, a user clicks on a locked\/encrypted file . . . .","In another preferred embodiment, the lock system detects the presence of a user by sending motion, or by sensing movement. At that time, the lock system automatically searches for system for intelligent authentication in step .","In step , the lock system establishes a secure tow-way wireless connection with system for intelligent authentication \/ and requests a digital key. The digital key can be a private key\/public key\/part of a private key\/part of a public key, an encoded\/encrypted\/obfuscated private key\/public key\/part of a private key\/part of a public key. The lock system may send an obfuscation\/encrypted formula so that system for intelligent authentication \/ can obfuscate\/encrypt transmitted information, can return it within a predetermined period (for example a second) and so that the lock system may de-obfuscate\/de-crypt the returned result. In step , System for intelligent authentication \/ automatically returns digital key wirelessly, and in step , on validation of the digital key, the lock system unlocks. In step , the lock system may try to maintain a wireless connection with system for intelligent authentication \/, and on detection of a connection drop, lock.","In another embodiment, on detection of connection drop, the lock or device or lock application may request a user code from the user, may block access, logout, encrypt data, lock a device or lock a lock.","The user may use the system for intelligent authentication with a first device in a first space, and then connect to a second device in a second space. The first device in a first space may provide the system for intelligent authentication with information such as last used radio station, last played record, last seat position, last rear-view mirror position, last light settings, last user adjustments, last visited web sites, last viewed channel, last environment variables, last user settings and preferences. The information is written to the memory wirelessly without connecting a cable. The information may be written to flash memory. When the user connects to the second device, the second device may request the last environment variables or the last user settings and preferences. It may use them to set the settings and preferences on the second device to the same values as those on the first device.","For example, a user is inside the home, and is listening to radio station A. When the user goes to his\/her car, the car radio will set to radio station A.","A user can purchase\/acquire\/install a lock system that comes with a digital access code (provided on a CD, memory card, USB flash, email, or any way for transferring digital data). The user can later update system for intelligent authentication \/ with the new digital access code by connecting system for intelligent authentication \/ to a PED, and transferring the new digital access code to system for intelligent authentication \/. The new digital code will be stored onboard system for intelligent authentication \/. The new digital code may be transferred to system for intelligent authentication \/ through SPI flashing.","In a preferred embodiment, system for intelligent authentication \/ stores a part of a private key. It receives a message from PED containing an obfuscation formula, for example, a large random number and a code for an obfuscation formula.","Turning to , the flowchart illustrates automatic login using a system for intelligent authentication.","This method enables the user to not have to enter a PIN code every time access is required. For example, a delivery man is making one delivery every 30 minutes using a mobile device. If we not the delivery man has not left proximity of the mobile device, then we do not have to ask him for a PIN code every time he makes a delivery. This adds convenience. At the same time, if we detect that the delivery man left proximity of the mobile device, then the next time he needs to make a delivery and capture information on the mobile terminal, a PIN will be requested.","In step , a user tries to access a system or a service from a computer or a device. In step , a program onboard the computer or device checks if the time passed since the last time the user entered a PIN code or a password has not exceeded a threshold. The program also checks if any signal drop was detected since the last user entered PIN code. In step , if the user recently entered a PIN code (within a predetermined period of time), and if there has not been any connection drop since the entered PIN code, the computer or device will not ask the user to enter a PIN code. The computer or device will request digital keys wirelessly from a paired system for intelligent authentication. In step , if the digital keys are authenticated by the computer, device or by a remote server, access is granted in step . Otherwise, access is not granted in step .","Also, if the period since last PIN code exceeded a time threshold, or if a signal drop was recently detected, the user is asked to enter a PIN code.","In another embodiment, the user is asked to enter user name and password, or to provide more information or to contact a client support service.","In another embodiment, the user is asked to enter a PIN code or password or username password, a predetermined number of time, and if the entered information is not authorized, the user has to go through an authentication workflow whereby the user may be asked to respond to challenge questions or to contact a support service. For example, a system may have a timeout between PIN codes of 2 hours.","During those two hours, and after the user enters a first PIN, the user can log to the system any time (or a predetermined number of time) without being asked for PIN as long as the connection between the user device and the system for intelligent authentication has not dropped.","After a connection drop is detected, the user must enter credentials again. This can be a simple PIN code, password, or a more complex questionnaire or interview.","If the user enters a wrong PIN code a predetermined number of times, the user interface blocks access and the user may have to go through a questionnaire or interview to be authenticated.","If the user does not have the system for intelligent authentication, the user may have to go through a questionnaire or interview in order to be authenticated.","For example, the user may be issued a onetime access password to allow him access a predetermined number of times until the system for intelligent authentication is found. If the user lost the system for intelligent authentication, the user device pairing to the system for intelligent authentication will be un-paired using an application or by pressing a reset button. This way, the system for intelligent authentication will no longer be a security threat, and cannot be used for any access.","This function is very useful for computer users and most particularly, mobile enterprise application users. Most enterprises that provide access to enterprise applications over mobile devices have to disconnect a user after 30 seconds, 1 or 2 minute of inactivity. This is because when there is inactivity, there is a high risk for device loss, theft, or access by unauthorized persons.","With this new solution, since the user has a wearable system for intelligent authentication (key chain, headset, token), if the computer or device has not detected a connection drop from the system for intelligent authentication, we can assume that the user has not left the proximity of the computer or device.","If a connection drop is detected, the application or device requests a user code from the user, may attempt to reconnect, or may issue an audible alarm","It is noted that the system for intelligent authentication is previously paired to one or more devices, that it is non-discoverable, and that it will only communication with paired devices.","If a thief steals a system for intelligent authentication, he will not be able to operate it with any computer or device other than the ones that were originally paired with the system for intelligent authentication.","The system for intelligent authentication is designed so that it does not allow reset, and it does not go to discoverable mode unless it is updated through an authorized update application.","It is noted that the user is supplied with an application that runs on the computer or device to un-pair the system for intelligent authentication in case the system for intelligent authentication is lost or stolen.","To further limit unauthorized access, the computer or device periodically asks the user for a PIN code, say every 2-hour period. This is in case an un-authorized person has laid hand on both the system for intelligent authentication and the computer or device.","Thus the current solution is design to provide intelligent automatic login with further convenience that traditional system, while enhancing the total access security through tracking the user location with respect to his\/her computer or device, and through obtaining security keys from a non-discoverable and non-resettable system for intelligent authentication that can only function with the user computer or device. Also, when the user takes notice of the system for intelligent authentication, he can go to his computer or device, and run an application to un-pair the system for intelligent authentication, and with that, the system for intelligent authentication become totally useless as it cannot communication with any device.","In a preferred embodiment, the system for intelligent authentication has a proximity alarm that alarms when the user leaves proximity of the system for intelligent authentication.

This can be a USB, RS232 or any other cable means.","In step , the user runs an application to update the system for intelligent authentication. The application can be a program running on the computer, a web service, a web plug-in, or any software running on a specialized device.","In step , the application collects update parameters, stack and application, and prepares update files. In a preferred embodiment, the application builds a DFU (device firmware upgrade) file. The application can sign the update files using a private key matching a public key stored on the system for intelligent authentication.","In step , the application tries to download the signed file to the system for intelligent authentication.","In step , a resident loader firmware onboard the system for intelligent authentication checks if the private key of the signed file matches a public key stored onboard the system or device.","In step , if there is a match, the signed file is downloaded to the system for intelligent authentication in step . When the new firmware executes, it may set the system for intelligent authentication to discoverable to enable pairing with a new second device.","In step , the signed file is not downloaded.","It is noted that the loader firmware cannot be updated through the data port or through the cable. It can only be updated through access to PCB pins or PCB test points, such as SPI pins. This is so that the firmware onboard the system for intelligent authentication cannot be tempered.","Turning to , the flowchart illustrates how the system for intelligent authentication turns to non-discoverable. In step , the system for intelligent authentication is updated.","There are two types of updates: 1) Updates that does not require the system for intelligent authentication to work with a new device, such as a new computer or a new lock. In this case, the system for intelligent authentication preserves its pairings to old devices for which it was previously paired.","2) Updates that require the system for intelligent authentication to work with a new device. In this case, the system for intelligent authentication is set to discoverable, so that it can be paired with a new device.","In this scenario, the update program can set the system for intelligent authentication to discoverable, and can set conditions for pairing or pairing rules.
