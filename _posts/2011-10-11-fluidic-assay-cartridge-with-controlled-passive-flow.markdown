The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present disclosure pertains to methods for regulating fluidic flow in a device. In particular, the disclosure pertains to devices and methods for performing liquid-based assays in fluidic cartridges, such as those that require multiple liquid steps.","The disclosed device and method advance the art by providing simple fluidic cartridges that solve problems in the field. The disclosure particularly pertains to fluidic devices with passively driven fluid flow, that is, fluid flow driven by forces such as capillary action and head pressures rather than by active pumping mechanisms. This disclosure also solves some of the problems associated with passive-flow fluidics, namely, channel draining and backflow, among others. The disclosure further provides means for adding liquid to cartridges in multiple steps, without requiring liquid aspiration or removal.","In one embodiment, a device is provided for analyzing or processing a liquid sample. The device may contain a first substrate, a second substrate, a fluidic channel, an inlet port and an outlet port. The first substrate may have a first inner surface and a first outer surface. Similarly, the second substrate may have a second inner surface and a second outer surface. The fluidic channel may be partly defined by the first inner surface of the first substrate and the second inner surface of the second substrate. In another aspect, the first substrate may form, at least in part, the lower wall of the fluidic channel, while the second substrate may form, at least in part, the upper wall of the fluidic channel.","In one embodiment, the fluidic channel is connected directly or indirectly to the inlet port on one end and to the outlet port on the other end. In another embodiment, a wicking pad may be placed on the second substrate, wherein said wicking pad is positioned at a distance from said outlet port. For instance, the wicking pad may be attached to the second outer surface of the second substrate. In one aspect, the wicking pad is positioned at a certain distance (or gap) from the outlet port, wherein the distance may help prevent the wicking pad from draining the fluidic channel. In another embodiment, the wicking pad may also prevent liquid that has already made contact with the wicking pad from flowing back into the outlet port. In one aspect, the distance or gap is between 1 and 5 mm. In another aspect, the distance or gap is between 2 and 4 mm.","In another embodiment, the device, such as a fluidic cartridge, may be designed such that the flow of the liquid sample through the fluidic channel is driven by a pressure differential between the inlet port and the outlet port. In another embodiment, when added to the inlet port, the liquid sample may form an inlet reservoir with a depth of H. As the liquid flows through the channel and reaches the outlet port, it may form an outlet reservoir having a depth of H. For purpose of this disclosure, H, and Hmay be both from about 1 to about 10 mm. In another embodiment, when H, is greater than H, a pressure differential is created between the inlet and outlet ports.","In another embodiment, the inlet port may have physical dimensions that provide an inlet liquid volume reservoir that feeds the fluidic channel. In one aspect, the inlet port may have a cylindrical geometry with diameter in the range of about 1 to 10 mm and a height of about 1 to 10 mm. In another aspect, the inlet port may have a non-cylindrical geometry, such as square, rectangular, or oval shape. In one example, the inlet port may hold about 0.003 to 3 milliliters of liquid.","In another embodiment, the outlet port may be an opening in the solid material defining the fluidic channel. In one aspect, the opening may be circular with a diameter of from about 1 to 5 mm. In another aspect, the opening may be D-shaped, square, rectangular, or oval shape.","In another embodiment, the sample in the inlet port may have a top liquid surface at a height of h relative to the outlet port, wherein the height is defined relative to a level orientation (or horizontal level) even when the device is tilted relative to the level orientation, as shown in .","In another embodiment, the device may be designed with an internal tilt relative to level, such that the height h may drive flow from the inlet port towards the outlet port. In another aspect, the height, h, may be achieved by placing the device in a rack with a pre-determined tilt angle. In one embodiment, the tilt may be at an angle between 2 and 45 degrees relative to a level orientation. In another embodiment, the tilt may be at an angle between 5 and 8 degrees relative to a level orientation.","In another embodiment, the wicking pad is characterized by an absorbance rate and gap between the pad and the outlet port is characterized by a surface energy, wherein the characteristic absorbance rate is selected such that when the absorbance rate exceeds the rate at which liquid emerges from the outlet port, liquid surface tension breaks the liquid connection between the wicking pad and the outlet port, preventing further liquid flow from the outlet port to the wicking pad. In another aspect, the wicking pad may be made of materials having a wicking rate of between 10 and 200 seconds per 4 cm of wick material. By way of example, wicking pad materials may include but are not limited to Whatman 900, Whatman 470, Millipore C182, Millipore C083, and Ahlstrom 222. According to manufacturer's specification, Whatman 900 has a wicking rate of 34 seconds per 4 cm, with 204 mg per sq. cm water absorption, and Whatman 470 has a wicking rate of 77 seconds per 4 cm, with 78 mg per sq. cm water absorption.","In another embodiment, the liquid flow in the fluidic channel may be restored by adding liquid to the inlet port, providing a means for performing multiple liquid additions without requiring aspiration or the removal of liquid from previous additions.","In another embodiment, the fluidic cartridge may contain a rail structure between the outlet port and the wicking pad for directing capillary flow from the outlet port to the wicking pad.","In another embodiment, the first substrate may contain a planar waveguide, and a refractive volume for optically coupling light beams to the planar waveguide. In another aspect, the refractive volume may be integrally formed from the planar waveguide, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/233,794, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this disclosure.","For purposes of illustrative clarity, certain elements in the drawings may not be drawn to scale.","A method and device for reliably performing passive continuous flow in a fluidic channel is described. The method and device: (1) rely on gravity to provide driving pressure; (2) are capable of starting and stopping liquid flow in a controlled manner; and (3) can deliver known quantities of liquid into the channel. The embodiments described herein further provide continuous flow of a known liquid volume through a channel, with flow terminating before the channel is completely drained of liquid. As disclosed herein, this effect may achieved by the following process, beginning with filling an inlet port with a known volume. Pressure-driven flow due to gravity and surface tension moves the liquid through a channel to an outlet port. Introduction of a wicking pad located near the outlet port absorbs the liquid and ensures that flow continues until all the liquid in the inlet port has flowed through the channel. Proper separation of the wicking pad from the outlet port, design of outlet port geometry, and control of solid-liquid-gas surface tension ensures that flow terminates before the channel is drained of liquid. The wicking pad further prevents backflow of liquid through the outlet port into the channel","The term \u201csurface tension\u201d is used herein in relation to the surface energies of the solid-liquid, liquid-gas, and solid-gas interfaces associated with the fluidic cartridge. Surface tension or surface energy impacts the ability of a liquid to wet a solid surface, characterized by a liquid-solid-gas interface. In the present invention, exemplary solids include plastics and plastics with modified surface properties. Exemplary liquids include aqueous solutions, including aqueous solutions with surface tensions modified by surface active components such as surfactants or amphiphilic molecules. An exemplary gas is air.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","112","114","116","110","112","114","116","110","110","112","114","112","114","116"]},"For applications, such as in-vitro diagnostics, a liquid  (such as an aqueous solution) may be introduced into channel  at inlet port  of fluidic cartridge , as shown in . Due to characteristics such as height differences in the fluidic columns between inlet port  and outlet port , a differential pressure exists therebetween that drives liquid  to flow from inlet port  to outlet port  in a direction indicated by arrows  and . If channel  has not previously been filled with liquid, capillary forces due to surface tension may also contribute to moving liquid  through channel .","Depending on outlet port  geometry (e.g., diameter and shape) and surface tension associated with the liquid, solid cartridge material, and gas (typically air), outlet port  can act as a capillary valve with a characteristic burst pressure. Referring to , liquid  flows through the channel then stops at a height h as determined by the capillary valve burst pressure at outlet port .","Once surface tension at outlet port  is overcome by the pressure exerted by liquid  at outlet , liquid  begins to flow out of outlet port , as shown in . That is, the difference between the fluid pressure and ambient pressure exceeds a burst pressure, overcoming the surface tension at outlet port . Consequently, liquid flows continuously through channel  until the level of liquid  at inlet port  drops to equilibrium level h (indicated by double arrows), which is lower than first level . At this point, flow ceases because the pressures due to surface tension forces and gravity are balanced between inlet port  and outlet port . For the small dimensional sizes of channel  in applications of interest (e.g., on the order of millimeters to tens of millimeters), the gravity-induced forces are comparable in magnitude to surface tension forces.","In one embodiment, a tilt may be introduced to the fluidic cartridge so as to alter the pressure differential between the inlet port and the outlet port. As shown in , a tilted cartridge  includes components similar to those of previously-described fluidic cartridge . In contrast to the embodiment illustrated in , tilted cartridge  is tilted from a level orientation by an angle \u03c6 such that the pressure differential at outlet port  is greater than those shown in . In effect, the column height of inlet port  is increased without requiring additional liquid volume, and thus the gravity-induced pressure is increased over that of the level orientation. As a result, burst pressure is more easily attained, and liquid  empties to a relatively lower liquid level in tilted cartridge  as compared to level, fluidic cat ridge .","Regardless of the specific configuration used (e.g., level cartridge  or tilted cartridge ), a fluidic column builds up at outlet port  such that at some point liquid flow stops when the pressure at the outlet port balances the pressure at the inlet port. This condition does not always guarantee that all of the liquid in the inlet port  flows through channel  to outlet port . One way to maintain liquid flow through channel  is to introduce a wicking pad, which essentially acts as a reservoir for absorbing liquid therein. As will be explained below, the wicking pad acts to reduce the column height of the outlet port such that liquid flow is maintained.  is a cross-sectional view of a fluidic cartridge  including a wicking pad , in accordance with an embodiment.","As shown in , liquid  may be inserted into fluidic cartridge  such that, at inlet port , liquid  reaches a level  while liquid  is kept within outlet port  by surface tension. When the burst pressure is exceeded, as shown in , the liquid flows out from outlet  in a manner dependent on the liquid-solid-gas surface tension and solid surface geometry. As the liquid column at outlet  expands, it eventually makes contact with wicking pad , which quickly absorbs the liquid. The strong capillary forces of the wicking pad absorb liquid at a rate faster than the rate at which channel  can supply liquid to outlet port . Due to this rate difference, the liquid column height at outlet  is rapidly decreased. After absorption by the wicking pad, the liquid column height at outlet  is decreased and then subsequently replenished by flow through channel . Provided that the column height of inlet  provides enough pressure for the liquid to repeatedly overcome the burst pressure and re-contact the wicking pad, back pressure from the liquid column of outlet  is avoided and continuous flow occurs in channel . Flow through channel  is maintained until the liquid column height of inlet  drops such that there is insufficient pressure to overcome the burst pressure of outlet . Careful choice of material surface energies, tilt angle, and liquid column heights enables the entire volume of liquid in inlet  to be completely emptied through channel . In this manner, prescribed amounts of liquid can be flowed from inlet port  through channel , despite large surface tensions from dimensionally small fluidics geometries that might be encountered in a diagnostic device.","Many applications require that the liquid remain in the channel at all times during liquid flow and after the inlet has emptied. For instance, an in-vitro diagnostic may require the biological sample in the liquid to incubate in the channel for a period of time so as to allow the sample to chemically react with reagents that are immobilized to the channel surface. Capillary pressures obtained by wicking pad  can be large enough to pull liquid from channel  in an unrestrained or uncontrollable manner, causing the channel to go dry or be filled with detrimental gas bubbles. Liquid flow from the outlet port to the wicking pad is affected by a number of factors: absorbance properties of wicking pad (determined by material composition), geometrical placement of wicking pad with respect to outlet , the physical geometry of cartridge features like outlet and inlet ports, and the surface energies of cartridge materials and liquids (determined by material composition, surface treatments, and time-dependent surface adsorption). One or more of these properties can be optimized for desired performance. For instance, surface energies around the outlet port can be modified by plasma treatment to promote wetting of the solid material by the liquid.","In an embodiment, a small gap  is introduced between wicking pad  and outlet port  to prevent draining of channel  (see ). When the rate of liquid from the outlet port is less than absorbance rate of the wicking pad (such as happens when the inlet port empties), surface tension forces in gap  around the outlet port \u201cbreak\u201d the liquid flow to the wicking pad. To restore flow, the inlet can be filled with sufficient liquid so that once again the inlet pressure exceeds the burst pressure. Flow then resumes as the wicking pad once again absorbs excess liquid from the outlet port. In this manner, flow can be started and stopped multiple times in a controlled manner without draining the channel completely of liquid. A key aspect of the embodiment is that the wicking pad does not actively pump liquid through the channel, but only acts a reservoir to store excess liquids. Gravity provides pressure-driven flow through the cartridge channel.","An embodiment also employs the use of ridge or rail features at the outlet port to directionally steer the liquid to the wicking pad. Surface tension forces associated with the sharp corners of the rail preferentially direct the liquid along the rail towards the wicking pad in a more controlled manner.  is a cross-sectional view of a fluidic cartridge , including a combination of a wicking pad  and a rail , in accordance with an embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIGS. 10-12","FIG. 10","FIG. 11","FIGS. 10 and 11","FIG. 12"],"b":["800","800","920","920","930","114","920","815","920","815","940","920","810","920","815","810","1040","920","114","1030","920","114","1130","920","815"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIGS. 9-12"],"b":["1300","1300","1310","1320","1330","1330","1332","1335","1338","1330","1340","1350","1360","1330","1320","1320","1332","1338"]},"Changes may be made in the above methods and systems without departing from the scope hereof It should thus be noted that the matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings should be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
