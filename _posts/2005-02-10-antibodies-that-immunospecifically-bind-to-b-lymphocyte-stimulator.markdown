The present invention also relates to methods and compositions for detecting, diagnosing, or prognosing a disease or disorder associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression or inappropriate function of B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor, comprising antibodies or fragments or variants thereof, or related molecules, that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator. The present invention further relates to methods and compositions for preventing, treating or ameliorating a disease or disorder associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression or inappropriate B Lymphocyte Stimulator function or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor function, comprising administering to an animal, preferably a human, an effective amount of one or more antibodies or fragments or variants thereof, or related molecules, that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator.","B Lymphocyte Stimulator (BLyS\u2122) protein is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (\u201cTNF\u201d) superfamily that induces both in vivo and in vitro B cell proliferation and differentiation (Moore et al., 285: 260-263 (1999)). B Lymphocyte Stimulator is distinguishable from other B cell growth and differentiation factors such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-13, IL-15, CD40L, or CD27L (CD70) by its monocyte-specific gene and protein expression pattern and its specific receptor distribution and biological activity on B lymphocytes. B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression is not detected on natural killer (\u201cNK\u201d) cells, T cells or B cells, but is restricted to cells of myeloid origin. B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression on resting monocytes is upregulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The gene encoding B Lymphocyte Stimulator has been mapped to chromosome 13q34.","B Lymphocyte Stimulator is expressed as a 285 amino acid type II membrane-bound polypeptide and a soluble 152 amino acid polypeptide (Moore et al., 1999 supra). The membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator has a predicted transmembrane spanning domain between amino acid residues 47 and 73. The NH-terminus of the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator begins at Alaof the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. Soluble recombinant B Lymphocyte Stimulator has been shown to induce in vitro proliferation of murine splenic B cells and to bind to a cell-surface receptor on these cells (Moore et al., 1999 supra). Soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator administration to mice has been shown to result in an increase in the proportion of CD45R, Ly6D(also known as ThB) B cells and an increase in serum IgM and IgA levels (Moore et al., 1999 supra). Thus, B Lymphocyte Stimulator displays a B cell tropism in both its receptor distribution and biological activity.","Levels of B Lymphocyte Stimulator protein have been found to be elevated in patients with autoimmune disease, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (Zhang et al., , (2001) 166:6-10; Cheema et al., (2001)44:1313-1319; and Groom et al., (2002) 109:59-68). Furthermore, administration of a soluble form of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor, TACI, has been shown to alleviate the autoimmune phenotype of NZBWF1 and MRL-lpr\/lpr mice (Gross et al., , (2000) 404:995-999). Thus, antibodies and related molecules that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator may find medical utility in, for example, the treatment of B cell disorders associated with autoimmunity. In other embodiments, antibodies and related molecules that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator may find medical utility in for example, neoplasia or immunodeficiency syndromes.","The present invention encompasses antibodies (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically bind to a polypeptide or polypeptide fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In particular, the invention encompasses antibodies (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically bind to a polypeptide or polypeptide fragment of human B Lymphocyte Stimulator (SEQ ID NOS:3228 and\/or 3229) or B Lymphocyte Stimulator expressed on human monocytes; murine B Lymphocyte Stimulator (SEQ ID NOS:3230 and\/or 3231) or B Lymphocyte Stimulator expressed on murine monocytes; rat B Lymphocyte Stimulator (either the soluble forms as given in SEQ ID NOS:3232, 3233, 3234 and\/or 3235 or in a membrane associated form, e.g., on the surface of rat monocytes); or monkey B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., the monkey B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS:3236 and\/or 3237, the soluble form of monkey B Lymphocyte Stimulator, or B Lymphocyte Stimulator expressed on monkey monocytes), preferably human B Lymphocyte Stimulator. The present invention also encompasses methods and compositions for detecting, diagnosing, or prognosing diseases or disorders associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression or inappropriate function of B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor in an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, comprising, or alternatively consisting of, use of antibodies (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator.

As such, the term antibody encompasses not only whole antibody molecules, but also antibody fragments as well as variants (including derivatives) of antibodies and antibody fragments. Examples of molecules which are described by the term \u201cantibody\u201d in this application include, but are not limited to: single chain Fvs (scFvs), Fab fragments, Fab\u2032 fragments, F(ab\u2032), disulfide linked Fvs (sdFvs), Fvs, and fragments comprising or alternatively consisting of, either a VL or a VH domain. The term \u201csingle chain Fv\u201d or \u201cscFv\u201d as used herein refers to a polypeptide comprising a VL domain of antibody linked to a VH domain of an antibody. Antibodies that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator may have cross-reactivity with other antigens. Preferably, antibodies that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator do not cross-react with other antigens. Antibodies that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator can be identified, for example, by immunoassays or other techniques known to those of skill in the art, e.g., the immunoassays described in the Examples below.","Antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, monoclonal, multispecific, human or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab\u2032) fragments, antiidiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. The immunoglobulin molecules of the invention can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgG, IgG, IgG, IgG, IgAand IgA) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule.","Antibodies of the invention may also include multimeric forms of antibodies. For example, antibodies of the invention may take the form of antibody dimers, trimers, or higher-order multimers of monomeric immunoglobulin molecules. Dimers of whole immunoglobulin molecules or of F(ab\u2032)fragments are tetravalent, whereas dimers of Fab fragments or scFv molecules are bivalent. Individual monomers within an antibody multimer may be identical or different, i.e., they may be heteromeric or homomeric antibody multimers. For example, individual antibodies within a multimer may have the same or different binding specificities. Multimerization of antibodies may be accomplished through natural aggregation of antibodies or through chemical or recombinant linking techniques known in the art. For example, some percentage of purified antibody preparations (e.g., purified IgG1 molecules) spontaneously form protein aggregates containing antibody homodimers, and other higher-order antibody multimers. Alternatively, antibody homodimers may be formed through chemical linkage techniques known in the art. For example, heterobifunctional crosslinking agents including, but not limited to, SMCC [succinimidyl 4-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate] and SATA [N-succinimidyl S-acethylthio-acetate] (available, for example, from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. (Rockford, Ill.)) can be used to form antibody multimers. An exemplary protocol for the formation of antibody homodimers is given in Ghetie et al., (1997) 94:7509-7514, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Antibody homodimers can be converted to Fab\u20322 homodimers through digestion with pepsin. Another way to form antibody homodimers is through the use of the autophilic T15 peptide described in Zhao and Kohler, (2002) 25:396-404, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Alternatively, antibodies can be made to multimerize through recombinant DNA techniques. IgM and IgA naturally form antibody multimers through the interaction with the J chain polypeptide. Non-IgA or non-IgM molecules, such as IgG molecules, can be engineered to contain the J chain interaction domain of IgA or IgM, thereby conferring the ability to form higher order multimers on the non-IgA or non-IgM molecules. (see, for example, Chintalacharuvu et al., (2001) 101:21-31. and Frigerio et al., (2000) 123:1483-94, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.) ScFv dimers can also be formed through recombinant techniques known in the art; an example of the construction of scFv dimers is given in Goel et al., (2000) 60:6964-6971 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Antibody multimers may be purified using any suitable method known in the art, including, but not limited to, size exclusion chromatography.","Unless otherwise defined in the specification, specific binding or immunospecific binding by an anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody means that the anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody binds B Lymphocyte Stimulator but does not significantly bind to (i.e., cross react with) proteins other than B Lymphocyte Stimulator, such as other proteins in the same family of proteins, e.g., other TNF family ligands). An antibody that binds B Lymphocyte Stimulator protein and does not cross-react with other proteins is not necessarily an antibody that does not bind said other proteins in all conditions; rather, the B Lymphocyte Stimulator-specific antibody of the invention preferentially binds B Lymphocyte Stimulator compared to its ability to bind said other proteins such that it will be suitable for use in at least one type of assay or treatment, i.e., give low background levels or result in no unreasonable adverse effects in treatment. It is well known that the portion of a protein bound by an antibody is known as the epitope. An epitope may either be linear (i.e., comprised of sequential amino acids residues in a protein sequences) or conformational (i.e., comprised of one or more amino acid residues that are not contiguous in the primary structure of the protein but that are brought together by the secondary, tertiary or quaternary structure of a protein). Given that B Lymphocyte Stimulator-specific antibodies bind to epitopes of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, an antibody that specifically binds B Lymphocyte Stimulator may or may not bind fragments of B Lymphocyte Stimulator and\/or variants of B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., proteins that are at least 90% identical to B Lymphocyte Stimulator) depending on the presence or absence of the epitope bound by a given B Lymphocyte Stimulator-specific antibody in the B Lymphocyte Stimulator fragment or variant. Likewise, B Lymphocyte Stimulator-specific antibodies of the invention may bind species orthologues of B Lymphocyte Stimulator (including fragments thereof) depending on the presence or absence of the epitope recognized by the antibody in the orthologue. Additionally, B Lymphocyte Stimulator-specific antibodies of the invention may bind modified forms of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, for example, B Lymphocyte Stimulator fusion proteins. In such a case when antibodies of the invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator fusion proteins, the antibody must make binding contact with the B Lymphocyte Stimulator moiety of the fusion protein in order for the binding to be specific. Antibodies that specifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator can be identified, for example, by immunoassays or other techniques known to those of skill in the art, e.g., the immunoassays described in the Examples below.","Furthermore, in the present application certain antibodies may be specific for either the membrane bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, or the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator (i.e., 134-285 of SEQ ID NO:2, preferably trimers of proteins consisting of amino acids 134-285 of SEQ ID NO:2), or both. Antibodies of the present invention are defined as able to bind the membrane bound and\/or soluble forms of B Lymphocyte Stimulator according to the assays described in Examples 1 through 19.","Preferably, an antibody of the invention comprises, or alternatively consists of, a VH domain, VH CDR, VL domain, or VL CDR having an amino acid sequence of any one of those referred to in Table 1, or a fragment or variant thereof.","An antibody of the invention \u201cwhich binds the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator\u201d is one which binds the 152 amino acid soluble form of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator protein (amino acids 134-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228). In specific embodiments of the invention, an antibody of the invention \u201cwhich binds the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator\u201d does not also bind the membrane-bound or membrane-associated form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. Assays which measure binding to the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator include, but are not limited to, receptor binding inhibition assay or capture of soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator from solution as described in Examples 8 and 9.","An antibody of the invention \u201cwhich binds the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator\u201d is one which binds the membrane-associated (uncleaved) B Lymphocyte Stimulator protein. In specific embodiments of the invention, an antibody of the invention \u201cwhich binds the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator\u201d does not also bind the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. Binding to HIS-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator (as described herein) in an ELISA is an indicator that an antibody binds the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, but should not be relied upon as proof of specificity for the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. Assays that may be relied upon as proof of an antibody's specificity for membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator, include, but are not limited to, binding to plasma membranes expressing B Lymphocyte Stimulator as described in Example 2. An antibody of the invention \u201cwhich binds the both the soluble form and the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator\u201d is one which binds both the membrane-bound form and the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator.","The term \u201cvariant\u201d as used herein refers to a polypeptide that possesses a similar or identical function as a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, an anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody or antibody fragment thereof, but does not necessarily comprise a similar or identical amino acid sequence of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, an anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody or antibody fragment thereof, or possess a similar or identical structure of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, an anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody or antibody fragment thereof. A variant having a similar amino acid refers to a polypeptide that satisfies at least one of the following: (a) a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an amino acid sequence that is at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95% or at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, an anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody or antibody fragment thereof (including a VH domain, VHCDR, VL domain, or VLCDR having an amino acid sequence of any one of those referred to in Table 1) described herein; (b) a polypeptide encoded by a nucleotide sequence, the complementary sequence of which hybridizes under stringent conditions to a nucleotide sequence encoding a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide (e.g., SEQ ID NO:3228), a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, an anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody or antibody fragment thereof (including a VH domain, VHCDR, VL domain, or VLCDR having an amino acid sequence of any one of those referred to in Table 1), described herein, of at least 5 amino acid residues, at least 10 amino acid residues, at least 15 amino acid residues, at least 20 amino acid residues, at least 25 amino acid residues, at least 30 amino acid residues, at least 40 amino acid residues, at least 50 amino acid residues, at least 60 amino residues, at least 70 amino acid residues, at least 80 amino acid residues, at least 90 amino acid residues, at least 100 amino acid residues, at least 125 amino acid residues, or at least 150 amino acid residues; and (c) a polypeptide encoded by a nucleotide sequence that is at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95% or at least 99%, identical to the nucleotide sequence encoding a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, an anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody or antibody fragment thereof (including a VH domain, VHCDR, VL domain, or VLCDR having an amino acid sequence of any one of those referred to in Table 1), described herein. A polypeptide with similar structure to a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, an anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody or antibody fragment thereof, described herein refers to a polypeptide that has a similar secondary, tertiary or quarternary structure of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, an anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody, or antibody fragment thereof, described herein. The structure of a polypeptide can determined by methods known to those skilled in the art, including but not limited to, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and crystallographic electron microscopy.","To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide at the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity=number of identical overlapping positions\/total number of positions\u00d7100%). In one embodiment, the two sequences are the same length.","The determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm known to those of skill in the art. An example of a mathematical algorithm for comparing two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul 87:2264-2268(1990), modified as in Karlin and Altschul 90:5873-5877 (1993). The BLASTn and BLASTx programs of Altschul, et al. 215:403410(1990) have incorporated such an algorithm. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the BLASTn program, score=100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the BLASTx program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. 25:3389-3402(1997). Alternatively, PSI-BLAST can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules (Id.). When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI-BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., BLASTx and BLASTn) can be used. (See http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.)","Another example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, CABIOS (1989). The ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package has incorporated such an algorithm. Other algorithms for sequence analysis known in the art include ADVANCE and ADAM as described in Torellis and Robotti 10:3-5(1994); and FASTA described in Pearson and Lipman 85:2444-8(1988). Within FASTA, ktup is a control option that sets the sensitivity and speed of the search.","The term \u201cderivative\u201d as used herein, refers to a variant polypeptide of the invention that comprises, or alternatively consists of, an amino acid sequence of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, or an antibody of the invention that immunospecifically binds to B Lymphocyte Stimulator, which has been altered by the introduction of amino acid residue substitutions, deletions or additions. The term \u201cderivative\u201d as used herein also refers to a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, an antibody that immunospecifically binds to B Lymphocyte Stimulator which has been modified, e.g., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the polypeptide. For example, but not by way of limitation, a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, or an anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody, may be modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. A derivative of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, or an anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody, may be modified by chemical modifications using techniques known to those of skill in the art, including, but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Further, a derivative of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, or an anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody, may contain one or more non-classical amino acids.

In other specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind heteromeric, especially heterotrimeric, B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides such as a heterotrimer containing two B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides and one APRIL polypeptide or a heterotrimer containing one B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide and two APRIL polypeptides, and wherein the individual protein components of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator heteromer consist of the mature extracellular soluble portion of either B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., amino acids residues 134-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228, or amino acids residues 134-266 of SEQ ID NO:3229) or fragments or variants thereof, or the mature extracellular soluble portion APRIL (e.g., amino acid residues 105-250 of SEQ ID NO:3239) or fragments or variants thereof.","In specific embodiments, the antibodies of the invention bind conformational epitopes of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator monomeric protein. In specific embodiments, the antibodies of the invention bind conformational epitopes of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator multimeric, especially trimeric, protein. In other embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind conformational epitopes that arise from the juxtaposition of B Lymphocyte Stimulator with a heterologous polypeptide, such as might be present when B Lymphocyte Stimulator forms heterotrimers (e.g., with APRIL polypeptides (e.g., SEQ ID SEQ ID NO:3239)), or in fusion proteins between B Lymphocyte Stimulator and a heterologous polypeptide.","In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention that specifically bind heterotrimers containing at least one B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide and at least one APRIL polypeptide, comprise all or a portion of SEQ ID NOS: 1881 or 1884 (e.g., one or more CDR regions, a VH domain or a VL domain).

Thus, in one embodiment, B Lymphocyte Stimulator multimers, such as, for example, homodimers or homotrimers, are formed when polypeptides of the invention contact one another in solution. In another embodiment, B Lymphocyte Stimulator heteromultimers, such as, for example, B Lymphocyte Stimulator heterotrimers or B Lymphocyte Stimulator heterotetramers, are formed when polypeptides of the invention contact antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention (including antibodies to the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein of the invention) in solution. In other embodiments, B Lymphocyte Stimulator multimers are formed by covalent associations with and\/or between the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides of the invention. Such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the polypeptide sequence (e.g., that recited in SEQ ID NO:3228 or SEQ ID NO:3229). In one instance, the covalent associations are cross-linking between cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequences which interact in the native (i.e., naturally occurring) polypeptide. In another instance, the covalent associations are the consequence of chemical or recombinant manipulation. Alternatively, such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a B Lymphocyte Stimulator fusion protein. In one example, covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a fusion protein (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925). In a specific example, the covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a B Lymphocyte Stimulator-Fc fusion protein. In another specific example, covalent associations of fusion proteins of the invention are between heterologous polypeptide sequence from another TNF family ligand\/receptor member that is capable of forming covalently associated multimers, such as for example, osteoprotegerin (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 98\/49305, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).

Examples include those peptide linkers described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,627 (hereby incorporated by reference). Proteins comprising multiple B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides separated by peptide linkers may be produced using conventional recombinant DNA technology.","In one embodiment, antibodies of the invention immunospecifically bind a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3228 or as encoded by the cDNA clone contained in ATCC\u2122 No. 97768, or a polypeptide comprising a portion (i.e., a fragment) of the above polypeptides.

Thus, a polypeptide produced by and\/or contained within a recombinant host cell is considered isolated for purposes of the present invention. Also intended as an \u201cisolated polypeptide\u201d are polypeptides that have been purified, partially or substantially, from a recombinant host cell. Thus, antibodies of the present invention may bind recombinantly produced B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides.","Antibodies of the present invention may also bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator expressed on the surface of a cell, wherein said B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide is encoded by a polynucleotide encoding amino acids 1 to 285 of SEQ ID NO:2 operably associated with a regulatory sequence that controls expression of said polynucleotide.

another embodiment, the invention provides antibodies that bind a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an epitope-bearing portion of a polypeptide of the invention. The epitope of this polypeptide portion may be an immunogenic or antigenic epitope of a polypeptide of the invention. An \u201cimmunogenic epitope\u201d is defined as a part of a protein that elicits an antibody response when the whole protein is the immunogen. On the other band, a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind is defined as an \u201cantigenic epitope.\u201d The number of immunogenic epitopes of a protein generally is less than the number of antigenic epitopes. See, for instance, Geysen et al., 81:3998-4002 (1983).","As to the selection of polypeptides bearing an antigenic epitope (i.e., that contain a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind), it is well known in that art that relatively short synthetic peptides that mimic part of a protein sequence are routinely capable of eliciting an antiserum that reacts with the partially mimicked protein. See, for instance, Sutcliffe, J. G., Shinnick, T. M., Green, N. and Learner, R. A. (1983) \u201cAntibodies that react with predetermined sites on proteins\u201d, 219:660-666. Peptides capable of eliciting protein-reactive sera are frequently represented in the primary sequence of a protein, can be characterized by a set of simple chemical rules, and are confined neither to immunodominant regions of intact proteins (i.e., immunogenic epitopes) nor to the amino or carboxyl terminals. Antigenic epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention are therefore useful to raise antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies, that bind specifically to a polypeptide of the invention.

See, e.g., Houghten, R. A. (1985) General method for the rapid solid-phase synthesis of large numbers of peptides: specificity of antigen-antibody interaction at the level of individual amino acids. 82:5131-5135; this \u201cSimultaneous Multiple Peptide Synthesis (SMPS)\u201d process is further described in U.S. Pat.

In a preferred embodiment, the present invention encompasses antibodies that bind a polypeptide comprising an epitope. An \u201cimmunogenic epitope,\u201d as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein that elicits an antibody response in an animal, as determined by any method known in the art, for example, by the methods for generating antibodies described infra. (See, for example, Geysen et al., 81:3998-4002 (1983)). The term \u201cantigenic epitope,\u201d as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein to which an antibody can immunospecifically bind its antigen as determined by any method well known in the art, for example, by the immunoassays described herein. Immunospecific binding excludes non-specific binding but does not necessarily exclude cross-reactivity with other antigens. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.","B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide fragments which function as epitopes may be produced by any conventional means. (See, e.g., Houghten, 82:5131-5135 (1985), further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211).","In the present invention, antibodies of the present invention bind antigenic epitopes preferably containing a sequence of at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, more preferably at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, and, most preferably, between about 15 to about 30 amino acids. Preferred polypeptides comprising immunogenic or antigenic epitopes that may be bound by antibodies of the present invention are at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 amino acid residues in length. Additional non-exclusive preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as portions thereof. Antigenic epitopes are useful, for example, to raise antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies, that specifically bind the epitope. Preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as any combination of two, three, four, five or more of these antigenic epitopes. Antigenic epitopes can be used as the target molecules in immunoassays. (See, for instance, Wilson et al., 37:767-778 (1984); Sutcliffe et al., 219:660-666 (1983)).","Similarly, immunogenic epitopes can be used, for example, to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art. (See, for instance, Sutcliffe et al., supra; Wilson et al., supra; Chow et al., 82:910-914; and Bittle et al., 66:2347-2354 (1985). Preferred immunogenic epitopes include the immunogenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as any combination of two, three, four, five or more of these immunogenic epitopes. The polypeptides comprising one or more immunogenic epitopes of B Lymphocyte Stimulator may be presented for eliciting an antibody response together with a carrier protein, such as an albumin, to an animal system (such as rabbit or mouse), or, if the polypeptide is of sufficient length (at least about 25 amino acids), the polypeptide may be presented without a carrier. However, immunogenic epitopes comprising as few as 8 to 10 amino acids have been shown to be sufficient to raise antibodies capable of binding to, at the very least, linear epitopes in a denatured polypeptide (e.g., in Western blotting).","Epitope-bearing B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides may be used to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art including, but not limited to, in vivo immunization, in vitro immunization, and phage display methods. See, e.g., Sutcliffe et al., supra; Wilson et al., supra, and Bittle et al., 66:2347-2354 (1985). If in vivo immunization is used, animals may be immunized with free peptide; however, anti-peptide antibody titer may be boosted by coupling the peptide to a macromolecular carrier, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or tetanus toxoid. For instance, peptides containing cysteine residues may be coupled to a carrier using a linker such as maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), while other peptides may be coupled to carriers using a more general linking agent such as glutaraldehyde. Animals such as rabbits, rats and mice are immunized with either free or carrier-coupled peptides, for instance, by intraperitoneal and\/or intradermal injection of emulsions containing about 100 micrograms of peptide or carrier protein and Freund's adjuvant or any other adjuvant known for stimulating an immune response. Several booster injections may be needed, for instance, at intervals of about two weeks, to provide a useful titer of anti-peptide antibody which can be detected, for example, by ELISA assay using free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of anti-peptide antibodies in serum from an immunized animal may be increased by selection of anti-peptide antibodies, for instance, by adsorption to the peptide on a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art.","As one of skill in the art will appreciate, and as discussed above, the antibodies of the present invention may bind polypeptides comprising an immunogenic or antigenic epitope fused to other polypeptide sequences. For example, the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides may be fused with the constant domain of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgE, IgG, IgM), or portions thereof (CH1, CH2, CH3, or any combination thereof and portions thereof), or albumin (including but not limited to recombinant human albumin or fragments or variants thereof (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,969, issued Mar. 2, 1999, EP Patent 0 413 622, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,883, issued Jun. 16, 1998, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety)), resulting in chimeric polypeptides. Such fusion proteins may facilitate purification and may increase half-life in vivo. This has been shown for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. See, e.g., EP 394,827; Traunecker et al., 331:84-86 (1988). Enhanced delivery of an antigen across the epithelial barrier to the immune system has been demonstrated for antigens (e.g., insulin) conjugated to an FcRn binding partner such as IgG or Fc fragments (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 96\/22024 and WO 99\/04813). IgG Fusion proteins that have a disulfide-linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion disulfide bonds have also been found to be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than monomeric polypeptides or fragments thereof alone. See, e.g., Fountoulakis et al., 270:3958-3964 (1995). Nucleic acids encoding the above epitopes can also be recombined with a gene of interest as an epitope tag (e.g., the hemagglutinin (\u201cHA\u201d) tag or flag tag) to aid in detection and purification of the expressed polypeptide. For example, a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non-denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines (Janknecht et al., 1991, 88:8972-897). In this system, the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the open reading frame of the gene is translationally fused to an amino-terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. The tag serves as a matrix-binding domain for the fusion protein. Extracts from cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni nitriloacetic acid-agarose column and histidine-tagged proteins can be selectively eluted with imidazole-containing buffers.","In another embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides and\/or the epitope-bearing fragments thereof that are fused with a heterologous antigen (e.g., polypeptide, carbohydrate, phospholipid, or nucleic acid). In specific embodiments, the heterologous antigen is an immunogen.","In a more specific embodiment, the heterologous antigen is the gp120 protein of HIV, or a fragment thereof.","In another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides and\/or the epitope-bearing fragments thereof that are fused with polypeptide sequences of another TNF ligand family member (or biologically active fragments or variants thereof). In a specific embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides of the present invention are fused with a CD40L polypeptide sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the CD40L polypeptide sequence is soluble.","In another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention bind mutant B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides that have been generated by random mutagenesis of a polynucleotide encoding the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide, by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. In another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention bind one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc., of B Lymphocyte Stimulator recombined with one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules. In preferred embodiments, the heterologous molecules are, for example, TNF-alpha, lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha, also known as TNF-beta), LT-beta (found in complex heterotrimer LT-alpha2-beta), OPGL, FasL, CD27L, CD30L, CD40L, 4-1 BBL, DcR3, OX40L, TNF-gamma (International Publication No. WO 96\/14328), AIM-I (International Publication No. WO 97\/33899), AIM-II (International Publication No. WO 97\/34911), APRIL (J. Exp. Med. 188(6):1185-1190), endokine-alpha (International Publication No. WO 98\/07880), OPG, OX40, and nerve growth factor (NGF), and soluble forms of Fas, CD30, CD27, CD40 and 4-IBB, TR2 (International Publication No. WO 96\/34095), DR3 (International Publication No. WO 97\/33904), DR4 (International Publication No. WO 98\/32856), TR5 (International Publication No. WO 98\/30693), TR6 (International Publication No. WO 98\/30694), TR7 (International Publication No. WO 98\/41629), TRANK, TR9 (International Publication No. WO 98\/56892), TR10 (International Publication No. WO 98\/54202), 312C2 (International Publication No. WO 98\/06842), TR12, CAD, and v-FLIP. In further embodiments, the heterologous molecules are any member of the TNF family.","In another preferred embodiment, antibodies of the present invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides of the invention (including biologically active fragments or variants thereof), that are fused with soluble APRIL polypeptides (e.g., amino acid residues 105 through 250 of SEQ ID NO:3239), or biologically active fragments or variants thereof.","To improve or alter the characteristics of B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides, protein engineering may be employed. Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel mutant proteins or muteins including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show, e.g., enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition, they may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide, at least under certain purification and storage conditions. For instance, for many proteins, including the extracellular domain or the mature form(s) of a secreted protein, it is known in the art that one or more amino acids may be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus without substantial loss of biological function. For instance, Ron et al., 268:2984-2988 (1993) reported modified KGF proteins that had heparin binding activity even if 3, 8, or 27 amino-terminal amino acid residues were missing. Accordingly, antibodies of the present invention may bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide mutants or variants generated by protein engineering.","In the present case, since the protein of the invention is a member of the TNF polypeptide family, deletions of N-terminal amino acids up to the Gly (G) residue at position 191 in SEQ ID NO:3228 may retain some biological activity such as, for example, the ability to stimulate lymphocyte (e.g., B cell) proliferation, differentiation, and\/or activation, and cytotoxicity to appropriate target cells. Polypeptides having further N-terminal deletions including the Gly (G) residue would not be expected to retain biological activities because it is known that this residue in TNF-related polypeptides is in the beginning of the conserved domain required for biological activities. However, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities may still be retained. Thus, the ability of the shortened protein to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or extracellular domain of the protein generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or extracellular domain of the protein are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete protein retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides antibodies that bind polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the amino acid sequence of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator of SEQ ID NO:3228, up to the glycine residue at position 191 (Gly-191 residue from the amino terminus). In particular, the present invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of residues n-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228, where nis an integer in the range of the amino acid position of amino acid residues 2-190 of the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO:3228. More in particular, the invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of residues 2-285, 3-285, 4-285, 5-285, 6-285, 7-285, 8-285, 9-285, 10-285, 11-285, 12-285, 13-285, 14-285, 15-285, 16-285, 17-285, 18-285, 19-285, 20-285, 21-285, 22-285, 23-285, 24-285, 25-285, 26-285, 27-285, 28-285, 29-285, 30-285, 31-285, 32-285, 33-285, 34-285, 35-285, 36-285, 37-285, 38-285, 39-285, 40-285, 41-285, 42-285, 43-285, 44-285, 45-285, 46-285, 47-285, 48-285, 49-285, 50-285, 51-285, 52-285, 53-285, 54-285, 55-285, 56-285, 57-285, 58-285, 59-285, 60-285, 61-285, 62-285, 63-285, 64-285, 65-285, 66-285, 67-285, 68-285, 69-285, 70-285, 71-285, 72-285, 73-285, 74-285, 75-285, 76-285, 77-285, 78-285, 79-285, 80-285, 81-285, 82-285, 83-285, 84-285, 85-285, 86-285, 87-285, 88-285, 89-285, 90-285, 91-285, 92-285, 93-285, 94-285, 95-285, 96-285, 97-285, 98-285, 99-285, 100-285, 101-285, 102-285, 103-285, 104-285, 105-285, 106-285, 107-285, 108-285, 109-285, 110-285, 111-285, 112-285, 113-285, 114-285, 115-285, 116-285, 117-285, 118-285, 119-285, 120-285, 121-285, 122-285, 123-285, 124-285, 125-285, 126-285, 127-285, 128-285, 129-285, 130-285, 131-285, 132-285, 133-285, 134-285, 135-285, 136-285, 137-285, 138-285, 139-285, 140-285, 141-285, 142-285, 143-285, 144-285, 145-285, 146-285, 147-285, 148-285, 149-285, 150-285, 151-285, 152-285, 153-285, 154-285, 155-285, 156-285, 157-285, 158-285, 159-285, 160-285, 161-285, 162-285, 163-285, 164-285, 165-285, 166-285, 167-285, 168-285, 169-285, 170-285, 171-285, 172-285, 173-285, 174-285, 175-285, 176-285, 177-285, 178-285, 179-285, 180-285, 181-285, 182-285, 183-285, 184-285, 185-285, 186-285, 187-285, 188-285, 189-285, and 190-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228. The present invention is also directed to antibodies that bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides comprising, or alternatively, consisting of, a contiguous sequence of amino acid residues at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides described above.","Furthermore, since the predicted extracellular domain of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides of the invention may itself elicit biological activity, deletions of N- and C-terminal amino acid residues from the predicted extracellular region of the polypeptide (spanning positions Gln-73 to Leu-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228) may retain some biological activity such as, for example, ligand binding, stimulation of lymphocyte (e.g., B cell) proliferation, differentiation, and\/or activation, and modulation of cell replication or modulation of target cell activities. However, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of the predicted extracellular domain of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the polypeptide, other functional activities may still be retained. Thus, the ability of the shortened polypeptides to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature or extracellular domains of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature or extracellular domains of the polypeptides are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides antibodies that bind polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the amino acid sequence of B Lymphocyte Stimulator shown in SEQ ID NO:3228, up to the glycine residue at position number 280. In particular, the present invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of residues n-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228, where nis an integer in the range of the amino acid position of amino acid residues 73-280 in SEQ ID NO:3228, and 73 is the position of the first residue from the N-terminus of the predicted extracellular domain of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide (disclosed in SEQ ID NO:3228).

More preferred embodiments of the invention are directed to antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide having the amino acid sequence at positions 134-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228. More preferred embodiments of the invention are directed to antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 96% identical to a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide having the amino acid sequence at positions 134-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228.","Additionally, more preferred embodiments of the invention are directed to antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 97% to a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide having the amino acid sequence at positions 134-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228. Additionally, more preferred embodiments of the invention are directed to antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 98% to a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide having the amino acid sequence at positions 134-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228. Additionally, more preferred embodiments of the invention are directed to antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 99% identical to B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide having the amino acid sequence at positions 134-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228.","In specific embodiments, antibodies of the present invention bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, one of the following N-terminally deleted polypeptide fragments of B Lymphocyte Stimulator: amino acid residues Ala-71 through Leu-285, amino acid residues Ala-81 through Leu-285, amino acid residues Leu-112 through Leu-285, amino acid residues Ala-34 through Leu-285, amino acid residues Leu-147 through Leu-285, and amino acid residues Gly-161 through Leu-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228.","Similarly, many examples of biologically functional C-terminal deletion polypeptides are known. For instance, Interferon gamma shows up to ten times higher activities by deleting 8-10 amino acid residues from the carboxy terminus of the protein (D\u00f6beli et al., 7:199-216 (1988). Since the present protein is a member of the TNF polypeptide family, deletions of C-terminal amino acids up to the leucine residue at position 284 are expected to retain most if not all biological activity such as, for example, ligand binding, the ability to stimulate lymphocyte (e.g., B cell) proliferation, differentiation, and\/or activation, and modulation of cell replication. Polypeptides having deletions of up to about 10 additional C-terminal residues (i.e., up to the glycine residue at position 274) also may retain some activity such as receptor binding, although such polypeptides would lack a portion of the conserved TNF domain which extends to about Leu-284 of SEQ ID NO:3228. However, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities may still be retained. Thus, the ability of the shortened protein to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature protein generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature protein are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete protein retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides antibodies that bind polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:3228, up to the glycine residue at position 274 (Gly-274). In particular, the present invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of residues 1-mof the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO:3228, where mis any integer in the range of the amino acid position of amino acid residues 274-284 in SEQ ID NO:3228. More in particular, the invention provides antibodies that bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of residues 1-274, 1-275, 1-276, 1-277, 1-278, 1-279, 1-280, 1-281, 1-282, 1-283 and 1-284 of SEQ ID NO:3228. The present invention is also directed to antibodies that bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides comprising, or alternatively, consisting of, a contiguous sequence of amino acid residues at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides described above.","Also provided are antibodies that bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides with one or more amino acids deleted from both the amino and the carboxyl termini, which may be described generally as having residues n-mof SEQ ID NO:3228, where nand mare integers as defined above. Also included are antibodies that bind a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a portion of the complete B Lymphocyte Stimulator amino acid sequence encoded by the deposited cDNA clone contained in ATCC\u2122 Accession No. 97768 where this portion excludes from 1 to 190 amino acids from the amino terminus or from 1 to 11 amino acids from the C-terminus of the complete amino acid sequence (or any combination of these N-terminal and C-terminal deletions) encoded by the cDNA clone in the deposited plasmid.","Similarly, deletions of C-terminal amino acid residues of the predicted extracellular domain of B Lymphocyte Stimulator up to the leucine residue at position 79 of SEQ ID NO:3228 may retain some biological activity, such as, for example, ligand binding, stimulation of lymphocyte (e.g., B cell) proliferation, differentiation, and\/or activation, and modulation of cell replication or modulation of target cell activities. Polypeptides having further C-terminal deletions including Leu-79 of SEQ ID NO:3228 would not be expected to retain biological activities.","However, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a polypeptide results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the polypeptide, other functional activities may still be retained. Thus, the ability of the shortened polypeptide to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete, mature or extracellular forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete, mature or extracellular forms of the polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of the predicted extracellular domain retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides antibodies that bind polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the predicted extracellular domain of B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:3228, up to the leucine residue at position 79 of SEQ ID NO:3228. In particular, the present invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of residues 73-mof the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO:3228, where mis any integer in the range of the amino acid position of amino acid residues 79 to 285 in the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO:3228, and residue 78 is the position of the first residue at the C-terminus of the predicted extracellular domain of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide (disclosed in SEQ ID NO:3228).

The present invention is also directed to antibodies that bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides comprising, or alternatively, consisting of, a contiguous sequence of amino acid residues at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides described above.","The invention also provides polypeptides having one or more amino acids deleted from both the amino and the carboxyl termini of the predicted extracellular domain of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, which may be described generally as having residues n-mof SEQ ID NO:3229 where nand mare integers as defined above.","In another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention bind polypeptides consisting of a portion of the extracellular domain of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA clone contained in the deposit having ATCC\u2122 Accession No. 203518, where this portion excludes from 1 to about 260 amino acids from the amino terminus of the extracellular domain of the amino acid sequence encoded by cDNA clone contained in the deposit having ATCC\u2122 Accession No. 203518, or from 1 to about 187 amino acids from the carboxy terminus of the extracellular domain of the amino acid sequence encoded by cDNA clone contained in the deposit having ATCC\u2122 Accession No. 203518, or any combination of the above amino terminal and carboxy terminal deletions, of the entire extracellular domain of the amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA clone contained in the deposit having ATCC\u2122 Accession No. 203518.","As mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a polypeptide results in modification or loss of one or more functional activities (e.g., biological activity) of the polypeptide, other functional activities may still be retained. Thus, the ability of a shortened B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the full-length or mature forms or the extracellular domain of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the full-length or mature or extracellular domain of the polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a B Lymphocyte Stimulator mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain functional (e.g., immunogenic) activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six B Lymphocyte Stimulator amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides antibodies that bind polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the predicted full-length amino acid sequence of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:3229, up to the glycine residue at position number 261 of the sequence shown SEQ ID NO:3229 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides.

Thus, the ability of a shortened B Lymphocyte Stimulator mutein to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature form or the extracellular domain of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature form or the extracellular domain of the polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a B Lymphocyte Stimulator mutein with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some functional (e.g., immunogenic) activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six B Lymphocyte Stimulator amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides in another embodiment, antibodies that bind polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator shown in SEQ ID NO:3229, up to the glutamic acid residue at position number 6, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides.

The present invention is also directed to antibodies that bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides comprising, or alternatively, consisting of, a contiguous sequence of amino acid residues at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides described above.","It will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that some amino acid sequences of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides can be varied without significant effect of the structure or function of the polypeptide. If such differences in sequence are contemplated, it should be remembered that there will be critical areas on the polypeptide which determine activity.","Thus, the invention further includes antibodies that bind variations of B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides which show B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide functional activity (e.g., biological activity) or which include regions of B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide such as the polypeptide fragments described herein. Such mutants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and type substitutions selected according to general rules known in the art so as have little effect on activity. For example, guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in Bowie, J. U. et al., \u201cDeciphering the Message in Protein Sequences: Tolerance to Amino Acid Substitutions,\u201d 247:1306-1310 (1990), wherein the authors indicate that there are two main approaches for studying the tolerance of an amino acid sequence to change. The first method relies on the process of evolution, in which mutations are either accepted or rejected by natural selection. The second approach uses genetic engineering to introduce amino acid changes at specific positions of a cloned gene and selections or screens to identify sequences that maintain functionality.","As the authors state, these studies have revealed that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions. The authors further indicate which amino acid changes are likely to be permissive at a certain position of the protein. For example, most buried amino acid residues require nonpolar side chains, whereas few features of surface side chains are generally conserved. Other such phenotypically silent substitutions are described in Bowie, J. U. et al., supra, and the references cited therein. Typically seen as conservative substitutions are the replacements, one for another, among the aliphatic amino acids Ala, Val, Leu and He; interchange of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr, exchange of the acidic residues Asp and Glu, substitution between the amide residues Asn and Gln, exchange of the basic residues Lys and Arg and replacements among the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr.","Thus, antibodies of the present invention may bind fragments, derivatives or analogs of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:3228, or that encoded by the deposited cDNA plasmid, such as (i) polypeptides in which one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino acid residue) and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) polypeptides in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group, or (iii) polypeptides in which the extracellular domain of the polypeptide is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or (iv) polypeptides in which the additional amino acids are fused to the extracellular domain of the polypeptide, such as an IgG Fc fusion region peptide or leader or secretory sequence or a sequence which is employed for purification of the extracellular domain of the polypeptide or a proprotein sequence.","Antibodies of the present invention may bind fragments, derivatives or analogs of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:3229, or that encoded by the deposited cDNA plasmid, such as (i) polypeptides in which one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino acid residue) and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) polypeptides in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group, or (iii) polypeptides in which the extracellular domain of the polypeptide is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or (iv) polypeptides in which the additional amino acids are fused to the extracellular domain of the polypeptide, such as, a soluble biologically active fragment of another TNF ligand family member (e.g., CD40 Ligand), an IgG Fc fusion region peptide or leader or secretory sequence or a sequence which is employed for purification of the extracellular domain of the polypeptide or a proprotein sequence. Such fragments, derivatives and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.","Thus, the antibodies of the invention may bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides that include one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions, either from natural mutations or human manipulation. As indicated, changes are preferably of a minor nature, such as conservative amino acid substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein (see Table 13).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0167","num":"0166"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 13"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Conservative Amino Acid Substitutions."},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Aromatic","Phenylalanine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Tryptophan"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Tyrosine"]},{"entry":[{},"Hydrophobic","Leucine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Isoleucine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Valine"]},{"entry":[{},"Polar","Glutamine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Asparagine"]},{"entry":[{},"Basic","Arginine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Lysine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Histidine"]},{"entry":[{},"Acidic","Aspartic Acid"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Glutamic Acid"]},{"entry":[{},"Small","Alanine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Serine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Threonine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Methionine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Glycine"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In one embodiment of the invention, antibodies of the present invention bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide having an amino acid sequence which contains at least one conservative amino acid substitution, but not more than 50 conservative amino acid substitutions, even more preferably, not more than 40 conservative amino acid substitutions, still more preferably, not more than 30 conservative amino acid substitutions, and still even more preferably, not more than 20 conservative amino acid substitutions.

Antibodies of the present invention may bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator amino acid sequences containing conservative substitution mutations of the polypeptide of any one of SEQ ID NOS:3230-3237.","Amino acids in the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides that are essential for function can be identified by methods known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, 244:1081-1085 (1989)). The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for functional activity, such ligand binding and the ability to stimulate lymphocyte (e.g., B cell) as, for example, proliferation, differentiation, and\/or activation. Accordingly, antibodies of the present invention may bind amino acids in the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides that are essential for function. In preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention bind amino acids in the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides that are essential for function and inhibit B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide function. In other preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention bind amino acids in the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides that are essential for function and enhance B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide function.","Of special interest are substitutions of charged amino acids with other charged or neutral amino acids which may produce proteins with highly desirable improved characteristics, such as less aggregation. Aggregation may not only reduce activity but also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations, because aggregates can be immunogenic (Pinckard et al., 2:331-340 (1967); Robbins et al., Diabetes 36: 838-845 (1987); Cleland et al., 10:307-377 (1993).","In another embodiment, the invention provides for antibodies that bind polypeptides having amino acid sequences containing non-conservative substitutions of the amino acid sequence provided in SEQ ID NO:3228.

Antibodies of the present invention may bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator amino acid sequences containing non-conservative substitution mutations of the polypeptide of any one of SEQ ID NOS:3230-3237.","In an additional embodiment, antibodies of the present invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a B Lymphocyte Stimulator amino acid sequence in which more than one amino acid (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 50) is replaced with the substituted amino acids as described above (either conservative or nonconservative).","Replacement of amino acids can also change the selectivity of the binding of a ligand to cell surface receptors. For example, Ostade et al., 361:266-268 (1993) describes certain mutations resulting in selective binding of TNF-alpha to only one of the two known types of TNF receptors. Since B Lymphocyte Stimulator is a member of the TNF polypeptide family, mutations similar to those in TNF-alpha are likely to have similar effects in B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides.","Sites that are critical for ligand-receptor binding can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallization, nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling (Smith et al., 224:899-904 (1992) and de Vos et al. 255:306-312 (1992)).","Since B Lymphocyte Stimulator is a member of the TNF-related protein family, mutations may be made in sequences encoding amino acids in the TNF conserved domain, e.g., in positions Gly-191 through Leu-284 of SEQ ID NO:3228 or in positions Gly-172 through Leu-265 of SEQ ID NO:3229, may modulate rather than completely eliminate functional activities (e.g., biological activities) of B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof. Accordingly, antibodies of the present invention may bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides that have mutations in the TNF conserved domain. In preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention may bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides that have mutations in the TNF conserved domain and act as antagonists of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In other preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention may bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides that have mutations in the TNF conserved domain and act as agonists of B Lymphocyte Stimulator.","Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art (see, for instance, DNA shuffling supra) can be used to create novel mutant proteins or muteins including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show, e.g., enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition, they may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide, at least under certain purification and storage conditions.","Thus, the invention also encompasses antibodies that bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator derivatives and analogs that have one or more amino acid residues deleted, added, or substituted to generate B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides, e.g., that are better suited for expression, scale up, etc., in the host cells. For example, cysteine residues can be deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue in order to eliminate disulfide bridges; N-linked glycosylation sites can be altered or eliminated to achieve, for example, expression of a homogeneous product that is more easily recovered and purified from yeast hosts which are known to hyperglycosylate N-linked sites. To this end, a variety of amino acid substitutions at one or both of the first or third amino acid positions on any one or more of the glycosylation recognition sequences in the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides of the invention, and\/or an amino acid deletion at the second position of any one or more such recognition sequences will prevent glycosylation of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator at the modified tripeptide sequence (see, e.g., Miyajimo et al., EMBO J 5(6):1193-1197). By way of non-limiting example, mutation of the serine at position 244 to alanine either singly or in combination with mutation of the asparagine at position 242 to glutamine abolishes glycosylation of the mature soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., amino acids 134-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228) when expressed in the yeast . A mutant B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide in which only the asparagine at position 242 is mutated to glutamine, is still glycosylated when expressed in . In this mutant, the glycosylation event may be due to the activation or unmasking of an O-linked glycosylation site at serine 244. Similar mutations affecting glycosylation could also be made in the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:3229, i.e., aspargine-223 to glutamine and\/or serine-224 to alanine of SEQ ID NO:3229. Additionally, one or more of the amino acid residues of the polypeptides of the invention (e.g., arginine and lysine residues) may be deleted or substituted with another residue to eliminate undesired processing by proteases such as, for example, furins or kexins. One possible result of such a mutation is that B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide of the invention is not cleaved and released from the cell surface. Accordingly, antibodies of the invention may bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator derivatives and analogs that have one or more amino acid residues deleted, added, or substituted. In other embodiments, antibodies of the invention may bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator derivatives, variants or analogs that are unable to be cleaved from the cell surface.","In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides in which Lys-132 and\/or Arg-133 of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:3228 is mutated to another amino acid residue, or deleted altogether, to prevent or diminish release of the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator from cells expressing B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In a more specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides in which Lys-132 of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:3228 is mutated to Ala-132. In another, nonexclusive specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides in which Arg-133 of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:3228 is mutated to Ala-133. These mutated proteins have uses such as, for example, in ex vivo therapy or gene therapy, to engineer cells expressing a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide that is retained on the surface of the engineered cells.","In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides in which Cys-146 of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:3228 is mutated to another amino acid residue, or deleted altogether, for example, to aid preventing or diminishing oligomerization of the mutant B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide when expressed in an expression system. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides in which Cys-146 is replaced with a serine amino acid residue.","In another specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides in which Cys-232 of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:3228 is mutated to another amino acid residue, or deleted altogether, for example, to aid preventing or diminishing oligomerization of the mutant B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide when expressed in an expression system. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides in which Cys-232 is replaced with a serine amino acid residue. Polypeptides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","In yet another specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides in which Cys-245 of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:3228 is mutated to another amino acid residue, or deleted altogether, for example, to aid preventing or diminishing oligomerization of the mutant B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide when expressed in an expression system. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides in which Cys-245 is replaced with a serine amino acid residue. Polypeptides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","The polypeptides of the present invention are preferably provided in an isolated form, and preferably are substantially purified.

Bestfit uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Advances in Applied Mathematics 2:482489, 1981) to find the best segment of similarity between two sequences.","By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% \u201cidentical\u201d to a reference amino acid sequence of a B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide is intended that the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the reference amino acid of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a reference amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another amino acid, or a number of amino acids up to 5% of the total amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.","As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for instance, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3228, the amino acid sequence encoded by the deposited cDNA clone HNEDU15 (ATCC\u2122 Accession No. 97768), or fragments thereof, or, for instance, to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3229, the amino acid sequence encoded by the deposited cDNA clone HDPMC52 (ATCC\u2122 Accession No. 203518), or fragments thereof, can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such the Bestfit program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711). When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for instance, 95% identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention, the parameters are set, of course, such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference amino acid sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence are allowed.","In a specific embodiment, the identity between a reference (query) sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, is determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. 6:237-245 (1990)). Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are: Matrix=PAM 0, k-tuple=2, Mismatch Penalty=1, Joining Penalty=20, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=1, Window Size=sequence length, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty=0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is shorter. According to this embodiment, if the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction is made to the results to take into consideration the fact that the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N- and -C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. A determination of whether a residue is matched\/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of this embodiment. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence. For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching\/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C-termini not matched\/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the subject sequence which are not matched\/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are made for the purposes of this embodiment.","Antibodies that Immunospecifically Bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator Polypeptides","The present invention also encompasses antibodies (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides, which antibodies comprise, or alternatively consist of, all or a portion of a heavy and\/or light chain variable domain of the scFvs referred to in Table 1.","The present invention also encompasses methods and compositions for detecting, diagnosing and\/or prognosing diseases or disorders associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression or inappropriate B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor function in an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, comprising using antibodies (including molecules which comprise, or alternatively consist of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator.

Furthermore, other scFvs that immunospecifically bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator may be generated using phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In particular, DNA sequences encoding VH and VL domains are amplified from animal cDNA libraries (e.g., human or murine cDNA libraries of lymphoid tissues) or synthetic cDNA libraries. The DNA encoding the VH and VL domains are joined together by an scFv linker by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector (e.g. p CANTAB 6 or pComb 3 HSS). The vector is electroporated in and the is infected with helper phage. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 and the VH and VL domains are usually recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII. Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds to an antigen of interest (i.e., B Lymphocyte Stimulator or a fragment thereof) can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in Brinkman et al., J. Immunol.

Thus in one embodiment, the present invention provides for a method of selecting phage that express scFvs that immunospecifically bind both B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides and APRIL polypeptides, comprising at least one round of phage selection for binding to B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide and at least one round of phage selection for binding to APRIL polypeptide. Selection for B Lymphocyte Stimulator binding may either precede or follow selection for APRIL binding. More than one round of selection for binding to either B Lymphocyte Stimulator or APRIL may be conducted.","ScFvs that immunospecifically bind to a heterotrimer comprising at least one B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide and at least one APRIL polypeptide may be, for example, obtained by sequential rounds of selection for binding to one or the other of B Lymphocyte Stimulator and APRIL polypeptide. Thus in one embodiment, the present invention provides for a method of selecting phage that express scFvs that immunospecifically bind a heterotrimer comprising at least one B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide and at least one APRIL polypeptide, comprising at least one round of phage selection for binding to B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide and at least one round of phage selection for binding to APRIL polypeptide. Selection for B Lymphocyte Stimulator binding may either precede or follow selection for APRIL binding. More than one round of selection for binding to either B Lymphocyte Stimulator or APRIL may be conducted.","Alternatively, scFvs that immunospecifically bind to a heterotrimer comprising at least one B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide and at least one APRIL polypeptide may be obtained, for example, by selecting scFVs that bind to a B Lymphocyte Stimulator heterotrimer. A B Lymphocyte Stimulator heterotrimer may contain, for example, one B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide and two APRIL polypeptides (2B Lymphocyte Stimulator: 1APRIL heterotrimer). Other B Lymphocyte Stimulator heterotrimers may contain, for example, one B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide and two APRIL polypeptides (1B Lymphocyte Stimulator:2APRIL heterotrimer). Preferably, the heterotrimers comprising B Lymphocyte Stimulator and APRIL polypeptides contain the mature forms of both the B Lymphocyte Stimulator and APRIL polypeptides. ScFvs may be selected in one or more rounds of selection for binding only to the 2B Lymphocyte Stimulator:1APRIL heterotrimer, or only to the 1B Lymphocyte Stimulator:2APRIL heterotrimer. Alternatively, scFVs that immunospecifically bind heterotrimers comprising B Lymphocyte Stimulator and APRIL polypeptides may be obtained through sequential rounds of screening on individual forms of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator\/APRIL heterotrimer in any order and\/or on both forms of the heterotrimer simultaneously, or any combination thereof.","As described in the above references, after phage selection, the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies, including human antibodies, or any other desired antigen binding fragment, and expressed in any desired host, including mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, yeast, and bacteria, e.g., as described below. Techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab\u2032 and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO 92\/22324; Mullinax et al., BioTechniques 12(6):864-869 (1992); Sawai et al., AJRI 34:26-34 (1995); and Better et al., Science 240:1041-1043 (1988) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties).","The characteristics of an antibody, such as its on-rate, off-rate and\/or overall affinity may be altered using in vitro mutation and selection techniques. This process is well known in the art and is commonly referred to as in vitro affinity maturation of antibodies. Starting with a given antibody that binds a particular antigen with a certain affinity, one of skill in the art can engineer variants of that antibody and test the antibody variants for altered (usually improved) antigen binding characteristics. The amino acid sequence of the VH and VL regions of such antibody variants may be substantially from that of the starting or original antibody; for example, the an antibody variants may comprise the original VH or VL paired with a different (from the original) VL or VH region, respectively. Alternatively, the amino acid sequence of the VH and VL region of such antibody variants may be quite similar to that of the starting or original antibody; for example, an antibody variant may have only a few amino acid changes in the VH and\/or VL region. It is common for one to engineer the mutations in CDR regions, and particularly in the VHCDR3 region. Examples of both types of in vitro antibody affinity maturation are described for example, Thompson et al., (1996) The Journal of Molecular Biology 256:77-88. Moreover, a review of phage display antibody technology may be found in Vaughan et al., (1998) Nature Biotechnology 16:535-539; both of these articles are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. The scFvs of SEQ ID NOS:10-37 are CDR3 mutants derived from the scFv of SEQ ID NO:9 and scFvs of SEQ ID NOS:291-327 are CDR3 mutants derived from the scFv of SEQ ID NO:2.","To generate whole antibodies, PCR primers including VH or VL nucleotide sequences, a restriction site, and a flanking sequence to protect the restriction site can be used to amplify the VH or VL sequences in scFv clones. Utilizing cloning techniques known to those of skill in the art, the PCR amplified VH domains can be cloned into vectors expressing a VH constant region, e.g., the human gamma 4 constant region, and the PCR amplified VL domains can be cloned into vectors expressing a VL constant region, e.g., human kappa or lambda constant regions. Preferably, the vectors for expressing the VH or VL domains comprise a promoter suitable to direct expression of the heavy and light chains in the chosen expression system, a secretion signal, a cloning site for the immunoglobulin variable domain, immunoglobulin constant domains, and a selection marker such as neomycin. The VH and VL domains may also be cloned into one vector expressing the necessary constant regions. The heavy chain conversion vectors and light chain conversion vectors are then co-transfected into cell lines to generate stable or transient cell lines that express full-length antibodies, e.g., IgG, using techniques known to those of skill in the art.","Cell lines that express antibodies that comprise the VH and VL domains of scFvs of the invention have been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (\u201cATCC\u2122\u201d) on the dates listed in Table 2 and given the ATCC\u2122 Deposit Numbers identified in Table 2.

Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO 98\/46645, WO 98\/50433, WO 98\/24893, WO98\/16654, WO 96\/34096, WO 96\/33735, and WO 91\/10741; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the present invention comprise one or more VH and VL domains corresponding to the human scFvs of the invention and framework regions from another immunoglobulin molecule, preferably a human immunoglobulin molecule. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the present invention comprise one or more CDRs corresponding to the human scFvs of the invention and framework regions from another immunoglobulin molecule, preferably a human immunoglobulin molecule. In other embodiments, an antibody of the present invention comprises one, two, three, four, five, six or more VL CDRs or VH CDRs corresponding to one or more of the human scFvs referred to in Table 1, or fragments or variants thereof, and framework regions (and, optionally CDRs not derived from the scFvs in Table 1) from a human immunoglobulin molecule. In a preferred embodiment, an antibody of the present invention comprises a VH CDR3, VL CDR3, or both, corresponding to the same scFv, or different scFvs referred to in Table 1, or fragments or variants thereof, and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin.","A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a human antibody and a non-human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Gillies et al., J. Immunol. Methods 125:191-202 (1989); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Chimeric antibodies comprising one or more CDRs from human species and framework regions from a non-human immunoglobulin molecule (e.g., framework regions from a canine or feline immunoglobulin molecule) can be produced using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91\/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, Molecular Immunology 28(4\/5):489498 (1991); Studnicka et al., Protein Engineering 7(6):805-814 (1994); Roguska et al., PNAS 91:969-973 (1994)), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332). In a preferred embodiment, chimeric antibodies comprise a human CDR3 having an amino acid sequence of any one of the VH CDR3s or VL CDR3s referred to in Table 1, or a variant thereof, and non-human framework regions or human framework regions different from those of the frameworks in the corresponding scFv disclosed in Table 1. Often, framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.)","Further, the antibodies of the invention can, in turn, be utilized to generate anti-idiotype antibodies that \u201cmimic\u201d B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. (See, e.g., Greenspan & Bona, FASEB J. 7(5):437-444 (1993); and Nissinoff, J. Immunol. 147(8):2429-2438 (1991)). For example, antibodies of the invention which bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator and competitively inhibit the binding of B Lymphocyte Stimulator to its receptor (as determined by assays well known in the art such as, for example, that disclosed, infra) can be used to generate antiidiotypes that \u201cmimic\u201d a B Lymphocyte Stimulator ligand\/receptor-binding domain and, as a consequence, bind to and neutralize B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptors (e.g., TACI\u2014GenBank accession number AAC51790; BCMA\u2014GenBank accession number NP001183; and\/or BAFF-R\u2014GenBank accession number NP443177). Such neutralizing anti-idiotypes (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants, such as Fab fragments of such anti-idiotypes) can be used in therapeutic regimens to neutralize B Lymphocyte Stimulator. For example, such anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator ligands\/receptors, and thereby block B Lymphocyte Stimulator mediated biological activity. Alternatively, anti-idiotypes that \u201cmimic\u201d a B Lymphocyte Stimulator binding domain may bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor(s) and induce B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor mediated signalling (e.g., activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), and\/or AP-1). Such agonistic anti-idiotypes (including agonistic Fab fragments of these anti-idiotypes) can be used in therapeutic regimens to induce or enhance B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor mediated signalling. For example, such anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator ligands\/receptors, and thereby stimulate B Lymphocyte Stimulator mediated biological activity (e.g., B cell proliferation and\/or immunoglobulin production).","Once an antibody molecule of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) has been chemically synthesized or recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, or more generally, a protein molecule, such as, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Further, the antibodies of the present invention may be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art, to facilitate purification.","Polynucleotides Encoding an Antibody","The invention provides polynucleotides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof). The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under high stringency, or alternatively, under intermediate or lower stringency hybridization conditions, e.g., as defined supra, to polynucleotides complementary to nucleic acids having a polynucleotide sequence that encodes an antibody of the invention or a fragment or variant thereof.","The polynucleotides may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art. Since the amino acid sequences of the scFv antibodies and VH domains, VL domains and CDRs thereof, are known (as described in Table 1), nucleotide sequences encoding these antibodies can be determined using methods well known in the art, i.e., the nucleotide codons known to encode the particular amino acids are assembled in such a way to generate a nucleic acid that encodes the antibody, of the invention. Such a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (e.g., as described in Kutmeier et al., BioTechniques 17:242 (1994)), which, briefly, involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.","Alternatively, a polynucleotide encoding an antibody (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known, a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library, or a cDNA library generated from, or nucleic acid, preferably poly A+ RNA, isolated from, any tissue or cells expressing the antibody, such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of the invention) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify, e.g., a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.","Once the nucleotide sequence of the antibody (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) is determined, the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1990, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY, which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example to create amino acid substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions.","In a specific embodiment, one or more of the VH and VL domains referred to in Table 1, or fragments or variants thereof, is inserted within framework regions using recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. In a specific embodiment, one, two, three, four, five, six, or more of the CDRs referred to in Table 1, or fragments or variants thereof, is inserted within framework regions using recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions, and preferably human framework regions (see, e.g., Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 278: 457479 (1998) for a listing of human framework regions, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Preferably, the polynucleotides generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encode an antibody (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that specifically binds to B Lymphocyte Stimulator. Preferably, as discussed supra, polynucleotides encoding variants of antibodies or antibody fragments having one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions, and, preferably, the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally, such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules, or antibody fragments or variants, lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and fall within the ordinary skill of the art.","Recombinant Expression of an Antibody","Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention (including scFvs and other molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof (e.g., a heavy or light chain of an antibody of the invention or a portion thereof or a single chain antibody of the invention)), requires construction of an expression vector(s) containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule (e.g., a whole antibody, a heavy or light chain of an antibody, or portion thereof (preferably, but not necessarily, containing the heavy or light chain variable domain)), of the invention has been obtained, the vector(s) for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus, methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention, thus, provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention (e.g., a whole antibody, a heavy or light chain of an antibody, a heavy or light chain variable domain of an antibody, or a portion thereof, or a heavy or light chain CDR, a single chain Fv, or fragments or variants thereof), operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., PCT Publication WO 86\/05807; PCT Publication WO 89\/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464, the contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy chain, the entire light chain, or both the entire heavy and light chains.","The expression vector(s) is(are) transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus, the invention includes host cells containing polynucleotide(s) encoding an antibody of the invention (e.g., whole antibody, a heavy or light chain thereof, or portion thereof, or a single chain antibody of the invention, or a fragment or variant thereof), operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments, for the expression of entire antibody molecules, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below.","A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; yeast (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing antibody coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing antibody coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 3T3 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter). Preferably, bacterial cells such as , and more preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule, are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking et al., Gene 45:101 (1986); Cockett et al., Bio\/Technology 8:2 (1990)).","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited to, the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., EMBO 1. 2:1791 (1983)), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pfN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, Nucleic Acids Res. 13:3101-3109 (1985); Van Heeke & Schuster, J. Biol. Chem. 24:5503-5509 (1989)); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione 5-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) may be used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. Antibody coding sequences may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example, the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example, the polyhedrin promoter).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts (e.g., see Logan & Shenk, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 8 1:355-359 (1984)). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see, e.g., Bittner et al., Methods in Enzymol. 153:51-544 (1987)).","In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include, but are not limited to, CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, NSO, MDCK, 293, 3T3, W138, and in particular, breast cancer cell lines such as, for example, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, and normal mammary gland cell line such as, for example, CRL7O3O and HsS78Bst.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compositions that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.","A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., Cell 11:223 (1977)), hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:202 (1992)), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., Cell 22:8 17 (1980)) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:357 (1980); O'Hare et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1527 (1981)); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:2072 (1981)); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Clinical Pharmacy 12:488-505; Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87-95 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573-596 (1993); Mulligan, Science 260:926-932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62: 191-217 (1993); TIB TECH 11(5):155-2 15 (May, 1993)); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., Gene 30:147 (1984)). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone, and such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel et al.

(Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the coding sequence of the antibody, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:257 (1983)).","The host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes, and is capable of expressing, both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain is preferably placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, Nature 322:52 (1986); Kohler, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:2 197 (1980)). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.","Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been produced by recombinant expression, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, or more generally, for purification of a protein, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Further, the antibodies of the present invention may be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification.","Antibodies of the present invention include naturally purified products, products of chemical synthetic procedures, and products produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the antibodies of the present invention may be glycosylated or may be non-glycosylated. In addition, antibodies of the invention may also include an initial modified methionine residue, in some cases as a result of host-mediated processes.","Antibodies of the invention can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art (e.g., see Creighton, 1983, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Principles, W. H. Freeman & Co., N.Y. and Hunkapiller, M., et al., 1984, Nature 310:105-111). For example, a peptide corresponding to a fragment of an antibody of the invention can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore, if desired, nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the antibody polypeptide sequence. Non-classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, to the D-isomers of the common amino acids, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, a-amino isobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, g-Abu, e-Ahx, 6-amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2-amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, omithine, norleucine, norvaline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, homocitrulline, cysteic acid, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine, b-alanine, fluoro-amino acids, designer amino acids such as b-methyl amino acids, Ca-methyl amino acids, Na-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore, the amino acid can be D (dextrorotary) or L (levorotary).","The invention encompasses antibodies which are differentially modified during or after translation, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including but not limited, to specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide, trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, V8 protease, NaBH, acetylation, formylation, oxidation, reduction, metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin, etc.","Additional post-translational modifications encompassed by the invention include, for example, e.g., N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, processing of N-termini or C-termini ends), attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone, chemical modifications of N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, and addition or deletion of an N-termini methionine residue as a result of procaryotic host cell expression. The polypeptides may also be modified with a detectable label, such as an enzymatic, fluorescent, radioisotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the antibody.","Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, glucose oxidase or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin\/biotin and avidin\/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include biotin, umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; and examples of suitable radioactive material include a radioactive metal ion, e.g., alpha-emitters such as, for example, Bi, or other radioisotopes such as, for example, iodine (I, I, I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In, In, In, In), and technetium (Tc, Tc), thallium (Ti), gallium (Ga, Ga), palladium (Pd), molybdenum (Mo), xenon (Xe), fluorine (F), Sm, Lu, Gd, Pm, La, Yb, Ho, Y, Sc, Re, Re, pr, Rh, Ru, Ge, Co, Zn, Sr, P, Gd, Yb, Cr, Mn, Se, Sn, and Tin.","In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention may be labeled with Europium. For example, antibodies of the invention may be labelled with Europium using the DELFIA Eu-labeling kit (catalog#1244-302, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, Mass.) following manufacturer's instructions.","In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention are attached to macrocyclic chelators useful for conjugating radiometal ions, including but not limited to, In, Lu, Y, Ho, and Sm, to antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, the radiometal ion associated with the macrocyclic chelators attached to antibodies of the invention is In. In another preferred embodiment, the radiometal ion associated with the macrocyclic chelator attached to antibodies of the invention is Y, In specific embodiments, the macrocyclic chelator is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N\u2032,N\u2033,N\u2033\u2032-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). In specific embodiments, the macrocyclic chelator is \u03b1-(5-isothiocyanato-2-methoxyphenyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraaza-cyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid. In other specific embodiments, the DOTA is attached to the antibody of the invention via a linker molecule. Examples of linker molecules useful for conjugating DOTA to an antibody are commonly known in the art\u2014see, for example, DeNardo et al., Clin Cancer Res. 4(10):2483-90, 1998; Peterson et al., Bioconjug. Chem. 10(4):553-7, 1999; and Zimmerman et al, Nucl. Med. Biol. 26(8):943-50, 1999 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In addition, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,652,361 and 5,756,065, which disclose chelating agents that may be conjugated to antibodies, and methods for making and using them, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","In one embodiment, antibodies of the invention are labeled with biotin. In other related embodiments, biotinylated antibodies of the invention may be used, for example, as an imaging agent or as a means of identifying one or more B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor(s) or other coreceptor or ligand molecules.","Also provided by the invention are chemically modified derivatives of antibodies of the invention which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility, stability and in vivo or in vitro circulating time of the polypeptide, or decreased immunogenicity (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337). The chemical moieties for derivitization may be selected from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, ethylene glycol\/propylene glycol copolymers, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The polypeptides may be modified at random positions within the molecule, or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one, two, three or more attached chemical moieties.","The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. For polyethylene glycol, the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa (the term \u201cabout\u201d indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight) for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used, depending on the desired therapeutic profile (e.g., the duration of sustained release desired, the effects, if any on biological activity, the ease in handling, the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a therapeutic protein or analog). For example, the polyethylene glycol may have an average molecular weight of about 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10,000, 10,500, 11,000, 11,500, 12,000, 12,500, 13,000, 13,500, 14,000, 14,500, 15,000, 15,500, 16,000, 16,500, 17,000, 17,500, 18,000, 18,500, 19,000, 19,500, 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, 35,000,40,000, 50,000, 55,000, 60,000, 65,000, 70,000, 75,000, 80,000, 85,000, 90,000, 95,000, or 100,000 kDa.","As noted above, the polyethylene glycol may have a branched structure. Branched polyethylene glycols are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,575; Morpurgo et al., 56:59-72 (1996); Vorobjev et al., 18:2745-2750(1999); and Caliceti et al., 10:638-646 (1999), the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The polyethylene glycol molecules (or other chemical moieties) should be attached to the protein with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the antibody. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art, e.g., EP 0 401 384, herein incorporated by reference (coupling PEG to G-CSF), see also Malik et al., Exp. Hematol. 20:1028-1035 (1992) (reporting pegylation of GM-CSF using tresyl chloride). For example, polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via a reactive group, such as, a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include, for example, lysine residues and the N-termini amino acid residues; those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues, glutamic acid residues, and the C-termini amino acid residue. Sulfhydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Preferred for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group, such as attachment at the N-terminus or lysine group.","As suggested above, polyethylene glycol may be attached to proteins, e.g., antibodies, via linkage to any of a number of amino acid residues. For example, polyethylene glycol can be linked to a proteins via covalent bonds to lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine residues. One or more reaction chemistries may be employed to attach polyethylene glycol to specific amino acid residues (e.g., lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine) of the antibody or to more than one type of amino acid residue (e.g., lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine and combinations thereof) of the antibody.","One may specifically desire antibodies chemically modified at the N-terminus of either the heavy chain or the light chain or both. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration, one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules (by molecular weight, branching, etc.), the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein (or peptide) molecules in the reaction mix, the type of pegylation reaction to be performed, and the method of obtaining the selected N-terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N-terminally pegylated preparation (i.e., separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary) may be by purification of the N-terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective chemical modification at the N-terminus may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups (lysine versus the N-terminal) available for derivatization in a particular antibody, e.g., a heavy chain or alight chain. Under the appropriate reaction conditions, substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N-terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.","As indicated above, pegylation of the proteins of the invention may be accomplished by any number of means. For example, polyethylene glycol may be attached to the protein either directly or by an intervening linker. Linkerless systems for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in Delgado et al., 9:249-304 (1992); Francis et al., 68:1-18 (1998); U.S. Pat. No. 4,002,531; U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,052; WO 95\/06058; and WO 98\/32466, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.","One system for attaching polyethylene glycol directly to amino acid residues of proteins without an intervening linker employs tresylated MPEG, which is produced by the modification of monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (MPEG) using tresylchloride (ClSOCHCF). Upon reaction of antibody with tresylated MPEG, polyethylene glycol is directly attached to amine groups of the antibody. Thus, the invention includes antibody-polyethylene glycol conjugates produced by reacting proteins of the invention with a polyethylene glycol molecule having a 2,2,2-trifluoroethane sulphonyl group.","Polyethylene glycol can also be attached to antibodies using a number of different intervening linkers. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,460, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses urethane linkers for connecting polyethylene glycol to proteins. Protein-polyethylene glycol conjugates wherein the polyethylene glycol is attached to the antibody by a linker can also be produced by reaction of antibodies with compounds such as MPEG-succinimidylsuccinate, MPEG activated with 1,1\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole, MPEG-2,4,5-trichloropenylcarbonate, MPEG-p-nitrophenolcarbonate, and various MPEG-succinate derivatives. A number additional polyethylene glycol derivatives and reaction chemistries for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in WO 98\/32466, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Pegylated protein products produced using the reaction chemistries set out herein are included within the scope of the invention.","The number of polyethylene glycol moieties attached to each antibody of the invention (i.e., the degree of substitution) may also vary. For example, the pegylated antibodies of the invention may be linked, on average, to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, or more polyethylene glycol molecules. Similarly, the average degree of substitution within ranges such as 1-3, 2-4, 3-5, 4-6, 5-7, 6-8, 7-9, 8-10, 9-1, 10-12, 11-13, 12-14, 13-15, 14-16, 15-17, 16-18, 17-19, or 18-20 polyethylene glycol moieties per antibody molecule. Methods for determining the degree of substitution are discussed, for example, in Delgado et al., 9:249-304 (1992).","Antibody Characterization","Antibodies of the present invention (including scFvs and other molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) may be characterized in a variety of ways. In particular, antibodies and related molecules of the invention may be assayed for the ability to immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator or a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., to the soluble form or the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator) using techniques described herein or routinely modifying techniques known in the art. B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator fragments that may be immunospecifically bound by the compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to, human B Lymphocyte Stimulator (SEQ ID NOS:3228 and\/or 3229) or B Lymphocyte Stimulator expressed on human monocytes; murine B Lymphocyte Stimulator (SEQ ID NOS:3230 and\/or 3231) or B Lymphocyte Stimulator expressed on murine monocytes; rat B Lymphocyte Stimulator (either the soluble forms as given in SEQ ID NOS:3232, 3233, 3234 and\/or 3235 or in a membrane associated form, e.g., on the surface of rat monocytes); or monkey B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., the monkey B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS:3236 and\/or 3237, the soluble form of monkey B Lymphocyte Stimulator, or B Lymphocyte Stimulator expressed on monkey monocytes) or fragments thereof. Preferably compositions of the invention bind human B Lymphocyte Stimulator (SEQ ID NOS:3228 and\/or 3229) or fragments thereof. Assays for the ability of the antibodies of the invention to immunospecifically bind B Lymphocyte Stimulator or a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator may be performed in solution (e.g., Houghten, Bio\/Techniques 13:412421(1992)), on beads (e.g., Lam, Nature 354:82-84 (1991)), on chips (e.g., Fodor, Nature 364:555-556 (1993)), on bacteria (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), on spores (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,698; 5,403,484; and 5,223,409), on plasmids (e.g., Cull et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:1865-1869 (1992)) or on phage (e.g., Scott and Smith, Science 249:386-390 (1990); Devlin, Science 249:404406 (1990); Cwirla et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:6378-6382 (1990); and Felici, J. Mol. Biol. 222:301-310 (1991)) (each of these references is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference). Antibodies that have been identified to immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator or a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator can then be assayed for their specificity and affinity for B Lymphocyte Stimulator or a fragment of B Lymphocyte Stimulator using or routinely modifying techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art.","The antibodies of the invention may be assayed for immunospecific binding to B Lymphocyte Stimulator and cross-reactivity with other antigens by any method known in the art. In particular, the ability of an antibody to immunospecifically bind to the soluble form or membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator and the specificity of the antibody, fragment, or variant for B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide from a particular species (e.g., murine, monkey or human, preferably human) may be determined using or routinely modifying techniques described herein or otherwise known in art.","Immunoassays which can be used to analyze immunospecific binding and cross-reactivity include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, and protein A immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below (but are not intended by way of limitation).","Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer (1% NP-40 or Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2, 1% Trasylol) supplemented with protein phosphatase and\/or protease inhibitors (e.g., EDTA, PMSF, aprotinin, sodium vanadate), adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate, incubating for a period of time (e.g., 1 to 4 hours) at 40 degrees C, adding protein A and\/or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate, incubating for about an hour or more at 40 degrees C., washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS\/sample buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by, e.g., western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background (e.g., pre-clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads). For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.16.1.","Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples, electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel (e.g., 8%-20% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, blocking the membrane in blocking solution (e.g., PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer (e.g., PBS-Tween 20), blocking the membrane with primary antibody (the antibody of interest) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in washing buffer, blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody, e.g., an anti-human antibody) conjugated to an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) or radioactive molecule (e.g., P or I) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in wash buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.8.1.","ELISAs comprise preparing antigen, coating the well of a 96-well microtiter plate with the antigen, washing away antigen that did not bind the wells, adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the wells and incubating for a period of time, washing away unbound antibodies or non-specifically bound antibodies, and detecting the presence of the antibodies specifically bound to the antigen coating the well. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case, the detectable molecule could be the antigen conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase). One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g. Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1.","The binding affinity of an antibody (including an scFv or other molecule comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) to an antigen and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., H or I) with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of the present invention for B Lymphocyte Stimulator and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, B Lymphocyte Stimulator is incubated with an antibody of the present invention conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., H or I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody.","In a preferred embodiment, BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibodies (including an scFv or other molecule comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) to B Lymphocyte Stimulator, or fragments of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of B Lymphocyte Stimulator from chips with immobilized antibodies on their surface as described in detail in Examples 6, 12, 17 and 18, infra.","The antibodies of the invention (including scFvs and other molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) can also be assayed for their ability to inhibit, increase, or not significantly alter, the binding of B Lymphocyte Stimulator to a B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor (e.g., TACI\u2014GenBank accession number AAC51790; BCMA\u2014GenBank accession number NP001183; and\/or BAFF-R\u2014GenBank accession number NP443177) using techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, cells expressing a receptor for B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., IM9, REH, ARH-77 cells, Namalwa, and RPMI-8226 B cell tumor lines as wells as peripheral CD20+ B cells) can be contacted with B Lymphocyte Stimulator in the presence or absence of an antibody, and the ability of the antibody to inhibit, increase, or not significantly alter, B Lymphocyte Stimulator binding to the cells can be measured. B Lymphocyte Stimulator binding to cells can be measured by, for example, flow cytometry or a scintillation assay. B Lymphocyte Stimulator or the antibody can be labeled with a detectable compound such as a radioactive label (e.g., P, S, and I) or a fluorescent label (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde and fluorescamine) to enable detection of an interaction between B Lymphocyte Stimulator and a B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor and\/or B Lymphocyte Stimulator and an antibody of the invention. Alternatively, the ability of antibodies of the invention to inhibit, increase, or not significantly alter, B Lymphocyte Stimulator binding to a B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor can be determined in cell-free assays. For example, native or recombinant B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., that having the amino acid sequence of amino acids 134-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228) or a fragment thereof can be contacted with an antibody and the ability of the antibody to inhibit, increase, or not significantly alter, B Lymphocyte Stimulator from binding to a B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor can be determined. Preferably, the antibody is immobilized on a solid support and B Lymphocyte Stimulator or a B Lymphocyte Stimulator fragment is labeled with a detectable compound. Alternatively, B Lymphocyte Stimulator or a B Lymphocyte Stimulator fragment is immobilized on a solid support and the antibody is labeled with a detectable compound. B Lymphocyte Stimulator may be partially or completely purified (e.g., partially or completely free of other polypeptides) or part of a cell lysate. Further, the B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptide may be a fusion protein comprising B Lymphocyte Stimulator or a biologically active portion thereof and a domain such as an Immunoglobulin Fe or glutathionine-S-transferase. For example, amino acid residues 1-154 of TACI (GenBank accession number AAC51790), amino acids 148 of BCMA (GenBank accession number NP001183) or amino acids 1-81 of BAFF-R (GenBank Accession Number NP443177) may be fused to the Fe region of an IgG molecule and used in a cell free assay to determine the ability of antibodies of the invention to inhibit, increase, or not significantly alter, B Lymphocyte Stimulator binding to a B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor. Alternatively, B Lymphocyte Stimulator can be biotinylated using techniques well known to those of skill in the art (e.g., biotinylation kit, Pierce Chemicals; Rockford, Ill.).","The antibodies of the invention (including scFvs or other molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof), can also be assayed for their ability to inhibit, stimulate, or not significantly alter, B Lymphocyte Stimulator-induced B-cell proliferation using techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, B-cell proliferation can be assayed by H-thymidine incorporation assays and trypan blue cell counts (see, e.g., Moore et al., Science 285: 260-263 (1999)). Further, the antibodies of the invention, or fragments or variants thereof, can be assayed for their ability to block, stimulate, or not significantly alter, B Lymphocyte Stimulator-induced activation of cellular signaling molecules and transcription factors such as calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand (\u201cCAML\u201d), calcineurin, nuclear factor of activated T cells transcription factor (\u201cNF-AT\u201d), nuclear factor-kappa B (\u201cNF-kappa B\u201d), and AP-1 using techniques known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., von Bulow and Bram, Science 278:138-141(1997)). For example, NF-AT activity can be determined by electromobility gel shift assays, by detecting the expression of a protein known to be regulated by NF-AT (e.g., IL-2 expression), by detecting the induction of a reporter gene (e.g., an NF-AT regulatory element operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding a detectable marker such as luciferase, beta-galactosidase or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)), or by detecting a cellular response (e.g., cellular differentiation, or cell proliferation).","The antibodies of the invention, or fragments or variants thereof can also be assayed for their ability to neutralize, enhance, or not significantly alter, B Lymphocyte Stimulator activity. For example, antibodies or fragments or variants thereof, may be routinely tested for their ability to inhibit B Lymphocyte Stimulator from binding to cells expressing the receptor for B Lymphocyte Stimulator (see Example 3, infra).","Selection and Screening for Antibodies that Immunospecifically Bind to Soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator","Antibodies of the invention (including scFvs and other molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) may be screened in a variety of assays to identify those antibodies that immunospecifically bind to the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In one particular assay, antibodies that bind to the biotinylated soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator in solution are captured on streptavidin coated magnetic beads. This assay may be relatively applied to identify antibodies of the invention that neutralize and\/or bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator. Additionally, antibodies may be assayed in neutralization assays described herein or otherwise known in the art (see Example 3, infra). For example, antibodies may be tested for their ability to inhibit soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator) from binding to IM9 cells. In this assay, labeled soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator) is incubated with candidate anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibodies to allow for the formation of B Lymphocyte Stimulator-anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody complexes. Following incubation, an aliquot of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator-anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody sample is added to IM9 cells. The binding of soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator may be determined using techniques known in the art. For example, the binding of biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator to IM9 cells may be detected using a fluorimeter following the addition of streptavidin-delfia. Biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator, if it is not bound by antibodies that neutralize B Lymphocyte Stimulator, binds to the cells is detected. Thus, an antibody that decreases the amount of bio-B Lymphocyte Stimulator that binds to IM-9 cells (relative to a control sample in which the B Lymphocyte Stimulator had been preincubated with an irrelevant antibody or no antibody at all) is identified as one that binds to and neutralizes the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In another assay, antibodies are screened using ELISAs for those antibodies that bind to biotinylated soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator, but do not bind membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator, such as, for example, B Lymphocyte Stimulator on membranes from U937 cells (see Examples 2 and 9, infra). In these assays, soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator) and membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., on U937 membranes) are incubated in separate samples with the same antibodies and those antibodies that bind to the soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator (biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator), but not membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., on U937 membranes) are captured and identified.","Antibodies of the invention (including scFvs and other molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) may be tested to identify those antibodies that do not cross-react with APRIL, endokine-alpha, VEGI, TRAIL, TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, Fas-L, LIGHT, and PBS (see Example 4, infra). Antibodies may also be tested for their affinity for B Lymphocyte Stimulator using, for example, BIAcore analysis (see Examples 6, 12, 17 and 18 infra). Antibodies may also be tested for their ability to stimulate, inhibit, or not alter, B Lymphocyte Stimulator-induced immunoglobulin production and\/or B-cell proliferation using techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, human B-cells, B Lymphocyte Stimulator and antibodies may be incubated together in 96 well plates and H-thymidine incorporation may be measured using a scintillation counter.","Selection and Screening for Antibodies that Immunospecifically Bind to Membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator","Antibodies of the invention (including scFvs and other molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) may be screened in a variety of assays to identify those antibodies that immunospecifically bind to the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In one particular assay, antibodies that bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator on U937 membranes or immobilized histidine-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator are captured. Other cell lines that express B Lymphocyte Stimulator that might be useful for testing antibody binding to membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator include, K562, HL 60 and THP-1 cells. In another assay, antibodies are screened using ELISAs for those antibodies (or antibody fragments or variants) that bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator on U937 membranes or to histidine-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In this assay, antibodies are added to 96 well plates coated with U937 membranes or histidine-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator and those antibodies or antibody fragments or variants that bind to the U937 membranes or histidine-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator are captured. In another assay, antibodies are screened using ELISAs for those antibodies (or antibody fragments or variants thereof) that do not bind to biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator (soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator) but bind to membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator, such as, for example, that on membranes from U937 cells (see Example 2, infra). In these assays, soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator) and membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., on U937 membranes) are incubated in separate samples with the same antibodies (or antibody fragments or variants) and those antibodies (or antibody fragments or variants) that do not bind to the soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator (biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator), but bind the membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g., on U937 membranes) are captured and identified. In other assays, antibodies are screened using ELISAs to determine which of the antibodies (or antibody fragments or variants) that bind to histidine-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator or membranes from U937 cells do not cross-react with APRIL, endokine-alpha, VEGI, TRAIL, TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, Fas-L, LIGHT, and PBS (See Example 4, infra). ELISAs can also be used to determine which of the antibodies (or antibody fragments or variants) that bind to histidine-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator or membranes from U937 cells bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator in the presence of TNF-alpha (see Example 4, infra). Antibodies or fragments or variants thereof that immunospecifically bind to the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator may also be tested for their affinity for histidine-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator using high-throughput BIAcore analysis (see Example 14, infra).","Additionally, antibodies of the invention may be screened against cells engineered to express an \u201cuncleavable\u201d form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator in order to determine their specificity for the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. Mutations in B Lymphocyte Stimulator which may achieve this result include, but are not limited to, the mutation or deletion of amino acid residues Lys-132 and\/or Arg-133 of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:3228. Atypical mutagenesis might include mutation of one or both of residues Lys-132 or Arg-133 to alanine residues. Cells expressing such an \u201cuncleavable\u201d form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator provide a profound reagent to use in assaying the ability of antibodies to bind the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator.","Selection and Screening for Antibodies that Immunospecifically Bind to Soluble and Membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator","Antibodies of the invention (including scFvs and other molecules comprising, or alternately consisting of, antibody fragments or variants) may be screened in a variety of assays to identify those antibodies or antibody fragments or variants that immunospecifically bind to the soluble form and membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In one particular assay, antibodies that bind to immobilized B Lymphocyte Stimulator are captured. In another assay, antibodies are screened using ELISAs for those antibodies (or antibody fragments or variants) that inhibit the binding of soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator (e.g. soluble bio-B Lymphocyte Stimulator) to IM-9 cells as described supra. In other assays, antibodies are screened using ELISAs for those antibodies that bind to membranes from U937 cells. Additionally, further ELISA assays may be performed using techniques known in the art to determine which antibodies do not cross-react with APRIL, endokine-alpha, VEGI, TRAIL, TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, Fas-L, LIGHT, and PBS, or those antibodies that bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator in the presence of TNF-alpha (see Example 4 infra). Antibodies may be assayed in neutralization assays using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. Antibodies that immunospecifically bind to the soluble and membrane-bound forms of B Lymphocyte Stimulator may also be tested for their affinity for B Lymphocyte Stimulator using high-throughput BIAcore analysis.","Antibody Conjugates","The present invention encompasses antibodies (including scFvs and other molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof), recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalent and non-covalent conjugations) to a heterologous polypeptide (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90 or at least 100 amino acids of the polypeptide) to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences. For example, antibodies of the invention may be used to target heterologous polypeptides to particular cell types (e.g., cells of monocytic lineage and B-cells), either in vitro or in vivo, by fusing or conjugating the heterologous polypeptides to antibodies of the invention that are specific for particular cell surface antigens (e.g., membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator on cells of monocytic lineage) or which bind antigens that bind particular cell surface receptors (e.g., TACI, BCMA, BAFF-R located on B cells). Antibodies fused or conjugated to heterologous polypeptides may also be used in in vitro immunoassays and purification methods using methods known in the art. See e.g., Harbor et al., supra, and PCT publication WO 93\/2 1232; EP 439,095; Naramura et al., Immunol. Lett. 39:91-99 (1994); U.S. Pat.

In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine polypeptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821-824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the hemagglutinin \u201cHA\u201d tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984)) and the \u201cflag\u201d tag (DYKDDDDK, (SEQ ID No: 3238) Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.).","The present invention further encompasses antibodies (including scFvs and other molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof), conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent.

The elevated levels of B Lymphocyte Stimulator protein in sera is present in the soluble form and has biologic activity as assayed by the ability to stimulate anti-IgM treated B cells in vitro. SLE patients with more than 15 ng\/ml serum B Lymphocyte Stimulator were also found to have elevated levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies compared to both normal controls and SLE patients with less than 5 ng\/ml of serum B Lymphocyte Stimulator unpublished data).","In addition the serum of two subgroups of patients which were positive for anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA+) but did not meet the formal requirements of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) for classification of SLE were analyzed for B Lymphocyte Stimulator levels. The first subgroup of sera was ANA+ sera that came from patients who did not present with the clinical impression of SLE. This group had only slightly elevated levels of B Lymphocyte Stimulator (\u02dc9 ng\/ml B Lymphocyte Stimulator). The second subgroup however, which was ANA+ sera from patients who presented with the clinical impression of SLE, had significantly increased B Lymphocyte Stimulator levels (\u02dc15 ng\/ml).

Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase, alkaline phosphatase, and horseradish peroxidase; radioisotopes, such as iodine (I, I, I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In, In, In, In), technetium (Tc, Tc), thallium (Ti), gallium (Ga, Ga), palladium (Pd), molybdenum (Mo), xenon (Xe), fluorine (F), Sm, Lu, Gd, Pm, La, Yb, Ho, Y, Sc, Re, Re, Pr, Rh, and Ru; luminescent labels, such as luminol; and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.","One aspect of the invention is the detection and diagnosis of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor in an animal, preferably a mammal and most preferably a human. In one embodiment, diagnosis comprises: a) administering (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally) to a subject an effective amount of a labeled antibody of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically binds to B Lymphocyte Stimulator; b) waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled antibody to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where B Lymphocyte Stimulator is expressed (and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level); c) determining background level; and d) detecting the labeled antibody in the subject, such that detection of labeled antibody or fragment thereof above the background level and above or below the level observed in a person without the disease or disorder indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor. Background level can be determined by various methods including, comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.","It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of Tc. The labeled antibody will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments.\u201d (Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982).","Depending on several variables, including the type of label used and the mode of administration, the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days.","In an embodiment, monitoring of the disease or disorder is carried out by repeating the method for diagnosing the disease or disorder, for example, one month after initial diagnosis, six months after initial diagnosis, one year after initial diagnosis, etc.","Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the patient using methods known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, computed tomography (CT), whole body scan such as position emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and sonography.","In a specific embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument (Thurston et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,050). In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patient using positron emission-tomography. In yet another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","Immunophenotyping","The antibodies of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) may be utilized for immunophenotyping of cell lines and biological samples by their B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression. Various techniques can be utilized using antibodies, fragments, or variants of the invention to screen for cellular populations (i.e., immune cells, particularly monocytic cells or B-cells) expressing B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor, and include magnetic separation using antibody-coated magnetic beads, \u201cpanning\u201d with antibody attached to a solid matrix (i.e., plate), and flow cytometry (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,660; and Morrison et al., Cell, 96:73749 (1999)).","These techniques allow for the screening of particular populations of cells, such as might be found with hematological malignancies (i.e., minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemic patients) and \u201cnon-self\u201d cells in transplantations to prevent Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Alternatively, these techniques allow for the screening of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells capable of undergoing proliferation and\/or differentiation, as might be found in human umbilical cord blood.","In one embodiment, antibodies of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) are used to identify cells of monocytic or B cell origin.","Use of Antibodies to Identify, Purify and\/or Target B Lymphocyte Stimulator Protein and\/or B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator Receptor Expressing Cells","The antibodies of the invention may be used to identify, purify and target B Lymphocyte Stimulator protein and\/or B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expressing cells. For example, the antibodies of the invention when coupled to a detectable label can be used to identify cells that express B Lymphocyte Stimulator. More specifically, the antibodies of the invention can be used in immunohistochemistry or in flow cytometry. Additionally, the antibodies of the invention may be used to purified B Lymphocyte Stimulator proteins or portions thereof from cells expressing B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In more specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention may be conjugated (directly or indirectly) to a detectable label such a fluorescent label and used in fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Alternatively, antibodies of the invention may be conjugated (directly or indirectly) to a magnetic particle or bead and used in magnetic cell sorting (MACS).","Antibodies of the invention may be used to target therapeutic or toxic moieties to B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator Receptor expressing cells (see Antibody Conjugates section above). In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention may also be used to kill B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator Receptor expressing cells. In one embodiment, antibodies of the invention are linked to a cytotoxic moiety which kills B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator Receptor expressing cells that have been contacted with such an antibody conjugate.","Certain forms of antibodies, particularly, IgG3 and IgM antibodies, as well as IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies to a lesser extent, are able to mediate cellular lysis via the complement cascade. Thus antibodies of the invention may be used to kill B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator Receptor expressing cells via complement-mediated killing.","Antibodies of the invention may be used to mediate antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotocicity (ADCC) by, for example, Natural Killer (NK) cells. ADCC occurs when antibodies of the IgG1 or IgG3 isotype interact with Fc\u03b3RIII receptor on Natural Killer cells triggering an cytotoxic attack by the NK cell on the antibody coated cells. Thus antibodies of the invention may be used to kill B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator Receptor expressing cells via ADCC.","Therapeutic Uses of Antibodies","The present invention is further directed to antibody-based therapies which involve administering antibodies of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) to an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, patient for treating one or more of the disclosed diseases, disorders, or conditions. Therapeutic compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, antibodies of the invention and nucleic acids encoding antibodies (and anti-idiotypic antibodies) of the invention as described herein. The antibodies of the invention can be used to treat, ameliorate or prevent diseases, disorders or conditions associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of B Lymphocyte Stimulator or B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor, including, but not limited to, any one or more of the diseases, disorders, or conditions described herein. The treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, disorders, or conditions associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression and\/or activity or aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression and\/or activity includes, but is not limited to, alleviating symptoms associated with those diseases, disorders or conditions. Antibodies of the invention may be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein.","Antibodies of the present invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that function as agonists or antagonists of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, preferably of B Lymphocyte Stimulator-induced signal transduction, can be administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression, lack of B Lymphocyte Stimulator function, aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression, or lack of B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor function. For example, antibodies of the invention which disrupt the interaction between B Lymphocyte Stimulator and its receptor may be administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression, excessive B Lymphocyte Stimulator function, aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression, or excessive of B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor function. Antibodies of the invention which do not prevent B Lymphocyte Stimulator from binding its receptor but inhibit or downregulate B Lymphocyte Stimulator-induced signal transduction can be administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression, excessive B Lymphocyte Stimulator function, aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression, or excessive B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor function. In particular, antibodies of the present invention which prevent B Lymphocyte Stimulator-induced signal transduction by specifically recognizing the unbound B Lymphocyte Stimulator, receptor-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator or both unbound and receptor-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator can be administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression, excessive B Lymphocyte Stimulator function, aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression, or excessive B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor function. The ability of an antibody of the invention to inhibit or downregulate B Lymphocyte Stimulator-induced signal transduction may be determined by techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. For example, B Lymphocyte Stimulator-induced receptor activation and the activation of signaling molecules can be determined by detecting the phosphorylation (e.g., tyrosine or serine\/threonine) of the receptor or a signaling molecule by immunoprecipitation followed by western blot analysis (for example, as described herein).","In a specific embodiment, an antibody of the present invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that inhibits or downregulates B Lymphocyte Stimulator activity by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 45%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 35%, at least 30%, at least 25%, at least 20%, or at least 10% relative to B Lymphocyte Stimulator activity in absence of the antibody is administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression, excessive B Lymphocyte Stimulator function, aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression, or excessive B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor function. In another embodiment, a combination of antibodies, a combination of antibody fragments, a combination of antibody variants, or a combination of antibodies, antibody fragments, and\/or variants that inhibit or downregulate B Lymphocyte Stimulator activity by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 65%, at least 60%, at least 55%, at least 50%, at least 45%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 35%, at least 30%, at least 25%, at least 20%, or at least 10% relative to B Lymphocyte Stimulator activity in absence of said antibodies, antibody fragments, and\/or antibody variants are administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression, excessive B Lymphocyte Stimulator function, aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression, or excessive B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor function.","Further, antibodies of the present invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) which activate B Lymphocyte Stimulator-induced signal transduction can be administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression, lack of B Lymphocyte Stimulator function, aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression, or lack of B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor function. These antibodies may potentiate or activate either all or a subset of the biological activities of B Lymphocyte Stimulator-mediated receptor activation, for example, by inducing multimerization of B Lymphocyte Stimulator and\/or multimerization of the receptor. The antibodies of the invention may be administered with or without being pre-complexed with B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In a specific embodiment, an antibody of the present invention that increases B Lymphocyte Stimulator activity by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% relative to B Lymphocyte Stimulator activity in absence of the antibody is administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression, lack of B Lymphocyte Stimulator function, aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression, or lack of B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor function. In another embodiment, a combination of antibodies, a combination of antibody fragments, a combination of antibody variants, or a combination of antibodies, antibody fragments and\/or antibody variants that increase B Lymphocyte Stimulator activity by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% relative to B Lymphocyte Stimulator activity in absence of the said antibodies or antibody fragments and\/or antibody variants is administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator expression or lack of B Lymphocyte Stimulator function or aberrant B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor expression or lack of B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor function.","One or more antibodies of the present invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator may be used locally or systemically in the body as a therapeutic. The antibodies of this invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) may also be advantageously utilized in combination with other monoclonal or chimeric antibodies, or with lymphokines or hematopoietic growth factors (such as, e.g., IL-2, IL-3 and IL-7), for example, which serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the antibodies.","The antibodies of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) may be administered alone or in combination with other types of treatments (e.g., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, anti-tumor agents, anti-angiogenesis and anti-inflammatory agents). Generally, administration of products of a species origin or species reactivity (in the case of antibodies) that is the same species as that of the patient is preferred. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, human antibodies, fragments, or variants, (e.g., derivatives), or nucleic acids, are administered to a human patient for therapy or prophylaxis.","It is preferred to use high affinity and\/or potent in vivo inhibiting and\/or neutralizing antibodies of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator, or polynucleotides encoding antibodies that immunospecifically bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator, for both immunoassays directed to and therapy of disorders related to B Lymphocyte Stimulator polynucleotides or polypeptides, including fragments thereof.

In another preferred embodiment, antibodies of the invention inhibit or reduce B cell proliferation induced by either or both forms of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In another preferred embodiment, antibodies of the invention inhibit or reduce immunoglobulin production induced by either or both forms of B Lymphocyte Stimulator.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of delivering antibody conjugates of the invention to targeted cells, such as, for example, monocytic cells expressing the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, or B cells expressing a B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for the specific delivery of antibodies and antibody conjugates of the invention to cells by administering molecules of the invention that are associated with heterologous polypeptides or nucleic acids. In one example, the invention provides a method for delivering a therapeutic protein into the targeted cell.

In a specific embodiment, the invention provides a method for the specific destruction of cells of monocytic lineage (e.g., monocytic cell related leukemias or lymphomas, such as, for example acute myelogenous leukemia) by administering antibodies or antibody conjugates of the invention (e.g., antibodies conjugated with radioisotopes, toxins, or cytotoxic prodrugs) that immunospecifically bind the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In another specific embodiment, the invention provides a method for the specific destruction of cells of B cell lineage (e.g., B cell related leukemias or lymphomas (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease) by administering antibodies or antibody conjugates of the invention (e.g., antibodies conjugated with radioisotopes, toxins, or cytotoxic prodrugs) that bind soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator, but do not inhibit B Lymphocyte Stimulator binding to a B Lymphocyte Stimulator receptor on B cells.","In another preferred embodiment antibodies of the invention (including antibody fragments and variants) promote or enhance B cell proliferation induced by the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator.

Many autoimmune disorders result from inappropriate recognition of self as foreign material by immune cells. This inappropriate recognition results in an immune response leading to the destruction of the host tissue. Therefore, the administration of antibody and antibody compositions of the invention that can inhibit an immune response, particularly the proliferation of B cells and\/or the production of immunoglobulins, may be an effective therapy in treating and\/or preventing autoimmune disorders. Thus, in preferred embodiments, antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose and\/or prognose an autoimmune disorder, or condition(s)

AIHA is an acquired hemolytic anemia due to auto-antibodies that react with the patient's red blood cells. The patient treated preferably will not have a B cell malignancy. Further adjunct therapies (such as glucocorticoids, prednisone, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, vinca-laden platelets or Danazol) may be combined with the antibody therapy, but preferably the patient is treated with an antibody, or antibodies, of the present invention as a single-agent throughout the course of therapy. Antibodies of the present invention are administered to the hemolytic anemia patient according to a dosing schedule as described infra, which may be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. Overall response rate is determined based upon an improvement in blood counts, decreased requirement for transfusions, improved hemoglobin levels and\/or a decrease in the evidence of hemolysis as determined by standard chemical parameters. Administration of an antibody, or antibodies of the present invention will improve any one or more of the symptoms of hemolytic anemia in the patient treated as described above. For example, the patient treated as described above will show an increase in hemoglobin and an improvement in chemical parameters of hemolysis or return to normal as measured by serum lactic dehydrogenase and\/or bilirubin.","In another specific preferred embodiment, therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose or prognose, Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome and\/or medical conditions associated therewith.","In another specific preferred embodiment, therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose or prognose, HIV infection and\/or medical conditions associated therewith (e.g. AIDS).","In another specific preferred embodiment, therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose or prognose, Myasthenia gravis and\/or medical conditions associated therewith.","In another specific preferred embodiment, therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose or prognose, IgA nephropathy and\/or medical conditions associated therewith.","In another specific preferred embodiment, therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose or prognose, hemolytic anemia and\/or medical conditions associated therewith.","In another specific preferred embodiment, therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose or prognose, thyroiditis and\/or medical conditions associated therewith.","In another specific preferred embodiment, therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose or prognose, Goodpasture's Syndrome and\/or medical conditions associated therewith.","In another specific preferred embodiment, therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose or prognose, multiple sclerosis and\/or medical conditions associated therewith.","In another specific preferred embodiment, therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose or prognose, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and\/or medical conditions associated therewith.","In another specific preferred embodiment, therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose or prognose, multiple myeloma and\/or medical conditions associated therewith.","In another specific preferred embodiment, therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose or prognose, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and\/or medical conditions associated therewith.","In another specific preferred embodiment, therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, are used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, diagnose or prognose, Hodgkin's disease and\/or medical conditions associated therewith.","In another specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention are used to treat, inhibit, prognose, diagnose or prevent adult immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Adult immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a relatively rare hematologic disorder that constitutes the most common of the immune-mediated cytopenias. The disease typically presents with severe thrombocytopenia that may be associated with acute hemorrhage in the presence of normal to increased megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Most patients with ITP have an IgG antibody directed against target antigens on the outer surface of the platelet membrane, resulting in platelet sequestration in the spleen and accelerated reticuloendothelial destruction of platelets (Bussell, J. B. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. (4):179 (1990)). A number of therapeutic interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of ITP, Steroids are generally considered first-line therapy, after which most patients are candidates for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), splenectomy, or other medical therapies including vincristine or immunosuppressive\/cytotoxic agents. Up to 80% of patients with ITP initially respond to a course of steroids, but far fewer have complete and lasting remissions. Splenectomy has been recommended as standard second-line therapy for steroid failures, and leads to prolonged remission in nearly 60% of cases yet may result in reduced immunity to infection. Splenectomy is a major surgical procedure that may be associated with substantial morbidity (15%) and mortality (2%). IVIG has also been used as second line medical therapy, although only a small proportion of adult patients with ITP achieve remission. Therapeutic options that would interfere with the production of autoantibodies by activated B cells without the associated morbidities that occur with corticosteroids and\/or splenectomy would provide an important treatment approach for a proportion of patients with ITP, Patients with clinical diagnosis of ITP are treated with an antibody, or antibodies of the present invention, optionally in combination with steroid therapy. The patient treated will not have a B cell malignancy. Antibodies of the present invention are administered to the RA patient according to a dosing schedule as described infra, which may be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. Overall patient response rate is determined based upon a platelet count determined on two consecutive occasions two weeks apart following treatments as described above.

Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their encoded protein that mediates a therapeutic effect.","Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.","For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al., Clinical Pharmacy 12:488-505 (1993); Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87-95 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573-596 (1993); Mulligan, Science 260:926-932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191-217 (1993); May, TIBTECH 1 l (5):155-215 (1993). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY (1993); and Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY (1990).","In a preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises, or alternatively consists of, nucleic acids encoding an antibody, said nucleic acids being part of an expression vector that expresses the antibody or fragments or chimeric proteins or heavy or light chains thereof in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the antibody coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids (Koller and Smithies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932-8935 (1989); Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435-438 (1989). In specific embodiments, the expressed antibody molecule is an scFv; alternatively, the nucleic acid sequences include sequences encoding both the heavy and light chains, or fragments or variants thereof, of an antibody.","Delivery of the nucleic acids into a patient may be either direct, in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid-carrying vectors, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro, then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo, where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art, e.g., by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular, e.g., by infection using defective or attenuated retrovirals or other viral vectors (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection of naked DNA, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus, by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432 (1987)) (which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors), etc. In another embodiment, nucleic acid-ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression, by targeting a specific receptor (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 92\/06 180; WO 92\/22635; WO92\/203 16; WO93\/14188, WO 93\/20221). Alternatively, the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination (Koller and Smithies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932-8935 (1989); Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435438 (1989)).","In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contains nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody of the invention or fragments or variants thereof are used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (see Miller et al., Meth. Enzymol. 217:581-599 (1993)). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al., Biotherapy 6:29 1-302 (1994), which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr 1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are: Clowes et al., J. Clin. Invest. 93:644-651(1994); Klein et al., Blood 83:1467-1473 (1994); Salmons and Gunzberg, Human Gene Therapy 4:129-141 (1993); and Grossman and Wilson, Curr. Opin. in Genetics and Devel. 3:110-114 (1993).","Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson, Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3:499-503 (1993) present a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy. Bout et al., Human Gene Therapy 5:3-10 (1994) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al., Science 252:431434 (1991); Rosenfeld et al., Cell 68:143-155 (1992); Mastrangeli et al., J. Clin. Invest. 91:225-234 (1993); PCT Publication W094\/12649; and Wang, et al, Gene Therapy 2:775-783 (1995). In a preferred embodiment, adenovirus vectors are used.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has also been proposed for use in gene therapy (Walsh et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204:289-300 (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,146).","Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, or viral infection. Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.","In this embodiment, the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art, including but not limited to transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcellmediated gene transfer, spheroplast fusion, etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells (see, e.g., Loeffler and Behr, Meth. Enzymol. 217:599-618 (1993); Cohen et al., Meth. Enzymol. 217:618-644 (1993); Clin. Pharma. Ther. 29:69-92m (1985)) and may be used in accordance with the present invention, provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell, so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.","The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art.","Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc.","In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the patient.","In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy, nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody or fragment thereof are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny, and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment, stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and\/or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention (see e.g. PCT Publication WO 94\/08598; Stemple and Anderson, Cell 7 1:973-985 (1992); Rheinwald, Meth. Cell Bio. 21A:229 (1980); and Pittelkow and Scott, Mayo Clinic Proc. 61:771 (1986)).","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.","Demonstration of Therapeutic or Prophylactic Utility of a Composition","The compounds of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. For example, in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific antibody or composition of the present invention is indicated, include in vitro cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise administered an antibody or composition of the present invention, and the effect of such an antibody or composition of the present invention upon the tissue sample is observed. In various specific embodiments, in vitro assays can be carried out with representative cells of cell types involved in a patient's disorder, to determine if an antibody or composition of the present invention has a desired effect upon such cell types.

For in vivo testing of an antibody or composition's toxicity any animal model system known in the art may be used.","Efficacy in treating or preventing viral infection may be demonstrated by detecting the ability of an antibody or composition of the invention to inhibit the replication of the virus, to inhibit transmission or prevent the virus from establishing itself in its host, or to prevent, ameliorate or alleviate the symptoms of disease a progression. The treatment is considered therapeutic if there is, for example, a reduction in viral load, amelioration of one or more symptoms, or a decrease in mortality and\/or morbidity following administration of an antibody or composition of the invention.","Antibodies or compositions of the invention can be tested for the ability to induce the expression of cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, by contacting cells, preferably human cells, with an antibody or composition of the invention or a control antibody or control composition and determining the ability of the antibody or composition of the invention to induce one or more cytokines.

In a preferred embodiment, a compound of the invention is tested for its ability to induce the expression of IFN-\u03b3.","Antibodies or compositions of the invention can be tested for their ability to modulate the biological activity of immune cells by contacting immune cells, preferably human immune cells (e.g., T-cells, B-cells, and Natural Killer cells), with an antibody or composition of the invention or a control compound and determining the ability of the antibody or composition of the invention to modulate (i.e, increase or decrease) the biological activity of immune cells. The ability of an antibody or composition of the invention to modulate the biological activity of immune cells can be assessed by detecting the expression of antigens, detecting the proliferation of immune cells (i.e., B-cell proliferation), detecting the activation of signaling molecules, detecting the effector function of immune cells, or detecting the differentiation of immune cells. Techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used for measuring these activities. For example, cellular proliferation can be assayed by H-thymidine incorporation assays and trypan blue cell counts.

Alternatively, or in addition, the detecting means may include a labeled, competing antigen.","In one diagnostic configuration, test serum is reacted with a solid phase reagent having a surface-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator obtained by the methods of the present invention. After B Lymphocyte Stimulator binds to a specific antibody, the unbound serum components are removed by washing, reporter-labeled anti-human antibody is added, unbound anti-human antibody is removed by washing, and a reagent is reacted with reporter-labeled anti-human antibody to bind reporter to the reagent in proportion to the amount of bound anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody on the solid support. Typically, the reporter is an enzyme which is detected by incubating the solid phase in the presence of a suitable fluorometric, luminescent or colorimetric substrate.","The solid surface reagent in the above assay is prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material, such as polymeric beads, dip sticks, 96-well plate or filter material. These attachment methods generally include non-specific absorption of the protein to the support or covalent attachment of the protein, typically through a free amine group, to a chemically reactive group on the solid support, such as an activated carboxyl, hydroxyl, or aldehyde group. Alternatively, streptavidin coated plates can be used in conjunction with biotinylated antigen(s).","Thus, the invention provides an assay system or kit for carrying out this diagnostic method. The kit generally includes a support with surface-bound recombinant B Lymphocyte Stimulator, and a reporter-labeled anti-human antibody for detecting surface-bound anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody.","In specific embodiments, the present invention encompasses a single chain Fv (scFv) having an amino acid sequence of one of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 2128.","In specific embodiments, the present

They were maintained in RPMI-L 640 supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine, 10% FCS, 10 U penicillin, 100 g\/ml streptomycin (all reagents from Sigma). The cells were thawed from frozen stock and are either used for plasma membrane preparation, or split 1:5, after 2 days in culture when the cell density reaches 1\u00d710\/ml.","Preparation of U937 Plasma Membranes","To prepare plasma membranes, 1\u00d710U937 cells were harvested from their culture medium by centrifugation at 1000 rpm at 4\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes in a benchtop centrifuge. The cells were resuspended in 40 ml 12 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose and placed on ice. The cells are then lysed using a hand-held electric homogenizer (Labortechnik IKA Ultra-Turrax) for four, one minute, bursts. To check that cell lysis had occurred, 10 \u03bcl cell lysate was added to 10 \u03bcl Trypan blue and the cell lysate was examined under a microscope. After confirming lysis, the homogenate was centrifuged at 270\u00d7g, for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. to pellet the nuclear fraction and the supernatant was retained. The supernatant was centrifuged at 8000\u00d7g, 10 mins, 4\u00b0 C., to pellet the mitochondrial and lysosomal fractions and the supernatant was retained. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100000\u00d7g, 60 mins, 4\u00b0 C. to pellet the plasma membrane enriched fraction. The supernatant was discarded and the plasma membrane pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS and stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. The protein concentration of the plasma membrane fraction was determined using a protein quantification kit (Biorad). Typical yields were between 5 and 10 mg of plasma membranes.","Phage ELISA","To determine the specificity of each of the unique scFvs, a phage ELISA was performed for each scFv against human B Lymphocyte Stimulator, U937 plasma membranes, TNF\u03b1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.), BSA and uncoated well. Individual colonies containing a phagemid representing one of the unique scFvs from panel 1 were inoculated into 96-well plates containing 100 \u03bcl 2TYAG medium per well. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 4 hours, shaking. M13KO7 helper phage was added to each well to a MOI of 10 and the plates were incubated for a further 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. The plates were centrifuged in a benchtop centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets were resuspended in 100 \u03bcl 2TYAK and incubated at 30\u00b0 C. overnight, shaking. The next day, plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min and the 100 \u03bcl phage-containing supernatant from each well carefully transferred into a fresh 96-well plate. Twenty \u03bcl of 6\u00d7MPBS was added to each well, and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour to pre-block the phage prior to ELISA.","Flexible 96-well plates (Falcon) were coated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with human B Lymphocyte Stimulator (1 \u03bcg\/ml) in PBS, U937 plasma membranes (10 \u03bcg\/ml) in PBS, TNF\u03b1 (1 \u03bcg\/ml) in PBS, BSA (1 \u03bcg\/ml) in PBS, or PBS, After coating, the solutions were removed from the wells, and the plates were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in MPBS, The plates were washed 3 times with PBS and then 50 \u03bcl of pre-blocked phage was added to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and then washed with 3 changes of PBST followed by 3 changes of PBS. To each well, 50 \u03bcl of an anti-gene VIII-HRP conjugate (Pharmacia) at a 1 to 5000 dilution in MPBS was added and the plates incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Each plate was washed three times with PBST followed by three times with PBS, Then 50 \u03bcl of an HRP-labelled anti-mouse polymer (DAKO EnVision) diluted 1\/50 in 3% MPBS was added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Each plate was then washed three times with PBST followed by three times with PBS, Fifty \u03bcl of TMB substrate was then added to each well, and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes or until colour development. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 \u03bcl of 0.5 M HSO. The signal generated was measured by reading the absorbance at 450 nm (A) using a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad 3550).","The results for 3 clones (I006E07, I008D05 and I016F04) are shown in . All 3 scFvs recognize immobilized B Lymphocyte Stimulator and U937 plasma membranes but do not recognize TNF\u03b1, BSA or an uncoated well (PBS only). These results indicate that these scFvs specifically recognize immobilized B Lymphocyte Stimulator and membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator.","All of the unique phage scFvs in panel 1 were assessed for their ability to inhibit soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator binding to its cognate receptor on IM9 cells.","Biotinylation of B Lymphocyte Stimulator","One hundred \u03bcg of either human or mouse B Lymphocyte Stimulator was dialysed overnight at 4\u00b0 C. against 50 mM sodium bicarbonate (sodium hydrogen carbonate) pH8.5 using a slide-a-lyzer cassette (Pierce). The next day, NHS-biotin (Pierce) was dissolved in DMSO to 13.3 mg\/ml. This was then added to the B Lymphocyte Stimulator at a molar ratio of 20:1 biotin:B Lymphocyte Stimulator, mixed and incubated on ice for 2 hours. The biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator was then dialysed back into sterile PBS (Sigma) using a slide-a-lyzer cassette overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The biological activity of the biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator was confirmed using the receptor binding inhibition assay (see below).","Maintenance of IM9 cells","IM9 cells are a human B lymphocyte cell line. They were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine, 10% FCS, 10 U penicillin, 100 g\/ml streptomycin (all reagents from Sigma). The cells are thawed from frozen stock and can be used in assays after 5 days in culture when they reach a density of 4-8\u00d710\/ml.","Receptor Binding Inhibition Assay","Individual colonies containing a phagemid representing one of the unique scFvs from panel 1 were inoculated into 96-well plates containing 100 \u03bcl 2TYAG medium per well.

The supernatant was removed and cell pellets were resuspended in 100 \u03bcl 2TYAK and incubated at 30\u00b0 C. overnight, shaking. The next day, plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min and the 100 \u03bcl phage-containing supernatant from each well carefully transferred into a fresh 96-well plate. Phage were diluted 1 in 2 in MPBS prior to use.","Flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Costar) were coated with 100 \u03bcl per well of a 1:10 dilution of poly-L-lysine (Sigma) in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed twice with water, allowed to air-dry and placed at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. One hundred \u03bcl of IM9 cells (at 10\/ml in RPMI-1640 culture medium) were then added to each well. Plates were then centrifuged at 3200 rpm for 5 mins to pellet the cells. The media was carefully aspirated and 200 \u03bcl of MPBS added to each well. The plates were then allowed to block for 1 hour at room temperature.","To a separate 96-well plate 10 \u03bcl of biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator (at 162.5 ng\/ml) in MPBS was added to each well to give a final concentration of 25 ng\/ml. Fifty-five \u03bcl of each appropriate phage supernatant was added to each well and the final volume in each well was 65 \u03bcl. Plates were then incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes.","The IM9 coated plates were washed twice in PBS, tapped dry and immediately 50 \u03bcl of the phage\/biotinylated-B Lymphocyte Stimulator mix was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Plates were washed three times in PBST and three times in PBS, tapped dry and 50 \u03bcl of streptavidin-Delfia (Wallac) was added to each well at 1:1000 dilution in the Manufacturer's assay buffer.

M13KO7 helper phage (Pharmacia) was added to each tube to a MOI of 10 and incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour, the first 30 minutes static and the final 30 minutes with gentle shaking. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 10 minutes and the supernatant discarded. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml 2TYAK and incubated at 30\u00b0 C. overnight with shaking. The next day, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 10 minutes.

Phage isolated by panning were then screened for the ability to bind to HIS-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator. HIS-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator was obtained by expressing amino acids 71-285 of SEQ ID NO:3228 using the pQE9 vector (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, Calif.) in and purifying the expressed protein.

Binding to HIS-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator was used as a primary screen for scFv's that would bind the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator (see below).

Characterization of these mouse monoclonal antibodies revealed that they specifically recognized both His-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator and the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator on U937 cells, but not soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator. Therefore, specific recognition of His-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator was used as supporting evidence for the recognition of the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator by phage and scFv antibodies.","Phage ELISA","To determine the specificity of each of the scFvs, a phage ELISA was performed for each antibody against His-tagged human B Lymphocyte Stimulator, U937 plasma membranes, TNF\u03b1, BSA and an uncoated well. Antigen coating conditions were as described in 2. apart from human B Lymphocyte Stimulator. B Lymphocyte Stimulator was first biotinylated (as described in Example 3) and coated at 1 \u03bcg\/ml onto streptavidin coated plates (Reacti-Bind, Pierce) for 30 mins at room temperature.

All 3 scFvs recognize U937 plasma membranes (U937) and His-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator (HIS-B Lymphocyte Stimulator) but not, biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator (bio-B Lymphocyte Stimulator) or an uncoated well (PBS). This indicates that the scFvs recognize the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator.","The specificity of the scFvs for only the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, and not for the soluble form, was confirmed using a competition ELISA. This assay assesses the ability of test phage scFvs to bind to the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator on U937 plasma membranes in the presence of different forms of competing B Lymphocyte Stimulator. Competing B Lymphocyte Stimulator was either the His-tagged form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator or soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator. ScFvs specific for the membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator would be expected to be competed out by pre-incubation with His-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator but not by pre-incubation with soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator.","Maintenance of U937 cells and plasma membrane preparations were performed as detailed in Example 2.","Competition ELISA","U937 plasma membranes (50 \u03bcl per well) were coated at 10 \u03bcg\/ml in PBS onto Falcon 96-well plates overnight at 4\u00b0 C.","Individual colonies containing a phagemid representing one of the unique scFvs from the panel 3 were inoculated into 50 ml tubes (Falcon) containing 5 ml 2TYAG medium. Tubes were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 4 hours, shaking. M13KO7 helper phage was added to each tube to an MOI of 10 and the tubes were incubated for a further 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. The tubes were centrifuged in a benchtop centrifuge at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml 2TYAK and incubated at 30\u00b0 C. overnight, shaking. The next day, tubes were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min and the phage-containing supernatant carefully transferred into a fresh tube.","For each test phage antibody, 3 aliquots of 20 \u03bcl 18% marvel\/6\u00d7PBS were transferred into separate wells of a 96-well plate. The first aliquot was supplemented with His-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator to a final concentration of 60 \u03bcg\/ml. The second aliquot was supplemented with soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator to a final concentration of 60 \u03bcg\/ml. The third aliquot was not supplemented with any competing antigen.

When sufficient color has developed, 25 \u03bcl\/well 0.5M HSOwas added to stop the reaction.

All 3 scFvs recognize U937 plasma membranes (U937). This binding is competed out to background levels (i.e. comparable to the signal observed with the anti-TNF\u03b1 phage antibody) in the presence of His-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator (HIS-B Lymphocyte Stimulator) but not biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator (bio-B Lymphocyte Stimulator). This confirms that the scFvs specifically recognize the membrane-bound form but not the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator.","This is a 96-well screen where the test samples (scFvs) are derived from 1 ml periplasmic extracts of individual antibody expressing clones. Potentially higher affinity scFvs are then identified principally as those giving a large number of total RU's bound to a HIS-B Lymphocyte Stimulator surface in BIAcore. This method of ranking does assume approximately equal yields of scFv from each clone. Since this is not always the case, some scFvs may also be identified that simply express high levels of scFv. These can be discriminated from those of higher affinity by further characterization of the scFvs (see Example 18).","Preparation of ScFv from 1 ml Cultures","Individual colonies containing a phagemid representing one of the unique scFvs from panel 3 were inoculated into 96-well plates containing 100 \u03bcl 2TYAG medium per well. Eight wells on each plate were reserved for positive and negative control samples. The plate was grown overnight at 30\u00b0 C. with shaking at 120 rpm.","Next day, 1 ml of 2TYAG+345 mM sucrose was added to each well of an autoclaved 96 deep well plate (Beckman). Twenty \u03bcl of each overnight culture was resuspended and transferred to the appropriate well of the deep well plate. The plate was grown for approximately 3.5 hours at 30\u00b0 C. with shaking at 250 rpm (or until the OD=0.6). Fifty \u03bcl of 1M IPTG was added to 5 ml 2TY and 10 \u03bcl of this was added to each well. The plate was grown overnight at 30\u00b0 C. with shaking at 250 \u03bcm.","Plates were kept at 4\u00b0 C. for the remainder of the procedure. The overnight plate (above) was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. to pellet the cells. The supernatant was decanted and each pellet resuspended in 100 \u03bcl TES (0.2M Tris HCl pH8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5M sucrose) and transferred to a fresh 96 well plate. This plate was incubated on ice for 30 minutes and then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3500 rpm at 4\u00b0 C. to pellet the cell debris. During centrifugation, 15 \u03bcl of freshly made protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche, 1 tablet dissolved in 1.5 ml water) was added to each well of a fresh 96 well plate. Supernatants from the centrifuged plate were then transferred to the plate containing the protease inhibitors. The plate was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. and the supernatant was transferred to a further 96-well plate. This step was repeated at least once more or until there was no sign of any cell debris following centrifugation. Finally, the plate was covered in foil to prevent evaporation of samples during the BIAcore run.","Generation of a High Density HIS-B Lymphocyte Stimulator Surface","All BIAcore analysis was performed on BIAcore 2000 machines, using the BIAcore 2000 control software and evaluated using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software. A high density His-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator surface (>1000 RU HIS-B Lymphocyte Stimulator coupled) was prepared in flow cell 2 by amine coupling to a CM5 chip. A new CM5 chip was inserted into the BIAcore and a sensorgram started over flow cell 2 with HBS buffer at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcl\/min. The NHS and EDC solution were mixed 1:1 before injecting 30 \u03bcl over the CM5 surface. Fifty \u03bcl HIS-B Lymphocyte Stimulator (at 10 \u03bcg\/ml in Sodium acetate buffer, pH4) was injected and allowed to couple to the surface. Thirty \u03bcl of ethanolamine-HCl solution was then injected to block free NHS esters. Prior to using the chip, 10 \u03bcl of 4M Guanidine hydrochloride in HBS was injected over the surface to strip the surface of non-covalently bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator. A blank surface (no HIS-B Lymphocyte Stimulator) was also prepared over flow cell 1 so that non-specific binding effects can be subtracted from the HIS-B Lymphocyte Stimulator binding curves.","Typically, a 5000 RU His-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator surface was generated in this way and used for 96-well analysis of scFvs isolated from the periplasm of ","BIAcore Analysis","The 96-well plate containing periplasmic scFvs was secured inside the BIAcore. Two ml of 4M Guanidine hydrochloride in HBS was placed in a rack inside the BIAcore for regeneration of the HIS-B Lymphocyte Stimulator surface between samples. The sensorgram was run over flow cells 1 and 2 at a flow rate of 20 \u03bcl minute. The following method was run:\n\n","When the run had finished, the sensorgram data for flow cell 1 was subtracted from the data for flow cell 2 for each sample using the BIAevaluation software. The clones were compared with one another principally by overall RU change as the scFv dissociates from the surface. In addition a few scFvs were identified as having potentially slower off-rates. An example of the dissociation section of a typical sensorgram for 8 scFvs is shown in . An anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody that does not recognize B Lymphocyte Stimulator was included as a control. Of the 8 scFvs exemplified, I079F06 was identified for further study due to the relatively high numbers of RU's bound to the surface.","ScFvs were identified principally if they demonstrated a RU change of over 1200, a few were also identified as having potentially slower than typical off-rates.

This assay assesses the ability of test phage scFvs to bind to the membrane-bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator on the murine cell line, P388, plasma membranes in the presence of different forms of competing human B Lymphocyte Stimulator. Competing B Lymphocyte Stimulator was either presented as the His-tagged form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, or soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator. ScFvs that recognize mouse membrane-bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator would give an ELISA signal on the P388 plasma membranes that is competed out by pre-incubation with HIS-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator but not by pre-incubation with soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator.","Maintenance of P388.D1 Cells and Preparation of Plasma Membranes","P388.D1 cells are a mouse monocyte-macrophage like cell line. They were cultured in L15 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% CS, 10U penicillin, 100 g\/ml streptomycin (all reagents from Sigma). Cells were split 1:4 every 3-4 days to maintain a cell density of 2\u22128\u00d710per ml. A fresh aliquot of cells was thawed from liquid nitrogen every 6 weeks. Plasma membrane fractions were prepared as described in Example 2.","Competition ELISA","P388 plasma membranes (501 \u03bcl per well) were coated at 10 \u03bcg\/ml in PBS onto Falcon 96-well plates overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The method is otherwise essentially as described Example 16.","The results for 3 clones, I079E02, I082H08 and I099D03 are shown in . All 3 scFvs recognize P388 plasma membranes. This binding is competed out in the presence of HIS-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator (HIS-B Lymphocyte Stimulator) but not in the presence of biotinylated B Lymphocyte Stimulator (bio-B Lymphocyte Stimulator). This confirms that these scFvs also recognize the membrane-bound form but not the soluble form of mouse B Lymphocyte Stimulator.","The VH domain and the VL domains of scFvs that we wished to convert into IgG molecules were cloned into vectors containing the nucleotide sequences of the appropriate heavy (human IgG1) or light chain (human kappa or human lambda) constant regions such that a complete heavy or light chain molecule could be expressed from these vectors when transfected into an appropriate host cell. Further, when cloned heavy and light chains are both expressed in one cell line (from either one or two vectors), they can assemble into a complete functional antibody molecule that is secreted into the cell culture medium. Methods for converting scFvs into conventional antibody molecules are well known within the art.","Generation of NS0 Cell Lines Expressing Anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator Antibodies (IgG1)","Plasmids containing the heavy and light chains were separately linearized using the Pvu I restriction enzyme. The linearized DNAs were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and then resuspended in HO. NS0 cells (10) from a growing culture were electroporated (0.25 kV and 975 \u03bcF) in PBS with 12.5 \u03bcg linearized heavy chain plasmid DNA and 37.5 \u03bcg linearized light chain DNA. The cells were washed in 20 ml non-selective medium (10% FCS in DMEM supplemented with 6 mM glutamine, amino acids and penicillin\/streptomycin) and then transferred in 12.5 ml medium into a T75 cmflask and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO\/air. The day after transfection the cells were resuspended in selective medium containing 1 mg\/ml geneticin and dispensed into 5\u00d796-well plates at 200 \u03bcl\/well. After 18 days at 37\u00b0 C. (5% CO\/air) the colony supernatants were screened by an ELISA that detects assembled human IgG in order to identify colonies expressing IgG. Approximately twenty positive colonies were expanded and adapted to growth in serum-free, selective medium. Duplicate T25 cmflasks were set up. Cells from one flask were frozen down as a stock and cells in the second flask were grown to saturation. The productivity of the saturated cultures was assessed by ELISA. The highest producing cell lines were then selected for large-scale antibody production.","The above procedure is exemplified for the I006D08 anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody constructs. Following electroporation and selection of NSO cells, supernatants from ninety-three wells each containing a single colony were screened by ELISA to detect assembled IgG1, antibody. Twenty-seven of the supernatants were identified as containing IgG. The colonies from 24 of the positive wells were transferred to 1 ml selective medium in a 24-well plate and allowed to grow for 2 days. The 1 ml cultures of cells were then added to 4 ml selective medium containing reduced serum (0.5% FCS) in a T25 cmflask. When the cultures reached confluency 1 ml cells were diluted in 4 ml selective, serum-free medium in a T25 cmflask. At confluency this subculture regime was repeated again. Finally 1 ml cells from the culture containing 0.1% FCS was diluted with 9 ml serum-free, selective medium and divided into 2\u00d7T25 cmto form the saturated and stock cultures. The stock cultures were frozen down and stored in liquid nitrogen once the cultures were confluent. The saturation culture was grown until the viability of the culture was <10%. Twenty-three out of the 24 colonies originally expanded were successfully adapted to growth in serum-free medium. The productivity of these serum-free adapted cell lines ranged from 0.3 to 17 \u03bcg\/ml by ELISA quantification of the saturated, 5 ml serum-free cultures. The I006D08-32 cell line produced 17 \u03bcg\/ml.","Large-scale IgG Production","The highest-producing cell lines were revived from frozen stocks and then expanded to 400 ml in selective, serum-free medium in 2 liter roller bottles. The cells were grown at 37\u00b0 C. and rolled at 4 rpm with the headspace being re-equilibrated with 5% CO\/air every 2-3 days. Finally the culture was expanded to a 4 liter volume by the addition of serum-free medium without selection (400 ml per 2 liter roller bottle). The cultures were then grown to saturation.","This procedure is exemplified by the production of I006D08 antibody from the I006D08-32 cell line. The frozen stock of I006D08-32 was revived into a T25 cmcontaining 5 ml serum-free medium containing 1 mg\/ml geneticin and grown at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO\/air incubator. After two days growth the culture was diluted with 7.5 ml fresh medium and transferred to a T75 cmflask. After a further three days in the incubator the cells were transferred to 130 ml selective medium and transferred to a 2 liter roller bottle. After three days growth the cells were diluted with 500 ml selective medium and split into 2\u00d72 liter roller bottles. After another 2 days 100 ml fresh selective medium was added to each roller. Finally the next day the culture was expanded to a total volume of 4 liters with non-selective medium and divided into 10\u00d72 liter roller bottles. After three days the medium was supplemented with 6 mM glutamine. The cells were grown for 17 days from the final subculture into a 4 liter volume. The cells grew up to 3\u00d710cells\/ml before viability declined to <0.2\u00d710cells\/ml. At this low viability the culture supernatants were harvested. ELISA analysis indicated that the culture supernatant contained 33 \u03bcg\/ml IgG, Hence, the 4 liter culture contained 132 mg IgG,","IgG Purification","The purification of the IgG from the fermentation broth is performed using a combination of conventional techniques commonly used for antibody production. Typically the culture harvest is clarified to remove cells and cellular debris prior to starting the purification scheme. This would normally be achieved using either centrifugation or filtration of the harvest. Following clarification, the antibody would typically be captured and significantly purified using affinity chromatography on Protein A Sepharose. The antibody is bound to Protein A Sepharose at basic pH and, following washing of the matrix, is eluted by a reduction of the pH, Further purification of the antibody is then achieved by gel filtration. As well as removing components with different molecular weights from the antibody this step can also be used to buffer exchange into the desired final formulation buffer.","Purification of I006D08 IgG1","The harvest was clarified by sequential filtration through 0.5 \u03bcm and 0.22 \u03bcm filters. Clarified harvest was then applied to a column of recombinant Protein A Sepharose equilibrated at pH 8.0 and washed with the equilibration buffer. I006D08 antibody was eluted from the Protein A Sepharose by application of a buffer at pH3.5. The collected antibody containing eluate was then neutralized to pH 7.4 by the addition of pH 8.0 buffer. The neutralized eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a 30 KDa cut off membrane. Concentrated material was then purified by Sephacryl S300HR gel filtration using phosphate buffered saline as the mobile phase. The final monomeric IgG1 fraction from the gel filtration column was then concentrated to the desired formulation concentration by ultrafiltration using a 30 KDa cut off membrane. The final product was filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter.","To determine if an antibody inhibited B Lymphocyte Stimulator mediated B cell proliferation, a splenocyte proliferation assay was performed Briefly, murine splenocytes were isolated by flushing spleen using a 25 g needle and 10 ml of complete medium (RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS containing 100 U\/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin, 4 mM glutamine, 5\u00d710M P-mercaptoethanol). The cells were passed through a 100 micron nylon filter to remove cell clumps. The cell suspension was then ficolled at 400\u00d7g for 25 minutes at room temperature (one 15 ml conical tube\/spleen; 3 ml ficol, 10 ml cell suspension\/spleen; Ficol 1083 from Sigma). The recovered cells were washed 3 times in complete medium and counted. Recovered cells were then diluted to a concentration of 3\u00d710\/ml in complete medium containing a 3\u00d7 concentration of SAC (3X=1:33,333 dilution of stock; stock is a 10% suspension of Staph. aureus (Cowan 1 strain) available from Calbiochem).","For each antibody, 50 microliters of antibody dilutions at 30 \u03bcg\/ml, 3.0 \u03bcg\/ml, and 0.3 \u03bcg\/ml concentrations were aliquotted into individual wells of a 96 well plate in triplicate. Suitable positive controls, such as, for example monoclonal antibody 15C10, were also used. Antibody 15C10 is described in Moore et al., (1999), Science 285: 260-263 and WO0050597; 15C10 has also been deposited with the ATCC\u2122 on Feb. 1, 2000 as ATCC\u2122 Deposit No. PTA-1158. Medium containing no antibody (and human isotype controls (purchased commercially) when necessary) were used as negative controls.","B Lymphocyte Stimulator protein was diluted in complete medium to concentrations of 300 ng\/ml, 90 ng\/ml and 30 ng\/ml. 50 microliters of each of the B Lymphocyte Stimulator dilutions were then added to the antibody dilution series in the plates. The plate containing the antibody and B Lymphocyte Stimulator dilutions are then incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO, after which 50 microliters of the splenocyte cell suspension containing SAC was added to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 72 hours (37\u00b0 C., 5% CO).","After 72 hours, each well was supplemented with 50 \u03bcl of complete medium containing 0.5 \u03bcCi of 3H-thymidine (6.7 Ci\/mM; Amersham) and cells were incubated for an additional 20-24 hours at (37\u00b0 C., 5% CO). Following incubation cells were harvested using a Tomtec Cell Harvester and filters counted in a TopCount Scintillation counter (Packard).","The bioassay for assessing the effects of putative B Lymphocyte Stimulator antagonists was performed in triplicate in 96 well format by mixing equal volumes of B Lymphocyte Stimulator, responder cells, and putative antagonist each of which is prepared as a 3\u00d7 stock reagent.","B-lymphocytes were purified from human tonsil by MACS (anti-CD3 depletion), washed, and resuspended in complete medium (CM) (RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS containing 100 U\/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin, 4 mM glutamine, 5\u00d710E-5 M beta-mercaptoethanol) at a concentration of 3\u00d710e6 cells\/mL. , Cowan I (SAC, CalBiochem) was added to cells at 3\u00d7 concentration (3\u00d7=1:33,333 dilution of stock","Meanwhile, eight serial dilutions (3-fold) of potential antagonist were prepared in CM such that the diluted antagonists are at 3\u00d7 the final concentrations to be tested in the assay.

Potential inhibitors were routinely tested at several concentrations of B Lymphocyte Stimulator to avoid false negatives due to unexpectedly low affinity or antagonist concentration.","Fifty microliters of diluted antagonist and 5 uL of diluted B Lymphocyte Stimulator were added to the putative antagonist dilution series.","Cells were then incubated for 72 hours (37\u00b0 C., 5% CO) in a fully humidified chamber. After 72 hrs., the cells were supplemented with 0.5 \u03bcCi\/well 3H-thymidine (6.7 \u03bcCi\/mmol) and incubated for an additional 24 hours. Plates were harvested using a Tomtec Cell Harvester and filters counted in a TopCount Scintillation counter (Packard).","I116A01 (SEQ ID NO:327) is a CDR3 mutant of the I006D08 (SEQ ID NO:2). The I116A0 I scFv was subsequently isolated from a single chain phage display library containing a repertoire of I006D08 mutations generated by randomization of the last 6 amino acids of the heavy chain CDR3 region of I006D08. The I116A0 I scFv contains 7 amino acid differences from the parental I006D08 sequence, I change in the VH framework 3 region, 5 changes in the VH CDR3, and I change in the VLCDR3. Each of the assays described herein were performed using whole IgG1 molecules comprising the VH and VL regions of I006D08 and I116A01.","Binding studies of I006D08 and I116A01","Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for I116A01 and I006D08 binding to B Lymphocyte Stimulator were assessed using BIAcore technology (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Briefly, antibodies were captured on low-density Protein A surfaces and B Lymphocyte Stimulator was passed over at various flow rates. The binding of B Lymphocyte Stimulator to immobilized antibody was detected by changes in surface charge that were proportional to the amount of bound B Lymphocyte Stimulator. Binding values were calculated using software provided by the manufacturer.","I116A01 was determined to have an equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of 267\u00b170 \u03bcM (mean\u00b1SD, n=3). The Kd value of I006D08, the parental antibody, was determined to be 498\u00b1151 pM (mean\u00b1SD, n=3). This was approximately 2-fold higher than the Kd obtained for I116A01. The difference in affinity can be attributed to a 2-fold higher off rate (kd, 1\/s) of I006D08 compared with I116A01, the on rates (ka, 1\/Ms) being essentially equal (Table 9).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0876","num":"0926"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 9"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Kinetic parameters for I116A01 and I006D08"},{"entry":"binding to B Lymphocyte Stimulator"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"ka, 1\/Ms","kd, 1\/s","Kd, pM"]},{"entry":["Mab","Mean \u00b1 SD","Mean \u00b1 SD","Mean \u00b1 SD"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["I116A01","1.26 \u00b1 0.14 \u00d7 10","3.32 \u00b1 0.63 \u00d7 10","267 \u00b1 70"]},{"entry":["I006D08","1.43 \u00b1 0.13 \u00d7 10","\u20025.8 \u00b1 0.24 \u00d7 10","498 \u00b1 151"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The Kd values obtained for the B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibodies indicate that these antibodies bind to B Lymphocyte Stimulator with high affinity and possess a slow dissociation or off rate.","The binding characteristics of I116A01 and I006D08 were investigated further using a competitive binding ELISA in which B Lymphocyte Stimulator was immobilized directly on the surface of the well to compare epitopes. Biotinylated I006D08 binding was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of unlabeled I006D08 or I116A01 suggesting that these antibodies recognize overlapping or identical epitopes on B Lymphocyte Stimulator.","Ability of I006D08 and I116A01 to Inhibit B Lymphocyte Stimulator-Induced Splenocyte Proliferation","The ability of I006D08 and I116A01 to inhibit B Lymphocyte Stimulator-induced splenocyte proliferation was tested using the assay described in Example 21 with slight modifications. In particular, the assay was modified such that the final concentration of B Lymphocyte Stimulator in the assay was 3 ng\/ml and the final dilution factor of SAC was 1:100,000. Using this assay it was shown that both antibodies I006D08 and I116A01 were each found to inhibit murine splenocyte proliferation induced by both human (aa134-285 of SEQ ID NO:2) and murine soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator. The ICvalues for the inhibition of human B Lymphocyte Stimulator induced-proliferation of murine B cells was 0.09 nM\u00b10.01 nM and 0.06 nM\u00b10.01 nM, respectively.","Additional Characterization of I006D08 and I116A01","I006D08 and I116A01 were identified herein as antibodies that bind both the membrane bound and soluble forms of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. The ability to bind the membrane bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator was determined according to the assays described above, e.g., ability to bind HIS-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator and ability to bind U937 and\/or P388 membrane preparations in an ELISA assay. Further characterization of antibodies I006D08 and I116A01 reveals that these antibodies bind recombinant B Lymphocyte Stimulator polypeptides expressed on the surface of a 293T cell. On the other hand, these antibodies are not able to bind naturally occurring B Lymphocyte Stimulator (non-recombinant) expressed on the surface of a cell, e.g., K562 cells (ATCC\u2122 #CCL-243) or U-937 cells (ATCC\u2122 #CRL-1593.2). Thus, I006D08 and I116A01 bind the soluble form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. I006D08 and I116A01 also bind the membrane bound form of B Lymphocyte Stimulator (as determined by their ability to bind HIS-tagged B Lymphocyte Stimulator and their ability to bind U937 and\/or P388 membrane preparations in an ELISA assay). I006D08 and I116A01 also bind recombinant B Lymphocyte Stimulator expressed on the surface of a 293T transfected fibroblast cell line, but do not bind naturally occurring B Lymphocyte Stimulator protein on the surface of a K-562 or U-937 cell.","Overexpression of B Lymphocyte Stimulator in transgenic animals results in an autoimmune phenotype including increased numbers of mature B cells (leading to enlarged spleens), increased levels of serum immunoglobulins, as well as increased levels of autoantibodies (e.g., anti-dsDNA antibodies) (McKay et al., (1999), The Journal of Experimental Medicine 190:1697-1710 and Gross et al., (2000) Nature 404:995-999, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.) Similar effects are observed when recombinant B Lymphocyte Stimulator is administered to animals such as mice and monkeys. The ability of anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibodies of the invention to reduce or prevent these B Lymphocyte Stimulator induced effects may be tested through either co-administration or sequential administration of soluble B Lymphocyte Stimulator and anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibodies of the invention in an animal. An anti-B Lymphocyte Stimulator antibody of the invention would be considered neutralizing if it prevented or reduced B Lymphocyte Stimulator-induced increases in B cell numbers (resulting in lack of, or less, enlargement of spleen), and serum immunoglobulins, and in particular serum autoantibodies.","The following example describes a large scale antibody production and purification methods that can be used to make antibodies of the present invention.

Cell culture broth temperature is cooled down to 15\u00b0 C. in the recovery vessel at the time of harvest and maintained at that temperature during the recovery. Centrifugation followed by depth filtration is used for cell removal and antibody recovery. The filtration process train consists of 0.1 \u03bcm nominal rated depth filter and 0.2 \u03bcm membrane filters connected in series. A constant flow rate of 13\u00b11 L\/min is maintained during the operation. The 0.2 \u03bcm filtered culture supernatant is collected in a process vessel, warned to 20\u00b0 C. and transferred to purification. The purification process is conducted at 22 to 26\u00b0 C.","Chromatography on rProtein A Sepharose FF Column","The culture supernatant is loaded onto rProtein-A Sepharose FF column (affinity chromatography, Amersham Phamnacia) or equivalent column that is equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5. The rProtein-A Sepharose FF column is washed with 0.05 M sodium citrate, 0.15 M sodium chloride, pH 5.2 and eluted with 0.05 M sodium citrate, 0.15 M sodium chloride, pH 3.2. The elution is monitored by ultraviolet (UV) absorbance at 280 nm. The elution peak is collected, and analyzed by Aand SDS-PAGE.","Virus Inactivation","The eluate from the rProtein-A Sepharose FF column is adjusted with 1 M citric acid to pH 3.4\u00b10.2 and allowed to stand for 45-60 minutes for viral inactivation. The solution is then readjusted to pH 5.4 with 1 M Tris base. The pH adjusted material is 0.2 \u03bcm filtered and stored at 20\u00b0 C. up to 20 hours.","Chromatography on SP Sepharose FF Column","The inactivated material from the rProtein-A Sepharose FF column is diluted with water for injection (WFI) to a conductivity of 7 mS, and loaded onto a SP Sepharose FF column (cation exchanger, Amersham-Pharmacia), or equivalent column equilibrated with 50 mM sodium acetate, 30 mM sodium chloride, pH 5.4. The antibody is eluted from the SP column with 50 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.0. The elution is monitored by ultraviolet (UV) absorbance at 280 nm. The elution peak is collected and analyzed by Aand SDS-PAGE.","Virus Removal Filtration, Diafiltration and Concentration","The eluate from the SP Sepharose FF column is filtered through a sequentially connected 0.2 \u03bcm filter and a virus removal filter (Pall DV50 Ultipor\u00ae VF Filter System). The DV50 filtrate is stored at 20\u00b0 C. up to 8 hours.","The DV50 filtrate is placed into a 30 kD molecular weight cut-off membrane device (Millipore Pellicon) to concentrate to a target concentration of 35-40 mg\/mL. The concentrated material is diafiltered against 10 mM sodium citrate, 1.9% glycine, 0.5% sucrose, pH 6.5. The diafiltered material is monitored by A. The diafiltered bulk is 0.2 \u03bcm filtered and stored at 20\u00b0 C. up to 8 hours.","Chromatography on Q Sepharose FF Column","The diafiltered antibody solution is passed over a Q Sepharose FF column (anion exchanger, Amersham-Pharmacia) or equivalent column equilibrated with 10 mM sodium citrate, 1.9% glycine, 0.5% sucrose, pH 6.5. The antibody is collected in the flow-through and monitored by A. The elution peak is collected and analyzed by A","Bulk Formulation, Filtration and Bulk Drug Substance Fill","Polysorbate 80 (1% stock solution in 10 mM sodium citrate, 1.9% glycine and 0.5% sucrose) is pre-filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter and added to the antibody solution to a final concentration of 0.01%. The purified antibody is aseptically filtered under a laminar flow hood through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter and filled into polypropylene containers.","Storage of Bulk Drug Substance","The bulk drug substance is stored at 2-8\u00b0 C. (short-term storage) or at or below \u221265\u00b0 C. (long-term storage).","In Process Testing","In-process testing of bioreactor culture at harvest for each batch and in-process testing during the purification process are performed. The bioreactor is sampled aseptically and the culture is tested at various times throughout cultivation for cell density, viability and nutrient determination to ensure consistency of material being supplied for purification. The purification process is monitored at each step. Appearance is checked by visual inspection. The protein concentration is determined by Absorbance at 280 nm. The pH of the material is checked. Purity is checked, for example, by SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. An ELISA may be performed to check the ability of the antibody to bind its antigen. The biological activity of the antibody is also monitored. Residual DNA content, Endotoxin levels, and the bioburden (the number of viable organisms present in the antibody preparation) are all monitored and kept at or below standard acceptable levels. Additionally the oligosaccharide content may be analyzed; the peptide sequence of the antibody chains may also be analyzed using N-termini sequencing and peptide mapping. Short and long-term studies of antibody stability may also be performed.","It will be clear that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as particularly described in the foregoing description and examples. Numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and, therefore, are within the scope of the appended claims.","The entire disclosure of each document cited (including patents, patent applications, journal articles, abstracts, laboratory manuals, books, or other disclosures) in this application is incorporated in their entireties herein by reference.
