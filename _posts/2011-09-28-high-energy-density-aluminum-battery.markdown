The Government has certain rights in the invention.","There is great interest and motivation to make a transition from fossil energy based electricity to the generation from renewable sources such as solar or wind. These sources offer enormous potential for meeting future energy demands. However, the use of electricity generated from these intermittent sources requires efficient electrical energy storage. For large-scale, solar- or wind-based electrical generation to be practical, the development of new electrical energy storage systems are critical to meeting continuous energy demands and effectively leveling the cyclic nature of these energy sources. Transformational developments in electrical energy storage are needed. In particular, there are needs for secondary batteries (or secondary batteries assembled in a charged state) made from novel materials that would increase the level of energy storage per unit volume and decrease dead weight while maintaining stable electrode-electrolyte interfaces. There is potential for increases in charge density by utilizing multielectron redox couples, such as in an aluminum battery.","The currently available electric energy storage technologies fall far short of the requirements for efficiently providing electrical energy for transportation vehicles, commercial and residential electrical and heating applications, and even for many electrically powered consumer devices. In particular, electrical storage devices with high energy and power densities are needed to power electric vehicles with performance comparable to that of vehicles powered by petroleum-fueled internal combustion engines.","Previous attempts to utilize aluminum anodes in secondary batteries have been plagued by high corrosion rates, parasitic hydrogen evolution, and a decrease in the reversible electrode potential (i.e., cell voltage is considerably lower than the theoretical value) due to formation of an oxide film on the anode surface.","Compositions and methods of making are disclosed for high energy density aluminum batteries.","In one embodiment, the battery comprises an anode comprising aluminum metal.

It is understood that any term in the singular may include its plural counterpart and vice versa.","As used herein, the term \u201caluminum battery\u201d refers to an aluminum metal anode battery, unless specified otherwise.","As used herein, the term \u201clithium battery\u201d refers to an lithium metal anode battery, unless specified otherwise.","As used herein, the term \u201caluminum metal\u201d includes aluminum metal, aluminum metal alloys, or any other anode composition that includes aluminum metal, or combinations thereof, unless specified otherwise. In certain embodiments, an aluminum metal alloy may comprise at least one of the following alloying elements: copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon, titanium, or zinc. In other embodiments, the aluminum metal may include at least one insertion compound such as graphite, silicon nanowires, or titanium oxide.","As used herein, the term \u201caluminum ion\u201d may refer to any ion comprising aluminum, including but not limited to Al, AlCl, and AlCl.","As used herein, the term \u201clithium ion\u201d may refer to any ion comprising lithium, including but not limited to Li.","As used herein, the terms \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201cprimary battery\u201d refer to any kind of battery in which the electrochemical reaction is generally not reversible (i.e., the reaction cannot be reversed by running a current into the cell to restore the capacity of the battery). Unless otherwise specified, the terms \u201cprimary\u201d or \u201cprimary battery\u201d refer to batteries that are assembled in a charged state wherein the electrochemical reactions are generally not reversible.","As used herein, the terms \u201csecondary\u201d and \u201csecondary battery\u201d refer to rechargeable batteries wherein the electrochemical reactions are electrically reversible (i.e., the reaction can be reversed by running a current into the cell to restore the capacity of the battery). In certain embodiments, the secondary battery can achieve a number of \u201ccycles\u201d (discharge and charge) while maintaining a \u201cfunctional discharge capacity\u201d (i.e., the discharge capacity is more than 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the initial discharge capacity). Unless otherwise specified, the terms \u201csecondary\u201d or \u201csecondary battery\u201d may also refer to batteries that are assembled in a charged state wherein the electrochemical reactions are electrically reversible. In other words, the term may refer to a battery that does not need to be charged prior to its first use (like a typical primary battery), but is still capable of being recharged. For example, in one embodiment, an Al\u2014MnObattery with a lithium ion containing electrolyte constitutes a secondary, rechargeable battery that is assembled in a charged state.","As used herein, the term \u201croom temperature ionic liquid\u201d may refer to an ionic liquid electrolyte that is in its liquid state at room temperature (i.e., approximately 20-25\u00b0 C.). In certain embodiments, the room temperature ionic liquid electrolyte remains in liquid state over a wide composition range. In one non-limiting example, an electrolyte comprising ethylmethylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate is in a liquid state as low as approximately 8\u00b0 C. at approximately a 1:2 molar ratio of aluminum chloride: EMIC. Additionally, the electrolyte remains in a liquid state as low as \u221298\u00b0 C. for a 2:1 molar ratio of aluminum chloride: EMIC. Such ionic liquids have the potential to deposit highly reactive metals such as aluminum that cannot be deposited by an aqueous solution.","As used herein, the term \u201chigh dielectric constant\u201d may refer to an electrolyte that is electrically insulating and ionically conducting by virtue of dissolved ions.","In one embodiment, the battery may be formed with an aluminum anode. Aluminum is an attractive anode material for energy storage and conversion. Its relatively low atomic weight of 26.98 g\/mol along with its trivalence gives a gram-equivalent weight of 8.99 and a corresponding electrochemical equivalent weight of 2.98 amp-hours per gram (Ah\/g), compared with 3.86 Ah\/g for lithium, 2.20 Ah\/g for magnesium and 0.82 Ah\/g for zinc. From a volume standpoint, aluminum should yield 8.04 Ah\/cm, compared with 2.06 Ah\/cmfor lithium, 5.85 Ah\/cmfor zinc and 3.83 Ah\/cmfor magnesium.","In comparison with a lithium battery, the theoretical voltage for aluminum is similar to lithium (2.86 volts v. 3.4 volts, respectively), and due to the mass of aluminum and its trivalency, the aluminum battery has the potential to yield 8-9 times better storage capacity than a lithium battery. If a cathode of approximately the same mass is used in each battery, the aluminum battery can provide approximately 4 times higher energy than the lithium battery.  provides a comparison of the theoretical energy density for various batteries, including aluminum and lithium batteries. Furthermore, an aluminum battery does not necessarily develop a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer between electrolyte and electrode. Also, the aluminum anode can be the protective containment (i.e., it is self-supporting). Additionally, aluminum is both an abundant and relatively inexpensive metal, and the use of a nonflammable ionic liquid electrolyte may provide an increased margin of safety.","Overall, an aluminum battery has the capability of achieving a much higher energy density than a lithium battery. Aluminum batteries have the potential for providing energy densities exceeding 200 Wh\/kg (mass density) and 300 Wh\/liter (volumetric density) at system-level costs below $250\/kWh for various applications. In certain embodiments, the aluminum battery can be used in grid storage applications, vehicle battery applications, portable electronic device application, or standard cell size battery applications. In one particular embodiment, the aluminum battery is used for a grid storage application. In another particular embodiment, the aluminum battery is used in a vehicle battery application.","In one embodiment, the aluminum battery is a primary battery. In another embodiment, the aluminum battery is a secondary battery. In certain embodiments, the secondary battery is capable of having at least 50, 100, 150, 200, or 500 cycles prior to battery failure. In some embodiments, battery failure is related to the functional discharge capacity becoming only 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the initial discharge capacity after a number of cycles. In other embodiments, battery failure is related to the inability to recharge the battery due to dendrite formation, oxide film formation, or other buildup on the anode or cathode. In one particular embodiment, the secondary battery is capable of having a functional discharge capacity greater than 50% of the initial discharge capacity after 50 cycles. In another embodiment, the secondary battery is capable of having a functional discharge capacity greater than 50% of the initial discharge capacity after 150 cycles.","In certain embodiments, the aluminum battery comprises: (1) an anode comprising aluminum metal, (2) a cathode comprising a material capable of intercalating aluminum or lithium ions during a discharge cycle and deintercalating the aluminum or lithium ions during a charge cycle, and (3) an electrolyte capable of supporting reversible deposition and stripping of aluminum at the anode, and reversible intercalation and deintercalation of aluminum or lithium at the cathode.","Anode","In certain embodiments, the anode material comprises aluminum metal. In other embodiments, the anode material comprises an aluminum metal alloy. Non-limiting examples of aluminum metal alloys include an alloying element selected from the group consisting of copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon, titanium, zinc, and mixtures thereof. In yet other embodiments, the anode material comprises an insertion compound. Non-limiting examples of insertion compounds include graphite, silicon nanowires, titanium oxide, and mixtures thereof.","In some embodiments, high purity aluminum foils and wires (99.999%, Aldrich) may be used as anodes and reference electrodes, respectively. In other embodiments, aluminum alloys (with Al as the predominant metal, at least 50%) could also be used as the anodes.","In certain embodiments, during the manufacture of the battery, the anode material is subjected to a pretreatment step to remove oxides from the material. In one embodiment, oxides are removed from the aluminum anode material through an electrochemical reduction step known to one of ordinary skill in the art.","Electrolyte","Suitable electrolytes for an aluminum battery are electrochemically stable within the operation window of the electrodes. In other words, in certain embodiments, the electrolyte is capable of supporting reversible deposition and stripping of aluminum at the anode, and reversible intercalation and deintercalation of aluminum at the cathode. In other embodiments, the electrolyte is capable of supporting reversible deposition and stripping of aluminum at the anode, and reversible intercalation and deintercalation of lithium at the cathode. Suitable electrolytes may include materials that assist in achieving a wide electrochemical window, good ionic conductivity, improved rate capability, long cycle ability, good capacity retention, and compatibility with the anode and cathode materials.","In certain embodiments, the electrolyte materials may be optimized through the addition of suitable co-solvents that may assist in reducing viscosity (increasing mobility) and\/or increasing charge transfer number (increasing salt dissociation).","In certain embodiments, the electrolyte comprises an ionic liquid. In some embodiments, the ionic liquid is a room temperature ionic liquid. In certain embodiments, the room temperature ionic liquid comprises an aluminate material selected from the group consisting of alkylimidazolium aluminates, alkylpyridinium aluminates, alkylfluoropyrazolium aluminates, alkyltriazolium aluminates, aralkylammonium aluminates, alkylalkoxyammonium aluminates, aralkylphosphonium aluminates, and aralkylsulfonium aluminates.","In certain embodiments, the electrolyte includes a compound that is capable of assisting in dissociating Al or Li for intercalation. In certain embodiments, the compound is selected from the group consisting of: aluminum chloride (AlCl), lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate, aluminum trifluoromethane sulfonate (aluminum triflate), butylpyridium chloride, 1-methyl-3-propylimidizolium chloride, a triazolium chloride, or an aluminum bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt. In particular, aluminum triflate and aluminum bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salts may provide electron delocalization of the anions so that Al will not be tightly bonded.","In one embodiment, the molar ratio of the compound (e.g., aluminum chloride) to the aluminate in the ionic liquid is greater than 1:1, which forms an acidic electrolyte. In other embodiments, the molar ratio of the compound to aluminate in the electrolyte is greater than 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, or 10:1. In yet other embodiments, the molar ratio of the compound to aluminate is approximately 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, or 10:1.","In certain compositions comprising excess aluminum chloride to aluminate, the predominant aluminum species in solution is an anion such as AlCl or AlCl. These electrolyte compositions can prevent the formation of oxides on the aluminum anode surface as well as eliminate hydrogen gas evolution. Additionally, acidic electrolyte compositions can minimize the evolution of Cl, which can be prevalent in basic electrolyte compositions.","In one particular embodiment, the ionic liquid comprises ethylmethylimidazolium trifluoromethane sulfonate. In another particular embodiment, the ionic liquid comprises ethylmethylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate. In another embodiment, the ionic liquid comprises aluminum chloride added to the EMIC. The molar ratio of aluminum chloride to EMIC in the electrolyte material is greater than 1:1in certain embodiments, wherein such combination creates an acidic solution. In other embodiments, the molar ratio of aluminum chloride to EMIC is greater than 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, or 10:1. In yet other embodiments, the molar ratio of aluminum chloride to EMIC is approximately 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, or 10:1.","Adjustment of the molar ratio of aluminum chloride to the aluminate can affect the Lewis acidity of the ionic liquid. At AlClmole fractions less than 0.5 in the electrolyte, the anions present are the Lewis bases Cl and AlCl; hence these melts are regarded as basic. On the other hand, at AlClmole fractions greater than 0.5, the stable anions are AlCl and AlCl. Since AlCl is a potential source of the Lewis acid AlCl, these melts are regarded as acidic. Adjustment of the molar ratio of AlClchanges the Lewis acidity of the AlCl-EMIC ionic liquid. This is expected to be a consideration in the design of the battery because it has been demonstrated that the deposition of aluminum occurs from the acidic medium.","In such a reaction, excess AlCldimerizes in the medium to form AlCl, and the equilibrium occurs when AlClis dissolved in the aluminate (EMIC, for example) to form AlCl and AlCl, as shown below in equations (1) and (2):\n\n[AlCl]+Cl[AlCl]\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n2[AlCl][AlCl]+Cl\u2003\u2003(2)\n","In acidic electrolytes, the AlCl species is the electrochemically active species for deposition of aluminum metal according to the following net reaction (3):\n\n4AlCl3 e \u2192Al+7AlCl\u2003\u2003(3)\n","A neutral ionic liquid electrolyte possesses the widest electrochemical window for electrolyte solutions such as AlCl-EMIC. Therefore, in certain embodiments, it may be beneficial to have a neutral electrolyte solution. However, there are difficulties maintaining a neutral electrolyte composition comprising AlCl-EMIC, for example. Therefore, in certain embodiments, an alkali metal halide additive (i.e., neutralizing compound) can be added to the originally acidic electrolyte. In certain embodiments, the neutralizing compound is selected from the group consisting of NaCl, LiCl, lithium chloroaluminate, KCl, NHCl, and mixtures thereof.","In one embodiment, the neutralizing compound is NaCl. In other embodiments, the neutralizing compound is KCl or, NHCl. The salt neutralizes the AlCl anions via the reaction in equation (4) (wherein the neutralizing compound is NaCl in this non-limiting example):\n\nNaCl(s)+[AlCl]Na+2[AlCl]\u2003\u2003(4)\n","In certain embodiments, lithium chloroaluminate is dissolved in the ionic liquid. In one embodiment, the ionic liquid is ethylmethylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate. In these embodiments, the electrolyte works as a reservoir to provide and store lithium cations and chloroaluminate anions. The imidazolium cations in the electrolyte serve as charge carriers to neutralize the charge balance. The reactions are described as the following:\n\nAnode: Al+7AlCl4AlCl+3e\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nCathode: 2MnO+Li+eLiMnO\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nOverall: Al+7AlCl+6MnO+3Li4AlCl+3LiMnO\u2003\u2003(7)\n","In other embodiments, the electrolyte comprises an ionic liquid electrolyte having:","a cation with one of the following structures:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"17.78mm","wi":"66.12mm","file":"US09466853-20161011-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","2","3","4 "]},"an anion having one of the following structures: AlCl, CFSO, B(CO), N(SOCFCF), N(SOCF), N(SOF), PF, BF, and BF(CF), wherein x=1, 2, or 3, and n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.","In certain embodiments, the cation in the ionic liquid is selected from the group consisting of: imidazolium, pyrrolidinium, piperidinium, triazolium, and tetraalkylammonium.","In yet another embodiment, the electrolyte comprises an organic solvent having a wide electrochemical window (e.g., similar or wider than the neutral melt window between \u22122 V and 2.5 V as shown in ) and a high dielectric constant. In certain embodiments, the organic solvent is selected from the group consisting of propylene carbonate, ethylmethylsulfone, ethylmethoxyethylsulfone, and methoxyethylmethylsulfone.","Cathode","In certain embodiments, the cathode comprises a material capable of intercalating aluminum or lithium ions during a discharge cycle and deintercalating the aluminum or lithium ions during a charge cycle. The cathode must readily incorporate Al(III) or Li, either as an anion or as the Al(III) or Li cation after shedding the Cl ligands.","In certain embodiments, for each equivalent of Al which is plated on the anode, three equivalents of AlCl will need to be incorporated in the cathode. In some embodiments, the electrolyte will tend to become more basic as Al is plated on the anode, but part of this problem will be alleviated by incorporation of the AlCl anions in the cathode.","In certain embodiments, the cathode comprises an active material selected from the group consisting of: \u03bb-MnO(or \u03bb-MnO), Ti(AlCl), MnCl(AlCl), Co(AlCl), and VO. In some embodiments, the cathode is \u201cLiMO\u201d [herein defined as any lithium ion cathode material comprising a metal (M) and oxide (O)]. Nonlimiting examples of LiMxOy cathodes include lithium cobalt oxide, lithium iron phosphate, and lithium manganese oxide. In certain embodiments, the battery is a primary battery and the cathode is a material selected from the group consisting of Ti(AlCl), MnCl(AlCl), Co(AlCl), and LiMO.","In certain embodiments, aluminum is inserted into the cathode material lattice. In one particular embodiment, aluminum is inserted into spinel-MnOto form spinel AlMnO. In another embodiment, the cathode material may comprise layered structures of VOaerogels and Al. Hence, AlVOmaterial can be used as a possible cathode material for Al(III) insertion.","In certain embodiments, these active components can be mixed with a carbon material (such as carbon black, for example) to make them conducting, and mixed with a binder (such as PVDF binder in N-methylpyrrolidinole, for example) to hold the material together. In some embodiments, the cathode comprises between approximately 50-90% of AlMnO, Ti(AlCl), MnCl(AlCl), Co(AlCl), and\/or AlVO, 1-20% of binder, and 1-40% of carbon material. In one particular embodiment, the cathode comprises approximately 80% of MnOor AlMnO, approximately 10% of PVDF binder in N-methylpyrrolidinole, and approximately 10% of carbon black.","In yet another embodiment, the cathode may be an air cathode, thereby forming an aluminum-air battery.","In one non-limiting example, the cathode is prepared from Co(AlCl)mixed with powdered graphite to make it conducting (and a binder to hold the material together). In this example, the net reaction during charging will be oxidation of Co(II) to Co(III). During this process, the AlCl anion will be incorporated in the cathode for charge balance. The structure of Co(II) complexed by AlCl anions in an ionic liquid has been shown to be discrete ions with the composition [Co(AlCl)] in which the tetrachloroaluminate ions are bidentate and the Co(II) center is octahedrally coordinated. The structure of Co(AlCl)in the solid state has four tetrachloroaluminate centers bound to each Co(II), two with bidentate coordination and two that are monodentate but bridging. Co(III) will always be octahedrally coordinated. Thus, oxidation of Co(II) to Co(III) is not expected to cause a large change in the coordination environment of the Co center.","In other non-limiting examples, Ti(II) and Mn(II) complexes may also be considered as a transition element for the cathode material.","In another embodiment, the cathode material is \u03bb-MnO. In one example, during the cycle, Al dissolves in the electrolyte from the anode and AlCl anions are formed, consuming the Cl anions generated when Al(III) or Li cations are incorporated in the cathode. During discharge, manganese in oxidation state IV will be reduced to a lower oxidation state at the cathode and the Al(III) or Li ions enter the solid to compensate for the charge. In certain embodiments, the cathode material can be prepared in a \u201creduced\u201d or uncharged state by reacting MnOwith triethylaluminum in a similar manner that butyllithium is used to incorporate Li in cathodes for Li-ion batteries.

The 3-dimensional diffusion of Al ions from one 8a tetrahedral site to another 8a tetrahedral site via the neighboring empty 16c octahedral site can support fast aluminum-ion diffusion through the lattice. Additionally, the edge-shared MnOframework with direct Mn\u2014Mn interaction can provide good electronic conduction. The fast aluminum-ion diffusion together with the good electronic conduction can support high rate capability.

The slurry was homogenized for about 5 min before casting on stainless steel foil with a doctor blade. After drying at approximately 120\u00b0 C., the electrode was pressed under 1 ton load for about 1 min before cutting into discs with diameter of approximately 1.3 cm. The electrode discs were further dried at approximately 120\u00b0 C. under vacuum for 24 hrs before assembling coin cells.

The acidicity of the ionic liquid can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio. A metal halide additive, lithium chloroaluminate (nonhydrate, Aldrich), was dissolved in the ionic liquid to form the electrolyte.

An Al disk and a MnO\/W disk were used as working electrodes, W disk as a counter electrode, and Al wire as a reference electrode. Two pieces of filter paper clamping the Al wire were used as a separator. The electrolyte, acidic 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloroaluminate, has a wide electrochemical window on W electrode, along with reversible Al deposition and dissolution.

The two pairs of peaks between 1.5 V and 2.5 V indicate a two-stage process of lithium insertion and extraction in the spinel structure, which is associated with the structure ordering when lithium ions occupy one half of the tetrahedral 8a sites. The increase of anodic current at potential >2.3V is attributed to the evolution of chlorine in this ionic liquid electrolyte. This is the anodic limit that hinders other materials with higher oxidation potential as cathode in chloroaluminate-based electrolyte. We also study the possibility of Al ion intercalation in \u03bb-MnOcontributing the redox reaction. Without adding lithium chloroaluminate, \u03bb-MnOshows none of the redox peaks in the CV cycling in the pure ionic liquid electrolyte. This confirms that the redox response in  only comes from lithium insertion and extraction.","Coin cells (CR2032) were used as prototype to evaluate Al\u2014MnObattery. An Al disk was used as the anode, a MnO\/W disk as the cathode, Celgard 3014 as the separator, and lithium chloroaluminate dissolved in 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloroaluminate as the electrolyte. The cells were tested using a MTI battery charger. Two charge-discharge regimes, constant current (CC) and constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) were used. In a CC regime, the cells were charged at a C\/10 (15 \u03bcA\/g) current to 2.5 V and discharged at the same current to 1.3 V. In a CC-CV regime, the cells were charged at a C\/10 (15 \u03bcA\/g) current to 2.4 V, held at 2.4 V until the current was less than 1 \u03bcA\/g, and then discharged at the same current to 1.0 V. The current rate was defined as per the theoretical specific capacity of \u03bb-MnO(1 C is equal to 148 mA\/g).","The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the battery is 2.12 V, which is quite stable in an observation at open circuit condition for 24 hours. This implies that both Al and MnOdo not react with the electrolyte at open circuit condition.  shows a typical charge-discharge curve with a constant current (CC) regime at C\/10 (15 mA\/g) current rate between 1.3 V-2.5 V. Both of charge and discharge curves appear a two-stage process, which is corresponding to the dual-peak redox behavior in the CV. The first discharge plateau is around 2.15 V and the second around 1.95 V. The specific charge and discharge capacity are 65 mAh\/g and 74 mAh\/g based on MnOweight. The larger discharge capacity than charge capacity could be attributed to inadequate charge due to the intervention of chlorine evolution. This results in rapid capacity fading under CC charge-discharge regime. In order to mitigate this effect, constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) regime was adopted to charge this battery.  shows the plot of discharge capacity vs. cycle numbers with a regime that the cell is charged to 2.4 V by a C\/10 (15 \u03bcA\/mg) current and kept at 2.4 V until the current is less than 1 \u03bcA\/mg. The discharge capacity is 94 mAh\/g at the first cycle, while decreases to 54 mAh\/g after 50 cycles. The capacity fading mostly occurs in the first 10 cycles. It is known that in a lithium ion battery, the capacity fading of LiMnOcathode largely originates from the dissolution of Mn in the electrolyte. In the case of Al\u2014MnObattery, it appears that the dissolution of Mn is also the major cause of capacity fading. In the discharged state, the electrolyte becomes a more acidic chloroaluminate ionic liquid where low-valence Mn ions may dissolve. The approaches to improving LiMnOcathode in lithium ion batteries maybe also work for MnOcathode in rechargeable Al batteries."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B","sub":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B","sub":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B","sub":["2 ","2","4 ","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B","sub":"2 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B","sub":"2 "}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
