{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to provision of electronic mail services via a cable services network. More particularly, the present invention relates to authorization and authentication of user access to electronic mail services via a cable services network.","With the advent of cable television networks, cable customers have grown accustomed to receiving a variety of television programming from numerous broadcasting sources. In recent years, technology advances have enabled customers to receive an even greater variety of services through cable services networks. Modem cable services networks provide traditional video television programming, telephone services, high-speed Internet access, electronic mail services, video-on-demand, information services, and the like. Through the use of set-top boxes (computing systems) cable services providers can provide interactive television services to customers. Such interactive television services allow customers to interact directly with services providers in response to services and product offerings presented to the customers through their personal television sets.","For provision of electronic mail services, a cable customer may view electronic mail messages on the customer's local television screen via an interactive television session. The customer's set-top box typically serves as a client-side computing device for displaying electronic mail messages to the customer's television screen. Typically, electronic mail messages are received and stored at a backend electronic mail server. The customer accesses the electronic mail server from the customer's set-top box via the cable services network. In order to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to a given customer's electronic mail messages, an authorization and authentication process is typically employed to verify a customer's authorized access to electronic mail files.","In typical electronic mail environments, an electronic mail user must provide credentials such as a username and password to gain access to electronic mail files. However, because most cable customers interact with their television sets through remote control devices, entry of such credentials is difficult. Prior systems sometimes utilize soft keyboards presented on television screens with which a user may slowly and tediously enter credentials such as usernames and passwords. Other systems cause remote control device keys to act as modified keyboards for entry of credentials. With such systems, entry of electronic mail access credentials is cumbersome, time consuming and error prone.","Accordingly, there is a need for an improved method and system for provision of electronic mail services via a cable services network. There is further a need for an improved method and system for interactively providing electronic mail system access credentials via a cable services network interactive television session. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","Embodiments of the present invention solve the above and other problems by providing improved methods and systems for accessing electronic mail services via a cable services network. According to an interactive television system of the present invention, a cable television services customer may interact with services providers through her personal television set via a set-top box. The set-top box controls and facilitates the presentation of video programming and data to the customer's television set. Additionally, the set-top box serves as a client side computing platform for allowing the customer to send and receive data to and from a server-side computing system operated by the customer's interactive television services provider.","According to an aspect of the invention, a cable television services customer may access electronic mail services through the customer's cable television services provider by providing access credentials via an interactive television session through the customer's cable television set-top box. Upon selection of electronic mail services from a menu of services, a determination is made as to whether the customer is an electronic mail services customer. If the customer is an electronic mail services customer, an electronic mail services login page is displayed to the customer on the customer's television display screen by the customer's set-top box.","With the customer's remote control device, the customer may select her username from one or more usernames associated with the set-top box. The customer may then enter a personal identification number using the number keys on the customer's remote control device. The username and personal identification number (PIN) are submitted from the client side set-top box to a backend application server via the cable services network. The application server passes the customer's username to a web services system to request a password for accessing an electronic mail system for the customer's electronic mail messages. The web services system passes a database query to a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) database. At the LDAP database, the username is utilized to obtain data for the customer including a username, password and personal identification number for the customer.","The username, password and PIN for the customer are passed to the application server via the web services system. At the application server, the PIN received from the LDAP database is compared with the PIN submitted by the customer. If the two PINs match, the password received from the LDAP database is utilized by the application server to access the electronic mail system to obtain electronic mail messages received by the customer. The application server first obtains electronic mail header information associated with the electronic mail messages received by the customer. The application server builds an inbox page with the header information and passes the inbox page to the client side set-top box for display to the customer on the customer's television display screen. Alternatively, the application server may send data representing the header information to the set-top box, and the set-top box may build and display the inbox page.","If the customer chooses to view a given message displayed in the inbox, a view request is sent to the application server. After the customer is again authenticated for access to the electronic mail system, electronic mail text for the selected message is obtained by the application server and is sent to the set-top box for display on the customer's television display screen. If the customer chooses to delete a selected electronic mail message, a delete mail request is sent to the application server. The application server accesses the electronic mail system with the customer's verified access credentials and deletes the selected email message.","According to another aspect of the invention, if the customer has never set up a personal identification number, a PIN setup page may be launched for submission of a new PIN. The customer enters a username, password and a new PIN. The username, the password and the new PIN entered by the customer are passed to the application server by the client side set-top box. The application server passes the username to the LDAP database via the web services system. At the LDAP database, a username and password associated with the username from the application server are found and are returned to the application server via the web services system. If the username and password received from the customer at the application server matches the username and password received from the LDAP database, the new PIN submitted by the customer is passed to the LDAP database by the application server via the web services system. The LDAP database stores the new PIN for the customer for subsequent use for authorizing and authenticating access to the electronic mail system by the customer.","These and other features and advantages, which characterize the present invention, will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to improved methods and systems for providing electronic mail services in a cable services network. Embodiments of the present invention provide for improved methods and systems for providing customer authorization and authentication credentials to an electronic mail system via an interactive television session through a cable services network.
