{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLE","CONCLUSION"],"p":["The present Application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/118,115, filed Nov. 26, 2008, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference to the extent it does not conflict herewith.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","The present invention relates to aerosol generators, and more particularly to a highly efficient aerosol generator adapted for producing a highly concentrated monodisperse aerosol over an extended period of time from a relatively small volume of an aerosol material.","Aerosols can be produced through a process of controlled condensation or vaporization-condensation. Generally such a process involves vaporizing an aerosol material and saturating a carrier gas with the generated vapor. The carrier gas and vapor is then cooled under laminar flow conditions. The controlled cooling initiates condensation of the vapor to yield an aerosol. To improve monodispersity and concentration of the aerosol, a common technique called heterogeneous condensation (HC) can be used. The HC technique involves the use of condensation nuclei or seed particles to assist in the formation of the aerosol particles to produce highly concentrated monodisperse aerosols from various liquid and solid aerosol materials.","Typically, a low volatility material (LVM) is selected for use as the aerosol material. The LVM is heated to produce a saturated vapor in the presence of a carrier gas and non-volatile condensation nuclei or seed particles (particle sizes of less than 0.1 \u03bcM) under low flow conditions. The condensation nuclei provide the surface needed to initiate particle formation and growth.","The mixture of vapor and condensation nuclei is thereafter cooled in a controlled manner under laminar flow conditions. The resulting supersaturation causes the vapor to uniformly condense onto the condensation nuclei, thereby yielding a monodisperse aerosol with particles having a narrow size distribution. The resulting particle sizes can be varied over a wide range of from about 0.5 \u03bcm to 5.0 \u03bcm by adjusting the ratio of vapor mass concentration to the number of condensation nuclei.","There are several aerosol generators commercially available on the market, which utilize HC to produce aerosols. Such aerosol generators are used for a variety of applications including observing the behavior of aerosols of specific particle sizes in a particular environment, effects of aerosols on electronic equipment, for example, and the toxicological effects of chemicals when inhaled. However, up to now, the use of such aerosol generators for highly toxic chemical agent testing has been very limited.","Aside from agent specific issues such as potential thermal breakdown and chemical reactivity, one of the principle factors limiting the use of HC aerosol generators is the relatively large quantity of agent needed for operation and the corresponding safety concerns for working personnel. Current aerosol generators commercially available in the market typically require a relatively large loading volume of the aerosol material, normally at least 100 ml, to produce a practical aerosol sample. Such aerosol generators generally include a saturator where the vapor of the aerosol material is produced to saturate the carrier gas passing therethrough. The saturator typically includes a boiler for holding the aerosol material and a heating element operatively associated with the boiler to heat the aerosol material to the state of vaporization. The carrier gas is then bubbled through the heated aerosol material, whereby the released vapor saturates the carrier gas.","The saturators are inherently inefficient, and therefore, require a sizable amount of aerosol material to produce an aerosol over a given period of time. Aerosol generators utilizing such saturators are especially impractical where the aerosol material is toxic and minimal handling is desired or where the aerosol material is expensive or in short supply. Such aerosol generators can pose undue safety hazards to the operators particularly where the aerosol material is highly toxic or dangerous to handle.","Accordingly, there is a need to develop an aerosol generator designed to produce highly concentrated monodisperse aerosols from an aerosol material with enhanced efficiency and reduced loading volumes of the aerosol material. There is a further need for an aerosol generator capable of producing highly concentrated monodisperse aerosols over an extended period of time from a relatively small volume of an aerosol material. There is a further need for a compact and lightweight aerosol generator for providing improved portability and convenient operation in a containment system such as, for example, a glove box.","The present invention relates generally to an aerosol generator adapted for producing a highly concentrated monodisperse aerosol composed of micron- and submicron-size particles from an aerosol material over an extended period of time, and from a relatively small volume of an aerosol material. The aerosol generator of the present invention utilizes a controlled condensation technique to produce the monodisperse aerosol. In particular, the aerosol generator of the present invention utilizes a vaporization-condensation process including, for example, heterogeneous condensation (HC). The technique involves vaporizing an aerosol material or a low volatility material, and allowing it to condense onto non-volatile seed particles or condensation nuclei. This results in the formation of an aerosol with a narrow size distribution. The aerosol generator can be used to produce monodisperse aerosols from a variety of low volatility liquid and solid materials. The aerosol generator of the present invention has the potential to produce near monodisperse aerosols over a wide range of sizes (0.3 to 5 micrometers)","Generally, the aerosol generator of the present invention includes a saturator for forming a vapor from a low volatility material or aerosol material, and a condenser for cooling the vapor of the aerosol material to produce the monodisperse aerosol. In the present invention, a high vaporization rate is achieved with small volumes of the aerosol material through the use of a custom designed saturator. Thus far, this has been proven to be a highly efficient approach for producing aerosols in the 0.7 to 5 micrometer size range with high output mass concentrations. Stable operation can be achieved for extended periods of time such as, for example, sixty minutes with loading volumes as low as 200 \u03bcL. The present invention provides a suitable applicability for testing of chemical agents when it is desirable to maintain quantities of test materials at a minimum.","The saturator of the present invention is designed to substantially enhance the efficiency and effective use of the aerosol material, thereby greatly reducing the loading volumes of the aerosol material and avoiding the limitations associated with prior art devices. Optionally, the aerosol generator of the present invention can further include a source of non-volatile sub-micron condensation nuclei, whereby the condenser cools the vapor of the aerosol material in the presence of the non-volatile sub-micron condensation nuclei to produce the monodisperse aerosol. The aerosol generator of the present invention is cost effective and relatively simple to make and implement.","In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an aerosol generator, comprising:","a saturator including:\n\n","a condenser adapted for receiving the gas containing the vapor from the saturator to produce an aerosol containing the aerosol material.","In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided an aerosol generator, comprising:","a condensation nuclei source for supplying condensation nuclei to a gas;","a saturator including:\n\n","a condenser adapted for receiving the gas containing the vapor and condensation nuclei from the saturator, wherein the vapor of the aerosol material condenses onto the condensation nuclei within the condenser to produce an aerosol containing the aerosol material.","In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a saturator for an aerosol generator, comprising:","an enclosure for passing a gas containing condensation nuclei therethrough from a condensation nuclei source; and","a porous substrate being adapted for retaining a non-vaporized form of an aerosol material, wherein the porous substrate is further adapted to release a vaporized form of the aerosol material resulting in the formation of a vapor for introduction into the gas passing through the enclosure.","The present invention is directed generally to an aerosol generator adapted for producing a highly concentrated monodisperse aerosol composed of micron- and submicron-size particles from an aerosol material over an extended period of time, and from a relatively small volume of an aerosol material.

The aerosol generator of the present invention is configured to produce aerosols over a wide range of particles of up to 5 micrometers in diameter.","Generally, the aerosol generator of the present invention includes a saturator for forming a vapor from a low volatility material or aerosol material, and a condenser for cooling the vapor of the aerosol material to produce the monodisperse aerosol. In the present invention, a high vaporization rate is achieved with small volumes of the aerosol material through the use of a custom designed saturator.

The aerosol generator of the present invention is cost effective and relatively simple to make and implement.","In one embodiment of the present invention, an aerosol generator includes a saturator having an enclosure for passing a gas therethrough, and a porous substrate adapted for retaining a non-vaporized form of an aerosol material, wherein the porous substrate is further adapted to release a vaporized form of the aerosol material for introduction into the gas within the enclosure, and a condenser adapted for receiving the gas containing the vapor from the saturator to produce an aerosol containing the aerosol material.","The term \u201caerosol\u201d, as used herein, is a relatively stable suspension of fine solid or liquid particles in a gas such as, for example, air.","The term \u201cmonodisperse\u201d, as used herein, refers to a property of an aerosol, whereby each of the individual aerosol particles exhibits the same or substantially the same size, shape and mass characteristics within a geometric standard deviation of less than 1.15.","The term \u201caerosol material\u201d, as used herein, refers to any liquid or solid material having relatively low volatility at standard temperature and pressure, which is vaporized and then condensed to produce an aerosol.","The term \u201cporous substrate\u201d, as used herein, refers to any refractory material having sufficient porosity or wicking capacity to receive and retain an amount of a low volatility material or aerosol material for subsequent vaporization, and maintaining a relatively high surface area to volume ratio with respect to a gas stream flowing in contact therewith. Preferably, the porous substrate is composed of a ceramic, including but not limited to, alumina such as, for example, fused alumina.","Referring to , there is shown an aerosol generator identified generally by reference numeral  in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The aerosol generator  is adapted to produce an aerosol through the process of vaporization-condensation, preferably heterogeneous condensation (HC). Although the present invention is described in context of a heterogeneous condensation-based system, it will be understood that the present invention can be readily adapted to produce an aerosol via the process of homogenous condensation, as one skilled in the art will recognize.","In the present embodiment, the aerosol generator  is configured to produce high-concentration monodisperse aerosols, while maintaining or extending the period of time of aerosol production from a relatively small volume of the aerosol material. In this manner, the aerosol generator  allows the user to work with smaller quantities of aerosol material that would otherwise not be possible with prior art devices.","In the present embodiment, the aerosol generator  includes a condensation nuclei source  adapted for producing condensation nuclei or seed particles, a saturator  adapted for holding a quantity of an aerosol material or low volatility material and producing a vapor thereof, a reheater  adapted for heating a gas flowing therethrough, a condensation chimney or condenser  adapted for cooling a gas flowing therethrough, and an aerosol dilutor . The condensation nuclei source  further includes a carrier gas source  for supplying an inert carrier gas such as nitrogen gas (N), an atomizer  (e.g., Collison atomizer), and a desiccant dryer .","A carrier gas , preferably an inert gas such as nitrogen gas, is used in the aerosol generator  to prevent or minimize chemical reactions with the aerosol material used. As described above, the carrier gas  is supplied from the carrier gas source  into the aerosol generator  via a conduit  to the atomizer . The atomizer  contains a salt solution  (e.g., a very dilute sodium chloride (NaCl) solution). As the carrier gas  passes therethrough, the atomizer  sprays the salt solution 0.78 from a nozzle  forming very tiny droplets (about 1 \u03bcm to 3 \u03bcm particle sizes) to yield a droplet-laden gas stream . The gas stream  is conveyed to the desiccant dryer  via a conduit .","The desiccant dryer  contains a desiccant substance or drying agent  (e.g., calcium oxide or silica gel) that removes water from the droplets in the gas stream . The gas stream  passes through an open channel  lined with a screen or mesh  within the desiccant dryer . Any moisture or water vapor diffuses through the screen  and absorbed by the drying agent  as the aerosol passes through the desiccant dryer . The drying process produces small crystals with sizes of from about 10 nm to 100 nm, depending on the original concentration of the salt solution , to yield a condensation nuclei gas stream .","The condensation nuclei gas stream  is then conveyed via a conduit  to the saturator  housed within a heating device . The saturator  includes an enclosure  through which the condensation nuclei stream  pass, and a porous substrate  disposed within the enclosure  in contact with the passing gas stream . The porous substrate  is adapted for retaining a non-vaporized form of an aerosol material, which upon heating releases a vaporized form of the aerosol material. The porous substrate  is configured to provide a high surface area for evaporation. The high surface area allows the operating temperature to be reduced while maintaining the rate of vaporization. The lower operating temperature also beneficially minimizes undesirable thermal degradation of the aerosol material. The saturator  produces a condensation nuclei-vapor gas stream , which is saturated with the vapor of the aerosol material. Depending on the temperature and vapor pressure, a precise saturation concentration of the vapor can be achieved in the gas stream .","The heating device  is configured to heat the porous substrate  and the aerosol material retained within the saturator . The heating device  preferably heats the porous substrate  to a temperature of from about 50\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C. The heating device  can selected, for example, from a convection oven, an electrically resistive heating element or a heat bath. Preferably, the heating device  includes an electrically resistive heater , which is positioned proximate to the enclosure  and the porous substrate . In the present embodiment of the invention, the heater  includes an aluminum heater block in the form of a half-cylinder that partially envelops the saturator  without physical contact therebetween.","The carrier gas-condensation nuclei-vapor stream  exiting the saturator  is conveyed into the inlet  of the reheater . The reheater  includes a series of resistive heating elements (not shown) to supply heat to the gas stream . The gas stream  is heated to a temperature above the temperature of the oven  to yield a vapor saturated gas stream . This ensures that no condensation takes place upstream of the condenser  and that the condensation nuclei are free of any volatile materials such as residual water. This also ensures that any prematurely formed condensation is re-evaporated and does not adversely affect the formation of the aerosol. Preferably, the temperature in the reheater  is at least 50\u00b0 C. higher, and more preferably from about 50\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C. higher than the temperature in the saturator .","The heated vapor saturated gas stream  exits through the outlet  of the reheater  and into the condenser  for cooling. The condenser  can be air-cooled or water-cooled. The condenser  cools the gas stream  as the vapor of the aerosol material and the nuclei moves therethrough. The condenser  directs the flow of the gas stream  in a downwardly direction to promote a smooth laminar flow preventing or at least substantially minimizing the formation of eddies or turbulence. The laminar flow facilitates a uniform particle growth process.","The resulting supersaturation of the vapor of the aerosol material in the gas stream  causes the vapor to condense onto the condensation nuclei to yield an aerosol . The aerosol  is subsequently passed through the dilutor  which may optionally add a dilution gas  supplied by an air source  via a conduit . The dilutor  is adapted to greatly minimize particle aggregation or coagulation, thereby stabilizing the resulting aerosol particle size. The dilution gas  passes through an inlet  of the dilutor  for mixing with the aerosol . The resulting mixture exits an outlet  of the dilutor  to yield a sample  of the aerosol  at a desired concentration.","Referring to , the saturator  includes a vessel  defining the enclosure  in which the porous substrate  is disposed, an inlet port , an outlet port  and an aerosol material loading port . In the present embodiment, the porous substrate  is a hollow ceramic thimble or tubular body  having a closed end , an open end , and interior and exterior surfaces  and , respectively. In the present embodiment of the invention, the ceramic thimble  is composed of fused alumina having an aluminum oxide (AlO) content of less than 90%. It will be understood that the composition of the ceramic thimble  is not limited to this embodiment, and may encompass any suitable ceramic or ceramic-like material as known to one of ordinary skill in the art.","The loading port  of the saturator  provides direct fluid communication with the thimble  in the enclosure  and enables the operator to load the aerosol material onto the thimble  via direct injection. The amount of the aerosol material can vary from about 100 \u03bcL to 1000 \u03bcL. With the ceramic thimble  loaded with the aerosol material, a closure cap or stopper  is replaced to cover the opening of the loading port .","Note that the porous substrate  can be composed of any suitable porous refractory material and\/or configured to have any suitable shape or configuration suitable for facilitating the vaporization of the aerosol material. Alternatively, the porous substrate  may be in the form of a pellet bed, a column or any form that maximizes the surface area to volume ratio thereof provided that the configuration does not restrict the flow or passage of the condensation nuclei through the saturator .","The vessel  of the saturator  is configured to direct from the conduit  a flow of the gas stream  containing the carrier gas (e.g., nitrogen gas) and the condensation nuclei at a flow rate of about 1 liter per minute over the interior and exterior surfaces  and , respectively, of the porous ceramic thimble  in a double pass fashion. The inlet port  of the saturator  includes an internal open-ended tube or pistol  extending into the thimble  through the open end  thereof within the enclosure  of the vessel . During operation, the gas stream  entering the saturator  from the condensation nuclei source  flows into contact with the interior and exterior surfaces  and , respectively, of the thimble  as it passes from the inlet port  toward the outlet port , thus producing a multi-pass flow.","The wicking action of the ceramic thimble  allows the aerosol material to spread over the porous surfaces  and , respectively, thereby creating a large surface area for promoting vaporization. As the aerosol material vaporizes from the ceramic thimble , the gas stream  picks up the newly formed vapors and exits the vessel  via the outlet port  as the vapor saturated gas stream . The vaporization rate of the aerosol material from the saturator  is mainly a function of temperature and flow rate of carrier gas through the vessel  of the saturator .","Heating of the saturator  can be accomplished in any number of ways provided that the temperature surrounding the vessel  is controlled to within 0.5\u00b0 C. or better. Examples of heating devices  that Applicant has tested include a 1 cubic foot convection over, a small 0.2 cubic foot custom made oven, or a constant temperature oil bath. A preferred heating device  is an oven having a heater  including a truncated cylindrical body composed of a metal having an inner diametric area for receiving and partially enclosing the saturator  and supplying heat to the vessel  housing the porous substrate .","The selection of the composition of the condensation nuclei is based upon factors such as compatibility with the material being aerosolized, analytical methods being applied, and the like. The presence of a very high concentration (>10particles\/cm) of condensation nuclei, however, is essential for efficient operation of the aerosol generator . Hence the passages through the saturator  must be unrestricted and sized appropriately to minimize loss of condensation nuclei via diffusional deposition in transit through the enclosure . The nuclei, generally less than 0.1 \u03bcm in size, can be generated by a number of different technologies ranging from compressed air atomization to a high voltage spark, provided that the method chosen produces a stable concentration of particles.","The following is a summary of recent tests in which the performance of the present aerosol generator was evaluated in terms of various operating parameters including loading volume, saturator flow rate, and heating method.","Methods:","All aerosol generator tests described herein were conducted with diethyl sebacate (DES), a low volatility colorless to yellowish liquid having a high boiling point of about 312\u00b0 C. DES has been proposed as a candidate simulant for chemically hazardous operations.","The prototype aerosol generator  was prepared from a modified Model 3470 monodisperse aerosol generator obtained from TSI, Inc. of Minneapolis, Minn., in which the original 125 mL saturator vessel was replaced with one of two different sized multipass saturators  of the present invention constructed for Applicant by Glassblowers.com, Inc., of Tumerville, N.J.","Other components of the model 3470 generator system, including the saturator convection oven , the reheater , and the vapor condenser , were basically unchanged for the first series of tests. The first multi-pass saturator  of the present invention included a 25 mm OD glass tube with tubing connection at each end and was designed for working liquid volumes of 0.5 to 3 mL. The main body of the present saturator  contained a 19\u00d750 mm hollow ceramic thimble  designed to increase the effective contact area between the challenge liquid to be vaporized and the nitrogen carrier gas. A second physically smaller saturator  of the present invention, containing a 13\u00d740 mm ceramic thimble , was designed to work with loading volumes in the range of 0.1 mL to 1 mL.","A more transportable version of the present aerosol generator was produced by replacing the 1-cubic foot convection oven of the TSI Model 3470 with a smaller (0.15 cubic foot) custom made mini-oven  with no moving parts. The mini-oven  was sized to fit the smaller saturator  of the present invention with the 13\u00d740 mm ceramic thimble . Performance of the mini-oven based aerosol generator  was tested in a more recent second series of tests.","Condensation nuclei in the form of sub-micron sodium chloride particles were formed by nebulization of a dilute aqueous saline solution (20 mg\/liter) using a standard single jet Collison atomizer  available from BGI, Inc. of Waltham, Mass. The saline solution  was prepared with ultra-pure water and subsequently filtered and refrigerated to reduce impurities and to minimize bacterial growth. The atomizer  was operated with pressurized nitrogen at 20 psig with a resulting flow rate of about 2.4 liters per minute. Atomized droplets thus formed were passed through a desiccant drier system  to remove water vapor and promote complete droplet evaporation leaving a residual salt particle of sub-micron size. Nuclei production rate was initially evaluated with a Model 3022 Condensation Particle Counter available from TSI, Inc. of Minneapolis; Minn.","Aerosols produced in the present aerosol generator  were immediately diluted at the outlet of the air condenser  approximately 10-fold to form a 20 liters per minute (lpm) air stream and diverted to a multi-port sampling manifold for evaluation. The sampling manifold was interfaced to various devices designed to assess aerosol mass concentration and particle size distribution. This includes two real time aerosol monitors: the Model 8520 DustTrak\u2122 Aerosol Monitor, and the Model 3320 Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS), each available from TSI, Inc. of Minneapolis, Minn., along with dual filter samplers loaded with glass fiber media (Pall Type NE, 0.3 \u03bcm). Quantification of all filter samples was accomplished by means of gravimetric analysis.","Results:","The presence of a sufficient concentration of condensation nuclei was a key factor in efficient aerosol generator operation. Initial tests, run to evaluate saline nuclei production rate from the single jet Collison atomizer  operated at a pressure of 20 psig, indicated a nuclei production rate of 2 to 3 million particles per minute. This is a sufficiently high seed particle production rate for maximizing the conversion of vaporized test material to usable aerosol output. Based on the saline solution concentration (20 mg\/liter), and the output characteristics of the Collison atomizer , the median size of the condensation nuclei is estimated at 0.05 \u03bcm.","Testing of the initial prototype aerosol generator  using the present saturator  in the convection oven of the commercial generator revealed that the system was capable of producing a highly concentrated aerosol output with a well controlled and highly focused particle size distribution. Table 1 below summarizes salient results for two sizes of the present saturator  and various saturator flow rates at the same oven temperature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0067"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of prototype aerosol generator performance"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Load","Satu-",{},{},"Oper-",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Vol-","rator",{},{},"ating","Output*",{}]},{"entry":["Satu-","ume","Flow","MMAD",{},"Time","Conc.","Generation"]},{"entry":["rator","(mL)","(lpm)","(\u03bcm)","GSD","(min)","(mg\/m)","Efficiency"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["19 \u00d7 50","2","2.4","2.94","1.31","40","1240","50%"]},{"entry":["19 \u00d7 50","2","2.4","2.32","1.37","40","1110","45%"]},{"entry":["19 \u00d7 50","2","1.4","3.47","1.21","60","910","58%"]},{"entry":["19 \u00d7 50","2","1.4","3.41","1.23","50","753","38%"]},{"entry":["19 \u00d7 50","2","0.9","3.95","2.14","70","538","38%"]},{"entry":["13 \u00d7 40","1","0.9","2.68","1.31","96","217","42%"]},{"entry":["13 \u00d7 40","\u2002\u20090.5","0.9","3.09","1.15","50","297","59%"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Oven Temperature - 136\u00b0 C.; *Generator output flow = 20 lpm"}]}}]}}},"With a 2 mL loading volume of the stimulant in the larger (19\u00d750 mm) saturator  of the present invention, aerosol output concentrations on the order of 1 gm\/mwere easily achieved at the highest saturator flow tested (2.4 lpm). Aerosol size distributions were quasi-monodisperse with geometric standard deviations (GSD) ranging from 1.14 to 1.37. The present aerosol generator  was operated steadily for about 40 to 60 minutes under these conditions. Reduction of the saturator flow at the same oven temperature had the effect of reducing mass output but increased the effective operating time of the generator.
