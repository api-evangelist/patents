title: Rich entity for contextually relevant advertisements
abstract: Described herein is an in-text advertising display that presents web advertisements contextually related to retrieved web content about text on a web page. The text of a web page is analyzed to determine whether terms or phrases are associated with particular contextual definitions called entities. Portions of text associated with an entity are emphasized to the user. Detection of a user trigger event initiates retrieval of additional web content about the emphasized text and the retrieved additional content is displayed in a display window, within a pop-up advertisement, or within a quickbar window. An adjacent seamless window displaying web advertisements related to the additional web content is also presented to the user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["As the Web becomes an increasingly popular medium for advertisers, web pages are being cluttered with disjointed web advertisements. Users viewing web pages are often inundated with advertisements that are not relevant to the content in the web pages or not related to the underlying meaning of words in the web pages' text. For instance, a web page detailing information about the celebrity Paris Hilton (a celebrity) may contain advertisements for trips to the city of Paris or nights at a particular hotel. Bombarding users with poorly chosen advertisements generally results in a frustrating experience for the users and fewer selections of advertisements.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","One aspect of the invention is directed to displaying user-interactive web content associated with text on a web page. In this embodiment, an entity database storing entity definitions associated with text phrases is accessed to determine if a portion of text on the web page is associated with an entity definition. If so, the portion of text is emphasized and subsequent user trigger events will initiate the display of additional web content in a display window and related web advertisements in a seamless second window. The web advertisements may change whenever the user opts to view different types of additional web content in the display window.","Another aspect is directed to a user interface (UI) display that presents additional web content about a portion of text on a web page and seamlessly presents web advertisements that correlate to the underlying contextual meaning of some of the additional web content. The additional web content may be organized according to type of content (e.g., audio, video, and news). Also, the web advertisements may change based on the additional web content is being displayed.","The subject matter described herein is presented with specificity to meet statutory requirements. The description herein is not intended, however, to limit the scope of this patent. Instead, the claimed subject matter may also be embodied in other ways, to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies.","In general, embodiments described herein are directed to displaying web advertisements so publishers of web pages can leverage the content of their web pages to optimize web advertising. Specifically, web advertisements are selectively displayed on a web page based on the underlying meaning (or \u201ccontextual relevance\u201d) of identified groups of words within the web page. In one embodiment, the text of a web page is parsed to determine whether the text contains any words or phrases associated with a particular contextual meaning, and if so, the words or phrases are converted into links that provide a path to additional web content. The linked text may be visually emphasized (e.g., underlined, highlighted, etc.) and configured to display the additional web content and\/or the web advertisement after a triggering event (e.g., mouse click, mouse hover, etc.).","An example will provide some high-level clarity to some of the embodiments discussed below. Suppose a web publisher creates a web page. In one embodiment, all the text on the web page is parsed to determine whether the text contains a particular type of contextually relevant text, like celebrity names. Each celebrity name on the web page may be converted into a link to additional web content about the given celebrity. When a user viewing the web page performs a triggering event on emphasized text, multiple UI windows may be displayed in a visually seamless fashion. One window, referred to in this example as the \u201cweb content window\u201d displays the additional web content related to the linked celebrity name and options for viewing the additional web content. Another window, called the \u201cadvertisement window,\u201d displays various web advertisements related the celebrity name and the additional web content being viewed in the web content window. Additionally, web advertisements may be selectively displayed in the advertisement window based, in part, on the user's preferences or history. This example is provided merely to describe one example embodiment and is not necessarily meant to apply to all embodiments.","Before proceeding further, some terms should initially be defined. The terms \u201cweb advertisement,\u201d \u201centity,\u201d \u201cweb service,\u201d \u201cseamless window,\u201d and \u201cadditional web content\u201d are described below for a better understanding of the embodiments mentioned herein. These definitions are provided for guidance in navigating through the discussions below; however, one skilled in the art may understand various other meanings associated with these terms. For example, the term \u201cweb service\u201d may imply many additional software and hardware components not described herein to one skilled in the art. As such, the definitions provided below are not all encompassing but instead supplement the understanding of these terms to one skilled in the art.","A web advertisement refers to an online advertisement presented on a web page. A web advertisement, while seemingly presented as a single file, may in fact include various image, text, audio, video, or other data files pulled from different online sources. The embodiments described herein mention web advertisements as displayable impressions of advertising.","An entity refers to the underlying context associated with one or more terms on a web page. Often, web pages are crawled to identify the terms and phrases within their web content, and the terms and phrases are analyzed to understand their contextual meaning. In particular, entities refer to classifications of the underlying contextual meaning of terms and phrases, which may be dictated by cultural, societal, demographic, or other norms. For example, terms that together constitute the name of a celebrity may be assigned to an entity indicating the terms a celebrity classification. In another example, a word displayed in a certain geographic location, such as \u201cSEAHAWKS\u201d in the state of Washington, may be assigned to a sports entity. Whereas, Seahawks in a different part of the country\u2014such as South Carolina\u2014may be assigned to an entity associated with birds. Multiple entities may be used to properly classify the meaning of text on the Web. In one embodiment, an entity is stored in a database as an \u201centity definition\u201d with various relationships to different terms or phrases. An entity definition is simply a representation of the contextual meaning assigned to an entity.","Web services, as described herein, refer to software designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. In one embodiment, a web service is an application programming interface (API) executing on a server and accessible to a remote computing device. Web services may include, for example, server-based applications configured to search a database, locate web advertisements, retrieve audio files, or the like. The list of existing and possible web services is virtually infinite, many of which are well known to those skilled in the art.","Web services typically use a client-server relationship to communicate computations of a server (or remote computing device) to a client computing device. This type of computing is commonly referred to as \u201cin-the-cloud\u201d computing. To support web services, servers may be configured with a server-based operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows Server\u00ae), server-based database software (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server\u00ae), or other server-based software.","Web services may communicate documents, such as extensible markup language (XML) or hypertext markup language (HTML) documents, containing various forms of data using the simple object access protocol (SOAP). For example, a web service that publishes and manages web pages may need to communicate the HTML documents associated with the web page. Moreover, a web service that locates text in web content referring to entities may query a database server to determine whether words or phrases parsed from the web content have previously been associated with an entity.","A \u201cseamless window\u201d is a UI window displayed within a web browser. In one embodiment, seamless windows are used to present web advertisements in a visually congruent manner with another UI displaying additional web content about an entity on the web page. Seamless windows may match the color, theme, font, animation, color pattern, color fade, or other characteristic of the additional web content. In effect, visually seamless windows appear as a mere extension of the UI window populated with additional web content. In one embodiment, a web advertisement in a seamless window is contextually relevant to the additional web content. For example, if the additional web content includes a news story about a particular type of product, the seamless window may be populated with the product or a competitor of the product.","Additional web content, as used to herein, refers to web content not found on the web page. Examples include, without limitation, online videos, audio, images, news, images, products, or other web content.","In one embodiment, a quickbar UI may be used to present the additional web content when text is associated with an entity. A quick bar, as referred to herein, is a miniature UI window showing a mini preview of the most popular additional web content for a given entity. For example, a celebrity name may initiate a quickbar displaying photographs or news headlines because celebrity photography and news is quite popular. Or, in another example, a musician may initiate a quickbar loaded with previews of the musician's discography. The quickbar may be displayed within close proximity to the text associated with the entity. In one embodiment, no advertisements are shown with the quickbar so the quickbar can be presented in a small window. The user may optionally dismiss the mini preview in the quickbar. In another example, when the user clicks the quickbar more frequently, another icon may be shown that, when selected, presents the additional content window, which is described in more detail below. As the user smoothly transitions to the additional content window, the mini preview quickbar may be configured to disappear leaving only the additional content window.","Embodiments mentioned herein may take the form of a computer-program product that includes computer-useable instructions embodied on one or more computer-readable media. Computer-readable media include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and nonremovable media, and contemplates media readable by a database. The various computing devices, application servers, and database servers described herein each may contain different types of computer-readable media to store instructions and data. Additionally, these devices may also be configured with various applications and operating systems.","By way of example and not limitation, computer-readable media comprise computer-storage media. Computer-storage media, or machine-readable media, include media implemented in any method or technology for storing information. Examples of stored information include computer-useable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data representations. Computer-storage media include, but are not limited to, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash memory used independently from or in conjunction with different storage media, such as, for example, compact-disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), digital versatile discs (DVD), holographic media or other optical disc storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage, or other magnetic storage devices. These memory components can store data momentarily, temporarily, or permanently.","Having briefly described a general overview of the embodiments described herein, an exemplary operating environment is described below. Referring initially to  in particular, an exemplary operating environment for implementing one embodiment is shown and designated generally as computing device .

In one embodiment, computing device  is a personal computer. But in other embodiments, computing device  may be a cell phone, smartphone, digital phone, handheld device, BlackBerry\u00ae, personal digital assistant (PDA), or other device capable of executing computer instructions.","Embodiments may be described in the general context of computer code or machine-useable instructions, including computer-executable instructions such as program modules, being executed by a computer or other machine, such as a PDA or other handheld device. Generally, machine-useable instructions define various software routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, remote procedure calls (RPCs), and the like. In operation, these instructions perform particular computational tasks, such as requesting and retrieving information stored on a remote computing device or server.","Embodiments described herein may be practiced in a variety of system configurations, including handheld devices, consumer electronics, general-purpose computers, more specialty computing devices, etc. Embodiments described herein may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote-processing devices that are linked through a communications network.","With continued reference to , computing device  includes a bus  that directly or indirectly couples the following devices: memory , one or more processors , one or more presentation components , input\/output ports , input\/output components , and an illustrative power supply . Bus  represents what may be one or more busses (such as an address bus, data bus, or combination thereof). Although the various blocks of  are shown with lines for the sake of clarity, in reality, delineating various components is not so clear, and metaphorically, the lines would more accurately be grey and fuzzy. For example, one may consider a presentation component such as a display device to be an I\/O component. Also, processors have memory. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that such is the nature of the art, and, as previously mentioned, the diagram of  is merely illustrative of an exemplary computing device that can be used in connection with one or more embodiments of the present invention. Distinction is not made between such categories as \u201cworkstation,\u201d \u201cserver,\u201d \u201claptop,\u201d \u201chandheld device,\u201d etc., as all are contemplated within the scope of  and reference to \u201ccomputing device.\u201d","Computing device  typically includes a variety of computer-readable media.

Network  may include any computer network or combination thereof. Examples of computer networks configurable to operate as network  include, without limitation, a wireless network, landline, cable line, fiber-optic line, local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or the like. In an embodiment where network  comprises a LAN networking environment, components are connected to the LAN through a network interface or adaptor in an embodiment where network  provides a LAN networking environment, components used a modem, or other means for establishing communications over the WAN, to communicate. Network  is not limited, however, to connections coupling separate computer units. Instead, network  may also include subsystems that transfer data between servers computing devices. For example, network  may include a point-to-point connection as well as the Internet. Computer networks should be well known to one skilled in the art, and therefore does not need to be discussed at length herein.","In one embodiment, the publisher embeds a script  within a web page . When rendered by a web browser, script  provides instructions for identifying what text the publisher wishes to analyze for entities. Script  is coded in a scripting language like JavaScript, VBScript, or the like. The following is a JavaScript example of script  that could be added to the head block of web page .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<script type = \u201ctext\/javascript\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003src=\/\/gaze.live.net\/GazeScript.js\u201d><\/script>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{},"b":"24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<div id=\u201dD033697cdd5dd5b2d4eec828299f97ba30cf2\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Madonna is a great artist!"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/div>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"In one embodiment, script , when executed by a web browser plug-in (e.g., Microsoft SilverLight\u2122 or Adobe Flash) provides access to the entity service  and communicates the text identified by the div block (or like script indication). Upon receipt of the identified text, the entity service  parses the wrapped text into individual terms and accesses the entity database  to determine whether the terms are associated with any entities. If so, the entity service , in one embodiment, emphasizes the entity-associated terms in web page \u2014e.g., by underlining, bolding, italicizing, animating, highlighting, or providing some other visually perceptible emphasis. Whereupon, the user viewing web page  on client computing device  will see an emphasized rendition of the entity-associated text in the web content.","Once text is emphasized, a detected trigger event may induce the presentation of a UI window displaying additional web content (referred to hereafter as \u201cthe additional content window\u201d). Trigger events may be performed any number of ways, such as by a mouse hover, mouse click, toolbar selection, or selection of keys. In one embodiment, a miniature toolbar of options described below is presented whenever the user hovers a mouse cursor over emphasized text.","Multiple options for viewing the web content may also be presented to the user in the additional content window. Icons can be displayed giving the user options to view news, highlights, profile data, videos, and images or listen to audio that is contextually relevant to the text and the identified entity associated therewith. When an icon is selected, the options and the icons in the additional content window are illustrated, as shown in  and described in greater detail below.","Entity extraction may be influenced by entity data  and  submitted by the publisher and administrator, respectively. In addition, the entities may be selected based, in part, on tracking data  from the user. Tracking data  is data indicating a user's web-search history, content preferences, and\/or viewing preferences. Tracking data  may be retrieved from cookies, online profile information, web history, or historical UI-viewer selections transmitted to tracking service . In particular, historical UI-viewer selections are tracked icon selections previously selected by the user.","In operation, application server  supports web services , which include hosting service , tracking service , entity service , ad service , and information service . Hosting service  handles publication of web page  and stores web page  in sites database . Tracking service  receives tracking data  from the user and stores tracking data  in tracking database . Entity service  handles parsing the text of web page  designated by script  and identifying entities in the entity database  related to the parsed text.","Additional web content is retrieved by information service , which is configured to find different types of web content. In one embodiment, information service  contacts a search engine (e.g., MSN\u00ae or Windows Live\u2122) to retrieve the additional web content associated with text upon which a trigger event was detected.","In one embodiment, entity service  communicates the identified text to be emphasized to client computing device . Information service  retrieves additional web content about entity-associated text from database . As previously mentioned, additional web content may include audio, video, news, headlines, profile data, or the like and is eventually passed to client computing device .","Entity service  parses the web content of web page  for known entities indicated in entity database . Entity database  stores associations of text terms or phrases with entity definitions. For example, the name \u201cMadonna\u201d may be associated in the entity database  with the entity definition \u201ccelebrity.\u201d In one embodiment, the administrator submits entity data  to the entity database  to define the relationships between entity definitions and terms. For example, the administrator may specify that \u201cParis Hilton\u201d is associated with a celebrity.","Alternatively, entity data  may indicate what entities are to be assigned to what types of web advertisements. The administrator may also filter web advertisements for display based on geographic areas, user age, user gender, user history (as identified by shared cookies, user-profile data, or user search history), and so forth. For example, entities associated with celebrities may be set to trigger impressions of web advertisements about different dress makers to women of certain age group in a particular geographic area because a highly publicized red-carpet event will take place in that geographic area.","The publisher can also specify entity data (indicated as entity data ) relevant to the publisher. This allows the publisher to limit the web advertisements being displayed on top of the web page  to a particular entity. Doing so is useful when the publisher has data indicating monetary effectiveness (e.g., high click-thru rate) of certain kinds of web advertisements. For example, the publisher may specify, in the entity data , that only web advertisements relating to certain entities (e.g., celebrities) or combinations of entities (e.g., celebrities+sports) are to be displayed on web page .","Ad service  selects web advertisements for the emphasized text from ads database . When selecting web advertisements, ad service  may consider additional other inputs to select appropriate web advertisements. For instance, ad service  may use entity data  and  from the publisher or administrator, respectively. Ad service may use tracking data  from the user. Ad service may receive an indication of what the user is currently viewing in the additional content window. For example, when the user views a news headline mentioning a particular vehicle, ad service  can select a web advertisement about the vehicle. In this scenario, ad service  uses the underlying contextual relevance of the news headline to select a web advertisement. This same principle can be applied to other types of web content, such as audio, video, etc.","Moreover, entity service  may switch web advertisements being displayed based on what the user is viewing in the additional content window. When the user cycles through the additional web content, the ad service  selects a different web advertisement related to what the user is currently viewing. For example, if the UI window is displaying news events and one of the news items is about a particular vehicle, the ad service  can initially select a web advertisement for the vehicle. If the user then begins to view images associated with the entity-associated text, the ad service  can select a web advertisement for a particular dress in one of the images.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304"]},"When found, text related to an entity is emphasized on the web page, as indicated at . Emphasis may be indicated through underlining, highlighting, animating, or otherwise visually identifying the identified text. The user can trigger the display of an additional content window populated with additional web content. If a triggering event is recognized, as indicated at , additional web content related to the identified text is retrieved, as indicated at . In one embodiment, the additional web content is contextually related to the entity and the identified text. For example, if the identified text is \u201cMadonna\u201d and the entity is \u201ccelebrity,\u201d the additional web content would be related to the celebrity named Madonna. As indicated at , the additional web content is displayed in an additional content window, such as an overlay window rendered over the web page.","A seamless window for a web advertisement is determined, as indicated at .
