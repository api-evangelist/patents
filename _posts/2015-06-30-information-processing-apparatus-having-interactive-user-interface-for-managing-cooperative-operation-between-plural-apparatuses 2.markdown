In this illustrative embodiment, the resumption processing is an example of the registration processing of re-adding the operation information of a corresponding apparatus to the cooperation operation list. The resumption processing is described in detail with reference to .","First, the control program  determines whether the operation instruction information has been already transmitted to the apparatus corresponding to the tapped \u201cRe\u201d icon (S). In this illustrative embodiment, since the operation instruction information has not been transmitted yet to the multi function device A (S: No), the control program  re-adds the operation information of the multi function device A to the cooperation operation list (S). Specifically, as shown in , the control program  sets the execution sequence corresponding to the apparatus ID \u201cMFC-A\u201d to a third and sets the execution sequence corresponding to the apparatus ID \u201cMFC-C\u201d to a fourth.","Also, the control program  changes the progressing status corresponding to the apparatus ID \u201cMFC-A\u201d from \u201ccancel\u201d to \u201coperation standby\u201d (S).

In the meantime, processing which is executed when the position of the \u201cRe\u201d icon corresponding to the apparatus having already transmitted the operation instruction information is tapped (Yes in S: S & S), will be described in a modified embodiment.","The execution sequence of the first operation of reregistering the operation information in the cooperation operation list in step S is not particularly limited inasmuch as it is executed before the second operation. That is, the corresponding operation may be executed after the first operation being currently executed or after the final first operation. This is also the same for the execution sequence of the second operation of reregistering the operating information in the cooperation operation list in step S.","Subsequently, when the transmission completion information is received from the multi function device B through the communication interface  (S), the control program  transmits the operation instruction information to the multi function device A of which the execution sequence is third, through the communication interface  (S). This operation instruction information is an instruction to enable the scanner unit  to execute the scan processing and to transmit the target data  generated in the scan processing to the portable device . In the meantime, since the processing of updating the cooperation operation list and cooperation operation screen, which is executed as the operation instruction information is transmitted to the multi function device A, is common to the above example, the overlapping description is here omitted.","The control program  of the multi function device A having received the operation instruction information from the portable device  through the communication interface  executes the first operation of transmitting the target data  generated in the scan processing to the portable device  (S). The control program  of the portable device  stores the target data  received from the multi function device A through the communication interface  in the data storage area B. Then, when the transmission of the target data  to the portable device  is completed, the control program  of the multi function device B transmits the transmission completion information to the portable device  (S).","When the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping the position of the \u201cD\u201d icon added to the status image  (S) before the transmission completion information is received from the multi function device A through the communication interface , for example, the control program  of the portable device  deletes the target data  stored in the data storage area B (S). The processing of step S is an example of the deletion processing. That is, the target data  is not transmitted to the multi function device C in step S, which will be described later.","Subsequently, when the transmission completion information is received from the multi function device A through the communication interface  (S), the control program  hides all the icons added to the status images  to . Also, the control program  transmits the operation instruction information to the multi function device D of which the execution sequence is fourth, through the communication interface  (S). This operation instruction information is an instruction to enable the printer unit  to receive the target data ,  from the portable device  and to execute the recording processing of the target data , . Further, the control program  transmits the target data ,  to the multi function device C through the communication interface . Since the processing of updating the cooperation operation list and cooperation operation screen, which is executed as the operation instruction information is transmitted to the multi function device C, is common to the above example, the overlapping description is here omitted.","The control program  of the multi function device C having received the operation instruction information from the portable device  through the communication interface  executes the second operation of receiving the target data ,  from the portable device  and enabling the printer unit  to record images represented by the target data ,  on a recording sheet (S). Also, when the reception of the target data ,  from the portable device  through the communication interface  is completed, the control program  transmits the reception completion information to the portable device  through the communication interface  (S). In the meantime, the reception completion information may also be transmitted before the recording processing by the printer unit  is completed.","According to the above illustrative embodiment, when the operation instruction information is transmitted, the \u201cE\u201d icon is set to be unselectable, and when the transmission completion information or reception completion information is received, the \u201cC\u201d icon is set to be unselectable. That is, since the states of the corresponding \u201cE\u201d icon and \u201cC\u201d icon are changed in correspondence to the progressing statuses of the operations of the respective apparatuses, it is possible to enable the user to easily recognize whether it is possible to change the operation of each apparatus. That is, it is possible to implement a user interface for easily changing the operation of each apparatus individually. In the above illustrative embodiment, the processing that is executed when the positions of the various icons corresponding to the first apparatus are tapped has been described. However, the description also applies to a case where the positions of the various icons corresponding to the second apparatus are tapped. The processing of modified embodiment, which will be described later, is also the same.","In particular, according to the above illustrative embodiment, when the cooperation operation is executed based on the cooperation operation list including an unnecessary operation, it is possible to selectively exclude only the unnecessary operation by the \u201cC\u201d icon during the execution of the cooperation operation. Also, it is possible to delete the target data, which is acquired by the unnecessary first operation, by the \u201cD\u201d icon. Further, it is possible to re-add a falsely excluded operation to the cooperation operation by the \u201cRe\u201d icon. As a result, it is possible to optimize the cooperation operation without re-executing the cooperation operation from the beginning.","In the above illustrative embodiment, when the variety of icons are displayed on the cooperation operation screen, they can be selected at all times, and when the icons are hidden, they cannot be selected. However, the method of disabling the various icons from being selected is not limited thereto. That is, the variety of icons may be displayed in an unselectable aspect as such by displaying the icon on the cooperation operation screen in a grayed-out mode. In the meantime, the description \u2018a state where an icon can be selected\u2019 conveys the meaning that the processing associated with the icon is executed by the tapping operation and the like, for example. In the meantime, the description \u2018a state where an icon is set to be unselectable\u2019 conveys the meaning that the processing associated with the icon is not executed by the tapping operation and the like, for example.","Also, the function, which is implemented by tapping the position of the \u201cC\u201d icon, is not limited to the example of the above illustrative embodiment. For example, when the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping the position of the \u201cC\u201d icon corresponding to all the first apparatuses, the control program  may stop the operation instruction processing (S) for the second apparatus. As another example, in the change processing that is executed when the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping the position of the \u201cC\u201d icon corresponding to all the second apparatuses, the control program  may transmit stop instruction information, which will be described later, to all the first apparatuses being executing the first operation, through the communication interface .","That is, when one of all the first operations and all the second operations are cancelled, it is not necessary to execute the other operations. That is, when the position of the \u201cC\u201d icon corresponding to all the first operations or all the second operations is tapped, the cooperation operation is preferably ended. In the meantime, when only one first or second apparatus is included in the cooperation operation list, the control program  may set the \u201cC\u201d icon corresponding to the apparatus that is unselectable. In this case, the user who wants to end the cooperation operation has only to tap the position of the cancel icon.","Meanwhile, in the above illustrative embodiment, a next operation is enabled to start after one operation is completed. However, the start timing of each operation is not limited thereto. For example, the control program  of the portable device  may transmit the operation instruction information to all the first apparatuses through the communication interface  without waiting for the reception of the transmission completion information. Then, when the transmission completion information is received from all the first apparatuses through the communication interface , the control program  may transmit the operation instruction information to all the second apparatuses through the communication interface  without waiting for the reception of the reception completion information. Thereby, since the plurality of first operations or the plurality of second operations is executed in parallel, the throughput of the cooperation operation is improved.","Also, in the above illustrative embodiment, one of the cooperation operation lists registered in advance is selected on the cooperation operation selection screen, so that the cooperation operation is enabled to start. Thereby, the operation registered in advance in the cooperation operation list can be deleted or changed after the cooperation operation starts. At this time, the input method of the start instruction and the acquisition method of the cooperation operation list are not limited to the above examples.","As an example, when the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping a position of a start instruction icon (not shown) of the cooperation operation after the user interface  receives the user's operation of tapping the position of the cooperation operation icon in step S, the control program  may start the cooperation operation. In this case, the processing of receiving the tapping operation two times and starting the cooperation operation is another example of the reception processing of receiving the selection instruction and the start instruction.","As another example, the selection of the first apparatus and the second apparatus, the selection of the operation to be executed by each apparatus, the designation of the execution sequence of each operation and the input of the start instruction may be performed on one screen. That is, the description \u2018the cooperation operation list is acquired\u2019 in step S conveys the meaning of reading out the cooperation operation list registered in advance from the data storage area B or acquiring the cooperation operation list from the user through the user interface .","A modified embodiment of the operation of the cooperation system  is described with reference to . In the meantime, the common elements of the above illustrative embodiment are denoted with the same reference numerals, the descriptions thereof are omitted, and the differences are mainly described.","For example, when the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping the position of the \u201cC\u201d icon of the apparatus ID \u201cserver A\u201d (S) on the cooperation operation screen shown in  before the transmission completion information is received from the server apparatus  through the communication interface , the control program  of the portable device  executes the cancel processing (S). The cancel processing of the modified embodiment is an example of the change processing of stopping an operation being executed in a corresponding apparatus. The cancel processing is described in detail with reference to .","When the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping the position of the \u201cC\u201d icon corresponding to the server apparatus  having already transmitted the operation instruction information (S: Yes), the control program  transmits stop instruction information to the server apparatus  through the communication interface  (S). The stop instruction information is information for enabling an apparatus of a transmission destination to stop an operation being executed.","Also, as shown in , the control program  changes the progressing status corresponding to the apparatus ID \u201cserver A\u201d from \u201cunder operation\u201d to \u201cunder suspension\u201d (S). Accompanied by this, the control program  changes the progressing status of the status image  from \u201cunder operation\u201d to \u201cunder suspension\u201d, and adds the \u201cRe\u201d icon and \u201cD\u201d icon rather than the \u201cC\u201d icon to the status image , as shown in . That is, in the modified embodiment, when the position of the \u201cC\u201d icon corresponding to the apparatus having transmitted the operation instruction information is tapped, the \u201cRe\u201d icon and the \u201cD\u201d icon are added to the corresponding status image.","The server apparatus  having received the stop instruction information from the portable device  stops the first operation being executed (S) and transmits resumption information to the portable device  (S). The resumption information is information for specifying a resumption position of the first operation. For example, the resumption information may be information for specifying a position of target data of which transmission is completed or information for specifying a position of target data that is to be transmitted next time.","Subsequently, the control program  of the portable device  stores the resumption information received from the server apparatus  through the communication interface  in the data storage area B and stands by until the user interface  receives a user's input operation. In the meantime, when predetermined standby time elapses after the position of the \u201cC\u201d icon is tapped or when predetermined standby time elapses after the resumption information is received, the control program  may start an operation that should be executed subsequently to the operation under suspension. Also, when the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping the position of the \u201cD\u201d icon, the control program  may delete the target data, which has been received by the first operation under suspension, from the data storage area B and start an operation that should be executed subsequently to the first operation.","Then, when the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping the position of the \u201cRe\u201d icon, which corresponds to the server apparatus  in which the first operation is under suspension, within a standby time period (S), the control program  executes the resumption processing (S). The resumption processing of the modified embodiment is an example of the resumption instruction processing of resuming an operation under suspension in a corresponding apparatus. The resumption processing is described in detail with reference to .","When the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping the position of the \u201cRe\u201d icon corresponding to the server apparatus  having already transmitted the operation instruction information (S: Yes), the control program  transmits the resumption instruction information to the server apparatus  through the communication interface  (S). The resumption instruction information is information for enabling an apparatus of a transmission destination to resume an operation under suspension. The resumption instruction information includes the resumption information stored in the data storage area B, for example. The server apparatus  having received the resumption instruction information from the portable device  resumes the first operation from the resumption position specified by the resumption information (S).","Also, the control program  of the portable device  changes the progressing status corresponding to the apparatus ID \u201cserver A\u201d from \u201cunder suspension\u201d to \u201cunder operation\u201d, as shown in  (S). Accompanied by this, the control program  changes the progressing status of the status image  from \u201cunder suspension\u201d to \u201cunder operation\u201d and adds the \u201cC\u201d icon rather than the \u201cRe\u201d icon and \u201cD\u201d icon to the status image , as shown in .","Subsequently, when the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping the position of the \u201cE\u201d icon added to the status image  (S) before the transmission completion information is received from the server apparatus  through the communication interface , the control program  executes correction processing (S). The correction processing is processing of correcting an operation content of an operation to be executed by a corresponding apparatus. The correction processing is described in detail with reference to .","First, as shown in , the control program  sets \u201cON\u201d for the standby flag of the apparatus ID \u201cMFC-A\u201d corresponding to the tapped \u201cE\u201d icon (S). Then, the control program  displays a correction reception screen rather than the cooperation operation screen on the display  (S).  illustrates an example of the correction reception screen. The correction reception screen shown in  includes the setting information registered in the cooperation operation list, an \u201c>\u201d icon for receiving correction of each setting information, and an \u201cOK\u201d icon. When the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping a position of the \u201c>\u201d icon on the correction reception screen, the control program  receives an input of corrected setting information. Although the specific input method of the setting information is not particularly limited, the setting information may be selected from a pull-down menu, for example.","Subsequently, when the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping a position of the \u201cOK\u201d icon (S: Yes), the control program  changes an operation content of the apparatus ID \u201cMFC-A\u201d of the cooperation operation list to the corrected operation content received through the correction reception screen (S). Also, the control program  displays the cooperation operation screen rather than the correction reception screen on the display . Further, as shown in , the control program  sets \u201cOFF\u201d for the standby flag corresponding to the apparatus ID \u201cMFC-A\u201d (S).","In the meantime, when the transmission completion information is received from the server apparatus  through the communication interface  (S: No) at timing at which the correction reception screen is displayed on the display , i.e., before the position of the \u201cOK\u201d icon on the correction reception screen is tapped, the control program  stands by for the transmission of the operation instruction information to the multi function device A. Then, when the user interface  receives a user's operation of tapping the position of the \u201cOK\u201d icon on the correction reception screen (S: Yes), i.e., when the display of the correction reception screen is over, in other words, when \u201cOFF\u201d is set for the standby flag (S: Yes), the control program  transmits the operation instruction information to the multi function device A through the communication interface  (S).","According to the modified embodiment, since it is possible to individually correct the falsely set operation content, it is not necessary to again execute the cooperation operation from the beginning. Also, while \u201cON\u201d is set for the standby flag, i.e., while the operation content is being corrected, the operation instruction information is not transmitted to the apparatus. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the operation from starting based on the falsely set operation content. In the modified embodiment, the cooperation operation is under suspension while \u201cON\u201d is set for the standby flag. However, the control of the cooperation operation is not limited thereto. For example, the operation in which \u201cON\u201d is set for the standby flag may be skipped over and a subsequent operation may be first executed.","Also, according to the above modified embodiment, it is possible to enable an apparatus under operation to temporarily stop the operation by tapping the position of the \u201cC\u201d icon and to resume the operation by tapping the position of the \u201cRe\u201d icon. Also, since the stopped operation is resumed from the middle of the operation based on the resumption information, the decrease in the throughput of the cooperation operation is suppressed. The resumption control on the operation by the resumption information is particularly effective for the second apparatus configured to execute the second operation of recording images on a plurality of recording media, for example. For example, when the operation is stopped at timing at which images are recorded on two sheets of 10 recording sheets, an image may be recorded on a third recording sheet and thereafter upon the resumption.","In the above illustrative embodiment, the variety of programs stored in the program storage area A, A of the storage ,  of the multi function device  or portable device  are executed by the CPU , , so that the respective processing to be executed by the control unit of the present disclosure is implemented. However, the configuration of the control unit is not limited thereto, and a part or all of the configurations may be implemented by hardware such as IC (abbreviation of Integrated Circuit).","Further, the present disclosure can be implemented not only by the multi function device  or portable device  but also by a program configured to enable the multi function device  or portable device  to execute the processing. The program may be provided with being recorded in a non-transitory recording medium. The non-transitory recording medium may include a storage mounted to a server that can be connected to the multi function device  or portable device  through the communication network, in addition to a CD-ROM, a DVD-ROM and the like. The program stored in the storage of the server apparatus may be delivered through the communication network such as the Internet, as information or signal representing the program."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the accompanying drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["10","50","10","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["65","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-6C","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B"],"b":"53"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A and 7B","FIG. 8A","FIG. 8B"],"b":"53"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A and 9B","FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B"],"b":"53"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A-10E","FIGS. 10A-10EA","FIGS. 10A-10EB","FIGS. 10A-10EC","FIGS. 10A-10ED","FIGS. 10A-10EE"],"b":["31","32","35","37","40"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 12A-12B","FIG. 12A","FIG. 12B"],"b":"53"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 13A-13D","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13C","FIG. 13D"],"b":["71","75","61","65"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
