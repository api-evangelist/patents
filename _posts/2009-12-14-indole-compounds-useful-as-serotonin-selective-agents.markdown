application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/237,318, filed Sep. 27, 2005, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/613,944, filed Sep. 27, 2004, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The invention was made at least in part with National Institutes of Health grants #1-R43-MH63529-01-A1 and #5-R43-DK065322-02. The U.S. Government may have certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to novel indole compounds, and their use as selective agents at serotonin receptors.","Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) plays a significant role in influencing a large number of central and peripheral processes. 5-HT-selective pharmacotherapies have been developed to treat a wide variety of medical problems including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, migraine, emesis, and appetite control (Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, Volume 32, 2002, Academic Press, Fitzgerald, L., Ennis, M. \u201c5-HTReceptor Modulators: Progress in Development of New CNS Medicines\u201d pp 21-30). 5-HT exerts its influence through activation of fourteen distinct receptor subtypes in seven separate families. There is particular interest in the three receptor subtypes of the 5-HTfamily, 5-HT, 5-HT, and 5-HT. Modulation of the 5-HTreceptor subtype has been shown to play a role in numerous human diseases including obesity, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), sexual dysfunction, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders (Roth, B., Shapiro, D. \u201cInsights into the Structure and Function of 5-HT2 Family Serotonin Receptors Reveal Novel Strategies for Therapeutic Target Development\u201d 2001, 5, 685; Martin, J., Bos, M., Jenck, F., Moreau, J-I., Mutel, V., Sleight, A., Wichmann, J., Andrews, J., Berendsen, H., Broekkamp, C., Ruight, G., Kohler, C., van Delft, A. \u201c5-HTReceptor Agonists: Pharmacological Characteristics and Therapeutic Potential\u201d 1998, 286, 913). However, the transmembrane sequence homology between the 5-HTreceptor and the 5-HTand 5-HTreceptors is high (Bickerdike, M., Vickers, S., Dourish, C. \u201c5-HTReceptor Modulation and the Treatment of Obesity\u201d 1999, 1, 207; Glennon, R., Dukat, M., El-Bermawy, M., Law, H., De Los Angeles, J., Teitler, M., King, A., Herrick-Davis, K. \u201cInfluence of Amine Substituents on 5-HTversus 5-HTBinding of Phenylalkyl- and Indolylalkylamines\u201d 1994, 37, 1929). Thus selectivity for the 5-HTreceptor can be difficult to obtain, however such selectivity is important from a drug development standpoint. 5-HTreceptor agonists are associated with heart valve toxicity (Rothman, R., Baumann, M., Savage, J., Rauser, L., McBride, A., Hufeisen, S., Roth, B. L. \u201cEvidence for Possible Involvement of 5-HTReceptors in the Cardiac Valvulopathy Associated with Fenfluramine and other Serotonergic Medications\u201d 2000, 102, 2836; Fitzgerald, L., Burn, T., Brown, B., Patterson, J., Corjay, M., Valentine, P., Sun, J-H., Link, J., Abbaszade, I., Hollis, J., Largent, B., Hartig, P., Hollis, G., Meunier, P., Robichaud, A., Robertson, D. \u201cPossible Role of Valvular Serotonin 5-HTReceptors in the Cardiopathy Associated with Fenfluramine\u201d 2000, 57, 75) and pulmonary hypertension (Launay, J., Herve, P., Peoc'h, K., Tournois, C., Callebert, J., Nebigil, C., Etienne, N., Drouet, L., Humbert, M., Simonneau, G., Maroteaux, L. \u201cFunction of the Serotonin 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2B Receptor in Pulmonary Hypertension\u201d 2002, 8, 1129). However, the 5-HTreceptor is found only in the CNS (Bickerdike, M., Vickers, S., Dourish, C. \u201c5-HTReceptor Modulation and the Treatment of Obesity\u201d 1999, 1, 207; Martin, J., Bos, M., Jenck, F., Moreau, J-I., Mutel, V., Sleight, A., Wichmann, J., Andrews, J., Berendsen, H., Broekkamp, C., Ruight, G., Kohler, C., van Delft, A. \u201c5-HTReceptor Agonists: Pharmacological Characteristics and Therapeutic Potential\u201d 1998, 286, 913), and agonists that discriminate for 5-HTover 5-HTshould not display cardio- or pulmonary toxicity. Selectivitiy for 5-HTover 5-HTreceptors is also important since agonists at 5-HTgenerally display undesirable hallucinogenic activity (e.g. LSD, psilocybin).","Psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) is an agonist at the 5-HTand 5-HTreceptors. Its binding potency at 5-HTcorrelates with its activity as a hallucinogen in humans (Delgado, P. L., Moreno, F. A. \u201cHallucinogens, Serotonin, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\u201d 1998, 30, 359; Perrin, D. M. \u201cHallucinogens and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\u201d 1999, 156, 1123; Moreno, F. A., Delgado, P. L. \u201cHallucinogen-Induced Relief of Obsessions and Compulsions\u201d 1997, 154, 1037). More than 40 years ago, some derivatives of psilocybin were reported by workers at Sandoz (Hofmann, A., Troxler, F. U.S. Pat. No. 3,075,992; U.S. Pat. No. 3,078,214). This work was carried out prior to the ability to test for activity at specific serotonin receptor subtypes. More recently, considerable effort has been made in seeking selective 5-HTreceptor ligands. The indole Ro 60-0175 (Martin, J., Bos, M., Jenck, F., Moreau, J-I., Mutel, V., Sleight, A., Wichmann, J., Andrews, J., Berendsen, H., Broekkamp, C., Ruight, G., Kohler, C., van Delft, A. \u201c5-HTReceptor Agonists: Pharmacological Characteristics and Therapeutic Potential\u201d 1998, 286, 913; Bos, M., Jenck, F., Martin, J., Moreau, J-I., Sleight, A., Wichmann, J., Widmer, U. \u201cNovel Agonists of 5-HTReceptors. Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Substituted 2-(Indol-1-yl)-1-methylethylamines and 2-(Indeno[1,2-b]pyrrol-1-methylethylamines Improved Therapeutics for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\u201d 1997, 45, 2762) is 25 times more active at 5-HTas compared to 5-HT, however it is not selective over 5-HTreceptors (Bickerdike, M., Vickers, S., Dourish, C. \u201c5-HTReceptor Modulation and the Treatment of Obesity\u201d 1999, 1, 207). Certain 1-methyl-5-substituted indoles reported by Lilly are selective 5-HTantagonists (Audia, J., Evrard, D., Murdoch, G., Droste, J., Nissen, J., Schenck, K., Fludzinski, Z., Lucaites, V., Nelson, D., Cohen, M. \u201cPotent, Selective Tetrahydro-\u03b2-carboline Antagonists of the Serotonin 2B (5HT) Contractile Receptor in the Rat Stomach Fundus\u201d 1996, 39, 2773). Substituted indoles were reported by Vernalis to be highly selective agonists at 5-HTas compared to 5-HT(American Chemical Society National Meeting, Boston, Mass., Aug. 18-22, 2002, Poster Session, Division of Medicinal Chemistry, Wednesday morning, August 21, #344-349). Wyeth has reported 5-HTagonists including WAY161503 that are active in an animal model of obesity (Welmaker, G., Nelson, A., Sabalski, J., Sabb, A., Potoski, J., Graziano, D., Kagan, M., Coupet, J., Dunlop, J., Mazandarani, H., Rosenzwieg-Lipson, S., Sukoff, S., Zhang, Y. \u201cSynthesis and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) activity of 2,3,4,4a-tetrahydro-1H-pyrazino[1,2-a]quinoxalin-5-(6H)ones and 2,3,4,4a,5,6-hexahydro-1H-pyrazino[1,2-a]quinoxalines\u201d 2000, 10, 1991). Yamanouchi has described indazole compounds including YM348 which are 5-HTagonists showing activity in an animal model of obesity (Kimura, Y., Hatanaka, K., Naitou, Y., Maeno, K., Shimada, I., Koakutsu, A., Wanibuchi, F., Yamaguchi, T., \u201cPharmacological profile of YM348, a novel, potent and orally active 5-HT2C receptor agonist\u201d 2004, 483, 37). Arena reports mCPP analogs active in vivo as potential obesity treatments (Smith, B., Smith, J., Tsai, J., Schultz, J., Gilson, C., Estrada, S., Chen, R., Park, D., Prieto, E., Gallardo, C., Sengupta, D., Thomsen, W., Saldana, H., Whelan, K., Menzaghi, F., Webb. R., Beeley, N. \u201cDiscovery and SAR of new benzazepines as potent and selective 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists for the treatment of obesity\u201d 2005, 15, 1467).","Obesity is one of the most important health problems currently affecting the U.S. population. The overweight suffer a significantly higher death rate, as well as a much greater risk of developing many diseases including type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and some forms of cancer. Exercise and diet modification allow some obese people to lose weight. However, many others are unable to achieve lasting weight loss by such methods, and pharmaceutical agents that promote satiety can be effective and appropriate treatments.","Considerable evidence has accumulated implicating 5-HTreceptor activation with appetite suppression. In 1995, transgenic mice lacking the 5-HTreceptor were shown to become obese (Tecott, L., Sun, L., Akana, S., Strack, A., Lowenstein, D., Dallman, M., Julius, D. \u201cEating Disorder and Epilepsy in Mice Lacking 5-HTSerotonin Receptors\u201d 1995, 374, 542). A clinical study in 1997 (Sargent, P., Sharpley, A., Williams, C., Cowen, P. \u201c5-HT-Receptor Activation Decreases Appetite and Body Weight in Obese Subjects\u201d 1997, 133, 309) using meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), a 5-HTagonist, has shown appetite reduction and weight loss in obese subjects. Furthermore, selective 5-HTantagonists reduce or eliminate the anorexic effects of 5-HTagonists (Kennett, G., Wood, M., Bright, F., Trail, B., Riley, G., Holland, K., Avenell, K., Stean, T., Upton, N., Bromidge, S., Forbes, I., Middlemiss, D., Blackburn, T. \u201cSB242082, a Selective and Brain Penetrant 5-HTReceptor Antagonist\u201d 1997, 36, 609). Fenfluramine is a non-selective 5-HTreceptor agonist which together with phenteramine (\u201cphen-fen\u201d) was marketed until recently as a highly effective appetite suppressant. The clinical effectiveness of fenfluramine as an appetite suppressant has been shown to be largely due to its activity as a 5-HTreceptor agonist (Bickerdike, M., Vickers, S., Dourish, C. \u201c5-HTReceptor Modulation and the Treatment of Obesity\u201d 1999, 1, 207; Vickers, S., Dourish, C., Kennett, G. \u201cEvidence that Hypophagia Induced by d-Fenfluramine and d-Norfenfluramine in the Rat is Mediated by 5-HTReceptors\u201d 2001, 41, 200).","Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental illness involving persistent and distressing thoughts and actions that significantly interfere with normal life. OCD afflicts at least 1-2% of the population in the US and worldwide, and is the fourth most common psychiatric diagnosis in the United States (Delgado, P. L., Moreno, F. A. \u201cHallucinogens, Serotonin, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\u201d 1998, 30, 359; Goodman, W. K. \u201cObsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Diagnosis and Treatment\u201d 1999, 60 (Suppl 18), 27). OCD is currently treated pharmacologically and\/or with psychotherapy. Current pharmacotherapy for OCD has significant limitations and the discovery of an improved medication for OCD would have considerable commercial potential.","Psilocybin, a 5-HTreceptor agonist, is currently in a Phase I clinical trial with OCD patients (The New York Times, Page D1, Mar. 13, 2001). Other 5-HTreceptor agonists are recognized as potential treatments for OCD (Martin, J., Bos, M., Jenck, F., Moreau, J-I., Mutel, V., Sleight, A., Wichmann, J., Andrews, J., Berendsen, H., Broekkamp, C., Ruight, G., Kohler, C., van Delft, A. \u201c5-HTReceptor Agonists: Pharmacological Characteristics and Therapeutic Potential\u201d 1998, 286, 913).","Other possible uses for 5-HTselective compounds include treatments for epilepsy (Isaac, M. \u201cSerotonergic 5-HT2C Receptors as a Potential Therapeutic Target for the Design Antiepileptic Drugs\u201d 2005, 5, 59), Alzheimer's disease (Arjona, A., Pooler, A., Lee, R., Wurtman, R. \u201cEffect of a 5-HT(2C) Serotonin Agonist, Dexnorfenfluramine, on Amyloid Precursor Protein Metabolism in Guinea Pigs\u201d 2002, 951, 135), sexual dysfunction (Uckert, S., Stief, C., Jonas, U. \u201cCurrent and Future Trends in the Oral Pharmacotherapy of Male Erectile Dysfunction\u201d 2003, 12, 1521; Millan, M., Peglion, J., Lavielle, G., Perrin-Monneyron, S. \u201c5-HT2C Receptors Mediate Penile Erections in Rats: Actions of Novel and Selective Agonists and Antagonists\u201d 1997, 325, 9), and substance abuse and addiction disorders (Kampman, K., Pettinata, H., Lynch, K., Sparkman, T., O'Brien, C \u201cA Pilot Trial of Olanzapine for Cocaine Dependence\u201d 2003, 70, 265).","Compounds that are selective for the 5-HTreceptor may therefore have therapeutic potential in treating, for example, the above disorders. Such selectivity can also reduce possible side effects due to activity at other serotonin receptors.","Certain N-unsubstituted psilocin derivatives containing fluorine substitution at the 5-, 6-, or 7-position have been reported (Blair, J., Kurrasch-Orbaugh, D., Marona-Lewicka, D., Cumbay, M., Watts, V., Barker, E., Nichols, D. \u201cEffect of Fluorine Substitution on the Pharmacology of Hallucinogenic Tryptamines\u201d 2000, 43, 4701), and some of these compounds were shown to have reduced activity at the 5-HTreceptor as compared to psilocin itself.","The present invention relates to novel N-substituted psilocin (4-hydroxyindole) derivatives that are also substituted at the 5-, 6-, and\/or 7-positions and possess 5-HTreceptor selectivity, preferably versus both the 5HTand 5-HTreceptors. Such compounds have not previously been described or recognized to have selective functional activity at the 5-HT-receptor or to have in vivo activity in an animal model of human disease.","The invention also relates to N-substituted psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxyindole) derivatives, also substituted at the 5-, 6-, and\/or 7-positions.

For example, referring to , N-unsubstituted indoles such as compounds 1 and 23 can be N-alkylated or N-sulfonylated, for example, with an alkyl halide or sulfonyl chloride, using a base such as sodium hydride, to give N-alkylated or N-sulfonylated indoles. These 4-substituted indoles can be hydrogenated using, for example, palladium hydroxide on carbon as catalyst in the presence of hydrogen gas, to give 4-hydroxyindoles. The 4-hydroxyindoles can be phosphorylated, for example, by use of tetrabenzylpyrophosphate and a strong base such as lithium diisopropylamide, followed by hydrogenation using, for example, palladium hydroxide on carbon in the presence of hydrogen gas, to give 4-phosphoryloxyindoles.","Naturally occurring or synthetic isomers can be separated in several ways known in the art. Methods for separating a racemic mixture of two enantiomers include chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (see, e.g., \u201cChiral Liquid Chromatography,\u201d W. J. Lough, Ed. Chapman and Hall, New York (1989)). Enantiomers can also be separated by classical resolution techniques. For example, formation of diastereomeric salts and fractional crystallization can be used to separate enantiomers. For the separation of enantiomers of carboxylic acids, the diastereomeric salts can be formed by addition of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, and the like. Alternatively, diastereomeric esters can be formed with enantiomerically pure chiral alcohols such as menthol, followed by separation of the diastereomeric esters and hydrolysis to yield the free, enantiomerically enriched carboxylic acid. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","3. Uses of the Compounds of the Invention","As described herein below, it has now surprisingly been found that the compounds of the invention have serotonin receptor activity, and can be used to treat or prevent conditions associated with serotonin receptor activity.","Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides methods for treating a subject for a serotonin-receptor-related disorder, or preventing a serotonin-receptor-related disorder, by administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of the invention, such that the serotonin-receptor-related disorder is treated or prevented. Serotonin-receptor-related disorders include, e.g., Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), obesity, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, sexual dysfunction, addiction, anorexia nervosa, Tourette's syndrome, and trichotillomania, or other central nervous system disorders, or canine veterinary diseases including acral lick dermatitis (ALD). In certain embodiments, the subject is a mammal, e.g., a primate, e.g., a human.","In one embodiment, a method of treating a subject suffering from or susceptible to a serotonin-receptor-related disorder includes administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, to thereby treat the subject suffering from or susceptible to a serotonin-receptor-related disorder.","A further aspect relates to a method of treating a subject suffering from or susceptible to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), including administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of the invention to thereby treat the subject suffering from or susceptible to OCD.","A further aspect relates to a method of treating a subject suffering from or susceptible to obesity, including administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of the invention to thereby treat the subject suffering from or susceptible to obesity. In certain embodiments, the methods of the invention include administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention in combination with another pharmaceutically active compound. Examples of pharmaceutically active compounds include compounds known to treat serotonin-related diseases. Other pharmaceutically active compounds that may be used can be found in , Sixteenth Edition, Eds. D. L. Kasper et al. McGraw-Hill Professional, N.Y., N.Y. (2004); and the 2005 Physician's Desk Reference 59th Edition, Thomson Healthcare, 2004, the complete contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. The compound of the invention and the pharmaceutically active compound may be administered to the subject in the same pharmaceutical composition or in different pharmaceutical compositions (at the same time or at different times).","Determination of a therapeutically effective or a prophylactically effective amount of the compound of the invention, can be readily made by the physician or veterinarian (the \u201cattending clinician\u201d), as one skilled in the art, by the use of known techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. The dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient in the judgment of the attending clinician; the severity of the condition being treated and the particular compound being employed. In determining the therapeutically effective amount or dose, and the prophylactically effective amount or dose, a number of factors are considered by the attending clinician, including, but not limited to: the specific serotonin-receptor-related disorder involved; pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the desired time course of treatment; the species of mammal; its size, age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of or involvement or the severity of the disease; the response of the individual patient; the particular compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the kind of concurrent treatment (i.e., the interaction of the compound of the invention with other co-administered therapeutics); and other relevant circumstances.","Treatment can be initiated with smaller dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage may be increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. A therapeutically effective amount and a prophylactically effective amount of a compound of the invention of the invention is expected to vary from about 0.1 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day (mg\/kg\/day) to about 100 mg\/kg\/day.","Compounds determined to be effective for the prevention or treatment of serotonin-receptor-related disorders in animals, e.g., dogs, chickens, and rodents, may also be useful in treatment of serotonin-receptor-related disorders in humans. Those skilled in the art of treating serotonin-receptor-related disorders in humans will know, based upon the data obtained in animal studies, the dosage and route of administration of the compound to humans. In general, the dosage and route of administration in humans is expected to be similar to that in animals.","The identification of those patients who are in need of prophylactic treatment for serotonin-receptor-related disorders is well within the ability and knowledge of one skilled in the art. Certain of the methods for identification of patients which are at risk of developing serotonin-receptor-related disorders which can be treated by the subject method are appreciated in the medical arts, such as family history, and the presence of risk factors associated with the development of that disease state in the subject patient. A clinician skilled in the art can readily identify such candidate patients, by the use of, for example, clinical tests, physical examination and medical\/family history.","In another aspect, a compound of the invention is packaged in a therapeutically effective amount with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.

Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.","The compound of the invention(s) can be alternatively administered by aerosol. This is accomplished by preparing an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation or solid particles containing the compound. A nonaqueous (e.g., fluorocarbon propellant) suspension could be used. Sonic nebulizers are preferred because they minimize exposing the agent to shear, which can result in degradation of the compound.","Ordinarily, an aqueous aerosol is made by formulating an aqueous solution or suspension of the agent together with conventional pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and stabilizers. The carriers and stabilizers vary with the requirements of the particular compound, but typically include nonionic surfactants (Tweens, Pluronics, or polyethylene glycol), innocuous proteins like serum albumin, sorbitan esters, oleic acid, lecithin, amino acids such as glycine, buffers, salts, sugars or sugar alcohols. Aerosols generally are prepared from isotonic solutions.","Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound of the invention(s) to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the agent in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the active ingredient across the skin The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the active ingredient in a polymer matrix or gel.","Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of the invention.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compound of the invention(s) in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.","Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.","These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.","In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.","Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of compound of the invention(s) in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.","When the compound of the invention(s) are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99.5% (more preferably, 0.5 to 90%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier.","Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compound of the invention(s), which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and\/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically-acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.","Actual dosage levels and time course of administration of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. An exemplary dose range is from 0.1 to 10 mg per day.","A preferred dose of the compound of the invention for the present invention is the maximum that a patient can tolerate and not develop serious side effects. Preferably, the compound of the present invention is administered at a concentration or amount of about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight, about 0.01-about 50 mg\/kg or about 10 mg-about 30 mg\/kg of body weight.

Further research demonstrates that an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 5-HT into the rostral back of the mouse elicits scratching with the hind paws, which is itch-associated rather than a pain response (Kuraishi, Y., Nagasawa, T., Hayashi, K., Satoh, M. \u201cScratching Behavior Induced by Pruritogenic but not Algesiogenic Agents in Mice\u201d 1995, 275, 229). The 5-HT action is at least partly mediated by 5-HTreceptors in the skin, as shown by blocking with specific antagonists (Yamaguchi, T., Nagasawa, T., Satoh, M., Kuraishi, Y. \u201cItch-associated Response Induced by Intradermal Serotonin Through 5-HT2 Receptors in Mice\u201d 1999, 35, 77). The effect of test compounds on itch-associated scratching in the mice may indicate their action on 5-HT receptors, and a study was carried out as an animal model for OCD. The subjects were male Swiss-Webster mice, 4-6 weeks old, weighing 25-45 g. Mice were housed 5 per cage, given free access to standard mouse food and water except during experiments, and maintained in a temperature-controlled room (70\u00b0 F.). Serotonin and all test drugs were made up with ascorbic acid to protect against oxidation. Two mice, one a control, the other experimental, were tested each time. Each mouse was separately placed into a plexiglas box.","Mice were injected subcutaneously between the shoulder blades with either 0.1 ml of serotonin, 0.4 mg per ml in 0.15 M saline plus ascorbic acid, 1 mg\/ml, or compound 48-80 (the copolymer product of N-methyl-p-methoxyphenethylamine with formaldehyde), 1.0 mg\/ml in saline plus ascorbic acid. Test compounds were injected i.p. 5 minutes before the inducer. The cumulative number of scratches with a hind leg was recorded at 5 minute intervals for 30 minutes. One saline injected control and one test animal were tested together in each assay.
