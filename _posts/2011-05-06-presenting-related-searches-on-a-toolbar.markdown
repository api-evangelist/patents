title: Presenting related searches on a toolbar
abstract: Computer-readable media and computerized methods for automatically presenting keyword(s) within a search box of a toolbar are provided. The methods involve detecting a navigation action invoked by a user of a web browser and pulling from the web browser a uniform resource locator (URL) targeted by the navigation action. The targeted URL is compared against a manifest of suggested search terms to determine a match. When there exists suggested search term(s) that correspond with the URL, keyword(s) are selected from the suggested search term(s) for presentation within the search box. When no suggested search terms are found to correspond with the URL, the search box is left empty. Generally, a first search service is responsible for enabling the user to visit an online location associated with the URL, while a second search service is responsible for managing content within the search box of the toolbar.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Not applicable.","Not applicable.","Various techniques exist that enable Internet-based search engines to receive and process queries from users and to provide search results based thereon. Because these search engines are typically coupled with data stores, other queries, search results, and various search data may be conveniently stored for subsequent access. For instance, related searches that are generally associated with a query or specifically associated with a user may be discovered. However, existing technology fails to present those related searches in an intuitive manner once a user had navigated away from a search-result page.","For example, the existing methods are configured to offer users a standard search experience that involves locating and presenting a list of search results on a user interface (UI) display area and, perhaps, surface related searches on the UI display area as well. However, as users navigate away from the list of search results, they may realize that the navigated-to website may not contain the information they are seeking. Thus, when a user is no longer viewing the search results, existing UIs are inadequate for continuing to provide related searches to the user as a reminder. Accordingly, employing a procedure to supply and display related searches while the user is navigating across a number of web sites would enhance a user's experience researching a particular topic.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Embodiments of the present invention generally related to computer-readable media and computerized methods for supplying and displaying related searches while the user is navigating across a number of websites when researching a particular topic. These \u201crelated searches\u201d broadly relate to a term or phrase offered by a search-based keyword tool, such as a backend application programming interface (API), that supplies search suggestions based on search parameters. These \u201csearch parameters\u201d may comprise web-location information (e.g., uniform resource locations (URLs) or subject matter of a website being currently visited by the user), the query, the search results, specific user search history, general user behavior, popular searching trends, or any combination thereof. In an exemplary embodiment, the related searches are presented to a user in a display area, or \u201csearch box,\u201d within a navigation toolbar application (hereinafter \u201ctoolbar\u201d). This search box represents any display area that is managed by a web-search service that is capable of prompting a user with one or more related searches.","As such, by presenting the term or phrase of the related searches within a portion of the navigation toolbar, the user is prompted with concepts relevant to the initial query that assist with reaching the user's true search intent. Further, by presenting the related search within the navigation toolbar, the user may be prompted by the related search even after navigating away from an initial search-results page.","The subject matter of the present invention is described with specificity herein to meet statutory requirements. However, the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent. Rather, the inventors have contemplated that the claimed subject matter might also be embodied in other ways, to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies.","Generally, embodiments of the present invention introduce technology for presenting to a user related searches that pertain to a web-location, such as a uniform resource locator (URL), that a user is currently visiting. In an exemplary embodiment, one or more of the related searches are presented to the user within a search box of a toolbar. This toolbar is typically rendered by a web-browsing application along with a display area that reveals content of the web-location, such as an online HTML document. The related searches may be generated by a backend mechanism, or application programming interface (API), that is responsible for discovering terms and\/or phrases that are predetermined to be relevant to the URL of the currently visited web-location.","Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention relates to computer-executable instructions, embodied on one or more computer-readable media, that perform a method for surfacing one or more suggested search terms within a search box of a toolbar. Initially, the method includes receiving information that describes an online web-location. This information may include the URL of a web page or website the user is presently visiting or attempting to navigate towards. In one instance, one or more suggested search terms are determined as a function of the web-location information. At least one keyword is selected from the suggested search term(s). This selected keyword may then be presented within the search box of the toolbar upon the user viewing content of the web page or website targeted by the URL.","In another embodiment, aspects of the present invention involve a computerized method, implemented at a processing unit, for automatically providing a user with one or more suggested search terms. The method includes extracting web-location information from a web-browsing application. As mentioned above, the web-location information may include a URL of a website the user is currently visiting. The method additionally includes performing a comparison against a manifest to retrieve the suggested search term(s). In an exemplary embodiment, performing the comparison involves one or more of the following steps: inspecting entries within the manifest with regard to the web-location information; and, when an entry of the manifest corresponds with the web-location information, designating the entry as one of the suggested search term(s). In the alternative, when no entries of the manifest correspond with the web-location information, the method includes returning a null set that indicates no suggested search terms are to be displayed. In this case, a search box of a toolbar may be left empty. However, when there exists suggested search term(s), one or more of these suggested search term(s) may be presented within the search box of a toolbar. As discussed more fully with respect to , the toolbar is surfaced at a UI display upon invoking the web-browsing application.","In yet another embodiment, the present invention encompasses a computer system capable of discovering and presenting one or more suggested search terms within a toolbar. As described more fully below, the computer system comprises a processing unit coupled to a computer storage medium, where a plurality of computer software components executable by the processing unit are stored on the computer storage medium. The computer software components include a web-browsing application, a first search service, and a second search service. The web-browsing application is generally configured to receive a user-initiated selection directed to a destination link that, at some point, initiates navigation to a web location. The first search engine, which is typically operated by a first web-search service, is configured to navigate the user to the web location targeted by a URL. The second search engine, which is typically operated by a second web-search service, is configured to manage content presented within a search box of the toolbar.","In one instance, the process of managing content comprises one or more of the following steps carried out by the second web-search service: determining one or more suggested search terms that are relevant to the URL; selecting at least one keyword from the suggested search term(s); and presenting the selected keyword(s) within the search box of the toolbar. Selecting may include ranking the suggested search terms in the context of relevance to the URL, or to the user's profile in conjunction with the URL, and designating as the selected keyword(s) those suggested search terms that are ranked as being of highest relevance. As mentioned below, those suggested search terms of lower relevance may be iteratively cycled through the search box, in accordance with configuration settings of the toolbar.","Having briefly described an overview of embodiments of the present invention and some of the features therein, an exemplary operating environment suitable for implementing the present invention is described below.","Referring to the drawings in general, and initially to  in particular, an exemplary operating environment for implementing embodiments of the present invention is shown and designated generally as computing device . Computing device  is but one example of a suitable computing environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the invention. Neither should the computing device  be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination of components illustrated.","The invention may be described in the general context of computer code or machine-useable instructions, including computer-executable instructions such as program modules, being executed by a computer or other machine, such as a personal data assistant or other handheld device. Generally, program modules including routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc., refer to code that performs particular tasks or implements particular abstract data types. The invention may be practiced in a variety of system configurations, including handheld devices, consumer electronics, general-purpose computers, more specialty computing devices, etc. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote-processing devices that are linked through a communications network.","With reference to , computing device  includes a bus  that directly or indirectly couples the following devices: memory , one or more processors , one or more presentation components , input\/output (I\/O) ports , input\/output components , and an illustrative power supply . Bus  represents what may be one or more busses (such as an address bus, data bus, or combination thereof). Although the various blocks of  are shown with lines for the sake of clarity, in reality, delineating various components is not so clear, and metaphorically, the lines would more accurately be grey and fuzzy. For example, one may consider a presentation component such as a display device to be an I\/O component. Also, processors have memory. The inventors recognize that such is the nature of the art, and reiterate that the diagram of  is merely illustrative of an exemplary computing device that can be used in connection with one or more embodiments of the present invention. Distinction is not made between such categories as \u201cworkstation,\u201d \u201cserver,\u201d \u201claptop,\u201d \u201chandheld device,\u201d etc., as all are contemplated within the scope of  and reference to \u201ccomputing device.\u201d","Computing device  typically includes a variety of computer-readable media. Computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computing device  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and nonremovable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media include both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and nonremovable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. Computer storage media include, but are not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium, which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by computing device . Communication media typically embody computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and include any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media include wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","Memory  includes computer-storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory. The memory may be removable, nonremovable, or a combination thereof. Exemplary hardware devices include solid-state memory, hard drives, optical-disc drives, etc. Computing device  includes one or more processors that read data from various entities such as memory  or I\/O components . Presentation component(s)  present data indications to a user or other device. Exemplary presentation components include a display device, speaker, printing component, vibrating component, etc.","I\/O ports  allow computing device  to be logically coupled to other devices including I\/O components , some of which may be built in. Illustrative components include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, printer, wireless device, etc.","A process for automatically generating a set of related searches and offering one or more of the related searches to the user via a toolbar will now be discussed with reference to . In particular,  depicts a block diagram that illustrates an exemplary system architecture  of a distributed computing environment, suitable for use in implementing embodiments of the present invention. It should be understood and appreciated that the exemplary system architecture  shown in  is merely an example of one suitable computing environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the present invention. Neither should the exemplary system architecture  be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement related to any single component or combination of components illustrated therein.","Initially, the exemplary system architecture  includes a client device , data stores , a server , a server , and a network  that interconnects each of these items. Each of the client device , the data stores , and the servers  and , shown in , may take the form of various types of computing devices, such as, for example, the computing device  described above with reference to . By way of example only and not limitation, the client device  and\/or the servers  and  may be a personal computer, desktop computer, laptop computer, consumer electronic device, handheld device (e.g., personal digital assistant), various servers, processing equipment, and the like. It should be noted, however, that the invention is not limited to implementation on such computing devices but may be implemented on any of a variety of different types of computing devices within the scope of embodiments of the present invention.","Typically, each of the devices , , and  includes, or is linked to, some form of a computing unit (e.g., central processing unit, microprocessor, etc.) to support operations of the component(s) running thereon (e.g., first search engine , second search engine , and the like). As utilized herein, the phrase \u201ccomputing unit\u201d generally refers to a dedicated computing device with processing power and storage memory, which supports operating software that underlies the execution of software, applications, and computer programs thereon. In one instance, the computing unit is configured with tangible hardware elements, or machines, that are integral, or operably coupled, to the devices , , and  to enable each device to perform communication-related processes and other operations (e.g., processing user inputs , providing outcomes  to the user inputs , generating related searches , and the like). In another instance, the computing unit may encompass a processor (not shown) coupled to the computer-readable medium accommodated by each of the devices , , and .","Generally, the computer-readable medium includes physical memory that stores, at least temporarily, a plurality of computer software components that are executable by the processor. As utilized herein, the term \u201cprocessor\u201d is not meant to be limiting and may encompass any elements of the computing unit that act in a computational capacity. In such capacity, the processor may be configured as a tangible article that processes instructions. In an exemplary embodiment, processing may involve fetching, decoding\/interpreting, executing, and writing back instructions (e.g., selecting a keyword from the related searches  to be displayed within the search box).","Also, beyond processing instructions, the processor may transfer information to and from other resources that are integral to, or disposed on, the devices , , and . Generally, resources refer to software components or hardware mechanisms that enable the devices , , and  to perform a particular function. By way of example only, the resources accommodated by the server  may include one or more of the following: the second search engine  and a backend API . Further, the client device  may include resources, such as a client application (not shown) that is capable of installing and running a toolbar and a web-browsing application  that interacts with the toolbar.","The client device  may include an input device (not shown) and a presentation device . Generally, the input device is provided to receive input(s) affecting, among other things, a presentation of search results, a toolbar, or web-page content within a browser window  surfaced at a UI display area . Illustrative input devices include a mouse, joystick, key pad, microphone, I\/O components  of , or any other component capable of receiving a user input and communicating an indication of that input to the client device . By way of example only, the input device facilitates entry of a query and controls the location of a selection tool on the search results responsive to the query.","In embodiments, the presentation device  is configured to render and\/or present the UI display  thereon. The presentation device , which is operably coupled to an output of the client device , may be configured as any presentation component that is capable of presenting information to a user, such as a digital monitor, electronic display panel, touch-screen, analog set top box, plasma screen, audio speakers, Braille pad, and the like. In one exemplary embodiment, the presentation device  is configured to present rich content, such as the browser window  that includes a display area populated with search results (e.g., digital images). In another exemplary embodiment, the presentation device  is capable of rendering other forms of media (e.g., audio signals). In yet another exemplary embodiment, the presentation device  may present a toolbar with content (e.g., related searches) revealed in a search box, as more fully discussed below.","The data store(s)  are generally configured to store information that facilitates generating related searches that are relevant to the user's current context of a search session. In various embodiments, such information may include, without limitation, a search-history log  that includes recorded user search behavior (e.g., query logs, related searches list, etc.), a manifest  that lists URLs that are predefined as prompting related searches, and other information that pertains to embodiments of the present invention. In addition, the data store(s)  may be configured to be searchable for suitable access of the stored information . For instance, the data store(s)  may be searchable for one or more previous user-initiated queries submitted by a user within the ongoing search session.","It will be understood and appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the information  stored in the data store(s)  may be configurable and may include any information relevant to the generation and display of relates searches . The content and volume of such information are not intended to limit the scope of embodiments of the present invention in any way. Further, though illustrated as single, independent components, the data store(s)  may, in fact, be a plurality of databases, for instance, a database cluster, portions of which may reside on the client device , the servers  and , another external computing device (not shown), and\/or any combination thereof.","This exemplary system architecture  is but one example of a suitable environment that may be implemented to carry out aspects of the present invention and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the invention. Neither should the illustrated exemplary system architecture  be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination of the computing devices , , and , the storage devices , and components , , , and  as illustrated. In some embodiments, one or more of the components , , , and  may be implemented as stand-alone devices. In other embodiments, one or more of the components , , , and  may be integrated directly into the servers  and , respectively, or on distributed nodes that interconnect to form the servers  and . It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the components , , , and  are exemplary in nature and in number and should not be construed as limiting.","Accordingly, any number of components may be employed to achieve the desired functionality within the scope of embodiments of the present invention. Although the various components of  are shown with lines for the sake of clarity, in reality, delineating various components is not so clear, and, metaphorically, the lines would more accurately be grey or fuzzy. Further, although some components of  are depicted as single blocks, the depictions are exemplary in nature and in number and are not to be construed as limiting (e.g., although only one presentation device  is shown, many more may be communicatively coupled to the client device , and although only one server  is shown, the server  may include separate devices that host the second search engine  and the backend API  individually).","Further, the devices of the exemplary system architecture  may be interconnected by any method known in the relevant field. For instance, the servers  and , as well as the client device , may be operably coupled via a distributed computing environment that includes multiple computing devices coupled with one another via one or more networks . In embodiments, the network  may include, without limitation, one or more local area networks (LANs) and\/or wide area networks (WANs). Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet. Accordingly, the network is not further described herein.","In operation, the components , , , and  are designed to perform a process for recommending and displaying on a toolbar search term(s) and\/or suggested queries as a function of a navigated-to URL. As a result, exposing within the toolbar the search term(s) related to the URL allow users to easily search on the related search term(s) and expeditiously satisfy the intent of their ongoing search session. Consequently, upon displaying the related search term(s) within a portion (e.g., search box) of the toolbar, users may be more apt to explore\/conduct additional searches with the related search term(s) upon navigating away from a search-results page.","Accordingly, the components , , , and  are designed to act in concert to supply and display related search term(s), or related searches, while the user is navigating across a number of websites when researching a particular topic. As used herein, these \u201crelated searches\u201d broadly relate to a term or phrase offered by a search-based keyword tool, such as the backend API . The scope of items encompassed by the phrase related searches is meant to be broad, and may cover such items as a character, a single term or synonym, phrase(s) related to an identifier of the navigated-to webpage, relevant keywords, and alternate equivalent queries (e.g., queries submitted by other users that conducted a search session with a similar context). Accordingly, suggested search term(s), keyword(s), and related search(es) are used interchangeably herein. In operation, the related searches are offered to help the user pick queries that may lead to more focused search results.","Initially, the web-browsing application  is triggered to install and provision a toolbar on the client device  as an add-on app. The trigger may be a user-initiated download of a navigational toolbar application from a local or remote source (e.g., prompted by a solicitation from the second search engine ), or an automatic download from a search service (e.g., Bing\u00ae). Once installed, the toolbar is surfaced upon the user launching the web-browsing application . The toolbar may operate to receive queries or keywords from the user to initiate a navigation event. Or, the toolbar may operate to selectively present related searches  upon detecting a navigation event received at the web-browsing application . In an exemplary embodiment, the queries may be received and the related searches  may be presented at a common display area (e.g., search box) integrated within the toolbar.","The phrase \u201cnavigation event\u201d is meant to be interpreted broadly and may be invoked upon receiving the user input . By way of example, the navigation event may include navigating the user away from a search-results page and toward an online document (e.g., web page of a website) associated with a specific URL. In this example, the navigation event is invoked upon a user selecting a destination link (e.g., user input  directed to clickable text of a hotlink) associated with a search result. In another example, the navigation event may include receiving an entry of a query within the search box of toolbar and detecting a command to submit the entry to a search engine  or . Although various different search events have been described, it should be understood and appreciated that other types of suitable search events and\/or user inputs  may be used to invoke generation of related searches, and that embodiments of the present invention are not limited to those examples described herein.","In embodiments, a user may visit a particular online location or web site via the web-browsing application  intercommunicating with the first search engine  managed by a first search service. Upon, the user selecting a link at the online location (e.g., click-action input  directed to a destination link) or entering another query that targets a specific web address, the user may be navigated to an outcome  of the user input , such as a subject URL. If the content underlying the subject URL is not of interest to the user (i.e., the web site lacks the material that the user is seeking), the user may rely upon guidance from a related-search term or phrase surfaced within the toolbar in order to productively continue the search session. This related search term or phrase may be provided by the second search engine  managed by a second search service, as discussed immediately below.","When the toolbar is actively running in tandem with the web-browsing application , the toolbar may be configured to extract information describing the online web location (e.g., subject URL) that the user is currently visiting. This information may be conveyed via the network to the second search engine . The second search engine  is configured to call the backend API  with the subject URL. In turn, the backend API  is able to process the subject URL and, potentially, deliver the related searches  for display at the toolbar. In this way, the toolbar is able to solicit, retrieve, and present the related searches  that are relevant to the online web location that the user is visiting.","In one embodiment, processing the subject URL at the backend API  involves accessing search-history logs  at the data stores  for consideration in generating the related searches . In another embodiment, processing the subject URL at the backend API  involves accessing the manifest  at the data stores  for consideration in generating the related searches . In general, the manifest, or \u201cwhite list,\u201d represents an aggregation of preselected URLs that will produce at least one related search. Accordingly, by limiting the number of URLs that may generate related searches, the system avoids overloading the second search service by refraining from processing every obscure navigation event.","Upon accessing the manifest , the backend API  may perform a comparison against the manifest  to retrieve one or more suggested search terms, or related searches . When an entry (e.g., preselected URL) of the manifest  corresponds with the web-location information (e.g., subject URL), the entry may be designated as one of the suggested search terms to be displayed at the toolbar. Or, in another instance, this procedure may occur at the second search service . In this instance, when the web-location information corresponds with an entry of the manifest , the second search service  is enabled to make the call to the backend API  to process the subject URL. As mentioned above, the related searches  may be derived from the subject URL alone or the subject URL in conjunction with user history (e.g., previously inputted search terms) and\/or search behavior from the log .","In yet another embodiment, the related searches  may be mapped to entities of the manifest , while the online location information may be mapped to subject entities. As used herein, the term \u201centities\u201d generally refers to an abstract object that captures a search intent of the user. Generally, abstract objects may be thought of as characterizations of a concept being searched, a field of interest researched by the user, or an intended task extrapolated from the user's search session. For example, entities may include a person (e.g., Michael Jackson), a place (e.g., Dubuque, Iowa), a thing (e.g., surfboard), class (e.g., animals), category (e.g., sports), task (e.g., plan a trip), specific action (e.g., book a flight), and the like. If, upon comparison to the manifest , the subject entity matches a manifest entity, then the search terms associated with the matched manifest entity are designated as one or more of the related searches . Upon receiving the related searches  at the second search engine , keywords selected from the related searches  may be presented to the user within the search box of the toolbar.","Alternatively, if no entries of the manifest  correspond with the web-location information, a null set may be returned to the second search engine . The null set typically indicates that no suggested search terms are to be displayed. Accordingly, the second search engine  may leave the search box of the toolbar blank, thereby refraining from providing the user with a keyword for use as guidance in continued searching. Or, the second search engine  may employ other content for presentation within the search box, such as language drawn from another search engine as discussed below.","If the null set is returned, in embodiments, content may be provided within the search box. That is, as opposed to leaving the search box of the toolbar blank when the subject URL is unmatched at the manifest , second search engine  may enter a ghosting mode. Typically, the ghosting mode shows content (e.g., query or link) that mirrors the query or link submitted to the first search engine . However, ghosting mode may be exited upon the second search engine  identifying matching entries within the manifest . In this case, the toolbar reverts back to showing related searches .","If multiple keywords\/queries are returned as part of the related searches , the keywords\/queries may be pruned to a predefined threshold number and ranked. In one instance, the lower ranked keywords\/queries are trimmed from the related searches  based on, in part, a size of a display area (e.g., menu  of ) allocated for revealing the related searches . In another instance, the ranking is carried out using a ranking model that organizes the related searches  from highest to lowest relevance with respect to the web-location information (e.g., subject URL). This ranking may be employed to select an initial keyword (e.g., keyword \u201cmoon phase\u201d  of ) for display in the search box. In an exemplary embodiment, the keyword that is ranked as being of highest relevance (e.g., most popular) to the subject URL in comparison to a remainder of the related searches  is selected for display within the search box of the toolbar.","Turning now to , illustrative screen displays of exemplary user interfaces , , , , , and  for presenting related searches to a user via a search box within a toolbar are shown. The exemplary user interfaces , , , , , and  are rendered in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, and are not meant to limit the scope of representations that can express related searches. Initially, with respect to , the exemplary user interface  includes a navigated-to online location  (e.g., web page within the Wikipedia\u00ae website that addresses the moon) that has content  and a subject URL \u201cHTTP:\/\/MOON.COM\u201d  associated therewith. As discussed above, the first search engine  is typically utilized to navigate the user to the online location  upon either entry of the subject URL  to a search bar  or selection of a link on a previous search-results page.","Further, the exemplary user interface  includes a toolbar  with a search box . Because the toolbar  is represented as being installed and active within the web browser application (e.g., as an add-on), the search box  is adapted to present the keyword \u201cmoon phase\u201d , as a result of backend operation(s) of a search-based keyword tool. Further, a control button  is shown that, upon actuation, operates to submit the keyword  as a query to the second search engine , which manages the search box . As discussed above, the keyword  may be selected from a set of suggested search terms (e.g., related searches  of ). In the exemplary user interface , the keyword  may be a search term\/phrase of highest relevance to the subject URL , a most-popular search in the user's field of interest (based on a context of the search session), an entity that corresponds with the subject URL, or an alternative selection from the suggested search terms.","Upon the user selecting the control button  (e.g., hovering a pointer  over the control button  and performing a click-action), the keyword  is entered and submitted as a query to a second search engine managing the toolbar. Consequently, the second search engine (e.g., utilizing the second search engine of ) is activated to conduct a search and to generate search results  of  related to the keyword . That is, the currently active keyword  in the search box  is employed to conduct a new search when the user clicks the control button . Accordingly, the user is relieved of the duty of retyping the keyword  into the search bar .","Turning now to , an exemplary user interface  is shown that includes a display area with a search-results page  and a set of related searches . As illustrated, the first search engine that originally was employed for navigation has been usurped by the second search engine, which is now instructing the web-browsing application to visit the search-results page  constructed by the second search engine. This search-results page  includes content  that is retrieved based on the keyword \u201cmoon phase\u201d , which was previously submitted via the toolbar  of  and executed as a query using the second search service. As shown, the content  includes a set of images  of moon phases and a set of videos  of moon phases.","Further, in embodiments, the search-results page  may include a query-entry area  with the keyword \u201cmoon phase\u201d  automatically populated therein (demonstrating to the user how the content  was arrived upon) and may include a set of suggested search terms  that were generated via the search-based keyword tool (e.g., backend API ). With regard to the suggested search terms , as mentioned above, the related searches are determined as a function of some web-location information and then pruned based on one or more criteria (e.g., popularity, frequency, recentness, and the like). The keyword  is identified based one or more criteria (e.g., being most relevant to the web-location information), while a remainder of the pruned related searches are cached for eventual access. This remainder of the pruned related searches, in embodiments, is designated as the suggested search terms  and presented within the content  on the search-results page . Accordingly, because the second search engine has access to the cached suggested search terms  and has also taken control of rendering the subject matter within the user interface , the suggested search terms  may be displayed within the content  of the user interface .","In contrast, with respect to the embodiments of , the first search engine is currently providing the web-browser application with the subject matter to display on the user interface . However, the second search engine still retains control over the toolbar  of  and can manage various features associated therewith. For instance, the second search engine may be configured to present the cached suggested search terms  to a user upon the user interacting with the toolbar. In one instance, the user interaction involves a selection (e.g., click-action using a mouse) within the search box . However, any number of user interactions with the toolbar may cause the suggested search terms  to be displayed, and embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the exemplary user-initiated selection(s) described herein.","In addition, the suggested search terms  may be displayed in any format that is available in the field of search technology. As shown, the suggested search terms  are presenting as a listing within a menu . This menu  may be a drop-down menu anchored from the toolbar , a pop-up window that obscures a portion of the content , or any other display-area configuration that holds at least a portion of the suggested search terms . Further, the suggested search terms  of the listing may be configured as destination links that, when selected upon, navigate the user to a search-results page that is constructed for the selected search term. Thus, upon selecting a search term, the second search engine assumes control over the subject matter displayed within the user interface  and is responsible for retrieving content related to the selected search term in the same way the second search engine would address an executed query composed of the selected search term.","Turning now to , an exemplary user interface  is illustrated that depicts a situation where a user has selected or focused upon the search box  and begun editing the keyword . This edited keyword \u201cM\u201d  may trigger the toolbar  to perform one or more tasks. For example, the toolbar  may present a menu  that includes recommendations within the display area thereof. These recommendations may include one or more of the suggested search terms  and\/or predictive queries , which are typically popular queries that begin with the same letters as the edited keyword . Thus, in operation, when the user starts typing in the search box , the menu  may employ auto-suggest logic to recommend text for use as the query, thereby allowing the user to manipulate the selected keyword , or any other suggested search term , prior to entry as a query.","Also, the menu  may include an \u201coptions\u201d link  that allows a user to examine and alter properties of the menu . Accordingly, the user is provided the opportunity to modify the content and format of the menu  upon selecting the link . For example, the user may be prompted to decide whether the suggested search terms  are filtered and ranked based on a ranking of relevance to the web-location information or based on a level of variance between the suggested search terms , in order to provide the user with distinct options in which to refine the initial search (i.e., supplying a greater scope of choices).","With reference to , the exemplary user interface  depicts a feature of dynamically cycling the suggested search terms  within the search box , as opposed statically posting just the selected keyword . As shown, a candidate search term \u201ccurrent moon phase\u201d  from the suggested search terms  is rotated into the search box . In embodiments, the cached suggested search terms  are individually and iteratively rotated through the search box . The transition from one candidate search term  to the next may be based on the expiration of a predefined timeframe. This predefined time frame may be consistent for each of the suggested search terms , or may vary across the related searches. For instance, the highest-ranked term(s) (e.g., selected keyword ) may linger within the search box  for longer than lower-ranked term(s) (e.g., suggested search terms ). In an exemplary embodiment, rotating the related searches within the search box  may involve one or more of the following steps: displaying the selected keyword  within the search box  for a first predefined period of time; upon expiration of the first predefined period of time, replacing within the search box  the selected keyword  with a first candidate (e.g., candidate search term \u201ccurrent moon phase\u201d ) from a remainder of the suggested search terms ; displaying the first candidate from the remainder of the suggested search terms  within the search box  for a second predefined period of time; and, upon expiration of the second predefined period of time, replacing within the search box  the first candidate with a second candidate from the remainder of the suggested search terms .","Turning to , the exemplary user interface  illustrates a highlighting feature  that accompanies the keyword  within the search box . This feature  is designed to draw the user's attention to the toolbar  and alert the user that a keyword  from a second search engine is being offered as an alternative to any related searches that the first search engine has presented within the content . This feature  may be any type of visual effects, such as a glowing area, flames, a fixed image, a video, color changes, a change in font or format of the keyword , an audio signal, or a non-intrusive effect. Further, the text of the keyword may be displayed in any manner known in the art, such as a subtle format (e.g., light grey and italicized) to designate the keyword  is simply a suggestion.","Turning to , a flow diagram is illustrated showing an overall method  for surfacing keyword(s), which are selected from one or more suggested search terms, within a search box of a toolbar, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Although the terms \u201cstep\u201d and\/or \u201cblock\u201d may be used herein to connote different elements of methods employed, the terms should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless and except when the order of individual steps is explicitly described. Initially, the method  includes receiving information that describes an online web location, as depicted at block . This information may include the URL of a web page or website the user is presently visiting or attempting to navigate towards. In one instance, as depicted at block , one or more suggested search terms are determined as a function of the web-location information. At least one keyword is selected from the suggested search term(s), as depicted at block . This selected keyword may then be presented within the search box of the toolbar, upon the user viewing content of the web page or website targeted by the URL, as depicted at block .","With reference to , a flow diagram illustrating an overall method  for automatically providing a user with one or more suggested search terms on a UI display is shown, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The method  includes extracting web-location information from a web-browsing application, as depicted at block . In embodiments, the web-location information may include a URL of a website the user is currently visiting. As depicted at block , the method  may additionally include performing a comparison against a manifest to retrieve the suggested search term(s).","In an exemplary embodiment, performing the comparison involves one or more of the following steps: inspecting entries within the manifest with regard to the web-location information (see block ); and, when an entry of the manifest corresponds with the web-location information, designating the entry as one of the suggested search term(s) (see block ). In the alternative, as depicted at block , when no entries of the manifest correspond with the web-location information, the method  includes returning a null set that indicates no suggested search terms are to be displayed. In this case, a search box of a toolbar is left empty. However, when there exists suggested search term(s), as depicted at block , one or more of these suggested search term(s) may be presented within the search box of a toolbar. Thus, related searches that help users focus their search sessions are placed in an intuitive location on the toolbar and are configured to launch a new query without being retyped by the users.","Although embodiments of the present invention are described in relation to related search(es) being presented within a search box of a toolbar, other embodiments contemplate variant mechanisms for notifying a user of the related search(es). For instance, a toolbar-based navigation menu that accompanies a web-browsing application may be surfaced for displaying the related search(es). This navigation menu may be managed by a third-party interactive program installed locally or remotely, which interfaces between the user and a search service that is responsible for generating the related searches. In one example, the navigation menu may comprise a pop-up window displayed on top of HTML-document content in a browser window. In another example, a wing may be surfaced for a limited amount, where the wing surfaces the related search(es) by imposing upon content around a border of the browser window before vanishing. Typically, the wing is surfaced a predefined amount of times to educate the user that related search(es) are being automatically generated in the background during the search session and, potentially, being presented in the toolbar.","The present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments, which are intended in all respects to be illustrative rather than restrictive. Alternative embodiments will become apparent to those of ordinary skill-in-the-art to which the present invention pertains without departing from its scope.","From the foregoing, it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all the ends and objects set forth above, together with other advantages which are obvious and inherent to the system and method. It will be understood that certain features and sub-combinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and sub-combinations. This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is described in detail below with reference to the attached drawing figures, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIGS. 3-8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
