Field","The following description relates to a mobile communication terminal to provide a widget expansion function using a message communication, and an operation method of the mobile communication terminal.","2.Description of Related Art","Currently, with rapid development of a mobile communication terminal such as a smart phone and the like, an activation of a local service may be expected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110"]},"The communication system  may provide a local service such as, for example, a guide service, a reservation service, and a commercial transaction service, using a mobile phone based on user information. The user information may be a provider location in a predetermined region such as, for example, a school, a hospital, a shopping mall, a theme park, a gasoline station, and the like.","For the local service, the mobile communication terminal  may download a variety of mobile applications from a local service server  operated by a provider, and provide a service.","A downloadable mobile application may be classified into a native application scheme and a mobile web scheme. The native application may employ application programming interface (API) supported by a specific platform. The native application scheme may readily and quickly perform a system optimization including a user interface and support offline connection. The mobile web scheme may support a variety of devices in a multi-platform. Accordingly, an appropriate selection of the native application or mobile web scheme may be used depending on a necessity.","In the case of using the local service, when a service is provided using mobile web widgets, a user may readily access the service and use the service without being aware of a server address.","A drawback of an existing web widget is that it may not control a quick screen switch and hardware, like a game, and may be available only when a network is connected. The web scheme may create an application using a script including a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), cascading style sheets (CSS), and JavaScript.","A manufacturing company provides a device API suggested in a standard interface, and a browser or a widget engine expands a function of the device API using a plug-in. When the function is expanded, the device API may be used. A standard JavaScript API may not directly control hardware and thus, the function of the browser or the widget engine may be expanded by defining a new JavaScript API using a native language such as, for example, C\/C++.","With codes defined using the native language, a widget's JavaScript may be expanded in the widget engine using a static scheme and a plug-in scheme. In the case of a variety of mobile devices using the same platform, a device function may be used in combination with a plug-in. When the plug-in scheme is employed by a JavaScript API expanded in the browser or the widget engine, the device API may be directly called using a combined native code.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"An expansion of an additional function of a widget in an existing mobile communication terminal  will be described with reference to .","The mobile communication terminal  using an existing web scheme may use a function expansion module for each widget W, W, and W  using a widget platform .","Since an API library used for widgets W, W, and W  is called from a device API  via a web plug-in , a development may be complex and a security may be vulnerable. In addition, since each of the widgets W, W, and W  may not use a native language, an error occurrence probability may be significantly high.","In one general aspect, there is provided a mobile communication terminal, including a widget platform providing unit to generate an additional function expansion message based on expansion of an additional function of a widget, and to transmit the generated additional function expansion message, and a widget manager to receive the additional function expansion message, to determine an application programming interface (API) library with respect to the expansion of the additional function, and to call the determined API library.","The widget manager may be configured to provide the called API library to the widget in a form of a response message.","The mobile communication terminal may include a storage unit to store at least one API library, wherein the widget manager may be configured to call an API library corresponding to the additional function expansion message from the stored at least one API library.","The widget manager may include a communication processing unit to provide an interface for receiving of the additional functional expansion message, and a message processing unit to analyze the received additional function expansion message, and to determine the API library based on the analysis.","The widget manager may include a security policy processing unit to determine a processing scheme of the called API library based on a predetermined security policy.","The widget manager may include an API library mapping processing unit to call the determined API library from the at least one API library.","The widget manager may be configured to transfer, to the widget, an execution result of the called API library and an execution result of a context awareness engine.","The widget manager may be configured to store the transferred execution results, and to provide a sharing function with other widgets.","In another general aspect, there is provided an operation method of a mobile communication terminal, the method including receiving an additional function expansion message that is generated based on an expansion of an additional function of a widget, determining an API library by analyzing the received additional function expansion message, calling the determined API library, and transferring an execution result of the called API library and an execution result of a context awareness engine.","The method may include determining a processing scheme of the called API library based on a predetermined security policy.","The method may include storing the transferred execution results, and providing a sharing function with other widgets.","In another general aspect, there is provided a mobile communication terminal including a widget to request a widget expansion function, and a manager to manage the request for the widget expansion function using a message communication.","The mobile communication terminal may include a platform providing unit to generate an additional function expansion message based on the request and transmit the generated additional function expansion message to the manager.","The manager may receive the additional function expansion message and determine an application programming interface (API) library corresponding to the expansion of the additional function.","The API library may be provided to the widget via the message communication.","The manager may store results of the API library provided to the widget, and share the results with other widgets.","Other features and aspects will be apparent from the following detailed description, the drawings, and the claims.","Throughout the drawings and the detailed description, unless otherwise described, the same drawing reference numerals will be understood to refer to the same elements, features, and structures. The relative size and depiction of these elements may be exaggerated for clarity, illustration, and convenience.","The following detailed description is provided to assist the reader in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the methods, apparatuses, and\/or systems described herein. Accordingly, various changes, modifications, and equivalents of the methods, apparatuses, and\/or systems described herein will be suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art. The progression of processing steps and\/or operations described is an example; however, the sequence of and\/or operations is not limited to that set forth herein and may be changed as is known in the art, with the exception of steps and\/or operations necessarily occurring in a certain order. Also, description of well-known functions and constructions may be omitted for increased clarity and conciseness.","Descriptions of related and known functions may be omitted where possible for conciseness. Also, terms used herein are defined to describe the example embodiments and thus, may be changed depending on a user, the intent of an operator, or a custom. Accordingly, the terms must be defined based on the following overall description of this specification.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"The mobile communication terminal  may provide a local service for a guide, a reservation, and a commercial transaction, using a mobile phone, based on user information, for example, a provider location in a predetermined region such as, for example, a school, a hospital, a shopping mall, a theme park, and a gasoline station.","To provide the local service, the mobile communication terminal  may drive widgets W, W, W, W, and W . Here, for example, a widget may correspond to a mini application program enabling a user to use functions such as weather, news, a calendar, a calculator, and the like. The widget may also allow the user to use functions such as news, games, and stock information, and the like, without using a web browser. The widget may herein be understood as a mini application program applied to the mobile communication terminal .","The mobile communication terminal  may expand an additional function of a widget to provide a predetermined service, for example, a local service and the like.","The expansion of the additional function may be embodied by a widget platform providing unit . When a widget script corresponding to a widget calls an added function, the widget platform providing unit  may transfer the called added function to a widget manager  in a form of a message instead of directly calling the added function using a web plug-in.","The widget manager  receiving the message may interpret the transferred message and call a corresponding application programming interface (API) library. The API library may correspond to the widget calling for the added function.","The widget manager  corresponds to a general native application and thus, may directly access a device API without using a separate plug-in according to a message request of the widget. Since the widget manager  stores and manages user information and environment information, the widget manager  may readily apply a security policy and protect a related code. When a widget is used in a mobile web application to access a local service, a variety of other widgets may be executed to access the local service in a relatively short period of time. Thus, when a plurality of widgets simultaneously and frequently accesses a device API and an intelligent API, it may be more efficient with regard to speed to access API information using the widget manager . The widget may synchronously download device API information results using the widget manager  without a procedure for accessing a device resource.","In addition, since a call module according to a widget request may be readily replaceable, virtual device information may be transferred to the widget by calling a pseudo sensing API using a network instead of using the device API depending on circumstances. Accordingly, by replacing a device API call module of the widget manager  with an emulator API call module, an emulation function for a device API may be provided and a development readability may be supported.","To expand the additional function of the widget, the widget platform providing unit  may generate an additional function expansion message and transmit the generated additional function expansion message to the widget manager .","The API library for expansion of the additional function may be stored and maintained in a storage unit .","The widget manager  may receive the additional function expansion message, determine an API library associated with the expansion of the additional function, and call the determined API library.","The widget manager  may provide the local service in interoperation with a local service server . For example, the widget manager  may analyze a widget package description downloaded from the local service server , or may collect widget execution information, or may control local service context information, for example, neighboring sensing information to be collected.","The widget manager  may provide the called API response to the widget in a form of a response message.","The widget manager  may perform an advance query and response through association with a context awareness engine .","According to example embodiments, a mobile application may provide a user with a convenience using a context awareness technology. For example, the widget manager  may provide an intelligent local service using an intelligent widget API interoperating with an inference engine of the widget. Accordingly, for the intelligent widget API, the widget manager  may share context awareness model information with the context awareness engine  and may obtain a desired result through a query.","Even though an application within a general mobile device may use an inference result through a direct interface with a context awareness engine, a service provider providing widgets may be unaware of context awareness engine information of an available user. Accordingly, the mobile communication terminal  may provide the intelligent local service using the widget manager .","According to example embodiments, it is possible to provide an independent framework to a browser and a web engine by processing expansion of an additional function of a widget using a message.","According to example embodiments, information regarding a service region and user context may be readily collected. A web widget API used for an intelligent local service may be additionally expanded. In addition, it is possible to readily and appropriately embody a complex algorithm and call a device API.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"Compared to directly expanding a function of a web widget using a plug-in, the widget manager  enables a communication and cooperation between widgets, and thus, a speed and a security of expanding a function of a widget may be enhanced.","In particular, a plurality of widgets and an intelligent engine such as a context awareness engine may be employed in an intelligent local service. Accordingly, the widget manager  may manage device and environment information, and may select a widget and an API and thus, may provide a user with a convenient and safe service.","Referring to , the widget manager  may include a communication processing unit , a message processing unit , a security policy processing unit , and an API library mapping processing unit .","The widget manager  may further include a service and user information management module  to manage service and user information.","The communication processing unit  may provide an interface for receiving of an additional function expansion message.","In interoperation with a communication module of a widget platform, the communication processing unit  may receive the additional function expansion message from the communication module, or may transmit a response message according to a call of an API library.","The message processing unit  may determine a suitable API library by analyzing the additional function expansion message requested from a widget. For example, the message processing unit  may analyze the received additional function expansion message and may determine the API library based on the analysis. The message processing unit  may discover an API feature used for the widget, select an available API module, and use the selected API module for API mapping.","The security policy processing unit  may determine a processing scheme of the called API library based on a predetermined security policy.","The API library mapping processing unit  may call an API function from the API library determined based on the analysis.","Prior to execution of a widget, the widget manager  may determine the widget and APIs suitable for a local service circumstance through negotiation. For example, when a user device supports a context awareness function, the widget manager  may request a local service server for downloading of an intelligent widget and designate an intelligent API call module suitable for an intelligent widget API feature, so that the widget may send a query and get a result from the context awareness engine.","When the intelligent widget requests an execution of an intelligent widget API using a communication API, the widget manager  may add context awareness engine information, transfer the context awareness engine information to the context awareness engine as a query, perform inference, and then transfer again an inference result to the widget. As such, the widget manager  may share the inference result with other widgets similar to a device API. A widget API request and a corresponding result may be transferred to a sensor abstraction layer (SAL) of the context awareness engine and be used as user information collected from the widget.","For the above operation, the widget manager  may store the transferred execution results and provide a sharing function with other widgets.","According to example embodiments, the widget manager  may enhance a single tasking structure and improve speed when employing a widget expansion function, and may also readily embody a complex algorithm. In addition, the widget manager  may be suitable for collecting sensor and user information, and enables cooperation and material sharing between widgets. The widget manager  may also maintain a security policy when accessing an API library and readily perform a development.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"In operation , the operation method of the mobile communication terminal may receive an additional function expansion message that is generated based on an expansion of an additional function of a widget.","In operation , the operation method of the mobile communication terminal may determine an API library by analyzing the received additional function expansion message.","The operation method of the mobile communication terminal may determine a processing scheme of the called API library based on a predetermined security policy.","When the API library is determined, the operation method of the mobile communication terminal may call the determined API library.","In operation , the operation method of the mobile communication terminal may transfer an execution result of the called API function and an inference result from a context awareness engine.","In operation , the operation method of the mobile communication terminal may store the transferred execution results, and provide a sharing function with other widgets.","For the above operation, a widget manager applied to the mobile communication terminal may transfer an API execution result and a context awareness engine execution result to the widget in a form of a response message, and may manage and store the execution results. When a request is received, the widget manager may share the execution results with other widgets.","Since a script based API is reconfigured as a script using only a message communication API, a web plug-in may not be used to expand an additional function of a widget. The widget manager may periodically call a device API and an intelligent API as necessary or in response to a request, and may transfer related result information to widgets.","According to example embodiments, an operation method of a mobile communication method may correspond to a message communication scheme using a widget manager and thus, may additionally expand a script function of a widget and may not employ a complex web plug-in, and thus, may be independent from a web platform. The widget manager may call a device API and an intelligent API as a proxy, and may share corresponding results with other widgets. Accordingly, it is possible to support a service using a complex algorithm and to readily apply a security policy.","The processes, functions, methods and\/or software described above including a communication method of a mobile communication terminal may be recorded, stored, or fixed in one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media that includes program instructions to be implemented by a computer to cause a processor to execute or perform the program instructions. The media may also include, alone or in combination with the program instructions, data files, data structures, and the like. The media and program instructions may be those specially designed and constructed, or they may be of the kind well-known and available to those having skill in the computer software arts.
