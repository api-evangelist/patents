title: Knowledge-based condition survey inspection (KBCSI) framework and procedure
abstract: A knowledge-based condition survey inspection (KBSCI) framework and procedure for use with an engineering management system (EMS) that tailors types of condition survey inspections (CSIs) and inspection intervals to empirically-established life cycles of component-sections. Embodiments of the invention facilitate proactive life cycle management, scheduling appropriate types of CSIs only when needed. The frequency and type of inspection is tailored to items important to a facility manager, such as the importance to the operation of individual component-sections and their individual life cycle, not the overall life cycle of a system or facility. Further, additional useful information is available from the data collected to maintain embodiments of the KBCSI framework so that meaningful “What-If” analysis may be performed in support of decision makers. By tailoring CSIs to needs rather than an arbitrary inspection schedule designed to only catch deficiencies, significant life cycle cost savings are realized.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLE"],"p":["Under paragraph 1(a) of Executive Order 10096, the conditions under which this invention was made entitle the Government of the United States, as represented by the Secretary of the Army, to the entire right, title and interest therein of any patent granted thereon by the United States. This patent and related ones are available for licensing. Contact Bea Shahin at 217 373-7234 or Phillip Stewart at 601 634-4113.","Embodiments of the present invention may be used to complement an engineering management system (EMS) such as BUILDER\u2122. BUILDER\u2122 is a product in the family of Engineered Management Systems (EMS) developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at its Engineering Research and Development Center-Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL) in Champaign, Ill.","BUILDER\u2122 combines engineering, architectural, and management methods with data base management software to provide decision support. BUILDER\u2122 provides engineers and facility managers with an automated tool to support decisions regarding what, when, where, and how best to maintain buildings and their key components.","BUILDER\u2122 consists of three interrelated activities: 1) data collection in the field, 2) data entry into a database management system and other data management activity, and 3) manipulation of the resultant database for decision support. BUILDER\u2122 supports: assessing condition objectively, establishing minimum acceptable condition criteria, budgeting, using \u201cWhat if\u201d scenarios, prioritizing work, developing annual work plans, monitoring contractor performance, establishing a condition history, and scheduling re-inspection. BUILDER\u2122 also accommodates automating the presentation of data to decision makers in briefings and reports.","BUILDER\u2122 provides outputs such as: automated inspection procedures and schedules, benefit analyses, budget optimization analyses, and engineering analyses, all with enhanced graphics for presentation to decision makers. Because BUILDER\u2122 uses a standard database software program, it interfaces easily with other EMS programs using the same or compatible database software developed by ERDC-CERL, such as ROOFER\u2122, PAVER\u2122, PIPER\u2122, etc.","BUILDER\u2122 uses as its primary condition measure a condition index (CI) rating on a scale of 0\u2013100. The CI for each component (termed component-section hereafter) is computed from inspection data that records the type, severity, and density of each discovered \u201cproblem\u201d or \u201canomaly\u201d (termed \u201cdistress\u201d in BUILDER\u2122). Empirically-developed deterioration curves (termed life cycle (LC) curves hereafter) show the optimal point at which maintenance work should be done to avoid costly rehabilitation or premature replacement.","With the assistance of the IMPACT\u2122 simulation program included with BUILDER\u2122, facility managers can develop long-range work plans based on a sound investment strategy. By. providing an objective description of condition and an automated means of exploring various options under different budget scenarios, BUILDER\u2122 and IMPAC\u2122 together facilitate formulating multi-year work plans and justifying funding requests.","Although BUILDER\u2122 was developed for military installations, it may be used by any organization that has facility management responsibilities. Version 2.2 of BUILDER\u2122 was released in December of 2003. There are new features and program enhancements in BUILDER\u2122 2.2 that improve the user interface and advance the science of building asset management. A list of the most significant enhancements is provided below.","BUILDER\u2122 Stand-Alone Remote Entry Database (RED). The RED program for BUILDER\u2122 has been improved for greater ease of use while in the field. These enhancements translate into significant speed and accuracy improvements during the inventory and condition survey inspection (CSI) collection process.","BUILDING COPY and BUILDING TEMPLATES. The one-time collection of building data is-the most costly phase in BUILDER\u2122 implementation. As a result, BUILDER\u2122 2.2 has added features to speed up this process. When a group of buildings are identical or nearly identical and all built around the same time, the \u201cBUILDING COPY\u201d feature is a useful tool. It allows you to collect the inventory for one building and copy it for describing other similar buildings. This bypasses the need to inventory each like building separately. In addition, for a \u201ctypical\u201d building, i.e., one not identical to other buildings in your portfolio but basically alike, a \u201cBUILDING TEMPLATE\u201d may be created for that building type. For all buildings of the same type a system inventory may be completed from that template. Inventory quantities may be scaled according to building size and the current template may be adjusted to \u00b110%. Each \u201ccomponent-section\u201d of the building is initially dated automatically to the year of construction of the building. Multiple such templates may be created and stored in an e-library.","Installation Date Estimation. In BUILDER\u2122 v.2.2, the assumption is made that component-sections are replaced after a reasonable expected (predicted) life cycle. Version 2.2 compares the age of the building to the Expected Service Life of the component-section to develop an accurate default value for the installation date. This feature facilitates quickly creating an inventory model. When BUILDER\u2122 automatically creates the system inventory, the estimated age of each component-section is developed from current data, yielding accurate projections of condition.","Estimation Date Check Box. BUILDER\u2122 v.2.2 also recognizes that many times the installation date for many component-sections is unknown. A check box has been added to flag such instances. When checked, the installation date is displayed with a yellow background, indicating an estimate. Estimated dates are also denoted on the system inventory report to alert of the need to verify installation dates.","Distress CSI with Quantities. In addition to choosing an estimated range for the affected distress density, BUILDER\u2122 v.2.2 allows the option of entering the quantity of measured component-sections and affected distress quantity. BUILDER\u2122 v.2.2 then calculates an appropriate density range from this input. For large samples, this feature provides a better estimate of the affected quantity. In addition, it provides quantitative information about a given distress for planning scope of repair or replacement work.","Project Creation. With previous versions of BUILDER\u2122, the component-section is the fundamental \u201cmanagement unit.\u201d While also true for v.2.2, in BUILDER\u2122 v.2.2 component-section work items may be combined for management as a single project. Thus, the project planning, funding, execution, and completion of these work items may be controlled under a single project. These projects are prioritized and ranked and compete for funding with other items in the work plan list.","Automatic Inventory\/Inspection Updates. As work gets denoted as completed in BUILDER\u2122 v.2.2, inventory and inspection records are automatically updated. This includes updating the year installed, material\/equipment category and component-section type and quantity in the inventory if a component-section is replaced. Automatic inspection dates are scheduled to reflect the improvement in condition when items are replaced, repaired, or painted.","Fiscal Start Date Configuration. BUILDER\u2122 v.2.2 allows for a fiscal year start date. This date is used by IMPACT\u2122 to estimate completion dates for both existing line items and evaluation of new work items.","The IMPAC\u2122 program has been released in v.1.1. Some of the key enhancements of v.1.1 are discussed below.","System Selection for IMPACT\u2122 Simulation. IMPACT\u2122 v.1.1 permits defining the scope of an IMPACT\u2122 scenario for selected systems. Thus, for example, separate work plans for Roofing, HVAC, or interior work may be created. By running simulations for only select systems, the processing time for IMPACT\u2122 simulation is decreased.","Building Status Changes. IMPAC\u2122 identifies building status changes that will take place within the horizon of a scenario. For example, if a building is scheduled to be demolished within the time frame of a multi-year simulation, IMPAC\u2122 v.1.1 recognizes the status change and applies a different standard level to the building so as not to budget money for renovation as it nears demolition.","Adding Buildings During an IMPACT\u2122 Scenario. IMPAC\u2122 v.1.1 permits identifying when a new building footprint will enter inventory. These new buildings will automatically be entered into the simulation and compete for funding with existing inventory.","Conventional methods of scheduling inspections most often schedule inspections at set time intervals with little or no regard to the characteristics or importance of the individual component-section. Typical inspection intervals may be two or more years and are often set using budgetary constraints of only the inspection costs. The frequency of inspection for individual buildings and systems within the buildings may vary. However, individual component-sections are often not considered in scheduling inspections even though each has its unique life cycle. Further, conventional inspections are often conducted as \u201cdeficiency\u201d inspections, i.e., deficiency inspections document only what is wrong with various component-sections with a goal of addressing only the discovered deficiencies and not assessing overall condition of the component-section. Conventional deficiency inspections fill the \u201cjob jar.\u201d Because of budget constraints, the \u201cjob jar\u201d is seldom emptied and the conventional procedure insures repeating the same inefficiencies with little room for feedback or \u201clessons learned.\u201d Conventional inspection methods are expensive in that some items are inspected too often and others are inspected only after replacement is the only option.","Embodiments of the present invention include a framework and procedure for establishing a condition survey inspection (CSI) schedule based on measuring individual component-section's condition and \u201cdegradation\u201d or \u201cdeterioration\u201d trend, thus establishing an empirically-derived life cycle for making decisions on when to inspect that component-section, independent of any arbitrary inspection interval. Embodiments of the present invention support a range of decision support activities, such as budgeting, scheduling, planning, performance assessment, etc., resulting in a management tool that does more than just filling a \u201cjob jar.\u201d The approach used by embodiments of the present invention reduces overall cost by taking a tailored approach to life cycle cost. It uses a flexible Knowledge-Based Condition Survey Inspection (KBCSI) method to augment the BUILDER\u2122 EMS and its complementary IMPACT\u2122 software, as well as like engineering management systems. Embodiments provide a structure and procedure for defining inspection requirements and planning, scheduling, budgeting, re-scheduling, and prioritizing inspection activity as well as permitting post-work assessment.","A knowledge-based condition survey inspection (KBCSI) framework and procedure complements an engineering management system (EMS) employing \u201ccommercially available\u201d database software, such as MICROSOFT\u00ae ACCESS\u00ae. Among other advantages, linking KBCSI to an automated EMS supports decision makers in accomplishing routine facility management activities that include: defining framework elements; establishing requirements and planning, scheduling, prioritizing and budgeting \u201csustainment\/restoration modernization\u201d (SRM) activity; and evaluating contractor performance.","A framework for implementing KBCSI in an EMS is defined and requirements established for conducting condition survey inspections (CSIs). Executing an initial KBCSI provides data for computing the initial condition index (CI) for a component-section, the indexes updated each time a CSI is accomplished thereafter. As used with a KBSCI in support of an EMS such as BUILDER\u2122, such an index is termed the Component-Section Condition Index (CSCI).","In general, embodiments of the present invention provide a method for tailoring inspections and maintenance of component-sections of components that may be incorporated in systems within facilities. The component-sections have an established life cycle. The method comprises first linking to one or more databases of one or more engineering management systems (EMS), wherein the linking provides one or more identifiers and one or more parameters identified with each component-section of interest. Next one or more types of condition survey inspections are identified for use. Criteria are then established for inspection of the component-sections during their expected (predicted) life cycle. Some of the criteria may be established from data collected during a condition survey inspection of the component-section. A component-section condition index (CSCI) is defined with discrete values for aiding in assessing the condition of the individual component-sections. One or more algorithms are employed to establish a relationship between the values of the condition index and elapsed time over the life cycle of each component-section. The algorithms may use data from one or more condition survey inspections and pre-specified criteria to establish the relationship. One way the relationship may be presented to a facility manager is in the form of a life cycle (LC) curve of the component-section as displayed on a graph. Areas on the curve may be delineated as defining one or more zones within the relationship by applying the criteria, inspection data, or both. Within each zone, one or more types of condition survey inspections may be recommended as optimum. Further, the frequency of conducting condition survey inspections may be optimized by applying the pre-specified criteria and information learned by recently conducted condition survey inspection. The method enables condition survey inspections of specific component-sections to be tailored based on the life cycle of those component-sections.","The criteria used with the method may include, but not be limited to: facility usage importance, system usage importance, component-section usage importance, expected service life of the component-section of interest, remaining service life (RSL) of the component-section, maintenance life of the component-section, remaining maintenance life (RML) of the component-section, rate of deterioration of the component-section, specific distress tracking (from past inspection) of the component-section, condition zone within which the component-section lies, condition standards applied to the component-section, deterioration factor (as defined below), CSCI gain (as defined below), mission dependency index (MDI) (as defined below), and maximum timeframe between condition survey inspections (as defined below).","One engineering management system to which the method may be applied by linking to its databases is BUILDER\u2122. The types of condition survey inspections that may be employed include, but are not limited to: direct ratings, direct ratings with sampling, direct ratings without sampling, paint ratings, paint ratings with sampling, paint ratings without sampling, distress surveys, distress surveys with sampling, distress surveys without sampling, distress surveys with quantities, and combinations thereof.","Some embodiments of the present invention use a condition index having a range of 0\u2013100 and describe five zones over the life cycle of the component-section: an initial zone, a pre-sweet spot zone, a sweet spot zone, a post-sweet spot zone, and a dead zone. The sweet spot zone incorporates a sweet spot defined as a time interval in the life cycle of the component-section when performing maintenance on the component-section is predicted to be optimal.","The method provides for establishing the instantaneous rate of deterioration for the component-section as determined at a given point in its life cycle by calculating the slope of the tangent to the life cycle (LC) curve at that point. The method also provides for applying the deterioration factor to determine if scheduling at least one condition survey inspection, in an upcoming inspection period for example, may be warranted.","The method may provide for iterating the algorithms at least after maintenance has been performed on each component-section, where performing maintenance may have resulted in altering at least one of the criteria, the life cycle, the zones, or the LC curve. Upon iteration, it may be appropriate to apply a factor termed CSCI gain to modify the LC curve to more accurately describe the current life cycle of the component-section, to re-establish zones, and to re-draw the LC curve.","The method also may provide for assigning an optimal type of condition survey inspection to each zone. The method further may comprise rolling up the condition indexes as represented by the LC curve into a condition index of a component of the facility that incorporates that component-section.","The method also establishes objectives and provides guidance as to which types of condition survey inspections may fulfill each objective.","Also provided in embodiments of the present invention, is a method for managing facilities that may incorporate systems, components and component-sections. The component sections are incorporated in a component and have an established life cycle. In general this method comprises providing an engineering management system (EMS) incorporating one or more databases and linking to one or more of these databases. Once this linking has been established, the method employs the same general approach as above to facilitate managing the inspection and maintenance of facilities. An appropriate EMS for use with this method is BUILDER\u2122.","Refer to  for a sample hierarchy for rolling up condition indexes from component-section (CSCI) level  through building component (BCCI)  and system (SCI)  levels to that of a complete building (BCI) . In BUILDER\u2122, the CSCIs  are rolled up to the building component level  to provide a Building Component Condition Index (BCCI) that may be further rolled into the system level  to yield a System Condition Index (SCI), depending on building size and complexity. The SCIs are finally rolled into Building Condition indexes (BCIs)  that may be further averaged (not shown separately) for groups of buildings, complexes, or installations. Other indexes may be employed.","Where sampling is used in the CSI, a Sample Unit Condition Index (SUCI) may be computed. For painted surfaces on the building, a Coating Condition Index (CCI) may be computed. All indexes are used to assess the condition of the facility (building). Using algorithms incorporated in BUILDER\u2122, CIs are computed automatically from data collected using the KBCSI.","The inventory of buildings, systems, components and component-sections has been loaded in the EMS, e.g., BUILDER\u2122, prior to implementation of a KBCSI. An inventory provides the number and description of elements (systems, components, and the basic component-sections) in the building that are to be \u201csustained and repaired.\u201d A \u201ccomponent-section\u201d may be differentiated by the type and amount of material of which it is made. For example, parts of an \u201cexterior wall finish\/covering\u201d may be made of wood and other parts of masonry. Component-sections may-be created to meet an individual user's requirements based on layout or functional use. For example, \u201cinterior ceiling\u201d may comprise one component-section of \u201c1floor ceiling\u201d and another of \u201c2floor ceiling,\u201d although each may be identical but for location. In all cases, the condition assessment process supported by the KBCSI is conducted first at the component-section level. By definition, the component-section is the lowest level at which CIs are calculated.","Refer to . BUILDER\u2122 incorporates default Expected Service Life values for component-sections, as estimated from a compilation of sources. The actual values may differ widely between given sources. Thus, it is beneficial to perform a condition assessment to both establish and calibrate a relationship between predicted Condition Index (CI) and Time that may result in a life cycle (LC) curve  of the shape presented in . From this LC curve  two useful estimates may be obtained: the Remaining Maintenance Life (RML) and the Remaining Service Life (RSL) as discussed below.","In BUILDER\u2122, the default Expected Service Life values are used to \u201cseed\u201d prediction models for an initial prediction of Expected Service Life. As condition data are added using embodiments of the present invention, the Expected Service Life, and the values resulting therefrom, such as RSL, are adjusted based on actual condition, yielding improved estimates of when a component-section may need refurbishment or replacement.","Each component-section has a unique life cycle. The life cycle is delimited by a finite Expected Service Life, shown as SERVICE LIFE in  at a CSCI, i.e., terminal condition index value, at the end of which replacement or refurbishment is expected to be required. The end of the Expected Service Life is shown in  as point  on the life-cycle (LC) curve . The period between the AGE NOW, i.e., the point  on the LC curve , and the Expected Service Life point  is established as the RSL. Many component-sections also have an Expected Maintenance Life shown at point  on the LC curve , and depicted as MAINT LIFE in , at which point  some work is expected (predicted) to be needed to achieve the Expected Service Life. The period between AGE NOW, point , and the point  on the LC curve defining the Expected Maintenance Life is established as the RML. Both RSL and RML are used in embodiments of the present invention to assess condition of a component-section.","Although actual data may be used to calculate an improved estimate of RSL in a rather straightforward manner, determination of RML presents a more complicated estimation process. BUILDER\u2122 provides a function to address this for those maintenance actions that are not classed as preventive maintenance. Many component-sections exhibit a maintenance protocol that includes an optimum time interval during which maintenance should be performed, colloquially termed the \u201csweet spot\u201d as indicated by the oval  along the LC curve . This sweet spot  represents a narrow range  of CSCI values, shown as CSCIin , that represent the optimum expected time interval during which maintenance or repair should be performed. An example is replacing a bearing in a fan before the blades are allowed to wobble and hit the frame, requiring further maintenance. Thus, performing work during the sweet spot  minimizes the \u201cpenalty cost\u201d incurred from deferring maintenance, yielding life cycle cost (LCC) savings. User-defined \u201ctrigger points\u201d for starting maintenance work, as defined in BUILDER\u2122, for example, may be coupled to the sweet spot . These trigger points may be customized for types of buildings or systems, as well as for missions performed in the buildings or by the systems.","Refer to . Once a component-section has been inspected and had any necessary maintenance accomplished, i.e., repaired, refurbished, or replaced, the LC curve  resets as is depicted in  as LC curve . The initial LC curve , shown as part solid and part dashed-line in , is replaced with a new LC curve  that is calculated using data from the maintenance done at point  in , most likely during the sweet spot  of the LC curve  of . Point  in this iteration represents the AGE NOW of the component-section. This iteration uses the same CSCIrange  as the first LC curve  although this need not remain the same. Thus the sweet spot, as represented by the oval , represents the same range  of CSCIs (i.e., position on the y-axis) for this iteration as it was for the initial seeding using the initial LC curve . This need not be the case, however, as the acceptable range  of CSCIs may change based on changing operating conditions, upgrades, etc.","A new maintenance point  may be chosen in the center of the new sweet spot  using a method similar to that used to establish the intial LC curve . In , the LC curve  is shown ending at the same Expected Service Life point  as for the initial LC curve . This may not represent the case where the component-section is actually replaced or refurbished at its maintenance point  rather than repaired. How much Expected Service Life is extended, if at all, is dependent on how extensive the work done at the maintenance point  was as represented by \u201cCSCI Gain,\u201d that is what percentage of full capability was obtained. A typical maintenance action may extend the Expected Service Life as shown with the dashed-dotted curve , yielding an extended Expected Service Life (XSL) and concomitant extended Remaining Service Life (XRSL) that extends Expected Service Life to the point . Maximum gain of  is realized for this example as represented by the starting point of the curve . The post-maintenance CSCI, i.e., the CSCI at the start of the new LC curve , may be less than 100 if not all the \u201cdistresses\u201d in the component-section are fully addressed by the maintenance performed at point . The curve  in  shows an anomolous condition where the CSCI Gain is actually maximum at  and the total Maintenance Life has been reduced and set equal to RML (since the new LC curve  starts at AGE NOW), but the Expected Service Life, still ending at point , has not been extended. This could result if other factors, such as operating cycle or load, were also changed at the point  on the LC curve .","BUILDER\u2122 offers different types of CSIs. These are:\n\n","The DSwDQ provides a record for each component-section of the type of distresses present, e.g., cracked, damaged, deteriorated; the severity level, e.g., high, medium, low; and the quantity. This is the most detailed CSI but also the most time-consuming and expensive.","The DSwS or DSw\/oS is similar to the DSwDQ but quantity is not recorded. Rather the density, defined as distress quantity divided by subcomponent amount, is estimated to be in one of a number of pre-specified ranges. Because of the estimation, it is faster and less expensive than the DSwDQ. Sampling is desirable if the component-section is large, complex or discontinuous.","The DRwS or DRw\/oS provides for visually inspecting each component-section and evaluating it against a set of rating criteria and selecting the appropriate rating. No data are collected on distresses. It is faster and less expensive that DSwS or DSw\/oS. Sampling is desirable if the component-section is large, complex or discontinuous.","PRwS or PRw\/oS is used for painted surfaces. This rating is similar to DRwS or DRw\/oS but limited to painted surfaces.","Performing CSIs permits:\n\n","At the completion of each CSI, a CSCI will be computed together with RSL (or paint life), RML, and a Rate of Deterioration approximated. Additionally, each roll-up CI, e.g., SCI, BCI, will be re-computed.","Refer to Table 1.

By matching needs to the least costly method that will meet the objective, cost savings may be realized. For example, although different approaches may be used-to satisfy an objective, factors to be considered when selecting one include where on the LC curve , ,  the component-section is at the time of a CSI.","Refer to , displaying an intial LC curve  segmented into four time intervals (I\u2013IV) in which CSIs may be conducted and maintenance may be accomplished. In Region I, i.e., that period prior to the earliest point  that defines the sweet spot , no maintenance (sustainment or refurbishment) work is foreseen. Although no maintenance is forecast for Region I, CSIs are needed to satisfy Objectives 1\u20136 of Table 1. The simplest and least expensive types of CSIs may be suitable, such as the Direct Rating and Paint Rating CSIs. Note that in the general case, calculating the RSL during this time interval is not of primary importance since it is probably far in the future. Further, although useful for determining work scope in the future, Objective 7 of Table 1, may be accomplished using a simple Direct Rating since setting work requirements now is beyond a normal planning horizon.","Region II, i.e., that period between points  and  on the LC curve  of , covers the sweet spot  during which time interval \u201cnormal\u201d maintenance is predicted as being optimal. The sweet spot  has been predicted as the interval that may require some repair work in the general case, but may also require replacement or refurbishment depending on the specific type of component-section, its importance, and other factors such as need to maintain mission integrity.","Region III, i.e., that period between point  and  on the LC curve  of , represents a relatively short period occurring immediately after the sweet spot  has been passed. Region III may represent the \u201cfirst time\u201d maintenance scenario that arises when budget shortfalls did not permit addressing maintenance requirements during the sweet spot . Work accomplished in Region III may require either repair or replacement. Further, repair may be more extensive than what would have been needed in Region II, or include refurbishment that would have not have been required at this time if done in Region II.","Finally, if first maintenance work is delayed until Region IV, i.e., after point  on the LC curve  of , it may be more cost effective to replace the component-section even though its full Expected Service Life as represented at point  has not been met.","Refer to , showing five \u201ccondition zones\u201d A\u2013E. Each zone represents an expected condition, defined by a range of CIs, as predicted by the initial LC curve  of . The \u201coptimum\u201d CSI type to be employed in each zone will be different. The condition index range for Zone A may be so close to 100 as to require only a Direct Rating with Sampling CSI (for component-sections large or complex enough to warrant sampling). The condition index range for Zone B is that defining what may be termed a \u201csweet spot approach zone\u201d and, although no work may be scheduled for Zone B, a Distress CSI with Sampling (again for component-sections large or complex enough to warrant sampling) may be warranted to prepare for scheduling work in the sweet spot .","The CSCI boundary between Zone A and Zone B, designated at point  on the LC curve in , is an entry to the sweet spot . That condition index value, CSCI, establishes the boundary between Zone A and Zone B and is determined from predicted change in the estimated rate of deterioration (the tangent to the curve  at a relevant point within Zone A) and the desired long-range work plan horizon (e.g., 5-year plan) as set by the facility manager. For example, assume the CSCI at the beginning of the sweet spot  is set by the facility manager at , the rate of deterioration is set at two points\/year, and the horizon is set at five years. Zone B would begin at a CSCI of  or  \u201ccondition points\u201d (5 years\u00d72 points\/yr) above the start of the sweet spot (shown at point  on LC curve , but not to scale).","Zone C encompasses the sweet spot  but extends beyond it by a small margin as shown in . Competing priorities may delay maintenance work beyond the optimal sweet spot  and this is taken into account in defining the boundaries of Zone C. However, deferring beyond a planned work period may require a Distress CSI with Quantities for the entire component-section to account for the incremental degradation in condition index below the sweet spot . Further, depending on how far the degradation has progressed, replacement may be a viable alternative in Zone C. Objective 9 of Table 1, \u201cEstablish when cost effective to replace,\u201d may be met in this zone, depending on when the CSI is conducted within Zone C.","Meeting the objective of quantifying distresses for maintenance work, i.e., Objective 8 in Table 1, is important to facility managers. Optimally, quantification provided by a Distress CSI with Quantity refines the scope of work and accurately estimates the cost. Essentially, it creates a \u201cjob\u201d for inclusion in a \u201cjob jar.\u201d This type of CSI is sometimes referred to as the \u201cJust-In-Time\u201d (JIT) CSI. Although Objectives 1\u20136 of Table 1 will be met by this type of CSI, they are secondary to Objective 7, \u201cDetermine broad scope of work for future planning,\u201d and Objective 8. If it is found that not all of the component-section needs maintenance it may be split into two or more parts for creating jobs for the job jar.","The CSCI boundary, CSCI, between Zone B and Zone C, i.e., establishing the sweet spot  start at point  on the LC curve , may be set by the facility manager. It may be based on two factors. The first is economic, i.e., to minimize the cost accruing from deferring work, if work is, in fact, deferred. The second is the minimum condition index at which the component-section should be maintained. Often, the economic critierion is used in setting the minimum condition index standard. Ideally, the boundary, CSCI, should be the central point  of the sweet spot  of  minus one year to allow for quantification of work scope and adding the job to the job jar just in time for the next annual well-defined work plan. This boundary, defined at a condition index, CSCI, of , is established in BUILDER\u2122, serving as a trigger point for executing work or, as a minimum, identifying those component-section candidates to prioritize in scheduling work. The sweet spot  need not be the same for the same types of buildings or same types of building components, depending on the use of the building or the importance of a specific component-section in operation of the building.","Zone D in  is sometimes referred to as the \u201cmissed opportunity zone.\u201d Once in this zone, the primary objective is Objective 10 of Table 1, i.e., determining how much life is left, or RSL. Most often the economically feasible choice is replacement. Since replacement is warranted, there is no need to document distresses. For Zone D's less than optimal condition index, i.e., well past the sweet spot  and nearing the end of the Expected Service Life at point  on the LC curve , a Direct Rating with Sampling (for component-sections large or complex enough to warrant sampling) is all that is warranted since the optimum maintenance period has passed and the predicted RSL is short compared to the entire Expected Service Life. Further, since painting will be included in the replacement in most cases, there is no need to do a paint rating CSI. Objectives 1\u20135 and 7 are also met by a Direct Rating CSI.","Finally, for Zone E, often termed the \u201cdead zone\u201d, that starts at the terminal index, CSCI, the component-section exhibits a considerably \u201cdegraded\u201d condition index, at and beyond the condition index, CSCI, predicted at the end of Expected Service Life at point  on the LC curve . It would not be cost effective to do any CSIs in this zone. Objectives 1\u20133 of Table 1 are met and none of the others can be met or are meaningless with such a low CSCI.","Each of these CSI types are tailored for use in the above zones based on both the initial and any subsequent LC prediction curves , ,  and provide data in support of establishing maintenance work requirements. For example, if the RML is a few years, a Direct Rating CSI may suffice. However, if the RML is a year or less, and it is desired to correct distresses, a Distress CSI with Quantities is appropriate.","There are exceptions to the above generalized scenarios defining the zones of . Three examples are given below. These are examples only and other scenarios may occur in practice.","Occasionally, a component-section is non-maintainable. One such type of component-section may be that type referred to as a \u201cconsumable.\u201d That is, it is \u201cused up\u201d routinely with little or no maintenance expected. These general types of component-sections are replaced as needed. Another type of non-maintainable is one exhibiting only a \u201crun-to-fail\u201d option with either a minimal risk at failure or a high risk. This may be the most general case of a \u201cconsumable.\u201d CSIs are not needed for these types. Those component-sections whose failure results in a high risk to resources or personnel require that replacement be scheduled prior to expected failure. Examples may include batteries in battery-powered alarms, fire retardant in fire extinguishers, etc. For those high risk component-sections, the sweet spot  is set at a point to assure continuity of service and replacement prior to the predicted end of Expected Service Life. The time of replacement is based on an acceptable risk tolerance.","Another exception is event controlled. If a catastrophic event, e.g., hurricane, earthquake, explosion, flood, etc. were to occur, the life cycle of the component-section may be aborted or restricted. Thus, after such an event, a CSI may be mandated. The type depends on the nature of the damage and urgency of repair.","Some component-sections may be \u201cmaintainable\u201d but exhibit an inherent rapid rate of deterioration or have a short Expected Service Life in comparison to companion component-sections in the same system or building. These types may permit both Zone A and Zone B to be skipped because the sweet spot  approaches so rapidly in comparison to other component-sections in the same system or building.","Conventionally, the timing of inspections has been set on some fixed schedule, e.g., annually or bi-annually. This insures that some component-sections will be inspected \u201ctoo often\u201d and others not often enough. The KBCSI employed in embodiments of the present invention uses a flexible scheduling approach based on supporting the objectives listed in Table 1.","KBCSI considers the expected CSCIs of each of the component-sections and uses that information to calculate values for RML, RSL, condition zone location (e.g., Zones A\u2013E), and rate of deterioration. Using these calculated values, and other criteria, such as budget and resource availability, employing a KBCSI tailors a CSI for those component-sections required to meet applicable objectives of Table 1 in a given year, and only those component-sections. Criteria used to implement embodiments of the present invention include, but may not be limited to:","Building\/system usage importance","Component-section usage importance","Expected Service Life","RSL","Maintenance life","RML","Rate of deterioration","Specific distress tracking","Condition Zone","Condition standards","Maximum timeframe between CSIs","CSCI gain","Deterioration factor","Mission dependency index (MDI)","In BUILDER\u2122 the importance of a building or system is measured by the mission dependency index (NMDI). However, if an NMDI value has not been determined, the function of the building or system may be used as a surrogate measure of importance, e.g., an operations building would have a higher use value than a storage shed.","The component-sections that are critical to operation of a system or building, such as the power grid or HVAC equipment, would be rated higher than ancillary systems such as background music or vending machines.","Those component-sections with a short life need to be surveyed (inspected) more often than those with long lives, all other factors being equal.","RSL may be a relatively important criteria in Zones A and D of . In Zone A, if the RSL is long, a CSI is needed less often than if it has a short RSL. In Zone D, CSIs should be scheduled at specific points prior to RSL going to zero.","Component-sections with short service lives need to be inspected more often than those with long service lives, all else being equal. Less change per year is expected for those with long lives and if the frequency of CSIs for component-sections with short lives is too far apart, the sweet spot  may be missed between CSIs.","RML sets the timing for CSIs. RML minus one year is a common time for performing a CSI. In BUILDER\u2122, the IMPACT\u2122 program has provisions for recommending work needs for future years that can be used to schedule these CSIs one year (or at some suitable time) prior to the predicted need for the maintenance action. In general, it is advantageous to have \u201cwork scheduled year minus one year\u201d as the year for conducting a CSI.","If a component-section is deteriorating at a rapid rate or at a rate greater than predicted initially, the CSI should be scheduled more often.","In certain cases, a past CSI may have revealed particular distresses at a severity level that would require more frequent CSIs to track the rate at which the distress density is growing (if at all) or for changing the assessment \u201con the books\u201d to a higher severity level.","Establishing a condition zone for a component-section aids in determining the type of CSI to do. The condition zone in which a component-section is assigned also sets the frequency when combined with the current values for RML and RSL.","Condition standards affect the range of the condition zone, building importance factor, and component-section importance factor. Taken together, these factors contribute to a desired frequency of CSIs.","A facility manager may set a maximum interval between CSIs to insure that a particular component-section does not go too long with a CSI. Criteria may be set to assure that no more than a set number of years lapses before any given component is inspected, regardless of the other factors used in determining CSI type and frequency.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the Knowledge-Based Inspection (KBI) Program is linked to BUILDER\u2122 and selects from its database a subset of component-sections to consider for the next round of CSIs. The selection algorithm is based on pieces of data (knowledge) associated with each component-section. The program permits comparing these data with user-defined parameters as discussed below.","The KBI Program accesses information about the CSI history of a component-section to facilitate knowledgeable decisions about both the type of CSI and the timing of the CSI as relates to the next scheduled CSI cycle. There are four available CSI options in this embodiment:","Do Nothing","Direct rating (w\/ or w\/o sampling)","Distress survey (w\/ or w\/o sampling)","Distress survey with Quantities","The KBI Program initially decides whether to include a component-section in the CSI subset of interest, e.g., a subset that would include CSIs scheduled for the upcoming CSI cycle.

Upon opening the program, three options are presented. Using the KBI program initially requires linking to the database where the BUILDER\u2122 data reside. Thus, initially one would select, e.g., by clicking, a button designated \u201cLink to BUILDER\u2122 Databases,\u201d one of the three options. This brings up a \u201cChange Database Location\u201d screen with three boxes: \u201cInventory,\u201d \u201cLookup,\u201d and \u201cReference.\u201d Clicking the button to the right of each database path (box) above brings up a drop down table to facilitate navigation to the appropriate database. Upon selecting the path for each of the three, clicking the \u201cDone\u201d button sets the paths to the chosen databases. In one embodiment, the \u201cInventory\u201d database is loaded as the current BUILDER\u2122 database. If it is desired to use a BUILDER\u2122 database other than the current BUILDER\u2122 database or another EMS database, this will need to be selected separately by going through the above three drop down lists as appropriate.","When establishing parameters for one embodiment of the KBI Program as used with BUILDER\u2122, there are two options for sorting the inventory database. The first is by \u201cBuilding Use.\u201d For Department of Defense (DoD) buildings, a different parameter may be set for nine (9) categories of facility use: Operational\/Training, Maintenance\/Production, R&D, Supply\/Storage, Hospital\/Medical, Administrative, Unaccompanied Personnel Housing, Community, and Family Housing. The second option is to sort by Mission Dependency Index (MDI) range. This assumes that an MDI assessment has been done for each facility and the appropriate data loaded in the database. In one embodiment, a different parameter set is chosen for each of the following MDI ranges: 100\u201386, 85\u201371, 70\u201355, 54\u201338, 37\u201320, and 19\u20130.","For the above embodiment, each Building Use group or MDI range may be chosen from the drop down list and the parameters for each may be adjusted within a matrix, that includes data such as Building Number, System, Component, Material or Equipment Category, Component Type, Section Name, Installation Date, RSL, RML, Projected CI, Quantity, etc. Upon setting all parameters in the matrix, a \u201cRecompute Data\u201d button is clicked and the information is refreshed.","In one embodiment, also available onscreen with the matrix is a display of status of the various Zones (A\u2013E) with information such as lower boundary, number of CSIs within the zone, Deterioration (or Degradation) Factor, etc.","In one embodiment, also available onscreen with the matrix is a pie chart displaying how many of the component-sections are recommended for a CSI and how many of each type of CSI are recommended.

This list may be printed or exported to an EXCEL\u00ae spreadsheet for further manipulation.","The KBCSI framework and method, as employed in embodiments of the present invention tailors inspection methods and intervals to established life cycles of individual component-sections. This tailoring enables decision support to be tailored throughout the life cycle of individual elements in a system or facility. CSIs need not be done only when the \u201cwhole system\u201d or \u201cwhole facility\u201d is scheduled for inspection but rather when it is determined to be needed via proactive life cycle management. The frequency and type of inspection is tailored to items important to a facility manager, such as the importance to the operation of individual component-sections and their individual life cycle, not the overall life cycle of a system or facility. Further, additional useful information is available from the data collected to maintain embodiments of the KBCSI framework so that meaningful \u201cWhat-if\u201d analysis may be performed in support of the decision makers. Finally, by tailoring CSIs to needs rather than an arbitrary and capricious inspection schedule designed to only catch deficiencies, significant life cycle cost savings are realized.","Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the following claims.
