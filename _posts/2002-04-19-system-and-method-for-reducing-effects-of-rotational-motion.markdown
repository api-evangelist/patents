{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application 60\/285,112 titled \u201cMethod and System for Correcting Rotational Motion Artifacts Using Radial K-Space MRI\u201d, filed Apr. 20, 2001.","The present invention relates to the image processing arts and more particularly to improving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system images. It will be appreciated that the invention will also have application to other imaging systems like X-ray, CT, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and others.","Magnetic resonance imaging systems acquire diagnostic images without relying on ionizing radiation. Instead, MRI employs strong, static magnetic fields, radio-frequency (RF) pulses of energy, and time varying magnetic field gradient waveforms. MRI is a non-invasive procedure that employs nuclear magnetization and radio waves for producing internal pictures of a subject. Two or three-dimensional diagnostic image data is acquired for respective \u201cslices\u201d of a subject area. These data slices typically provide structural detail having, for example, a resolution of one millimeter or better.","Programmed steps for collecting data, which is used to generate the slices of the diagnostic image, are known as a magnetic resonance (MR) image pulse sequence. The MR image pulse sequence includes generating magnetic field gradient waveforms applied along up to three axes, and one or more RF pulses of energy. The set of gradient waveforms and RF pulses are repeated a number of times to collect sufficient data to reconstruct the image slices.","Data is acquired during respective excitations of an MR device. Ideally, there is little or no variation in the nuclear magnetization during the respective excitations. However, movement of the subject caused, for example, by breathing, cardiac pulsation, blood pulsation, and\/or voluntary movement, may change the nuclear magnetization from one excitation to the next. This change of the nuclear magnetization may degrade the quality of the MR data used to produce the images","Acquiring an MRI image takes a period of time. The period of time is determined, at least in part, by the number of scans that are taken and the number of data acquisitions in each scan. If the object being imaged moves during the scan then artifacts can be introduced into the image. Very small motions (e.g., 1 mm, 1\u00b0 of rotation) can introduce artifacts like blurring and ghosting. Some patients may have difficulties lying completely still, which can lead to MRI images of these patients being degraded by a rotational motion. Furthermore, some types of motion (e.g., heartbeat, respiration) require additional technologies for reducing the effects on imagery. Since these technologies may not yield ideal results, they too can lead to the degradation of MRI images due to rotational motion.","The following presents a simplified summary of methods, systems, APIs, data packets, and computer readable media for improving MRI images that are degraded by an object's rotational motion during MRI, to facilitate providing a basic understanding of these items. This summary is not an extensive overview and is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the methods, systems, computer readable media and so on or to delineate the scope of these items. This summary provides a conceptual introduction in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","This application describes a computer implemented method for reducing the effects on image quality of rotational motion during image acquisition by an MRI system. The method includes receiving data about a fiducial mark associated with the object to be imaged. A point source location of the fiducial can be computed from this point source data and a predicted sine wave in projection data that will be traced by the point source during the acquisition of radial k-space data can be predicted. The method also includes receiving MRI image data of the object. This image data can include, but is not limited to, one or more projections in the radial k-space associated with the object and an observed waveform that can be related to the predicted sine wave. The method also includes comparing the predicted sine wave to the observed waveform and, based on the comparison, selectively processing the image data to reduce the effects of a rotational motion of the object on the image. In one example, the selectively processed image data is then employed to construct a viewable image of the object.","The application also describes a system for improving the quality of an image of an object where the image is degraded by rotational motion of the object during image acquisition. The system includes a data receiver that receives MRI image data from the object being imaged. The image data can include, but is not limited to, object data and fiducial data. The data is stored in one or more data stores, where the object and fiducial data can be stored individually and\/or collectively. The system includes a fiducial analyzer that determines a reference sinusoidal fiducial trajectory data and an actual fiducial trajectory data. After these data are computed, the fiducial analyzer compares the actual trajectory data with the reference sinusoidal fiducial trajectory data to determine whether and\/or how to selectively manipulate the object data to improve the quality of the image. The determination is based on whether the comparison indicates that the image was degraded by rotational motion of the object during image acquisition.","Certain illustrative example methods, systems, APIs, data packets, and computer readable media are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These examples are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the methods, systems, APIs, data packets, and computer readable media may be employed and thus are intended to be inclusive of equivalents. Other advantages and novel features may become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","Example methods, systems, APIs, data packets, and computer media are now described with reference to the drawings where like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth to explain the methods, systems, APIs, data packets, and computer readable media. It may be evident, however, that the methods, systems, APIs, data packets, and computer readable media can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to simplify description.","As used in this application, the term \u201ccomputer component\u201d refers to a computer-related entity, either hardware, firmware, software, a combination thereof, or software in execution. For example, a computer component can be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program and a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be computer components. One or more computer components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a computer component can be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.","\u201cSoftware\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to, one or more computer readable and\/or executable instructions that cause a computer or other electronic device to perform functions, actions and\/or behave in a desired manner. The instructions may be embodied in various forms like routines, algorithms, modules, methods, threads, and\/or programs. Software may also be implemented in a variety of executable and\/or loadable forms including, but not limited to, a stand-alone program, a function call (local and\/or remote), a servelet, an applet, instructions stored in a memory, part of an operating system or browser, and the like. It is to be appreciated that the computer readable and\/or executable instructions can be located in one computer component and\/or distributed between two or more communicating, co-operating, and\/or parallel processing computer components and thus can be loaded and\/or executed in serial, parallel, massively parallel, and other manners.","To facilitate understanding correcting for the rotational motion of an object during radial k-space image acquisition, imagine standing directly in front of a person. You are looking directly at them (e.g., a viewing angle of 0\u00b0) and you see their face. For some reason, you want to walk around the person and take 360 photographs, one photograph for each degree of the compass. As you work your way around the person you eventually get exactly half way around (e.g., 180\u00b0). Imagine at this point in time, that the person rotates 180\u00b0 so that you are once again directly face to face. You now move 1\u00b0 further around your circle and take the next image. While the image is still good data, instead of it being an image taken from 181\u00b0 (e.g., behind the person you are photographing), it is a repeat of the image from 1\u00b0. Thus, when you develop your pictures, you will have two images taken from one degree relative to the face of the person and no images taken 181\u00b0 relative to the person.","Imagine further that as you reached exactly half way around the person you are photographing, that instead of rotating exactly 180\u00b0 to face you, they rotate 90\u00b0 counter to the direction you are walking around them. As you completed your circle around the person, your images would be 90\u00b0 out of phase. In addition to having 90 duplicate photographs, there would be 90\u00b0 for which you had no photographs of the person. Thus, the systems and methods described herein facilitate detecting this type of rotational motion, correcting errors in data, and adapting an image acquisition algorithm and\/or system to go back and acquire missing view angles. While this analogy describes photography, it is to be appreciated that the present invention relates to MRI, PET, CT, optical imaging and so on, in which projection data are used to reconstruct cross-sectional images.","Referring initially to , two views of an object  are illustrated. In the first view , the object  is at an initial orientation where various projection angles employed in radial k-space MRI are illustrated relative to the object . For example, view angles starting at 0\u00b0 and progressing by 45\u00b0 to 315\u00b0 are illustrated. While eight projection angles are illustrated, it is to be appreciated that a greater and\/or lesser number of projection angles can be employed in radial k-space MRI. In one example, 360 projection angles can be employed starting at 0\u00b0 and increasing in one degree increments.","In view , the object  has undergone rotational motion. Thus, the radial k-space data collected from various projection angles after the rotation may not accurately reflect the projection angle desired. Thus, rotational motion of object  during MRI image acquisition can negatively affect image quality.","Turning now to , an example data structure  that stores a set of projection data  is illustrated. The data structure  can be, for example, an array addressed to facilitate retrieving projection data by projection angle. For example, a first signal acquired at projection angle \u03b8can be stored in the data structure  at location L. Similarly, a second signal acquired at projection angle \u03b8can be stored in the data structure  at location L. Although the signals can be acquired sequentially (e.g., \u03b8, \u03b8, . . . \u03b8), it is to be appreciated that the data can be acquired in other orders that are neither linear nor sequential. However, storing the data from the various projection angles in the data structure  in predetermined locations associated with the programmed projection angles facilitates selectively processing (e.g., re-ordering) the acquired data. While an array is illustrated in , it is to be appreciated that other data structures including, but not limited to, trees, tables, lists, files, and so on, may be employed in accordance with various aspects of this application. The rotational motion described in  can lead to projection data being stored in locations that do not correspond to actual locations, which can negatively affect image quality.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","300","320","300","300","330","300","320","300","300"]},"Turning now to and , two images illustrate example MRI images before () and after () correction for rotational motion. Image  is an MRI image before correction, where the image is degraded due to rotational motion of the object during image acquisition. Image  is an MRI image of the same item after detecting errors due to rotational motion and correcting for those errors. A bright spot in the top center of image  represents an image marker placed on or near but linked to the object. This will be described in greater detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIGS. 5","FIGS. 4"],"i":["a ","b ","b ","b "],"b":["5","500","510","510","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIGS. 6","b":["7","7","1","2","600","610","1","2","1","2"],"i":["a","b "],"sub":["1","2","1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","610","610"],"sub":["1 ","1 ","1 ","2 ","2 ","2 ","1 ","2 ","1 ","2 "]},"Once the point source data has been acquired, then a point source location can be computed from the point source data. For example, in illustration , a \u03b8and an Rcan be computed from Sand Sto simplify subsequent mathematical calculations employed in detecting and correcting for rotational motion. In one example, Ris determined according to R=the square root of (r+r). Similarly, in one example, \u03b8is determined according to \u03b8=tan(r\/r). Once \u03b8and Rhave been computed, a predicted sine wave that will be traced by the fiducial mark can be computed. In one example, the predicted sine wave is calculated according to sin=(R) cos (|\u03b8\u2212\u03b8|), where \u03b8 can vary throughout a range of viewing angles.","Thus, referring to the calculations associated with , two projections are taken at viewing angles \u03b8and \u03b8, preferably where \u03b8and \u03b8are orthogonal. Preferably, the projections are taken at times between which it can be determined that no rotational motion occurred. Given the two projection data, the values Rand \u03b8can be computed. Once Rand \u03b8are computed, then a predicted reference waveform that will be produced from the signal generated by the fiducial marker can be computed.","Turning now to and , an example point source and the sinogram resulting from a radial k-space data acquisition of an image associated with the point source is presented. In addition to the point source data, data associated with the object with which the point source is associated is also stored. If the system computes how far from an expected location the point source has rotated, then a computation can be made to determine how far to shift the data associated with both the point source and the object to correct for the rotational motion. Thus, a method employing an object associated with a fiducial can include associating the point source  with the object to be imaged, computing the point source location, predicting a sine wave  that will be produced during radial k-space acquisition of the object data, acquiring a unique actual waveform from the radial projections, comparing the predicted sine wave  to the actual unique waveform that is collected during MRI and correcting and\/or reacquiring data based on the comparison of the predicted sine wave  to the actual waveform.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","800","800"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","910","900","910"]},"Turning to , an example waveform  collected during an MRI where the wave exhibits the results of rotational motion is illustrated alongside a predicted sine wave . The predicted sine wave  was computed from point source data acquired from a fiducial associated with the object to be imaged. The actual wave  was then collected from the MRI data. As seen, the actual wave  is distorted starting at an identifiable point  at which a rotational motion occurred. Furthermore, the disrupted wave  facilitates identifying a point  at which the rotational motion ceased. The interval  facilitates identifying, for example, the magnitude and\/or direction of the rotation. As described earlier, a rotational motion can lead to gaps in the projection data and\/or duplicate projection data. Therefore, based on the location , the interval , and the location , data from the MRI of the object can be selectively processed to correct the rotational motion. The selective processing can include, but is not limited to, re-ordering the data, removing one or more projection data from the set of projection data acquired during MRI, and generating a signal to indicate that additional projection data should be acquired. When a signal is generated to indicate that additional projection data should be acquired, systems and methods described herein may then receive the additional projection data and update the data that produced wave  to facilitate recomparing the predicted sine wave with an updated waveform. In one example, the steps of generating a signal to indicate that additional projection data should be acquired, receiving the additional projection data, updating the observed waveform, and reperforming the comparison of the predicted sine wave with the updated waveform can occur repeatedly. For example, they may repeat until a comparison of the predicted sine wave and the updated observed waveform is within a predetermined configurable tolerance and\/or until a predetermined, configurable number of attempts have been made.","Since the comparison of the predicted sine wave with the acquired waveform can be performed by distributed systems and\/or methods operating substantially in parallel with an MRI system, which may be distinct from the systems for acquiring the MRI data, it is to be appreciated that the systems and methods described herein for detecting rotational motion of an object should not increase MRI scan times. While the computations do not increase the scan time, one example method facilitates improving a signal to noise ratio in the observed image data by at least 50%. By recognizing the location, direction, and magnitude of a rotational motion, \u201cerrors\u201d can be removed from acquired data which leads to the improvement in the signal to noise ratio. In another example, systems and methods described herein facilitate improving the signal to noise ratio in the selectively processed observed image data to within 33% of what the signal to noise ratio would be in a corresponding image data that was not disrupted by rotational motion. The ability to undertake processing like removing duplicate data, averaging duplicate data, acquiring data that was initially missed, re-ordering data that has been stored in an incorrect location, and the like, facilitates producing these improvements in general image quality. Such improvements can be measured by measurements including, but not limited to, signal to noise ratios, resolution, level of artifacts, and so on.","As described above, the observed image data received from an MRI scan of an object includes the projection data of a radial k-space associated with the object and an observed waveform associated with the fiducial associated with the object that is scanned. However, the data associated with the fiducial may leave an artifact in the observed image data. Therefore, in one example method, additional processing is performed to remove the waveform data from the image data associated with the fiducial.","While the systems and methods described herein facilitate identifying and correcting for rotational motion during image acquisition, it is to be appreciated that once such detection and correction have been undertaken, example systems and methods may subsequently construct an image of the object based on observed image data that has been selectively processed to correct for rotational motion. It is to be further appreciated that the processing performed to correct for rotational motion during image acquisition may be employed in systems and methods that also undertake processing designed to reduce the effects of translational motion of the object to be imaged. In one example, the translational motion correction is undertaken before the correction for rotational motion.","In view of the exemplary systems shown and described herein, example computer implemented methodologies will be better appreciated with reference to the flow diagrams of . While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the illustrated methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks, it is to be appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks can occur in different orders and\/or concurrently with other blocks from that shown and described. Moreover, less than all the illustrated blocks may be required to implement an example methodology. Furthermore, additional and\/or alternative methodologies can employ additional, not illustrated blocks. In one example, methodologies are implemented as computer executable instructions and\/or operations stored on computer readable media including, but not limited to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a compact disc (CD), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a random access memory (RAM), a read only memory (ROM), a programmable read only memory (PROM), an electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), a disk, a carrier wave, and a memory stick. It is to be appreciated that the methodologies can be implemented in software as that term is defined herein.","In the flow diagrams, rectangular blocks denote \u201cprocessing blocks\u201d that may be implemented, for example, in software. Similarly, the diamond shaped blocks denote \u201cdecision blocks\u201d or \u201cflow control blocks\u201d that may also be implemented, for example, in software. Alternatively, and\/or additionally, the processing and decision blocks can be implemented in functionally equivalent circuits like a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), and the like.","A flow diagram does not depict syntax for any particular programming language, methodology, or style (e.g., procedural, object-oriented). Rather, a flow diagram illustrates functional information one skilled in the art may employ to program software, design circuits, and so on. It is to be appreciated that in some examples, program elements like temporary variables, routine loops, and so on are not shown.","Referring now to , a flow chart illustrates an example method  for reducing the effects on image quality of rotational motion of an object during MRI image acquisition. At , point source data is acquired. This point source data can include measurements like the angles of projection employed in characterizing the point source, and resulting distances associated with characterizing the point source.","At , point source parameters can be computed. For example, parameters Rand \u03b8can be computed from the point source data acquired at . At , based, at least in part, on the parameters computed at  and\/or the point source data acquired at , a unique sine wave that will be produced by the point source during radial k-space MRI can be predicted. At , waveform data associated with the point source is acquired from the object being imaged. While blocks  and  illustrate predicting the sine wave and then acquiring the waveform data, it is to be appreciated that such predictions and acquisitions can occur substantially in parallel.","At , a determination is made concerning whether the acquired waveform data satisfies pre-determined, configurable tolerances when compared to the predicted sine wave data. For example, the sum of the absolute values of the differences of predicted points on a sine wave with acquired points on a waveform can be computed. If the determination at  is yes, then processing proceeds to  where the object image is reconstructed from the acquired data. However, if the determination at  is no, then at  a determination is made concerning whether to re-order one or more projection data points. If the determination at  is yes, then the projection data will be re-ordered. For example, data placed in a first location corresponding to a first, incorrect view angle may be moved to a second, correct view angle location. Additionally, and\/or alternatively, the data may be averaged with data already stored in the correct view angle location, may replace the data already stored in the correct view angle location or may be employed to correct data stored in the correct view angle location. The determination at  may be no if, for example, the differences between the predicted sine wave data and the acquired waveform data exceed a predetermined, configurable threshold indicating that re-ordering would not produce a desired reduction in signal to noise ratio. In such a case, method  may be extended to include restarting the image acquisition sequence.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1100","1200"]},"At , point source data is acquired and at  point source parameters are computed from the point source data. Thus, the location of a fiducial associated with an object to be imaged can be computed which facilitates, at , predicting a unique sine wave that will be produced during the imaging of the object. At , observed waveform data from the fiducial mark is acquired. Thus, at , a determination is made concerning whether the acquired waveform data is within predetermined, configurable tolerances of the sine wave predicted at . If the determination at  is yes, then processing continues at  where the image of the object is reconstructed. If, however, the determination at  is no, then at , a determination is made concerning whether to reacquire one or more points of waveform data by, for example, repositioning imaging means that selectively acquire one or more projection data from one or more viewing angles. If the determination at  is no, then at , an image of the object is reconstructed. But if the determination at  is yes, then processing returns to .

The data packet  ends with an error detecting and\/or correcting field  whereby a computer component can determine if it has properly received the packet . While six fields are illustrated in the data packet , it is to be appreciated that a greater and\/or lesser number of fields can be present in data packets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1500","1500","1520","1510","1510","1520","1530","1530","1530"]},"The system  includes a fiducial analyzer  that determines a reference sinusoidal fiducial trajectory data from initial point source data. Furthermore, the fiducial analyzer  examines data from the data store  and computes an actual fiducial trajectory data.

The object data processor  undertakes this selective processing based, at least in part, on the comparison produced by the fiducial analyzer .","In one example system , the data  includes one or more projection data of radial k-space data acquired from an MRI device. In another example, the data  is a sinogram data. In one example system , the data  includes a fiducial data that is received from a high signal fiducial mark. The high signal fiducial mark can be, for example, a gadolinium filled tuned fiducial. Another example system  includes a low signal fiducial marker. Another example system  includes a fiducial data filter that removes the fiducial data from the image data to facilitate removing artifacts from a reconstructed image where the artifacts are associated with the fiducial.","The object data processor  can, for example, manipulate object data to improve the quality of an image degraded during image acquisition by rotational motion by performing actions, including but not limited to, deleting projection data, relocating projection data in the data store , and\/or combining projection data. In general, the object data processor  modifies the acquired image data so that the fiducial trajectory data more closely resembles or matches the reference trajectory data. Since the system  can produce corrected object data, an extension of the system  can include, for example, an image processor (not illustrated) that produces a viewable image of the object from the manipulated object data. Furthermore, an extension to system  can include a signaler (not illustrated) that generates a control signal indicating that the system  desires one or more additional projection data from the radial k-space. When this additional data is acquired, a data integrator (not illustrated) can integrate the additionally acquired data with previously acquired corrected data. The integration can include, but is not limited to, replacing previously acquired data, averaging with previously corrected data, corrected previously acquired data, and so on. It is to be appreciated that the data receiver , the fiducial analyzer , the object data processor , the image processor, the signaler, and the data integrator, can be computer components as that term is described herein.","Referring now to , an application programming interface (API)  is illustrated providing access to a system  that includes a data corrector. The API  can be employed, for example, by programmers  and\/or processes  to gain access to processing performed by the system . For example, a programmer  can write a program to access (e.g., to invoke its operation, to monitor its operation, to access its functionality) a data correcting computer component  where writing such a program is facilitated by the presence of the API . Rather than the programmer  having to understand the internals of the data corrector , the programmer's task is simplified by merely having to learn the interface  to the data corrector . This facilitates encapsulating the functionality of the data corrector  while exposing that functionality. Similarly, the API  can be employed to provide data values to the system  and\/or to retrieve data values from the system . For example, a programmer  may wish to present image data to the data corrector  and thus the programmer  may employ an image data interface  component of the API . Similarly, the programmer  may wish to present fiducial data to the data corrector  and thus may employ a fiducial data interface  component of the API . After receiving the image data and fiducial data, the data corrector  may, for example, pass corrected data to a process  via a corrected data interface  component of the API .","Thus, in one example of the API , a set of application program interfaces can be stored on a computer-readable medium. The interfaces can be executed by a computer component to gain access to a data corrector. Interfaces can include, but are not limited to, a first interface that receives and\/or returns an image data associated with an image, a second interface that receives and\/or returns a fiducial data associated with a fiducial, and a third interface that receives and\/or returns a corrected image data generated from the image data and the fiducial data.","The systems, methods, and objects described herein may be stored, for example, on a computer readable media. Media can include, but are not limited to, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a compact disc (CD), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a random access memory (RAM), a read only memory (ROM), a programmable read only memory (PROM), a disk, a carrier wave, a memory stick, and the like.","Thus, an example computer readable medium can store computer executable instructions for a computer implemented method for reducing the effects on image quality of rotational motion of an object during image acquisition. The method includes receiving a point source data associated with a fiducial associated with the object to be imaged and computing a point source location based on the point source data. The method then computes a predicted sine wave data based on the point source location and\/or the point source data. The method includes receiving an observed image data that has a set of projection data associated with the object to be imaged, and an observed waveform data associated with the predicted sine wave data. Once the observed image data is retrieved, the method compares the predicted sine wave data with the observed waveform data and selectively processes the observed image data to reduce the effects of rotational motion of the imaged object. The processing can include, but is not limited to, removing projection data, reordering projection data, and acquiring additional projection data.","Similarly, a computer readable medium can store computer executable components of a system for improving the image quality of an object degraded by rotational motion of the object during image acquisition. The system includes a data receiving component for receiving an image data from the object, where the image data includes object data and fiducial data. The system also includes data stores for storing the object data and the fiducial data, either individually or collectively. A fiducial analyzer determines a reference sinusoidal fiducial trajectory data and an actual fiducial trajectory data and then compares the two trajectory data. An object data processor selectively manipulates the object data to improve the quality of an object image degraded by rotational motion of the object based.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 15"],"b":["1700","1710","1715","1715","1720","1730","1740","1750","1710","1720"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 15"],"b":["1800","1820","1830","1840","1850"]},"What has been described above includes several examples.
