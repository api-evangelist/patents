No. 61\/819,226 filed on May 3, 2013 and entitled Hydroxytyrosol Compositions for Induction of DNA Damage and Cell Death and Inhibition of LSD1; and to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/731,598 filed on Nov. 30, 2012 and entitled Hydroxytyrosol Compositions for Induction of DNA Damage and Cell Death. The entire contents of this patent application are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference including, without limitation, the specification, claims, and abstract, as well as any figures, tables, or drawings thereof.","The invention relates to compositions comprising hydroxytyrosol (HT) and HT-containing formulations and treatment regiments comprising hydroxytyrosol compositions and HT-containing formulations and\/or oleuropein and chemotherapeutic agents. Compositions and\/or regiments may optionally include the administration of vitamins, minerals, and\/or anti-oxidants. Methods for using these compositions and treatment regimens for treating subjects for diseases, such as a malignancy, and for inducing or enhancing angiogenesis, treating or preventing oxidative stress, for treating or preventing high glucose-induced dysfunction, treating or preventing chemotherapy-induced dysfunction, and for improving cell viability are provided. The invention further relates to various methods for use of the hydroxytyrosol compositions and HT-containing formulations for inhibition of lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in various cancers.","The beneficial health effects of phenolic compounds isolated from are now evident. In particular, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of hydroxytyrosol have been widely investigated and shown to have beneficial uses as an antioxidant for the treatment of oxygen free radical-associated diseases or conditions. Specifically, United States Patent Pub. No. US 2011\/0034519 A1 describes compositions for and methods of administration of hydroxytyrosol, and optionally other dietary supplements, to a subject in need thereof for the inhibition and treatment of necrosis and extended quiescence that result in cellular necrosis instead of normal proliferation, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In addition, the beneficial properties of hydroxytyrosol for reversing damage to cells, promoting wound healing, and inhibiting necrosis have been similarly demonstrated. Specifically, United States Patent Pub. No. US 2013-0266545 A1 describes compositions and methods for reversing damage to skin cells and, in particular, to compositions and methods for wound healing and inhibiting necrosis, for example, in the treatment of skin that is distressed or wounded as result of a disease or other biological condition or process.","Compounds for treatment of diseases are often non-naturally occurring, cause harmful side-effects, and are expensive to produce. Chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer can be prohibitively expensive, and cause a variety of serious side effects. It is therefore unexpected and desirable that the co-therapy and\/or co-administration of regimens comprising hydroxytyrosol and chemotherapeutic agents demonstrate beneficial results in treating malignancy.","Furthermore, oxidants and free radical species, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), are known to contribute to cell damage and\/or cell death, as well as having a role in various metabolic and immune system processes. Synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) have demonstrated carcinogenicity and other toxic properties, underscoring the need for natural antioxidants. Growing evidence links antioxidants with a decreased risk of chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, cancer, and several other aging-related health concerns (Tahseen Iqbal et al., Antioxidant Activity and Volatile and Phenolic Profiles of Essential Oil and Different Extracts of Wild Mint () from the Pakistani Flora, Journal of Analytical Methods in Chemistry, (2013) vol. 2013, Article ID 536490). Oxidative stress has been linked to collateral damage in cancer chemotherapy. (See, e.g., Yumin Chen et al., Collateral Damage in Cancer Chemotherapy: Oxidative Stress in Nontargeted Tissues (2007) Mol. Interventions. 7(3); 147-156). Antioxidant activity has also been linked to wound healing. (See, e.g., Arti Shukla et al. Asiaticoside-induced Elevation of Antioxidant Levels in Healing Wounds (1999) Phytother. Res. 13, 50-54); to induction of angiogenesis (see Elena Daghini et al., Antioxidant vitamins induce angiogenesis in the normal pig kidney (2007) American Journal of Physiology\u2014Renal Physiology. 293; F371-F381); and high-glucose induced dysfunction (see G. Cohen et al., The roles of hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress in the rise and collapse of the natural protective mechanism against vascular endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetes (2007), 113(4-5); 259-267). Reduction in the concentration of one or more radical species in a biological environment thus has benefits in various biological environments for amelioration of a host of conditions. As a result compounds capable of enhancing the antioxidant capability in cells, animals, or individuals are important tools in treating or preventing a wide range of conditions. The expression of lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in various cancers is prevalent and represents a potential mechanism for prevention, treatment and\/or detection of cancers. Conventional efforts to develop specific inhibitors of the LDS1 protein expressed in a majority of cancers have had limited success to date. In particular, development of specific inhibitors of the LDS1 protein active and binding sites has not resulted in significant advances in cancer treatment and\/or prevention. However, the inhibition of LSD1 activity by hydroxytyrosol, hydroxytyrosol derivatives, substituted hydroxytyrosol compounds and\/or hydroxytyrosol prodrugs has provided surprising and unexpected results, demonstrating at least equivalent LSD1 inhibition (or superior inhibition) to known LSDI inhibitors.","Accordingly, it is an objective of the claimed invention to provide compositions and methods for the treatment of diseases currently treated with chemotherapeutic agents, including cancers, malignancies, and tumors.","A further object of the invention is to provide compositions and methods for inhibiting LSD1 activity, particularly in cancer cells, malignancies, and tumors.","A further object of the invention is to provide methods and compositions to increase the antioxidant capacity of normal cells.","Other objects, advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following specification taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","In an aspect of the invention the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of hydroxytyrosol (HT) and HT-containing formulations in cancer cells compared normal PBMC cells has been demonstrated. \u201cHydroxytyrosol-containing formulations\u201d or \u201cHT-containing formulations\u201d as used herein encompasses any formulation or composition that includes hydroxytyrosol, including but not limited to hydroxytyrosol alone, hydroxytyrosol in combination with oleuropein, and Formulations 1, 2, and 3 (Table 9), undiluted or at any dilution where an effective amount of hydroxytyrosol is present. The results further demonstrate applications of use treatment, suppression and\/or amelioration of various conditions and diseases, including any of those currently treated with chemotoxic compounds, such as for example cancers. In an additional aspect, the ability of hydroxytyrosol to induce double-stranded breaks in DNA in malignant cells, but not normal cells, is demonstrated. The results confirm the specificity of potential treatments using hydroxytyrosol, in particular the specificity of treatment regimens using hydroxytyrosol in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Genome-wide mRNA-sequencing has been employed to demonstrate molecular mechanisms accounting for the biological effects of hydroxytyrosol disclosed herein according to the invention. In an additional aspect of the invention, the combinatorial effects of hydroxytyrosol and the widely used chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin, in K562 cells, has been demonstrated.","In yet another aspect of the invention, the targeting of lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) for the treatment of cancer cells is provided.

It is understood that, as used here, \u201cpercent,\u201d \u201c%,\u201d and the like are intended to be synonymous with \u201cweight percent,\u201d \u201cwt-%,\u201d etc.","As one skilled in the art shall appreciate, there are two distinct mechanisms for cell death. \u201cApoptosis\u201d refers to \u201cnormal\u201d or programmed cell death, which encompasses the physiological process by which cells are routinely eliminated, giving balance to the proliferation of new cells. During apoptosis the outer membrane of the cell forms \u201cbubbles\u201d known as blebs. The content of the cells becomes incased in the blebs. The blebs separate from the cell and are digested by nearby cells or macrophages. This orderly process greatly reduces toxicity to surrounding cells.","\u201cNecrosis\u201d refers to a distinct form of cell death that is not a programmed event and is known as \u201caccidental\u201d death. This pathological process occurs when cells are exposed to extreme stress, chemical insult, and resultant free radical damage. The early stages of necrosis involve a swelling of the cell called oncosis. During oncosis the cell and its organelles begin to swell due to an exchange in the cell's potassium to sodium ratios. Necrosis, after the oncosis stage, is an explosive event where the cells contents stream directly into the surrounding cells environment causing damage and an immune response. Controlling necrosis during the early oncosis stage is important. Up to this point, necrosis is a reversible event. The morphology of cells dying by necrosis centers on changes in the cell's permeability. Hengartner M O, The biochemistry of apoptosis. Nature 407: 770-776, 2000, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Osmotic changes take place during an exchange of cytosol potassium and extracellular sodium. Early stage necrosis, known as oncosis, is characterized by the dilation or swelling of the cell and its organelles due to this exchange. Cell survival of this non-programmed event is dependent upon repairing the cell's membrane and stopping the flow of sodium ions into the cells interior. Repair of the cell's membrane and improvement in the cell's environment to more homeostatic conditions are paramount to survival","\u201cQuiescence\u201d refers to the normal part of the cell cycle, also referred to as \u201cG,\u201d that is the counterpart to proliferation, and involves a myriad of molecular events that occur and trigger the progression to the pre-replicative (G) phase. Cosenza S C, Owen T A, Soprano D R, Soprano K J, Evidence That the Time of Entry into S is Determined by Events Occurring in Early G. J Biological Chem 263; 12751-12758; 1988. The Gphase represents not just the absence of signals for mitosis but an active repression of the genes needed for mitosis. This is an important distinction since cancer cells cannot enter Gand as a consequence become immortal.","The methods and compositions of the present invention may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of the components and ingredients of the present invention as well as other ingredients described herein. As used herein, \u201cconsisting essentially of\u201d means that the methods and compositions may include additional steps, components or ingredients, but only if the additional steps, components or ingredients do not materially alter the basic and novel characteristics of the claimed methods and compositions.","Compositions","In an aspect of the invention the administration of hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations results in selective cell damage, including for example cell death, apoptosis and\/or DNA double-strand breaks in cells in need of treatment according to the invention. The term apoptosis often is used interchangeably with programmed cell death. According to the invention, the selective effects on cells results in no damage to normal cells. In an aspect, the hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations are employed as a pre-treatment for the chemotherapeutic agents. The compositions according to the invention provide a biochemical mechanism by which cellular characteristics are regulated. The compositions and\/or treatment regimens according to the invention comprise hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations, and may also include a chemotherapeutic agent.","Hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations as used herein encompasses any formulation or composition that includes hydroxytyrosol, including but not limited to hydroxytyrosol alone, hydroxytyrosol in combination with oleuropein, and Formulations 1, 2, and 3 (Table 9), undiluted or at any dilution where an effective amount of hydroxytyrosol is present. Additional components may be added to hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations, such as a chemotherapeutic agent, carrier, diluent and\/or other pharmaceutically acceptable delivery agents or the like.","In one aspect, hydroxytyrosol compositions include any hydroxytyrosol-based inhibitor of the LDS1 protein. Suitable hydroxytyrosol-based inhibitor of the LDS1 protein include, for example, hydroxytyrosol, a hydroxytyrosol derived compound, a hydroxytyrosol substituted compound, a hydroxytyrosol metabolite (originating from a prodrug), and combinations of the same.","Hydroxytyrosol","The compositions according to the invention employ hydroxytyrosol. Hydroxytyrosol (HT; CAS Registry number [10597-60-1]), is also known as 3-hydroxytyrosol, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethanol (DOPET) or 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1,2-benzenediol.

Thus, for example, the hydroxytyrosol may be provided as hydroxytyrosol acetate which releases hydroxytyrosol in the stomach or intestine.","In an aspect, the compositions according to the invention deliver at least about 1 \u03bcM hydroxytyrosol, at least about 5 \u03bcM hydroxytyrosol, at least about 10 \u03bcM hydroxytyrosol, at least about 20 \u03bcM hydroxytyrosol, at least about 50 \u03bcM hydroxytyrosol, at least about 100 \u03bcM hydroxytyrosol, or greater. In addition, without being limited according to the invention, all ranges recited are inclusive of the numbers defining the range and include each integer within the defined range. In general, larger doses tend to produce greater effects, with the preferred dosage also depending, at least in part, upon weight, metabolism, individual body chemistry, type of cancer or other condition being treated, and the like.","In an embodiment the dose of hydroxytyrosol administered to a person is about 0.01 to about 1000 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. In addition, without being limited according to the invention, all ranges recited are inclusive of the numbers defining the range and include each integer within the defined range. In a further aspect, the hydroxytyrosol is present at a level such that an effective amount for the induction of cell death, apoptosis and\/or DNA double-strand breakage in malignant cells results.","Depending upon the route of administration, greater doses of hydroxytyrosol may be administered. For example, significantly lesser amounts of hydroxytyrosol may be absorbed when the route of administration is oral as compared to parenteral or other forms of systemic administration. For oral delivery, therefore, the daily dose of hydroxytyrosol administered orally may be about 0.01 micrograms to about 1000 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. By way of further example, in one embodiment, the daily dose of hydroxytyrosol administered orally to a person is about 1 to about 100 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. By way of further example, in one embodiment, the daily dose of hydroxytyrosol administered orally to a person is about 5 to about 50 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. By way of further example, in one embodiment, the daily dose of hydroxytyrosol administered orally to a person is about 10 micrograms to about 50 micrograms per kilogram of body weight.","For parenteral delivery the daily dose may be from about 0.01 to about 100 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day, twice a day, or more than twice a day. In one embodiment, the daily dose of hydroxytyrosol parenterally administered to a person is about 0.1 to about 50 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day. In another such embodiment, the daily dose of hydroxytyrosol parenterally administered to a person is about 0.1 to about 10 microgram per kilogram of body weight.","Regardless of the route of administration of the hydroxytyrosol, the compositions may be administered in a single dose or multiple doses to achieve a target daily dose. For example, for certain embodiments the hydroxytyrosol is provided in a formulation that will provide a single daily dose. Alternatively, for such embodiments the hydroxytyrosol is provided in a formulation that will provide, in two or more doses over the course of a day.","As one skilled in the art appreciates, greater amounts of hydroxytyrosol may be included in the dosage unit form when the intended route of administration is oral. For example, typical dosage forms for oral administration include tablets, pills, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, and the like. A single dose, therefore, may comprise a single tablet, pill, capsule, gelcap, caplet or the like, or two or more tablets, pills, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, and the like. In general, dosage forms for oral administration may contain 0.01 to 100 milligrams of hydroxytyrosol. For example, in one embodiment, the dosage unit form contains 1 to 50 milligrams hydroxytyrosol.","The route of administration may affect the rate and extent of absorption of hydroxytyrosol. Taking this into account, i.e., taking into account the fraction of an administered dose that is not absorbed or for whatever reason is not systemically bioavailable to the subject, it is generally preferred that the administered dose provide the subject with at least about 100 but less than about 10,000, preferably less than about 6,000 TE of systemically bioavailable hydroxytyrosol per day. In general, it is preferred that the administered dose provide the subject with at least about 250 TE of systemically bioavailable hydroxytyrosol per day. In certain embodiments, it is preferred that the administered dose provide the subject with at least about 500, at least about 750, at least about 1,000, or at least about 5,000 TE of systemically bioavailable hydroxytyrosol per day.","Chemotherapeutic Agents","The compositions according to the invention employ a chemotherapeutic agent. Chemotherapeutics may also be referred to as chemotoxic agents, chemotherapy and the like which are customarily employed to diminish cell proliferation and\/or to induce cell apoptosis as one skilled in the art appreciates. Additional cancer therapies may also be employed in combination with the hydroxytyrosol according to the invention, including for example biotherapeutic agents, radiopharmaceuticals, and the like.","As one skilled in the art appreciates, cancer chemotherapeutic agents are used for their lethal action to cancer cells. Unfortunately, few such drugs differentiate between a cancer cell and other proliferating cells. Chemotherapy generally requires use of several agents concurrently or in planned sequence. Combining more than one agent in a chemotherapeutic treatment protocol allows for: (1) the largest possible dose of drugs; (2) drugs that work by different mechanisms; (3) drugs having different toxicities; and (4) the reduced development of resistance. Chemotherapeutic agents mainly affect cells that are undergoing division or DNA synthesis; thus slow growing malignant cells, such as lung cancer or colorectal cancer, are often unresponsive. Furthermore, most chemotherapeutic agents have a narrow therapeutic index. Common adverse effects of chemotherapy include vomiting, stomatitis, and alopecia. Toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agents is often the result of their effect on rapidly proliferating cells, which are vulnerable to the toxic effects of the agents, such as bone marrow or from cells harbored from detection (immunosuppression), gastrointestinal tract (mucosal ulceration), skin and hair (dermatitis and alopecia).","Many potent cytotoxic agents act at specific phases of the cell cycle (cell cycle dependent) and have activity only against cells in the process of division, thus acting specifically on processes such as DNA synthesis, transcription, or mitotic spindle function. Other agents are cell cycle independent. Susceptibility to cytotoxic treatment, therefore, may vary at different stages of the cell life cycle, with only those cells in a specific phase of the cell cycle being killed. Because of this cell cycle specificity, treatment with cytotoxic agents needs to be prolonged or repeated in order to allow cells to enter the sensitive phase. Non-cell-cycle-specific agents may act at any stage of the cell cycle; however, the cytotoxic effects are still dependent on cell proliferation. Cytotoxic agents thus kill a fixed fraction of tumor cells, the fraction being proportionate to the dose of the drug treatment.","Exemplary chemotherapeutic agents suitable for use in compositions and\/or combinational therapies according to the invention include: anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, alkylating agents, nitrosoureas, antimetabolites, such as 5-FU, platins, antitumor antibiotics, such as dactinomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), idarubicin, and mitoxantrone, miotic inhibitors, alkylating agents, mitotic inhibitors, steroids and natural hormones, including for example, corticosteroid hormones, sex hormones, immunotherapy or others such as L-asparaginase and tretinoin. These and other specific examples of chemotherapeutic agents are well known to those of skill in the art and are included within the scope of the invention.","Additional Functional Ingredients","The components of the treatment compositions according to the invention can further be combined with various functional components suitable for use treating the particular cancer or other condition. Additional functional ingredient components may include those that improve the health and\/or viability of a patient and\/or the cells of a patient.","In other embodiments, additional functional ingredients may be included in the compositions.

In some embodiments, the hydroxytyrosol containing compositions and\/or regimens of the present invention may be used for the treatment of cancers, for example neoplasias, chronic leukemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and other cancerous tissues. In some embodiments, the hydroxytyrosol containing compositions and\/or regimens of the present invention may be used for the treatment of any cancer expressing lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1).","In an embodiment, the treatment may be performed by administration of the hydroxytyrosol containing compositions and\/or regimens to the subject in need thereof or by administration directly to the site of the tumor or other cancer cells. The treatment may be performed in conjunction with administration of a chemotherapeutic agent (e.g. a treatment regimen), either simultaneously, in the same composition or in separate compositions, or sequentially. The treatment may be performed by administration of components in any order and in any combination. The treatment may also be performed using more than one chemotherapeutic agent, or other type of treatment. Further, the treatment may be performed by providing multiple administrations of the compositions. One skilled in the art will ascertain these variations in treatment regimens employing the hydroxytyrosol compositions and\/or regimens disclosed herein.","As referred to in the methods of administering hydroxytyrosol compositions, such compositions include any hydroxytyrosol-based inhibitor of the LDS1 protein. Suitable hydroxytyrosol-based inhibitor of the LDS1 protein include, for example, hydroxytyrosol, a hydroxytyrosol derived compound, a hydroxytyrosol substituted compound, a hydroxytyrosol metabolite (originating from a prodrug), and combinations of the same. A hydroxytyrosol-containing formulation may further include other functional ingredients (for example oleuropein, N-acetyl cysteine, antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and\/or amino acids), chemotherapeutic agent, carrier, diluent and\/or other pharmaceutically acceptable delivery agents or the like.","The methods of the invention may be further applicable to non-cancerous condition which are treated with regimens employing chemotherapeutic agents, such as for example hepatitis C or other viral infections, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma.","The combination of hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations and optionally a chemotherapeutic agent according to methods of the invention results in at least additive effects, preferably synergistic effects. The combinational therapy according to the invention results in a greater reduction in cell number, an increase in apoptosis and\/or other indicator of improved treatment for a regimen disclosed herein, in comparison to either compound alone. In and additional aspect, the combination of the hydroxytyrosol and a chemotherapeutic agent according to methods of the invention may allow for a reduction in toxicity of the treatment as a similar result may be achieved with a lower dose of the chemotherapeutic agent. This is important as many of these agents are highly toxic and should be used in as small dose as possible.","Inducing Cell Death","The compositions and\/or regimens of the present invention may also be used in methods for inducing cell death. The compositions and\/or regimens may be administered to a cell or tissue to promote or enhance the effects of an apoptotic or necrotic agent or other treatment, or agents or treatments that arrest the cell cycle.

The treatment may also be performed using more than one agent, or other type of treatment. Further, the treatment may be performed by providing multiple administrations of the compositions to the cell or tissue.","Such methods may further be performed on individuals using the routes of administration and dosages discussed above. Further, the treatment may be performed to provide hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations at the desired dose systemically or to specific locations in the body. Further, the treatment may be performed to provide hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations in multiple administrations to the individual.","Methods of Detecting Pre-Cancer Cells","The compositions of the present invention may also be used in methods for the detection of pre-cancer and\/or cancerous tissues\/cells in a patient. As disclosed according to the invention, contacting cancer cells with compositions of hydroxytyrosol induces genetic and epigenetic effects in those cells which can be detected. Therefore, an embodiment of this invention is the administration of the hydroxytyrosol compositions according to the various embodiments of the invention followed by detection of genetic and\/or epigenetic effects to detect cancerous or pre-cancerous cells.","Such detection methods may be performed by administering the compositions according to the invention to a subject or by administration directly to a specific site of the subject. The methods may further include the collecting of cells, tissue, or other biological material from the patient. Such collection may be used for the determination of genetic and\/or epigenetic effects. The detection may be performed by a single administration, or multiple administrations, and may be done by collecting a single sample or by collecting multiple samples. The detection may be performed by collecting a sample from a patient and administering the compositions according to the invention to that isolated sample.","Effects on Non-Cancer Cells","The compositions of the present invention may also be used to induce certain desired changes or effects in other cell types. As disclosed according to the invention, and as shown in , contacting epidermal or endothelial cells with compositions comprising, consisting of and\/or consisting essentially of hydroxytyrosol improves migration, response to high glucose-induced dysfunction, and response to doxorubicin-induced damage. Further, contacting endothelial cells with compositions of hydroxytyrosol improves tubule formation\/angiogenesis. Further, contacting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with compositions of hydroxytyrosol improves their antioxidant capacity\/activity, including in the presence of high glucose (high glucose-induced dysfunction) and chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. doxorubicin-induced damage). Further still, contacting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with compositions of hydroxytyrosol improves cell viability. These beneficial uses of hydroxytyrosol are further confirmed by mRNA sequence and micro-array data summarized in , and further summarized in Table 1.","Further still, contacting muscle cells with compositions of hydroxytyrosol improves cell viability, as shown in . This beneficial use of the compositions of the invention is even more pronounced in the presence of chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. doxorubicin-induced damage) and oxidative stress.","Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, the compositions and methods are employed to achieve a protective effect, for example to improve cell viability or to treat or prevent chemotherapy-induced damage, high glucose-induced dysfunction, and\/or oxidative stress in non-cancer cells, including for example, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, muscle cells, and PBMC.","Sensitizing Cancer Cells to Immune Surveillance","The hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations and other compositions of the present invention may also be used in methods to sensitize cancers, for example cancer cells, tumors, or malignancies, to surveillance by an individual's immune system. In one aspect, such methods may be performed by administration of hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations to stimulate rapid proliferation of normal peripheral blood cells, increasing the number of naturally occurring natural killer (NK) cells found in the population and enhancing cytotoxic immunity against the cancer. Such methods may be accomplished using the various routs of administration and dosing schemes discussed above. In another aspect, increased sensitization of cancer cells may be achieved by isolating immune cells from an individual, treating the immune cells with hydroxytyrosol-containing compositions ex vivo, and returning the treated cells to an individual.","Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1)","LSD1 (also referred to as KDM1A) is a histone H3K4\/K9 demethylase and epigenetic regulator with roles in both gene activation and repression. LSD1 has been shown to have increased expression in multiple cancer types. LSD1 is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,323,941 and 7,741,086, which are incorporated herein by reference. LSD1 is a histone demethylase with specificity for mono- and dimethyl histone H3 lysine 4 and mono and dimethyl histone H3 lysine 9. Such histone demethylases contribute to epigenetic regulation of gene expression, which provides cells with a heritable mechanism for controlling gene expression without altering the DNA nucleotide sequence. LSD1 is highly conserved in high eukaryotes, and null mutation of LSD1 genes in mouse causes embryonic lethality.","LSD1 is a member of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent family of amine oxidases, which require FAD to oxidize the mono or dimethyl lysine to an imine intermediate that is further hydrolyzed to unmodified lysine and formaldehyde. LSD1 was identified as a component of the Ctb co-repressor complex, and as a member of the CoREST repressor complex. When the CoREST complex is targeted to lineage specific genes, LSD1 demethylates the activating H3K4me2 mark to silence their expression. Additional repressive complexes containing LSD1 have been identified, including NRD and subsets of the HDAC complexes.","Conversely, LSD1 has been found to interact with multiple proteins\/complexes that function in gene activation. LSD1 is recruited via interaction with androgen receptor or estrogen receptor for transcription of androgen receptor and estrogen receptor target genes. In this role, LSD1 is thought to demethylate the repressive H3K9me2 mark to allow for gene activation. LSD1 is also a member of a transcription elongation complex composed of ELL (elongation factor RNA polymerase II), pTEFb, AF4, and AFF4. Additionally, LSD1 is a component of an MLL supercomplex associated with active transcription. MLL itself is an epigenetic modifier as a histone methyltransferase with specificity for H3K4.","In one aspect of the present invention, hydroxytyrosol-containing formulation may be employed to alter the interactions of LSD1 is various proteins or complexes. In a preferred embodiment, hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations are employed to induce epigenetic effects, for example through inhibiting LSD1 and thereby altering H3K9 methylation and\/or through altering interactions with other factors. In another aspect, hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations may be utilized to induce changes in gene expression related to particular functions, for example glucose metabolism.","Human LSD1 consists of 852 amino acids and comprises an N-terminal SWIRM domain, involved in protein interactions, and a C-terminal amine oxidase domain, which contains an insertion that forms the CoREST interacting site (the so-called \u201ctower domain\u201d). A truncation mutant of LSD1 lacking its N-terminal 184 residues retained full demethylase activity against methylated H3-K4 peptide substrates.","Studies investigating potential inhibitors of LSD have elucidated the protein crystal structure of LSD1 and a substrate-like peptide inhibitor, which was derived from the N-terminal 21-amino acid residues of histone H3 peptide in which lysine 4 (K4) is replaced by methionine that binds to LSD1 with high binding affinity (K=0.05 \u03bcmol\/L). (Wang et al., Cancer Res. 71(23): 7238-7249 (2011)). These studies have further shown that the positively charged residues (Arg2 and Arg8) of the peptide establish favorable electrostatic interactions with a cluster of negatively charged residues on LSD1 surface that involve Asp375, Glu379, Asp553, Asp555, Asp556, Asp557, and Glu559. The funneled channel that accesses to FAD is blocked by the peptide inhibitor.","Inhibition and Inactivation of LSD1","LSD1 can be inhibited or inactivated in a number of ways. Tranylcypromine (Parnate) is a non-reversible monoamine oxidase enzymatic inhibitor of that inhibits the amine oxidase function of LSD1 by covalently modifying the FAD cofactor of LSD1. Phase II clinical trials of tranylcypromine in acute myeloid leukemia patients have already commenced.","Other enzymatic inhibitors of LSD1 have been identified, for example by Wang et al., Cancer Res. 71(23): 7238-7249 (2011), that inhibit LSD1 activity without forming a covalent bond by blocking the funneled channel that accesses to FAD. These novel inhibitors exhibited half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) at 5.27-11.16 \u03bcM (5.27-11.16 e\u2212006M).","Willmann et al., Int. J. of Cancer 131(11): 2704-09 (2012) also reported a selective and reversible LSD1 inhibitor, Namoline, which blocks LSD1 demethylase activity in vitro and in vivo. Namoline has a reported LSD1 half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 50 \u03bcM.","The amine oxidase activity of LSD1 may also be inhibited by preventing binding of the peptide substrate. This can be accomplished by occupying the substrate binding site, by altering the conformation of the binding site, or by interacting with key amino acids that affect substrate binding, including preventing establishment of favorable electrostatic interactions with any of the cluster of negatively charged residues on LSD1 surface that involve Asp375, Glu379, Asp553, Asp555, Asp556, Asp557, and Glu559. Without being bound by any particular theory, compositions of the invention, including hydroxytyrosol, or derivatives or equivalents of hydroxytyrosol or oleuropein, may inhibit the enzymatic activity of LSD1 in any of these ways.","LSD1 can also be inhibited by blocking interactions with partner proteins. For Example, Ferrari-Amorotti et al. showed that preventing the interaction of LSD1 with the E-box-binding transcription repressor Slug suppressed motility and invasiveness of cancer cells similar to inhibition of LSD1 with Parnate. (Cancer Res. 2013 Jan. 1; 73(1):235-45 (2012)).","In addition, LSD1 can be inactivated by downregulation, using methods familiar to a person of skill in the art, including gene down regulation or targeted knock-down of the gene by RNA interference (RNAi). For example, Wang et al. ablated LSD1 expression with a specific siRNA targeted at an mRNA region that is identical between mouse and human LSD1 genes that induced a marked inhibition of cell growth and BrdUrd incorporation in cancer cells.","In one embodiment of the invention, the hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations inhibit LSD1 activity. In one aspect, hydroxytyrosol and\/or oleuropein, or homologues of hydroxytyrosol and\/or oleuropein, binds directly to LSD1. In a more specific aspect, hydroxytyrosol and\/or oleuropein, or homologues of hydroxytyrosol and\/or oleuropein, may mediate inhibition of LSD1 by interacting with, for example, the flavin group of the FAD contained in the LSD1 protein or a site close to the adenosine group (). In a more specific aspect, hydroxytyrosol and\/or oleuropein, or homologues of hydroxytyrosol and\/or oleuropein may mediate inhibition of LSD1 by interacting with specific residues on LSD1, for example the tryptophan residue at position 807 (Trp807), the phenylalanine at position 560 (Phe560), and\/or the histidine at position 812 (His812).","In one aspect, LDS1 inhibition results in modification of histone methylation. Such inhibition may comprise alteration of di-methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9). Such alteration may comprise an increase or a decrease in H3K9 dimethylation.","LSD1 in Cancer","LSD1 has been linked to a large number of cancer types, including: non-small cell lung cancer (Lv et al., PLoS ONE 7(4): e35065. doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0035065 (2012)); breast cancer (Wu et al., PNAS 109 (41): 16654-59 (2012)); hepatocellular carcinoma (Zhao et al., Tumor Biology 34(1): 173-80 (2013)); colon cancer (Jin et al., Biochem J. 449(2): 459-68 (2013)); prostate cancer (Willmann et al., Int. J. of Cancer 131(11): 2704-09 (2012)); chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (Bennani-Bati et al., Human Pathology 43(8): 1300-07 (2012)); olitary fibrous tumors, synovial sarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, desmoplastic small round cell tumors, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (Schildhaus et al., Human Pathology 42(11): 1667-75 (2011)); teratocarcinoma, embryonic carcinoma, and seminoma or embryonic stem cells that express the stem cell markers Oct4 and Sox2 (Wang et al. Cancer Res. 71(23):7238-49 (2011)); and bladder cancer (Kauffman et al., Mol. Carcinogenesis 50(12): 931-44 (2011)), all of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Schenk et al. specifically showed LSD1 to be a therapeutic target and that it may contribute to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pathogenesis Inhibition of LSD1 by tranylcypromine allowed for effective treatment of AML otherwise unresponsive to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. The authors suggested that LSD1 may contribute to AML pathogenesis, and inhibition of LSD1 could provide for new combinatorial therapies for AML.","In addition, Harris et al. (Cancer Cell. 2012 Apr. 17; 21(4):473-87) showed that inhibition of LSD1 prevented development of leukemia in a murine model of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) leukemia by inducing differentiation of MLL leukemia cells. The authors suggested that LSD1 was responsible for promoting the oncongenic gene program associated with certain types of leukemia.","Conventional efforts to develop specific inhibitors of the LDS1 protein expressed in a majority of cancers have had limited success to date. In particular, development of specific inhibitors of the LDS1 protein at the FAD or the funneled channel that accesses to FAD, including Asp375, Glu379, Asp553, Asp555, Asp556, Asp557, and Glu559 sites have not resulted in significant advances in cancer treatment and\/or prevention.","LSD1 has also been implicated in the activation of HIV viral transcription (Sakane et al., PLoS Pathology 7(8): e1002184. doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1002184), and in HIV-1 gene silencing in latently infected cells (Le Douce et al., Nucl. Acids Res. (2012) 40 (5): 1904-1915). Further, LSD1 has been linked to both repression of inflammation (Janzer et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 421(4):665-70 (2012)) and hypertension (Williams et al., Am J Hypertens. 25(7):812-17 (2012)).","Hydroxytyrosol Interaction with LSD1","Without being limited to a particular theory, it is believed that hydroxytyrosol interacts directly with LSD1 in a manner that inhibits the FAD-dependent oxidation of methylated lysine, either by binding FAD or by blocking the funneled channel that accesses to FAD. In the alternative, hydroxytyrosol may block peptide ligand binding by inhabiting the ligand binding site, altering the conformation of the ligand binding site of LSD1, or interacting with key amino acid residues that affect substrate binding by LSD1. The invention therefore embodies any derivative of oleuropein or hydroxytyrosol, or structural mimic or homologue thereof, that exhibits binding and\/or inhibition characteristics similar to hydroxytyrosol.","As demonstrated by this invention, hydroxytyrosol inhibits the enzymatic activity of LSD1 (). Unlike other inhibitors of LSD1, hydroxytyrosol is a naturally occurring compound, lacking the substantial toxic side effects of other inhibitors. According to the invention, LSD1 is inhibited by exposure to hydroxytyrosol or compositions comprising hydroxytyrosol. This inhibition of LSD1 prevents the growth, development, migration and metastasis of cancer cells. Although not bound by this exemplary embodiment, hydroxytyrosol can be provided in order to inhibit enzymatic activity, prevent association with co-factors or partner proteins, or decrease expression of LSD1 in target cancer cells, thereby preventing the growth, development, migration or metastasis of cancer cells.","In addition, hydroxytyrosol, or derivatives of hydroxytyrosol and\/or oleuropein, may inhibit LSD1 by preventing the binding of partner proteins or cofactors, or by downregulating the protein. It is understood that inhibition of LSD1 by hydroxytyrosol, or derivatives\/equivalents of hydroxytyrosol or oleuropein, can be by one or more of these mechanisms.","In another embodiment, hydroxytyrosol is used to treat cancer in an individual by inhibiting LSD1 and thereby inhibiting cancer cell growth, development, or metastasis. In a preferred embodiment, the individual is screened for a cancer that is linked to LSD1, and if the individual has a cancer linked to LSD1 the individual is treated with a composition of the present invention. In another embodiment, hydroxytyrosol is used to prevent the growth or development of cancer in an individual.","Methods of Detecting LSD1-Positive Cancer","The compositions of the present invention may also be used to detect cancer cells that express LSD1 or are susceptible to LSD1 inhibition. As disclosed according to the invention, cancer cells can be assayed for sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition by contacting with compositions comprising hydroxytyrosol. Sensitivity can be measured using a variety of indicators, including, for example: cell growth, proliferation and\/or death; alteration of gene expression and epigenetic effects; cell invasion; cell migration; cell adhesion; and\/or expression of cancer cell markers.","In a further embodiment, detection of hydroxytyrosol sensitivity of cancer cells may be used as part of a method for treatment of an individual with an LSD1-expressing cancer. According to the invention, and individual may be screened for a cancer sensitive to hydroxytyrosol via LSD1 inhibition, and upon identification of a hydroxytyrosol-sensitive cancer, the individual may be administered a composition of hydroxytyrosol sufficient to treat or prevent development of the cancer.","It is understood from the disclosures made herein that in vitro efficacy of treatment with hydroxytyrosol, alone or as part of an exemplary formulation, or in conjunction with additional treatments, is predictive of in vivo efficacy. For example, dosing schemes for chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin, vinblastine, and mitomycin C are well understood in the art. Further, according to aspects of the invention dosing for administration of hydroxytyrosol, alone or as part of an exemplary formulation, or in conjunction with additional treatments, wherein the hydroxytyrosol or formulation is administered at 0.5 mg\/kg body weight for 5 days per week for 6 weeks.","All publications and patent applications in this specification are indicative of the level of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains. All publications and patent applications are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated as incorporated by reference.","Embodiments of the present invention are further defined in the following non-limiting Examples. It should be understood that these Examples, while indicating certain embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only. From the above discussion and these Examples, one skilled in the art can ascertain the essential characteristics of this invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, \u2014can make various changes and modifications of the embodiments of the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions.

Such modifications are also intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims.","Methods","Docking","The molecular docking program, AutoDock Vina, was used to propose energetically favorable binding sites for hydroxytyrosol on human LSD1. Docking was performed on the crystal structure of LSD1 complexed with FAD covalently bonded to tranylcypromine (PDBID 2EJR). Prior to docking calculations, all waters, as well as the tranylcypromine adduct, were removed to create a PDB file containing only LSD1 and FAD. Although the control compound, tranylcypromine, is known to inhibit LSD1 via covalent attachment to the co-factor FAD, preliminary work does not assume covalent bonding between HT and FAD. This enables identification of possible HT binding sites both near and distal from the FAD pocket. On the other hand, predicted binding sites close to FAD may enable the identification of candidate structures for FAD with HT adduct. Predicted docking poses may also help guide determination and refinement of the HT-FAD chemical structure and conformation within the protein-inhibitor co-crystal structure. In addition, we modeled the novel LSD1 inhibitor 2d (1,15-bis{N 5-[3,3-(diphenyl)propyl]-N 1-biguanido}-4,12-diazapentadecane) and compared binding energies to those of HT.","The hydroxytyrosol ligand structure was obtained from the ZINC small-molecule structure database and converted to PDB format using Deepview. LSD1-FAD and hydroxytyrosol PDB files were pre-processed using PyRx to create their corresponding PDBQT files for use with Autodock Vina. All five rotatable torsions for hydroxytyrosol were activated while LSD1-FAD was assumed to be rigid. PyRx was used to define the ligand search grid with the center coinciding with those of the amine oxidase domain, with (x, y, z) dimensions of 65 \u212b3. The grid encompasses the amine oxidase domain surface and enables exhaustive search of potential binding sites. The searches were each conducted with exhaustiveness of 2000. Calculations were performed on a 180 node 64-bit Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae E5-2670 cluster housed at the Victorian Partnership for Advanced Computing (VPAC) facilities, utilizing 16 nodes (256 cores) per docking search. The top 20 predicted hydroxytyrosol binding poses were visualized and analyzed using VMD version 1.9.2.","Results and Discussion","Preliminary docking calculations of HT to FAD-bound LSD1 indicate two \u201cclusters\u201d of docking solutions, indicative of the possible presence of two distinct favorable binding sites for this inhibitor. The most energetically favorable site is close to the flavin group of the FAD, while the other site is close to the adenosine group. The binding pose with the highest predicted binding affinity lies close to the flavin group, and is illustrated in  and .

Apo-One homogenous caspase 3\/7 assay was used to measure the relative caspase 3\/7 induction in haematological malignant and normal peripheral blood cells. Cells were pre-treated with either 50 \u03bcM hydroxytyrosol and 100 \u03bcM oleuropein for 24 hours prior to cell lysis by the Apo-One assay reagents. The results show significant augmentation in the induction of caspase 3\/7 apoptosis in all haematological cell lines investigated by either hydroxytyrosol or oleuropein but not normal peripheral blood cells (PBMC) (). In most cell lines, both hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein were found to be effective.","Summary:","mRNA-Seq indicates that hydroxytyrosol regulates the expression of various genes in a dose-dependent manner\u2014genes associated with cell-death, cell cycle and apoptosis are regulated in K562 cells. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways are modulated in human keratinocytes. In vitro assays indicate that hydroxytyrosol is a potent inhibitor of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1).","Methods","Cell Culture","Human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells (ATCC No. CCL-243) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va., USA) and maintained in complete-Royal Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 20 mmol\/L HEPES (pH 7.4; GIBCO-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), 10% (v\/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol\/L L-glutamine (GIBCO-Invitrogen), and 80 units gentamicin (GIBCO-Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in suspension in a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v\/v) COat 37\u00b0 C. and were maintained in exponential growth phase. For maintenance, cells were passaged twice per week and seeded at ratios 1:10. Human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes transfected with the human papilloma virus (HPV) were grown as monolayers in keratinocyte\u2014Serum Free Medium (SFM) medium (GIBCO-Invitrogen) supplemented with L-glutamine, human epidermal growth factor (EGF), and bovine pituitary extract (BPE) at 37\u00b0 C., 5% (v\/v) CO. Cells were passaged by trypsinisation and seeded at ratio of 1:3.","mRNA-Sequencing","Cells were seeded at densities of 1\u00d710\/mL in culture flasks (Nalge Nunc, New York, USA) and treated with hydroxytyrosol (0, 20, 100 \u03bcM), for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C., 5% (v\/v) CO. mRNA sequencing was performed by TRIZOL extraction and library preparation using Illumina kits according to manufacturer's protocols. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed at a depth of approximately 20 million mapped reads per sample to determine the effect of hydroxytyrosol on genome-wide gene expression, in human erythroleukemic K562 cells and human keratinocytes (24 hr treatment, 20 and 100 \u03bcM). Reads generated by the Illumina base calling software V1.6 were aligned with Burrows Wheeler Aligner to the human transcriptome database curated by RefSeq (Hg18 build). Raw counts were normalized to adjust for slightly differing data volume across lanes giving the widely used score reads per transcript per million reads. These scores were used to determine relative fold changes and the conventionally used \u00b11.5 fold-change, which is discernible with qRT-PCR, was defined a significant change in expression. The online program MetaCore (GeneGo Inc. St. Joseph, Mich., USA) was used for pathway analysis.","LSD1 Demethylase Profiling","Formulation 2 (4\u00d7 diluted) was tested against positive control tranylcypromine for LSD1 inhibition activity. Formulation 2 (4\u00d7 diluted) was tested in 10-dose ICmode with 3-fold serial dilution in singlet starting at 100 \u03bcM and control compound, Tranylcypromine, was tested in 10-dose ICmode with 3-fold serial dilution starting at 100 \u03bcM. The production of FAD-dependent HOas a result of demethylase activity of LSD1 is measured by coupling with HRP and Amplex Red and fluorescence was measured using the EnVision plate reader at Ex\/Em=535\/590 nm. 10 \u03bcM Histone H3 (1-21) K4me2 peptide was used as the standard substrate. Data was represented at the percentage of LSD1 enzymatic activity inhibition relative to DMSO controls and a curve fit for the control compound.","Results and Discussion","These findings indicate that hydroxytyrosol induces cell-death and apoptosis preferentially in malignant K562 cells compared to PMBC cells. Similarly, the findings indicate that hydroxytyrosol induces DNA-double strand breaks in K562 cells but not normal PBMC. Analysis of genome-wide mRNA-Seq data indicates that hydroxytyrosol affects pathways associated with cell-death, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Further, these studies have identified that hydroxytyrosol regulates the expression of numerous genes associated with epigenetic processes. In particular, the findings indicate changes associated with DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylase enzymes, suggesting that hydroxytyrosol may influence chromatin architecture by altering histone post-translational modifications (). Table 5 shows changes in expression of epigenetic-related genes in cancer cells following exposure to hydroxytyrosol according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.

that hydroxytyrosol protects human skin keratinocytes from radiation-induced DNA damage (). Next generation sequencing analysis was used to explore potential mechanisms of action. The findings indicate that hydroxytyrosol regulates the expression of approximately \u02dc3 thousand genes, the majority being up-regulated by 2-fold (). Chromosomal analysis indicates that differential gene expression can be observed on the entire chromosome. As shown in Table 6, pathway analysis, using GeneGo, indicates that hydroxytyrosol affects intrinsic antioxidant pathways in the cells. In particular heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1) is up-regulated by 15-fold. Analysis of the sequencing data also indicates altered expression of genes associated with epigenetic mechanisms.

Importantly, the hydroxytyrosol composition of the invention demonstrated more potent inhibition of LSD1 than tranylcypromine. Tranylcypromine is a known irreversible inhibitor of LSD1 that is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia patients. The effective concentration of the hydroxytyrosol composition of the invention at which 50% of LSD1 activity was inhibited (EC) was approximately 5 lower than that of tranylcypromine. In addition, this effective concentration is also lower than those reported for other novel LSD1 inhibitors. For example, the novel inhibitors reported by Wang et al., Cancer Res. 71(23): 7238-7249 (2011), exhibited half maximal inhibitory concentrations at 5.27-11.16 \u03bcM (5.27-11.16 e\u2212006 M), while Namoline, reported by Willmann et al., Int. J. of Cancer 131(11): 2704-09 (2012), has a reported ICof 50 \u03bcM (50 e\u2212006). Thus, the hydroxytyrosol composition according to the present invention is a more potent inhibitor of LSD1 than other drugs currently being pursed for cancer treatment, including drugs currently in clinical trials.","Summary:","In vitro assays indicate that hydroxytyrosol inhibits lysine demethylase 1 (LSD1) by direct binding to its substrates and subsequently effects the methylation status of histones in malignant cells.","Methods","LSD1 Demethylase Profiling","Hydroxytyrosol was tested against positive control tranylcypromine for LSD1 inhibition activity. Hydroxytyrosol was tested in 10-dose ICmode with 3-fold serial dilution in singlet starting at 100 \u03bcM and control compound, Tranylcypromine, was tested in 10-dose ICmode with 3-fold serial dilution starting at 100 \u03bcM. The production of FAD-dependent HOas a result of demethylase activity of LSD1 is measured by coupling with HRP and Amplex Red and fluorescence was measured using the EnVision plate reader at Ex\/Em=535\/590 nm. 10 \u03bcM Histone H3 (1-21) K4me2 peptide was used as the standard substrate. Data was represented at the percentage of LSD1 enzymatic activity inhibition relative to DMSO controls and a curve fit for the control compound.","Western Blotting","Cells were treated with or without 100 \u03bcM hydroxytyrosol for 24 hours prior to collection of whole cell lysates using Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (M-PER; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA). Total protein was measured using a Bradford Assay with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich) at 595 nM using a Emax Precision microplate reader. Equal amounts of protein (40 \u03bcg\/lane) were fractionated using 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies polyclonal rabbit anti-H3K9me3 (1:500; Abcam) and polyclonal rabbit anti-acetylated histone H3 (1:2000; 06-599, Millipore). The membranes were incubated with peroxidise-conjugated goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:10000) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence staining.","Results and Discussion","In vitro studies investigating the inhibitory potential of hydroxytyrosol to LSD1 indicate hydroxytyrosol is a potent inhibitor of LSD1 (). The FDA approved LSD1 inhibitor tranylcypromine was used as a positive control. The data shows hydroxytyrosol to be a more effective LSD1 inhibitor against tranylcypromine. A direct target of LSD1 is histone H3 at lysine 9. Western blot analysis shows hydroxytyrosol modifies histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) di-methylation differentially in chronic myeloid leukemic K562 cells and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Following treatment with hydroxytyrosol, di-methylation was increased in K562 cells but decreased in PBMC cells ().","Summary:","Hydroxytyrosol-containing Formulations reduce the cytotoxic effects induced by HOand doxorubicin, represented by reduced \u03b3H2AX formation.","Methods","Cell Culture","Human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes transfected with the human papilloma virus (HPV) were grown as monolayers in keratinocyte\u2014Serum Free Medium (SFM) medium (GIBCO-Invitrogen) supplemented with L-glutamine, human epidermal growth factor (EGF), and bovine pituitary extract (BPE) at 37\u00b0 C., 5% (v\/v) CO.","Cell Viability and Apoptosis","Cells were pre-treated with hydroxytyrosol (dilution factor 1=200 \u03bcM), oleuropein (dilution factor 1=50 \u03bcM) and the Formulations 1 and 2 (Table 9) for 24 hours; 37\u00b0 C., 5% (v\/v) CO.

The findings indicate that the formulation protects from damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and the anthracycline, doxorubicin (). In addition, potent protection from ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage was observed (, D). Removal of the olive phenolics, hydroxytyrosol or oleuropein from the formulation highlights the importance of these compounds in conferring radioprotective activity. Overall, the findings indicate a potential role for the hydroxytyrosol-containing Formulations of the invention in ameliorating acute skin side effects associated with cancer radiotherapy.","Summary:","An exemplary hydroxytyrosol-containing Formulation improves the migration of keratinocytes, human microvascular endothelial and human umbilical vein endothelial cells following treatment with high glucose and doxorubicin.","Methods","Cell Culture","Human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes transfected with the human papilloma virus (HPV), kindly provided by Dr. Pritinder Kaur (Peter McCallum Cancer Institute) were grown as monolayers in keratinocyte\u2014Serum Free Medium (SFM) medium (GIBCO-Invitrogen) supplemented with L-glutamine, human epidermal growth factor (EGF), and bovine pituitary extract (BPE).

In separate experiments, cells were treated with 30 mM glucose for 3 days prior to one day incubation in fresh media and then 24 hour incubation with the Formulation before scratching. Experiments to determine the protection of cells following doxorubicin treatment involved treatment with the McCord formulation or individual components for 24 hours prior to 1 hour incubation with 1 \u03bcM doxorubicin. Cells were washed and incubated for a further 24 hours in fresh media before scratching. Cells were then scratched by scraping the cell monolayer in a straight line using a pipet tip.

Lysates were collected by sonication in iced water of the cell pellet in emerged in cold lysis buffer (5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.9% sodium chloride, 0.1% glucose). Following centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., the supernatant was collected and Bradford assay was performed to determine protein concentration of each sample according the manufacturers protocols. Cell lysates were then used to perform the antioxidant assay kit (Cayman; cat: 709001, MI, USA) according the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysates were analyzed for their total antioxidant capacity. This included the full array of enzymes, small molecules and macromolecules that the cell has developed to counteract ROS and reduce their damage together with any food-derived antioxidants. The sum of endogenous and food-derived antioxidants in the sample represented the total antioxidant activity of the cells and was measured by their ability to inhibit the oxidation of ABTS (2,2\u2032-Azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate]) in the presence of metmyoglobin using the Perkin Elmer Multi-plate reader (\u03bbem=750 nm). The capacity of the antioxidants in the sample to prevent ABST oxidation was compared with known millimolar concentrations of Trolox, a water-soluble tocopherol analogue and all values were adjusted according the known amounts of protein present per sample.","Results and Discussion","Our findings indicate that the hydroxytyrosol-containing formulations of the present invention accelerate the migration of human keratinocytes (), HMEC-1 () and HUVEC cells () cells following physical wounding. To simulate endothelial dysfunction associated with diabetic complications, cells were pre-treated with 30 mM glucose for 3 days prior to wounding. The findings indicated that glucose prolonged the time required for 50% of the wound to heal significantly. The hydroxytyrosol-containing formulation had a pronounced protective effect on glucose-induced endothelial cell dysfunction, returning the time required to heal 50% of the wound to that similar to untreated cells. Further, doxorubicin also induced endothelial cell dysfunction, increasing the time required for 50% of the wound to heal to in untreated cells. As observed, with the effects mediated by glucose, the hydroxytyrosol-containing formulation exhibited a pronounced protective effect. Treatment with the hydroxytyrosol-containing formulation improved the wound healing response to that similar of the untreated cells.","Following investigations of total antioxidant capacity in PBMCs and K562 cells, the results show hydroxytyrosol and hydroxytyrosol-containing formulation 2 deplete total antioxidant capacity of the chronic myeloid leukemic cells and enhance the antioxidant capacity of the normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (). Furthermore, this trend is reflected in the relative cell viability of the cells. Hydroxytyrosol and hydroxytyrosol-containing Formulation 2 were found to significantly induce caspase 3\/7 mediated apoptosis in malignant K562 cells.","Furthermore, the results show hydroxytyrosol-containing Formulations of the present invention increased tubule formation in HUVEC cells and had a prolonged effect in increased tube length up to 16 hours (). Following investigations of total antioxidant capacity in PBMCs, the results show Hydroxytyrosol, Oleuropein and formulations containing both Hydroxytyrosol and Oleuropein significantly increased the total antioxidant of the cells.

In contrast, even in the presence of oxygen, proliferating and cancer cells exhibit an increased uptake of glucose and increased rate of glycolysis and predominantly undergo lactic acid fermentation. This phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect in honor of Otto Warburg who first made these observations in the 1920s. After a period of general lack of interest, the field has recently become an intense focus of research. Indeed it is becoming evident that there is a strong correlation between gene expression and cancer metabolism. These studies utilized mRNA-Sequencing and explored a \u201cWarburg gene-set\u201d which was derived from the publicly available Cell Signaling Technology pathway map. The following were evaluated: (1) changes in the expression of Warburg-related genes in human erythroleukemic compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and (2) the effects of incubation of K562 cells on relevant genes.","Methods","Cell Culture","Human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va., USA) and maintained in complete-Royal Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 20 mmol\/L HEPES (pH 7.4; GIBCO-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), 10% (v\/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol\/L L-glutamine (GIBCO-Invitrogen), and 80 units gentamicin (GIBCO-Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in suspension in a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v\/v) COat 37\u00b0 C. and were maintained in exponential growth phase. For maintenance, cells were passaged twice per week and seeded at ratios 1:10. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were fractionated using the Ficoll Plaque fractionation method from whole blood obtained from the Australian Red Cross Blood Bank (ARCB) under ethic approval (#304\/12). Cells were harvested fresh on the day of the experiments and maintained in complete\u2014RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 20 \u03bcg\/mL gentamicin at 37\u00b0 C., 5% (v\/v) CO.","mRNA-Sequencing","Cells were seeded at densities of 1\u00d710\/mL in culture flasks (Nalge Nunc, New York, USA) and K562 cells were treated with or without 100 \u03bcM hydroxytyrosol for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C., 5% (v\/v) CO. mRNA sequencing was performed by TRIZOL extraction and library preparation using Illumina kits according to manufacturer's protocols. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed at a depth of approximately 20 million mapped reads per sample. Reads generated by the Illumina base calling software V1.6 were aligned with Burrows Wheeler Aligner to the human transcriptome database curated by RefSeq (Hg18 build). Raw counts were normalized to adjust for slightly differing data volume across lanes giving the widely used score reads per transcript per million reads. These scores were used to determine relative fold changes and the conventionally used \u00b11.5 fold-change, which is discernible with qRT-PCR, was defined a significant change in expression. The online program MetaCore (GeneGo Inc. St. Joseph, Mich., USA) was used for pathway analysis. The Warburg gene-set shown in Table 10 was used to investigate changes in Warburg-related genes in human erythroleukemic compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and changes in expression of Warburg-related genes following incubation of K562 cells with hydroxytyrosol.","Results and Discussion","Previous in vitro investigations indicate that hydroxytyrosol induces cell-death and apoptosis preferentially in malignant cells compared to normal cells. Using genome wide next generation sequencing (mRNA-Seq) analysis, this study investigated the Warburg-related gene expression changes in erythroleukemic K562 cells compared to normal PBMC cells and K562 cells treated with 100 \u03bcM hydroxytyrosol (Table 10). As anticipated, the findings indicate that 51 genes of the total of 134 Warburg-related genes (38%) were significantly regulated in K562 cells compared to PBMC. Pre-treatment of cells with hydroxytyrosol resulted in differential expression of 30% of these genes; with 87% reversing expression towards that observed in PBMC cells. In accordance with the experimental data a pro-apoptotic effect was observed following treatment with hydroxytyrosol. Preliminary interrogation of the data shows significant up-regulation in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 (tumor protein p53; 1.91 fold change) and the TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator C12orf5 (chromosome 12 open reading frame 5) in K562 cells following treatment with hydroxytyrosol. In addition, a strong pro-apoptotic affect was observed via the up-regulation of caspases 4, 7 and 8 and the p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis BCL2 binding component 3 (BBC3), by a fold change of 1.87, 2.01, 1.62, and 2.29 respectively. Further, metabolic regulators PFKFB4 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase\/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4), PFKB2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase\/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2) and ACLY (ATP citrate lyase) were down-regulated by 1.79, 1.53 and 1.59 fold change respectively (Table 10). Importantly, down-regulation of the iron-transporter (transferrin receptor 2; TRF2), which is involved in iron hemostasis, growth and proliferation, was significantly down-regulated by hydroxytyrosol (1.9-fold).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0289","num":"0288"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 10"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Warburg-related gene expression changes in erythroleukemic K562 cells compared"},{"entry":"to normal PBMC cells and K562 cells treated with 100 \u03bcM hydroxytyrosol."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Fold Change"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"K562","K562 +"]},{"entry":["Gene",{},"vs.","100 \u03bcM"]},{"entry":["Symbol","Gene Name","PBMC","HT"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Up-regulated"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ME1","malic enzyme 1, NADP(+)-dependent, cytosolic","14.62","2.22"]},{"entry":["TFR2","transferrin receptor 2","12.15","\u22121.90"]},{"entry":["VEGFA","vascular endothelial growth factor A","9.92","2.65"]},{"entry":["SLC1A5","solute carrier family 1 (neutral amino acid transporter),","7.69"]},{"entry":[{},"member 5"]},{"entry":["HK1","hexokinase 1","7.57"]},{"entry":["PIK3CB","phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, beta polypeptide","7.09"]},{"entry":["SLC25A5","solute carrier family 25 (mitochondrial carrier;
