title: Hidden trajectory modeling with differential cepstra for speech recognition
abstract: A novel system for speech recognition uses differential cepstra over time frames as acoustic features, together with the traditional static cepstral features, for hidden trajectory modeling, and provides greater accuracy and performance in automatic speech recognition. According to one illustrative embodiment, an automatic speech recognition method includes receiving a speech input, generating an interpretation of the speech, and providing an output based at least in part on the interpretation of the speech input. The interpretation of the speech uses hidden trajectory modeling with observation vectors that are based on cepstra and on differential cepstra derived from the cepstra. A method is developed that can automatically train the hidden trajectory model's parameters that are corresponding to the components of the differential cepstra in the full acoustic feature vectors.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Improving the accuracy and performance of automatic speech recognition has been an active area of research. These have included modeling human speech using methods such as hidden Markov models and hidden trajectory models. For example, a statistical hidden trajectory model may use temporal filtering of hidden vocal tract resonance targets to estimate a hidden trajectory for a vocal tract resonance. The targets used in the hidden trajectory model are described as being stochastic with a phoneme-dependent probability distribution. Thus each phoneme has a mean target and a target variance. In the past, the mean target and the target variance have been determined using a vocal tract resonance tracker.","Using the tracker, hidden trajectory values for individual phonemes are collected and the statistical distribution of the vocal tract resonances is used to identify the means and variances for the targets. The vocal tract resonance tracker is prone to errors in the vocal tract resonances identified by the tracker, which are propagated into the target distributions. As a result, the target distributions are incorrect, sometimes resulting in undesirable performance of the hidden trajectory model. Also, the acoustic features such as cepstra used in the past are static, losing some useful information that can be provided by the \u201cdynamic\u201d or temporal-differential features.","The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A novel system for speech recognition uses static cepstra and differential cepstra over time frames as acoustic features for hidden trajectory modeling, and provides greater accuracy and performance in automatic speech recognition.

This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in the background.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIGS. 4 and 5"],"b":["100","200","100","100"]},"Method  provides an illustrative way to train a hidden trajectory model using cepstra and time-ordered differential cepstra. This includes estimating mean target vocal tract resonance (VTR) vectors for a set of speech units such as phones, phonemes, syllables, or sentences, for example. A hidden trajectory model is a two-stage model that provides a probability of an observation vector given a speech unit such as a phoneme. In the first stage of the model, a probability distribution for vocal tract resonance (VTR) trajectories is described in terms of a filtered sequence of VTR target distributions. In the second stage of the hidden trajectory model, the probability of an observation vector is described in terms of a non-linear function of the vocal tract resonance trajectory and a residual model.","Making reference to , method  begins with step , in which a speech signal  generated by a trainer reading from a text  is received by an analog-to-digital (A\/D) converter . At step , the speech signal is converted into digital frames by converting the analog signal into digital samples using A\/D converter  and forming frames of digital samples using frame constructor . At step , the frames derived from the speech signal are used to form observed feature vectors  for each frame using feature extractor . In one illustrative embodiment, A\/D converter  samples the analog speech signal at 16 kHz with 16 bits per sample, thereby creating 32 kilobytes of speech data per second and frame constructor  creates a new frame every 10 milliseconds that includes 25 milliseconds worth of data, for example. Under various embodiments, feature extractor  may extract observed feature vectors  as linear predictive coding (LPC) cepstral feature vectors, perceptual linear prediction (PLP) cepstral feature vectors, mel frequency cepstra feature vectors, fast Fourier transform (FFT) feature vectors, or other types of vectors, for example.","At step , observed cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors  are aligned with speech units by a hidden trajectory model (HTM) alignment component . HTM alignment component  uses a dictionary (not shown) to divide text  into speech units. It then aligns the sequences of observed cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors  with the speech units using a hidden trajectory model (not shown), which describes the probability of each speech unit given the sequence of observed cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors . This results in an alignment  which associates cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors (and thereby the frames associated with the cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors) with speech units in the training speech signal.","Method  of  continues at step  to evaluate cepstra and differential cepstra model parameters, which may be generally labeled as \u03b1, for each frame of the speech signal by model parameter calculator . As noted below, the model parameters may be determined using EQ. 5, below, and alignment . Once the model parameters  have been determined for each frame k, the process continues at step  where a conditional distribution is evaluated by a trajectory calculator . For example, in an illustrative embodiment, the conditional distribution may be evaluated as a probability density function of the time-ordered observed feature vectors and the time-ordered hidden trajectory vectors, and may be evaluated using the time-ordered hidden trajectory vectors, a parameter-free prediction function acting on the time-ordered observed cepstra and differential cepstra trajectory vectors, and vector and matrix differential cepstra parameters, as in EQ. 9, below.","At step , trajectory calculator  produces trajectory , representing a conditional distribution of the cepstra and differential cepstra trajectory vectors, using initial targets , which in one embodiment are generally accepted values for the vocal tract resonances for the various speech units. Trajectory calculator  calculates the mean trajectory by applying filter parameters  and initial targets , as \u03bc, to EQ. 5 below. The resulting mean trajectory is taken as trajectory .","At step , a residual model  is trained by a residual model trainer  using trajectory . Residual model  is trained by taking the difference between observed cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors  and cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors predicted using the corresponding value of trajectory .","This may be described with the equation:\n\n]\u2003\u2003(EQ. 1)\n","where r is the residual and ois the observed cepstra feature vector for the kth frame. The residuals, r, are grouped by speech units, and the mean and covariance for each group are computed to produce the residual model (\u03bc,\u03a3) . Differentials between time-ordered cepstra may also be used for acoustic features, and combined with the cepstra features for that purpose; these are discussed in more detail further below, after the description of the system using the cepstra alone.","At step , means are determined for the targets; residual model  is provided to a target calculator  along with observed cepstra and differential cepstra feature vectors , filter parameters , and trajectory . Target calculator  determines the mean vocal tract resonance target vectors  of each speech unit, as elaborated further below.","At step , the mean target vectors are assessed by a convergence test  to determine if the values have converged. If they have not converged, the mean target vectors are provided to trajectory calculator , which uses the mean target vectors in EQ. 5 below to re-evaluate the distribution of cepstra and differential cepstra features and determine a new sequence of trajectories  at step . The new trajectory values are then used to retrain residual model  at step  as described above. The new residual model and the new trajectories are then used to recalculate the mean target vectors at step .","Steps , , , and  may be repeated iteratively until the mean target vectors converge at step . When the mean target vectors converge, the mean target vectors are set as the final targets , and the process may end at step , where the method  is finished with training the speech recognition model using differential cepstra, and ready to receive subsequent speech signals and provide outputs based on interpretations of the speech signals.","Under one embodiment, the first stage of the hidden trajectory model describes the vocal tract resonance trajectory as being generated from segmental targets applied to a bi-directional finite impulse response filter as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["z","k","s"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msubsup":{"mi":["h","k","s"]},"mo":"*","msub":{"mi":["t","k"]}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":["k","D"],"mo":"-"}},{"mi":["k","D"],"mo":"+"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["c","\u03b3"]},{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c4"}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msubsup":{"mi":"\u03b3","mrow":[{"mi":"s","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c4"}},{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mi":["k","\u03c4"],"mo":"-"}}]}}}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"EQ","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}}]}}}}},"where zis the trajectory in the kth time frame for speech unit s, tis the VTR target vector for speech unit s at time frame \u03c4, \u03b3is a coarticulation parameter that indicates the spatial extent of coarticulation and is correlated with speaking effort, and 2D+1 represents the length of the filter's impulse response hand determines the temporal extent of coarticulation.
