{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to relates to an apparatus to cloak objects large and small from electromagnetic radiation. In particular, the invention relates to an electromagnetic cloak having plates adjacently disposed at a separation distance.","Due to the ever increasing use of electromagnetics, the United States armed forces need methods to prevent electromagnetic interference. Preventing electromagnetic interference is also useful in the private sector. The physical implementation of an electromagnetic cloak is a relatively new idea, although the basic physics of electromagnetism has been long known. An electromagnetic cloak can conceal an interior object to electromagnetic radiation by not disturbing the electromagnetic field outside of the cloak in a detectable way. Such a cloak can be used anywhere there is an object that interacts with an electromagnetic wave.","In order to cloak an object, radiation must travel around the object and reconstruct on the other side in both phase and amplitude. The path around an object, embedded in free space, for example, is longer than the path radiation would take in free space if the object were not there. Free space radiation travels at the speed of light, and so the velocity of the wave taking the longer path must travel faster than the speed of light so the phase can reconstruct on the other side. The wave velocity denoted constitutes the phase velocity, which can travel faster than the speed of light without violating physical laws because there is no energy moved by phase velocity.","In a true cloak, the radiation is generalized to any polarization and frequency, and can originate from any origin. Scattered waves are non-existent and transmitted waves are not distorted in either phase or amplitude outside the cloak. The cloak behavior would not depend on the electromagnetic nature of the object being cloaked. There exists no known physically realizable cloak that can accommodate all these generalizations simultaneously. Therefore, a need exists for an effective electromagnetic cloak that can prevent electromagnetic interference.","Conventional shielding techniques yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide, a cloaking system for use in an electromagnetic field includes a shielded element; a first plate enclosing the shielded element; and a second plate enclosing the first plate. The first plate and second plate are separated by a distance that varies by a distance depending on design optimizations. The first and second plates together create a first vane. Exemplary embodiments provide, the shielded element comprises a portion of one of a wind turbine, an airplane and an antenna.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","There has been recent and dramatic interest in the concept of an electromagnetic cloak. The cloak can conceal an object to electromagnetic radiation by not disturbing the radiation outside the cloaking shell. In a true cloak, the radiation can have any polarization and frequency, and can originate from any origin. Scattered waves are non-existent and transmitted waves are not distorted. There exist no known cloaks that can accommodate all these generalizations simultaneously that are physically realizable. Typically, a cloak is fabricated with particular restrictions placed on the electromagnetic radiation such as polarization, propagation direction (dimensionality), and\/or use for a single frequency.","Several concepts have been proposed or demonstrated to establish cloaking. In 2005, A. Alu and N. Engheta, \u201cAchieving transparency with plasmonic and metamaterial coatings\u201d, 72 (016623) (available at http:\/\/repository.upenn.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1175&context=ese_papers) proposed plasmonics to achieve transparency. Their work was based on principles of scattering and interference. In 2006, electromagnetic cloak designs were proposed by J. B. Pendry et al. \u201cControlling Electromagnetic Fields,\u201d 312 (1780) (http:\/\/www.ece.utah.edu\/\u02dcdschurig\/Site\/Top_Cited_Publications_files\/1780.pdf), and U. Leonhardt, \u201cOptical Conformal Mapping\u201d, 312 (23) (preprint at http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/physics\/0602092vl.pdf). These latter solutions depend on spatially variant and anisotropic requirements of the index-of-refraction to bend the wave around an object. The method necessitates the flexibility intrinsic to metamaterials for fabrication. P. Alitalo et al. demonstrated a volumetric broadband cloak that used principles of waveguides \u201cExperimental verification of broadband cloaking using a volumetric cloak composed of periodically stacked cylindrical transmission-line networks\u201d, 94 (014103) available at (http:\/\/lib.tkk.fi\/Diss\/2099\/isbn9789512299874\/article8.pdf), although that method is limited to small cloaked objects that fit between the guides near the center of the cloak.","The first experimental demonstration of a cylindrically symmetric cloak utilized a graded and anisotropic index-of-refraction as reported by D. Schurig et al., \u201cMetamaterial Electromagnetic Cloak at Microwave Frequencies\u201d, 314 (10) (http:\/\/www.ccc.utah.edu\/\u02dcdschurig\/Site\/Top_Cited_Publications_files\/977.pdf) at a frequency of 8.5 GHz. As with most cylindrically symmetric designs, the cloak behavior was restricted to rays that did not have an axial component. Further, in 2006, the polarization was fixed that simplified design in S. A. Cummer et al. \u201cFull-wave simulations of electromagnetic cloaking structures\u201d, 74 (036621), (http:\/\/people.engr.ncsu.edu\/dschuri\/Site\/Publications_files\/PhysRevE74036621.pdf). Often, applications do not require a true cloak solution.","Exemplary embodiments describe a cloak with restrictions that the radiation is a plane wave with a known direction, polarization and frequency. When the electromagnetic wave is of known origin, the demand for symmetry is reduced. An application might be to cloak the tall platforms of a windmill farm that interfere with a known transmitter. The disclosure herein extends to cloaks embedded in materials other than free space, and those that have a dielectric strength different than one. Such methods have been used for purposes other than cloaks as discussed by P.-S. Kildal et al. in \u201cReduction of Forward Scattering from Cylindrical Objects using Hard Surfaces\u201d, 44 (11), 1996. Various exemplary embodiments are based on a metal lens model first introduced in 1946 by W. E. Kock in \u201cMetal-Lens Antennas\u201d, 34 (11) 828-836. Conformal mapping techniques can be used to design bent tapered waveguides, as demonstrated in 1997 by M.-L. Wu et al., \u201cCompletely Adiabatic S-Shaped Bent Tapers in Optical Waveguides\u201d, 9 (2).","Kock demonstrated a lens effect applicable to antennas by controlling the phase velocity through parallel plate waveguides embedded in free space or air (with relative dielectric constant equivalent to unity) according to eqn.

Note that unlike Kock's metal lens, the plate separation a varies as the wave propagates through the guide. The plate separation distance  can be designed to accommodate large size or uniquely shaped objects rather than a cylinder with uniform radius.","For various design solutions as an example of a metal lens cloak, the effective electrical length of each vane (between vanes plates) is guided to conform to that of the external free space path. In addition, the electrical length is designed so that destructive interference at the input results in a perfect impedance match. For example, the plate in the cloak can optionally be composed of four identical segments of equal radius and circumference. The constant radius guarantees no sharp bends and provides for a smooth propagation path for the electromagnetic radiation to pass. This design naturally opens the vanes structure at the input and output, which aids in matching the guide impedance at the input and output, serves to flatten the vanes further away from the origin and provides for a smooth impedance transition to the narrowest part of the vane (where impedance is the highest) much in the same manner that back-to-back horn antennae would.","The combined physical path length of all four segments of any vane designed this way, represented by the dash line electromagnetic wave path , can be determined by ray tracing through the geometry resulting in the relation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["s","WG"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["r","i"]},"mo":"+","mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["a","i"]},"mn":"2"}}},{"msup":{"mi":"sin","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"msqrt":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["r","o"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mn":"3","mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["r","o"]}},{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["a","o"]}}],"mo":"+"}}}},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["r","i"]},"mo":"+","mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["a","i"]},"mn":"2"}}}}}}}]}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{}],"sub":["o ","i ","o ","i ","FS","o","o","o"],"sup":["th ","th "],"b":["330","370","380"],"figref":"FIG. 3","in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["s","r","r","a"]},"Geometry can be used to calculate the physical path length s, of a guide (a) of the 0order guide and (b) subsequent guides.

The reflection coefficient can be improved using by several methods. For example, one can include an impedance transformer by flaring the input and output sections, which also eliminates the space between the guides , as long as overall phase is accounted for. Also, the physical and electrical lengths of the guides can be fabricated to so that any reflected wave from the guide output will cancel reflected waves at the guide input.","The cloak assembly (denoting cloak and object concealed thereby) can operate within an electromagnetic field without producing a detectable disturbance beyond the cloak assembly. Thus, both phase and amplitude of the electromagnetic wave must be restored everywhere outside of the cloak to initial characteristics before the immersion of the cloak assembly. Many uses can be made from this concept. For example, signal noise from a large windmill farm with an airport radar system can be improved by cloaking each windmill stand, thereby enabling the emitted and return radar signals to pass through either direction as if the windmill stand were absent. The metal lens cloak of these embodiments accomplishes the cloaking behavior using metal lens techniques.","There has been recent and dramatic interest in the concept of an electromagnetic cloak. A cloak can conceal an object to electromagnetic radiation by not disturbing the radiation outside the cloaking shell. In a true cloak, the radiation is generalized to any polarization and frequency, and can originate from any origin. Scattered waves would be non-existent and transmitted waves are not distorted in either phase or amplitude outside the cloak. The cloak behavior would not depend on the electromagnetic nature of the object being cloaked. There exist no known cloaks that can accommodate all these generalizations simultaneously. Typically, a cloak is fabricated with particular restrictions placed on the electromagnetic radiation such as polarization, propagation direction (dimensionality), and\/or use for a single frequency.","Conventionally, two approaches to cloaking have been pursued prior to the exemplary embodiments. The first approach is based on the principles of scattering (often referred to as plasmonic approaches), as described by Alu. A drawback of this approach seems to be that higher order scattering modes are difficult to suppress for large cloaks. Thus the mantle cloak seems to be restricted to cloaking objects no larger than a few wavelengths.","The second approach is based on principles of metamaterials, which are synthetic materials that can mimic the electric and\/or magnetic polarization of natural materials, but in an engineered and controlled way as provided by Schurig, whose metamaterial approach utilized a difficult transformation to design the cloak called transformation optics. The design resulted in a recipe based on effective constituent parameters for the dielectric constant and permeability required by the metamaterial. The square root of the multiplication of these parameters gives an effective index of refraction that varies throughout the material and can be made less than unity.","A further complication is that the variation in index of refraction is typically anisotropic in this approach, meaning the parameters are different along each coordinate. These complications make the metamaterial cloak difficult to fabricate. Still further complications exist in trying to design the localized cells in the structure to result in the desired effective parameters, and it often takes several iterative design processes between the cell structure modeling, desired constituent parameters modeling, and the experimental trials. Another disadvantage of this design is due to the high dispersive losses typical of metamaterials. Thus, metamaterial cloaks based on cylindrical designs seem to be restricted to sizes on the order of a few wavelengths at most.","These embodiments are extendable to cloaks embedded in materials other than free space, and those that have a dielectric strength different than one. Consider a lossless dielectric slab with a relative permittivity \u2208>1 and of finite thickness L in the x-dimension, but otherwise infinite in extent. For a plane wave with normal incidence and known frequency, the thickness of the slab can be adjusted to extinguish the reflection coefficient in ways known to those skilled in the art of microwave engineering. Although this results in a unity transmission coefficient, the phase delay does not vanish.","As described for , the configuration of many parallel plates  embedded within the slab . The plates  have a period corresponding to plate separation A, with electromagnetic polarization assumed. The plates  form an effective index-of-refraction between zero and unity, thereby increasing phase velocity through the slab .

Electromagnetic interference caused by the struts  can be reduced by their concealment to electromagnetic radiation with cloaks .

Tuning can be accomplished by placing an array  of tunable split-ring resonators  within each vane structure of a metal lens cloak such as metal patterns forming a metasurface printed on a flexible sheet, such as a plastic substrate. Each exemplary resonator  includes an outer split ring  and an inner split ring  with the separation of each ring opposite in orientation to absorb the electromagnetic energy from a wave at the tuned frequency. Such split ring resonators enable negative values of permittivity and permeability to be artificially produced, whereas such characteristics are not naturally found.","Metal lens cloak designs where each vane is made from four identical segments of plate material of constant radius and circumference: a) a cloak where vane separation is periodic at the narrowest points, and b) a cloak where vane separation is periodic at the inputs and outputs.","Various exemplary embodiments provide a one-dimensional electromagnetic cloak, meaning bending parallel electromagnetic waves from interference from an object along a single plane, being effectively along a line. The exemplary technique utilizes a metal lens to guide a plane wave of specific polarization and frequency around an object. The effective index-of-refraction requirement necessary to extinguish phase delay (0<n<1 for a cloak embedded in free space) is inherent in the nature of the waveguide.","A central advantage of this approach is that large scale objects can be cloaked due to the low-loss nature of the metal lens waveguide. Further, anisotropic techniques to guide a wave through a two-dimensional path around an object are not necessary. This concept offers simplicity in design and can lead to rapid fabrication time and reduced costs. Thus, this is appealing for select applications where the electromagnetic influence of objects along a view path can be removed or at least mitigated.","Various concepts have been proposed to establish electromagnetic cloaking. The method necessitated the flexibility intrinsic to metamaterials to fabricate a cloak, which was first demonstrated using a two-dimensional cylindrical approach. The radiation was restricted to a fixed polarization and frequency which allowed for a clever approximation to the cloak problem that greatly simplified fabrication.","Constraints to the problem are that the input and output apertures of each individual guide are constant and normal to the input and output face, and that each plate is formed of four identical constant radius segments. This latter constraint maximizes curvature enabling smoother impedance transitions through the guides. The dielectric material inside the guide can be the same as that outside the guide and assumed to be unity for the simulations. The electrical lengths are optimized to be a multiple of wavelength to minimize reflection. The smooth transition of the guides enables adiabatic energy to flow through the guide. Such a guide design enables production at very low cost and being very light weight.","Additional references regarding electromagnetic tuning can be obtained from K. A. Boulais et al., \u201cTunable split-ring resonator for metamaterials using photocapacitance of semi-insulating GaAs\u201d, 93 (043518), 2008, or by other such methods. Tuning can also be mechanically provided by varying the plate separation using pressure (air, hydraulic, etc.), electromechanical (such as piezoelectric), magnetomechanical, thermoelectric, or other means. Thus, many techniques exist to tune the metal lens cloak so as to account for different electromagnetic radiation frequencies and\/or to enhance cloaking within a desired spectrum.","According to an exemplary embodiment, the metal lens cloak can have a perfect impedance match by using principles of interference coatings. The vane structure of a metal lens represents a waveguide. In a practical device, the input of the waveguide alone can almost match free space. Any remaining reflection can be compensated for by using principles of destructive interference.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
