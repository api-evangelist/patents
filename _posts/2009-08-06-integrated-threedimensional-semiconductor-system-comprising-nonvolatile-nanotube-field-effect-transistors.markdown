Low power is a requirement for most applications as is portability so conservation of battery power is a requirement and nonvolatile operation is advantageous. Also, integration levels (more function) are increasing rapidly as is the requirement for high performance chips with large logic capacity and field programmability that are in-circuit programmable (in-place in the package without requiring sockets). Field programmable devices (FPDs) are also sometimes referred to as programmable logic devices (PLDs) and the terms FPD and PLD are used interchangeably throughout the application.","What is needed in logic design is fast time to market. Lower costs are also important hence more function in smaller chips. Higher performance and lower power are especially important in battery powered applications. Field programmable logic chips are required for fast time to market. What is needed are configurable (programmable) logic functions and efficient programmable wiring that can be configured (programmed) multiple times in chips mounted on a board. Programmable switches must be small in size and nonvolatile to enable efficient wiring architectures for implementing configurable (programmable) logic functions and be compatible with and easily integrated in CMOS technologies. Programmable switches must be easy to use and compatible with high performance applications. Programmable switches must enable fine-tuning of logic timing for optimum performance.","Overview of Field Programmable Devices","Block diagram  illustrated in  shows simple programmable logic devices (SPLDs) with a smaller number of equivalent logic gates with thousands or tens of thousands of equivalent logic gates; complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) that combine multiple SPLDs with programmable wiring (routing) for a higher number of equivalent logic gates such as tens to hundreds of thousands of equivalent logic gates; and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with a large number of equivalent logic gates in the range of millions to tens of million of equivalent logic gates for example and into the hundreds of millions of equivalent logic gates for denser scaled future FPGA chips. A brief discussion of field programmable devices is provided in the sections that follow.","Simple Programmable Logic Devices (SPLDs)","Programmable read-only memories (PROMs) were the first chips to enable user-programmability of the bits in an array. Such chips were used to store code for system startup (BIOS), algorithms, and other functions for example. Simple logic functions can also be performed using PROMs in which address lines can be used as logic circuit inputs and data lines as outputs. However, logic functions typically do not require many product terms but a PROM contains a full decoder for its address inputs. Thus, PROMs are an inefficient architecture for programmable logic function and are rarely used for this purpose and are therefore not included in block diagram .","The first SPLD device developed for implementing a field-programmable logic array (FPLA) or PLA for short consisted of two arrays for storing two levels of equivalent logic gates. A first AND array (or AND-plane) is structured such that any of the AND array inputs or complements of the inputs can be AND'ed together and each AND-array output corresponds to any product term of inputs to the AND array. These product term outputs of the AND array become inputs to a second OR array. OR array outputs can be configured to produce any logical sum of any of the product terms (AND-array outputs) and implements logic functions in sum-of-products form. The PLA architecture is far better for generating logic functions than a PROM because both the AND and OR array terms can have many inputs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","220","225","230","210","210","220","220","240","240","240","245","225","240","250","230","245","250"],"sub":["C ","C ","1","2","M ","1","2","N ","1","2","M ","1","2","N"]},"In operation, inputs  of PLA  result in logic outputs  based on the ON and OFF states of devices, such as EPROMs for example, located at the intersection of input lines such as A, B\u00b7C, . . . , Dand product term lines PT, PT, . . . , PTin electrically programmable AND array  and the intersection of PT, PT, . . . , PTand outputs O, O, . . . , Oin programmable OR array .

Mead and Lynn Conway, \u201cIntroduction to VLSI Systems,\u201d Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1980, pages 79-82.","PLAs such as PLA  described further above are the earliest examples of simple SPLDs introduced in the early 1970's. PLAs using mask programmable AND arrays, OR arrays, and feedback loops in a fabricator were successfully used by IBM in many applications for over a decade. However, for field programmable PLAs with two memory arrays (memory planes) requiring electrically programmable AND and OR arrays, field programmable PLAs were difficult to manufacture and introduced significant propagation delays. To address these problems, simpler programmable array logic (PAL) devices were developed which use a programmable AND array to realize product terms and then provide said product terms to fixed (non-programmable) OR-gates. To compensate for the loss of OR array flexibility, product variations were introduced with different number of inputs and outputs and various sizes of OR-gates. Field programmable PALs were widely used in digital hardware immediately after their introduction and form the basis for more recent and more sophisticated architectures. All small programmable logic devices (PLDs) such PLAs and PALs are grouped together and referred to as simple field programmable devices (SPDLs) and are typically low cost with high pin-to-pin speed performance as illustrated by block diagram  in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","320","325","310","310"]},"PAL  inputs A and B form column logic inputs A, A, B, and Bto programmable AND array , where Aindicates the complement of logic variable A and Bindicates the complement of logic variable B.

The difficulty of increasing capacity of a single SPLD architecture is that the array size of the programmable logic-arrays are driven to large dimensions as the number of inputs increase. Therefore as technologies are scaled to smaller dimensions and the number of transistors available on chips increases, it becomes more efficient to limit the size of SPLDs and to interconnect multiple SPLDs with a programmable global interconnect matrix.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","410","420","430","440","300","300","450"]},"In operation, all communication between SPLD  and all other SPLDs used to form CPLD  are routed to global interconnect matrix  using wire(s) - and received from global interconnect matrix  using wire(s) -.

Since all connections are routed through similar paths, time delays can be predicted which simplifies CPLD design. Buffer circuits (not shown) may be used as well.","Applications that can exploit wide AND\/OR gates and do not require a large number of flip flops are good candidates for mapping into CPLDs. Control functions such as graphics controllers and some communication circuit functions map well into CPLD architectures. In-system re-programmability and reasonably predictable speed performance are significant advantages offered by CPLDs.","Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Logic","FPGAs were invented by Ross Freeman, cofounder of the Xilinx Corporation, in 1984 to overcome the limitations of CPLDs. The primary differences between CPLDs and FPGAs are due to differences in chip architecture. As described further above, CPLD architecture consists primarily of programmable sum-of-products logic arrays with a relatively small number of clocked registers (D-flip flops for example) interconnected by a global interconnect matrix as illustrated further above by CPLD  shown in . CPLDs typically have relatively high logic-to-interconnect ratios. The result is less architectural flexibility and smaller logic functions (typically limited to tens to hundreds of thousands of equivalent logic gates) but more predictable timing delays and greater ease of programming.","FPGA architectures are dominated by interconnects. FPGAs are therefore much more flexible in terms of the range of designs that can be implemented and logic functions in the millions and tens of millions and eventually in the hundreds of millions of equivalent logic gates may be realized. In addition, the added flexibility enables inclusion of higher-level embedded functions such adders, multipliers, CPUs, and memory. The added interconnect (routing) flexibility of FPGAs also enables partial reconfiguration such that one portion of an FPGA chip may be reprogrammed while other portions are running. FPGAs that can be reprogrammed while running may enable reconfigurable computing (reconfigurable systems) that reconfigure chip architecture to better implement logic tasks. The FPGA's flexibility, ability to support a large number of equivalent logic gates, and ability to accommodate embedded memory and logic functions are displacing ASICs in many applications because of lower non-recurring engineering (NRE) design costs and faster time-to-market. FPGA architecture is shown in  alongside SPLD and CPLD as a stand-alone category of programmable logic device architecture.","FPGA architecture and circuit implementations are described in U.S. Pat. No. Re. 34,363 to Freeman, filed on Jun. 24, 1991, and SRAM memory controlled routing switch circuit implementations are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,670,749 to Freeman, filed on Apr. 13, 1984, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. FPGA  (as shown in ) schematically illustrates basic concepts taught by Freeman in the above referenced patents by Freeman.","Referring now to , FPGA  includes an array of configurable (programmable) logic blocks (CLBs) such as CLB  and programmable switch matrices (PSMs) such as PSM . Interconnections between CLBs and PSMs may be relatively short to provide local wiring (such as interconnect ) or relatively long to provide global wiring (not shown). A programmable switch (routing) matrix PSM interconnecting four CLB blocks CLB, CLB, CLB, and CLB is illustrated in . In this example, switch , one of the switches in PSM, may be used to interconnect CLB, CLB, CLB, and CLB in any combination.","CLBs are typically formed by combining look up tables (LUTs) with flip flops and multiplexers as illustrated schematically by CLB  in . Alternatively, CLBs may be formed by combining combinatorial logic with flip flops and multiplexers as illustrated by CLB  in .","Referring now to , CLB  comprises LUT  with inputs I, I, . . . , I. LUT  may be a random access memory (RAM) such as an SRAM, an EPROM, an EEPROM, or a flash memory. A typical LUT configuration may be a RAM organized in a 4\u00d74\u00d71 configuration with four inputs and one output. In this example, the LUT  output drives the input of clocked D-flip flop  which in turn drives an input of multiplexer (MUX) . The LUT  output may also drive an input of MUX  directly. MUX  drives (provides) CLB  output to terminal O.","Referring now to , CLB  includes configurable combinatorial logic function  with inputs I, I, . . . , I. Configurable combinatorial logic function  may be formed using cascaded transfer devices or random logic blocks such as NAND and NOR functions for example. Configurable combinatorial logic function  formed using NanoLogic\u2122 functions may also be used as described further below in . Typical configurable combinatorial logic function  may be formed using cascaded transfer devices and configuration control bits or random logic blocks and configuration control bits. In this example, the configurable combinatorial logic function  output drives the input of clocked D-flip flop  which in turn drives an input of MUX . The configurable combinatorial logic function  output may also drive an input of MUX  directly. MUX  drives (provides) CLB  output to terminal O.","The routing flexibility of FPGAs enables a wide variety of functions to be realized.  illustrates FPGA  and shows an example of a static ram (SRAM) controlled routing of signals between various CLBs enabling an in-circuit programmable logic function. CLB  includes an AND gate with inputs Iand Iand an output Owhich is provided to PSM  which includes FET  whose ON or OFF states are controlled by SRAM .

Output Oof MUX  is connected to wire  which is connected to an input of an AND gate in CLB  providing an output O. A global wire  is shown which is not part of local wiring.","In operation, output Ois applied to terminal  of FET  with the logic state (high or low voltage) of gate terminal  controlled by SRAM . If FET  is OFF, low gate voltage in this example, then Odoes not propagate along wire . If however, FET  is ON, high gate voltage (typically 2.5 volts) in this example, then Opropagates through the channel region of FET  to terminal , and then along wire  to terminal  of FET  which is also controlled by SRAM . If FET  is in an OFF state, then Odoes not propagate to terminal . However, if FET  is in an ON state, then Opropagates along wire  to an input terminal of MUX . If MUX  is enabled by SRAM , then MUX output Ois applied to an input terminal of the AND gate in CLB  by wire . The AND gate output Ois also the output of CLB .","The use of SRAMs to control wiring in FPGAs as illustrated above with respect to  and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,670,749 has the advantage of compatibility with leading edge CMOS logic processes, is reprogrammable, and supports in-circuit programmability. However, it is the largest area element having 5 to 6 transistors per cell, requires external loading of bits to define the logic function. Further, in such SRAM based designs the FPGA is nonfunctional until loading is complete, is volatile, and has relatively low radiation tolerance. In addition, the large SRAM cell size also requires a large number of wiring layers and impacts architecture because the size of the switch is a key factor in determining FPGA architecture.","A very small switch such as a cross point antifuse may also be used for wiring. Such a small switch results in a different architecture and can reduce chip size by approximately 10\u00d7 relative to an SRAM-based FPGA implementation. A cross point antifuse is nonvolatile, has very low capacitance (1 fF per node for example), is radiation hard, and does not require external loading of bits to operate. However, programming such antifuse based FPGA devices (such as is depicted in ) requires relatively high voltages such as 5 to 10 volts to ensure breakdown and currents in the 5 to 10 mA range. Further such devices are one-time-programmable (OTP) and are difficult to in-circuit program.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","910","920","930","940","950","900","900"]},"In operation, high voltages typically in the 5-10 volt range with high currents in the milliampere range are used to program (change) the cross point antifuses from an OFF-to-ON state. Then the logic function can be tested. A new chip is required for each logic function and OTP in-circuit programming is difficult. A socket approach can facilitate programming of FPGA .","A nonvolatile nanotube programmable devices and the nonvolatile nanotube field programmable gate array (NFPGA) is provided.","Under certain embodiments, one or more nonvolatile nanotube (NV NT) select circuits are used to store (in a first operation) and later provide (in a second operation) one or more control bits to a conventional configurable logic block (CLB) circuit.

In some cases, more that one switch type may be used.","SRAMs used to control switches have the advantage of CMOS technology compatibility with the latest CMOS technology generation and compatibility with the standard (std.) technology operating voltages because no programming is required. However, very large switch area and volatile operation are disadvantages as well as high sensitivity to radiation and designs that can easily be copied. Antifuses have the advantage of small area size but are not reprogrammable because antifuses are OTP so the chip architecture cannot be modified once it is programmed. Antifuses typically require 5-10 volts and relatively high current in the 1-10 milliampere range. Antifuses have relatively high radiation tolerances and designs cannot easily be copied because \u201creverse engineering\u201d is difficult. EPROMs with UV erase are typically limited to development prototypes. EEPROMs can be reprogrammed in-circuit but are larger than antifuses and require high programming voltage and require higher than standard operating voltages. Flash has high programming voltages but standard operating voltages. Flash devices are small in size but larger than antifuses and may be more sensitive to radiation than antifuses.","Nonvolatile nanotube (NV NT) switches such as those described in U.S. patent application Ser.

Such applications include intelligence functions, military applications, industrial secrets, and others. However, there are situations in which a logic application function can be determined based on hardware implementations such as in integrated circuit chips for example in which such chips may be stolen or fall into unfriendly territory. In cases where hard wire connections are permanent, hard wires can be traced and the logic function can be identified. Alternatively, in some cases, chips may be interrogated electronically by a security breach in an internet connection. What is needed are effective countermeasures that provide high application function security.","A logic application function can be identified based on the logic blocks used and wiring interconnections between the logic blocks. A logic application function may be secured by reprogramming one or more programmable wiring interconnections between individual wires and logic (or logic and memory) blocks if a security event (breach) is detected. In another approach, a logic application function may be secured by reprogramming one or more programmable logic blocks if a security event is detected. In still another approach, a logic application function may be secured by both reprogramming one or more programmable wiring interconnections and further reprogramming one or more programmable logic blocks if a security event is detected. These and other similar electronic countermeasure approaches to logic application function security require dense nonvolatile switches that can be programmed multiple times and changed in case of a security event.","In certain situations, a security event may be detected and sufficient time exists to deploy electronic countermeasures such as the reprogramming of integrated circuit chips. If a security event is detected, the logic application functions may be changed by altering programmable wiring connections, altering programmable logic blocks, or altering both wiring connections and logic blocks as described further above. However, this requires dense nonvolatile switches such as nonvolatile nanotube cross point switches (, E, F, and G) and other nonvolatile nanotube switch types such as the NV NT switch illustrated in  that can be programmed multiple times. One-time-programmable (OTP) antifuses, or any kind of OTP switch, cannot be used because OTP switches cannot be reprogrammed. Additional examples of nonvolatile nanotube-based switches are illustrated further below with respect to  for example, and various FPGA logic examples also illustrated further below. In case of a security event, logic application functions may be altered in many ways, such as, but not limited to, reprogramming said logic application functions in a random manner or setting a plurality of programmable interconnections to an open state. Alternatively, the logic application function may be altered such that a different logic application function is formed to deliberately mislead.","In other situations, a security event may take place which is undetected or in which there is insufficient time to deploy electronic countermeasures. For example, an integrated circuit chip that includes high application function security logic may be stolen. In this situation, chip designs that make the application of advanced reverse engineering (failure analysis) techniques difficult may be used to protect high application function security chips. For example, a high application security function may include extra circuits, devices, and interconnections for the purpose of complicating reverse engineering of integrated circuit chips. For hard-wired logic functions, interconnections and contact regions may be traced (that is, interconnections between circuit elements detected using electronic equipment such as scanning electron microscopes) at high magnification to identify logic functions. If antifuses are used instead of contacts, it is difficult to tell whether an antifuse has been activated (is conductive) and forms a contact or if the antifuse is nonactivated (nonconducting) by examining the chip regions under high magnification. However, since cross sectional techniques to determine oxide integrity are well known in the industry, the logic function may be reverse engineered using known failure analysis techniques to see if an antifuse oxide has been ruptured and is in a conductive state or if the oxide is intact and the antifuse is in a noncontactive state.","Cross point switches using patterned nanofabric, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/280,786, filed on Nov. 15, 2005, entitled \u201cTwo-Terminal Nanotube Devices and Systems and Methods of Making,\u201d to form nonvolatile nanotube switches such as illustrated in  are nearly impossible to reverse engineer. Typically, the patterned nanofabric cross point switch area (or volume) is about 90% void or filled with non-carbon nanotube material. Cross sectioning such a cross point switch tends to destroy it completely. Even if the switch is not destroyed completely, it is likely to be damaged so that the state of the switch (low or high resistance) cannot be reliably determined.","Another approach to nanotube-based security is to leverage the difficulty of reverse engineering cross point switches using patterned nanofabric (as described further above) and to include patterned nanofabric contacts in logic as part of logic wiring (interconnects) that are very difficult to reverse engineer. This is possible because such patterned nanofabric contacts are (or can be made) normally as conducting nonvolatile nanotube crosspoint switches as-fabricated. Keeping the logic operating voltages below the switching voltage of the nonvolatile nanotube cross point switches enables the patterned nanofabric to act as a patterned nonfabric contact. The switching voltage of nonvolatile nanotube cross point switches may be increased to well above that the logic voltage swings as needed as to ensure that patterned nanofabric contacts remain conductive, as described in U.S. Pat.

In the operation descriptions that follow, the configuration-setting operation examples are based on erasing all NV NT switches to a high resistance (OFF) state and then selectively programming selected NV NT switches to a low resistance (ON) state.","In this configurable logic configuration-setting operation example, NCLB  NT SEL circuit is programmed such that select node  is at a high voltage enabling logic function (A\u00b7B)output to wire  and NPSM - NT SEL circuit is programmed such that select node  is at a high voltage which turns FET  to an ON state so that the wire  signal is transmitted to wire .","In an erase operation (low-to-high resistance state transition), X, X, X-X control lines are set to zero volts and mode select lines Y, Y, and Y are set to a high voltage such as 2.5 volts to connect all select nodes, including select nodes  and  to ground.

In this example, NT SEL  select node  is to be in a high voltage state during NFPGA  logic operation. NT SEL operation corresponds to NV NT select circuit  operation and corresponding NV NT switch  and  states are set based on NFPGA  operational requirements. Therefore, NV NT switch  () is programmed to a low resistance state and NV NT switch  is left in a high resistance state. However, if select node  were to have a low voltage state during logic operation then NV NT switch  would be left in a high resistance state and NV NT switch  would be programmed to a low resistance state.","In a programming operation for NT SEL, mode line Y is set at a high voltage such as 2.5 volts such that select node  is grounded by an FET corresponding to FET  () prior to applying programming pulses V.

CMOS circuits with threshold voltages of 0.7 volts, for example, in the range of 1 to 3.5 volts for example but at varying speeds and power dissipation. If the operating voltage is low, approaching 1 volt for example, then CMOS circuits will operate more slowly due to reduced overdrive but also will dissipate less power. However, CMOS circuits will operate at high speed if the circuit is operated at a higher voltage such as 3.5 volts for example. Switching CMOS circuits dissipate power proportional to f\u00b7C\u00b7V, where f is the frequency of operation, C is the capacitive load, typically primarily due to wiring capacitance, and the square of the rail-to-rail voltage swing V.","Controller  is described above with respect to control of voltages V-V applied to NT_E-BiDi Buffer  to modify the amplitude and polarity of pulses between input and output of NT-E-BiDi Buffer .

In this case, pulse timing (delay) NT_E-BiDi buffer  circuit may be monitored by sensing for the presence or absence of an output pulse in a valid data window defined by a strobe pulse. Voltages are adjusted by NT_V-GEN , under the control of controller , until the output pulse is detected by a comparator circuit (not shown) and a signal is sent to controller . Reference voltage generator , based on inputs from controller  or another signal source, incrementally changes the ratio of the resistance values of Nanristors  and  in NT_R-GEN  (as described further above) until the output voltage of NT_V-GEN  circuit (or circuits since there may be more than one used) results in the desired timing speed (delay). At this point Nanristor  and  nonvolatile resistance values are left unchanged. As a consequence of this method of continuous speed (delay) adjustment, the amplitude of the signal output may be different to that of the signal input. The amplitude may be restored to a full rail-to-rail swing of, for example, 3.5 volts may be restored by sending the signal through one or more inverter stages (not shown).

FPGAs are therefore much more flexible in terms of the range of designs that can be implemented and logic functions in the hundreds of thousands to millions and tens-of-millions of equivalent logic gates may be realized. In addition, the added flexibility enables inclusion of higher-level embedded functions such adders, multipliers, CPUs, and memory. The added interconnect (routing) flexibility of FPGAs also enables partial reconfiguration such that one portion of an FPGA chip may be reprogrammed while other portions are running. FPGAs that can be reprogrammed while running may enable reconfigurable computing (reconfigurable systems) that reconfigure chip architecture to better implement logic tasks. The idea of reconfigurable computing is not new; however, implementation is limited by hardware capability and architecture and software. NRAM\u2122s combined with FET switches and logic circuits to form NFPGAs enable the hardware portion of reconfigurable computing by providing nonvolatile configuration control bits (also referred to as nonvolatile configurable control logic states) that can change logic functions and signal routing in real time during chip operation and maintain such configurations in the absence of power as needed resulting in nonvolatile globally adaptive and reconfigurable capabilities in real time. Reconfigurable computing concepts are described by G. G. Yen, \u201cAutonomous Neural Control in Flexible Space Structures,\u201d Chapter 93, pp. 1199-1202 in \u201cThe Industrial Electronics Handbook\u201d edited by J. David Irwin, CRC Press LLC, 1997.","Reconfigurable computing involves both spatial and temporal partitions. NRAM\u2122  as described further above with respect to  is designed to store K programmed combinations of configurable control bits (configurable control logic states) that can be read out at speeds as fast as 150 ps corresponding to 6.7 GHz for a 90 nm technology node for example so NRAM\u2122  may be used to reconfigure programmable logic blocks and programmable switch matrices in real time providing both spatial and temporal partitions. In this example, NRAM\u2122  enables the nonvolatile nanotube configurable logic block (NCLB)  to be changed in as little time as one clock cycle (in pipeline mode) to support up to K logic configurations preprogrammed into NRAM\u2122 . Also, NRAM\u2122  enables the nonvolatile nanotube programmable switch matrix (NPSM)  to be reconfigured in as little time as one clock cycle (in pipeline mode) thereby rerouting signals in real time each cycle if needed. Nanotube bidirectional buffers described further above with respect to  may also use NRAM\u2122 configuration control bits (not shown) to redirect signal flow and change signal polarity, for example, in one cycle if needed. Hence, nonvolatile nanotube field programmable gate array (NFPGA)  which is formed using various interconnected NCLBs and NPSMs may be configured spatially and temporally within one clock cycle when in a pipeline mode and over several cycles in non-pipelined operating mode.","Typically in reconfigurable computing, the number of spatial and temporal changes needed is relatively small. Reprogramming NRAM\u2122s may only be needed less than a few thousand times for example. In some cases, small NRAM\u2122 memories are all that is needed so a small number of configuration control bits may be preprogrammed. In the case of NCLB , K=8 (eight word lines) can accommodate the various configurations illustrated in corresponding . For NPSM  various combinations of independent and shared routing configurations can be programmed as illustrated further above with respect to . If some NFPGA functions are not needed for certain computations for example, then power may be removed from these nonvolatile functions thereby eliminating standby power. Other NFPGA functions, embedded CPUs, memories, etc. May leverage these power savings by running faster at higher levels of power.","Embedded NRAM\u2122 memories may be combined with FPGAs, CPUs and other functions. In applications requiring fast cache operation, read and write times are essentially the same and may require cycle times of 150 ps to support a 6.7 GHz clock rate for example. It may also be desirable to modify logic function and signal routing in one clock cycle without using preprogrammed functions that may not cover all configuration control bit requirements. In present generation NRAM\u2122s write (erase\/program) operations are significantly slower than read operations. Hence, nanotube-based SRAM nonvolatile memories (NSRAMs) may be desirable because high speed SRAM operation at read and write cycle times of 150 ps (90 nm technology node) is enabled which supports a clock cycle of 6.7 GHz with the ability to save SRAM states in a nonvolatile mode using nanotube-based nonvolatile switches as needed.","U.S. Pat.

A second terminal of FET T is connected to a reference such as ground (zero volts) and mode select line Vis connected to the gate of FET T and controls the ON\/OFF state of FET T. A second terminal of NV NT switch SW is connected to erase\/program\/read select line V.","An NSRAM memory (not shown) is formed in a conventional manner by a combination of rows and columns of NSRAM cells  interconnected by shared approximately orthogonal word and bit lines. In operation, mode select line Vis held at a low voltage such as ground and FET T and FET T are in an OFF state and shadow devices pairs formed by NRAM\u2122 cell  and  are decoupled from flip flop . Typically mode select line Vis also held at ground turning FETs T and T OFF and program\/erase\/read line VEPR is at a low voltage such as ground. SRAM cells such as cell  operate in a volatile mode with memory cycle times as fast as 150 ps for a CMOS technology at a 90 nm node. If SRAM power is to be removed or if power is about to be lost, then a store operation is performed in which FETs T and T are turned ON and the logic state of flip flop  is transferred and stored in NRAM\u2122 cell  on NV NT switch (NV NT block) SW and a complementary state is stored in NRAM\u2122 cell  on NV NT switch (NV NT block) SW. Power may then be removed. The stored logic state may be recalled (restored) during power up in the following way. Vmay be held at ground or may be ramped to a voltage such as V; SRAM cell  voltage source is ramped to V. Flip flop  assumes a state corresponding to the true and complement logic states stored in NRAM\u2122 cells  and  and the logic state of SRAM cell  prior to power shutdown is restored and SRAM memory operation resumes. Store and recall (restore) operations are described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,245,520.","The integration of nanotube-based logic and memory functions as described further above results in what may be referred to as instant-OFF and instant-ON operations. The store operation that precedes power shut down may be performed in microseconds or milliseconds, for example, resulting in what may be referred to as an instant-OFF operation in which logic states and operating data are preserved in by nonvolatile nanotube switches or blocks. The recall (restore) operation may be performed as part of a power-ON operation typically requiring microseconds or milliseconds, for example. Since logic states and data are restored within a power-ON time interval and operational with the system initialized to pre-power-OFF logic states and data, such recall (restore) operations may be referred to as instant-ON.","An erase operation may be performed just prior to a store operation or at any time when FETs T and T are in an OFF state. During an erase operation, mode select line Vis set at a high voltage such as 2.5 volts for example and FETs T and T are turned on grounding nodes N and N, respectively. Then, Vapplies one or more erase pulses with an amplitude in the range of 5 to 7 volts and rise times in the nanosecond range for example to a second terminal of NV NT switches SW and SW and switches SW and SW are switched to high resistance states such as 1 G Ohm or higher.","A program operation may be used store the logic content of flip flop  on switches SW and SW in a nonvolatile mode prior to the removal of power. FETs T and T are in an OFF state and NRAM\u2122 cell  select FET T and NRAM\u2122 cell  select FET T are activated to an ON state. In this example, NV NT switches SW and SW are in a high resistance (OFF) state. Then, Vapplies one or more program pulses with an amplitude in the range of 3 to 5 volts and rise times in the microsecond range for example to a second terminal of NV NT switches SW and SW. If flip flop  node N is at a low voltage and node N is at a high voltage, then SW is programmed to a low resistance value such as 100 k Ohms for example and SW remains in a high resistance state such as 1 G Ohm. However, if flip flop  node N is at a high voltage and node N is at a low voltage, then SW is programmed remains at a resistance state such as 1 G Ohms for example and SW switches to a low resistance state such as 1 k Ohm.","In a program operation to store the state of flip flop , flip flops in some (or all) rows may transfer logic states to corresponding nonvolatile NRAM\u2122 cells. However, program pulses may disturb some flip flops during the store operation. In order to minimize the risk of disturbing the state of flip flop , transfer may be carried out one word line at a time for a word line within a subset of word lines corresponding to a subset of latches. In this case, the logic state of flip flop  is read out and bit line BL and BL are held at true and complement high\/low or low\/high values by corresponding sense amplifier\/latches for each bit line pair such as bit lines BL and BL. Select transistors FETs T and T are in an ON state, bit line BL connected to node N holds node N at a low (or high) voltage and bit line BL connected to node N holds node N at a high (or low) voltage. In this way, program currents flow to bit lines BL or BL (whichever is at a low voltage) without disturbing the state of flip flop . For unselected rows, select transistors corresponding to select transistor FETs T and T are in an OFF state so that corresponding flip flops are not disturbed.","In addition to fast programmable logic reconfiguration, NSRAMs may also be used to form high speed embedded nonvolatile caches used in conjunction with NFPGAs, CPUs, ASICs, analog, and other functions all integrated on the same chip.","Nanotube Configurable Logic Blocks (NCLB) & Nanotube Programmable Switch Matrix (NPSM) using Nonvolatile NS\/R-Controlled Select Circuit to form Nonvolatile Nanotube Configuration Control Register (NCCR)","Various nonvolatile nanotube configuration control registers (NCCRs) are combined with CLB and PSM functions to form NCLB and NPSM building blocks that may be integrated to form NFPGA logic as described with respect to  illustrated further below.

This is because the number of shift register stages and therefore the number of configuration control bits may be increased to any size while keeping the number of inputs the same. In the case of NRAM\u2122s for example, as array size increases to provide more configuration control bits, decoder size increases requiring a larger number of inputs such as inputs illustrated in . Configuration control registers may also be used instead of nonvolatile nanotube select circuits illustrated in  for example. Configuration control registers formed using typical shift register (S\/R) stages are volatile in operation; that is the logic states of the shift register stages are lost when power is lost or removed. In order to replace nonvolatile NRAM\u2122s and nonvolatile nanotube select circuits described further above in various NFPGA architectures, configuration control registers need to be nonvolatile as well.

In this example, NV NT switches such as NV NT switch - are assumed to be ON as fabricated. So first, an erase operation is performed on NV NT switches such as NV NT switch - resulting in a transition from an ON low resistance state such as 100 k Ohms for example to an OFF high resistance state of 1 G Ohm or higher. In an erase operation, the HOLD voltage is set to a low voltage such as ground and \u03a8 and \u03a8 voltages are set to a high voltage such as 2.5 volts for example. With LOGIC INPUT held at a high voltage such as 2.5 volts Q is held at 2.5 volts and turns erase\/program FET  ON. ERASE\/PROGRAM voltage is set to a high voltage such as 2.5 volts for example and erase\/program FET  is turned ON establishing a conductive path between NV NT switch terminal T and ground. RESTORE voltage is held at a low voltage such as ground so that restore FET  is OFF. Then, VE\/P\/R provides erase pulses to node T of NV NT switch -. One or more pulses with voltages in the 5 to 7 volt range and rise times in the nanosecond range may be used for example. NV NT switch - transitions from an ON state to an OFF state (low to high resistance state). Corresponding NV NT switch - also transitions to an OFF state as illustrated by nonvolatile nanotube configuration control register (NCCR) \u2032 in .","Alternatively, another FET (not shown) may have a first terminal connected to node N, a second terminal connected to a voltage source which may be pulsed or may be at ground, and a gate controlled by a second erase\/program line. In this way, an erase operation for example, may be performed independently of CELL--. Various coupling circuit examples are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,394,687 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/165,007, filed on Jun. 30, 2008, entitled \u201cNon-Volatile Shadow Latch Using a Nanotube Switch.\u201d","NCCR \u2032 is the same circuit as NCCR  except that NV NT switches - and - are in OFF or high resistance states. CELL-- and CELL-- and other stages (not shown) may operate in a volatile mode whenever coupling circuits - and - decouple corresponding NV NT switches - and - from CELL- - and CELL--, respectively, regardless of the low or high resistance states of NV NT switches. Coupling circuit -, which is the same as coupling circuit -, maintains an OFF state by keeping restore FET  and erase\/program FET  each in an OFF state with low RESTORE and ERASE\/PROGRAM voltages, respectively. Nonvolatile nanotube configuration control registers are operated in a volatile mode with high voltages such as 2.5 volts supplied to inverters INV- and INV-\u2032 for example.","In a store (save) operation, NV NT switches are programmed from a high resistance state to a low resistance state or left in a high resistance state. With restore FET  in an OFF state, erase\/program FET  is turned ON. If FET  is an ON state because Q is at a high voltage such 2.5 volts, then a continuous path exists between NV NT switch - terminal T and ground. If one or more programming pulses VE\/P\/R of 3-5 volts and microsecond rise times are applied to terminal T of NV NT switch -, then NV NT switch - transitions from a high resistance state such as 1 G Ohm to a low resistance state such as 100 k Ohms for example. However, if FET  is OFF because Q is at a low voltage such as ground, then there is no path between NV NT - terminal T and ground and NV NT switch - remains in a high resistance state. After the state of NV NT switch - and other NV NT switches such as NV NT switch - have been programmed, then power may be removed and the logic state of CELL-- and CELL-- are preserved in a nonvolatile mode as corresponding high or low resistance states. In this example, nonvolatile nanotube configuration control register \u2033 shows NV NT switch - in a high resistance state and NV NT switch - programmed to a low resistance state as illustrated in . Note that NCCR , NCCR \u2032, and NCCR \u2033 all correspond to the same circuit with NV NT switches in various combinations of low (ON) and high (OFF) resistance states.","In a recall (restore) operation, erase\/program FET  is held in OFF state. A voltage is applied to CELL-- (typically, a voltage source is ramped to 2.5 volts for example). With HOLD, \u03a8, and \u03a8 at high voltages such as 2.5 volts and a LOGIC INPUT of zero volts, node N is held at ground by output Q of INV-. Then \u03a8 voltage transitions to a low voltage state and decouples all individual register stages such as CELL-- from one another and voltage. With VE\/P\/R having transitioned to a recall (restore) voltage value applied to wire  and to node T, restore FET  is turned ON and a conductive path is established between NV NT switch - terminal T and CELL - node N. If NV NT switch - is in a low resistance (ON) state, then node N is forced to a high voltage state such as 2.5 volts as does the output Q of INV-. However, if NV NT switch - is in a high resistance (OFF) state, then N remains at a low voltage. Restore FET  is turned OFF and the recall (restore) operation is finished. U.S. Pat.

The capacitively coupled gate cannot change the state of a three-terminal NV NT switch in a SET state. Therefore, a RESET operation requires current flowing through the nanotube fabric.

NPAL  uses a configuration controller  with input INP to activate an NPAL logic mode of operation after programmable\/reprogrammable AND array  bits have been programmed or to activate a memory mode used to program or reprogram cells (as is done in an NRAM\u00ae) to implement new logic functions. Horizontal array lines each form a single product term such as PT when NPAL  operates in a NanoLogic\u00ae mode or a bit line such as BL when operating in a memory mode. Vertical array lines may form a single logic input in a logic mode such as input logic IL or form a word line such as word line WL when operating in a memory mode. Logic or memory modes of operation are controlled by configuration controller  by providing a low voltage (near ground) mode select signal  for NPAL NanoLogic\u00ae operation or by providing a high voltage (at or near V) for memory program (SET) or erase (RESET) operations.","In a NanoLogic\u00ae operating mode, NPAL  logic input circuits  drive vertical array lines corresponding to logic variables A, A\u2032, B, and B\u2032, while feedback lines  and  provide logic output O that provides logic variable C and logic output Othat provides logic variable D, respectively, as inputs. True and complement logic variables may be represented as A, Aor A\u2032; B, Bor B\u2032; C, and Cor C\u2032, and D, and Dor D\u2032 with the notations used interchangeably. The combination of logic input circuits  and logic outputs O and O drive gates of cell select FET devices as shown in . NPAL NanoLogic\u00ae operating voltage swings are kept below switching voltage level, less than or equal to 2 volts for example, with switching voltages typically 3 volts or higher. The drains of cell select FETs are connected to horizontal array lines corresponding to product terms such as PT, PT, PT, and PT. In a NanoLogic\u00ae operating mode, each of the product terms is connected to a pull up PFET device connected to a power supply voltage V. Product term lines such as PT is in a high voltage state prior to the activation of input logic signals. In this example, PT remains in a high voltage state for any combination of inputs A, A\u2032, B, B\u2032, C, C\u2032, D, and D\u2032 because all NV NT block switches, such as NV NT block  switches are in OFF state so no currents flows even if cell select FETs are turned ON.","In the case of product term PT, the PT voltage level is V prior to input logic activation. However, if the select FET of NV NT block  receives a high voltage such as 2 volts, for example from logic input B\u2032 (B), then current flows through the corresponding cell and the corresponding pull up PFET and PT voltage drops to a low voltage. However, if logic input B\u2032 is at a low voltage such as ground, the corresponding cell select FET remains OFF, no current flows, and product term PT remains at voltage V. Product term PT high or low voltage value depends on the state of the NV NT block switch at the intersection of PT and logic input C and corresponds to the behavior of PT as described further above.","Product term PT may be activated depending on the state of two NV NT block switches and corresponding logic input levels. Product term PT is also at voltage V prior to logic input circuit . In the case of product term PT, NV NT block switches at two cell locations, a first cell at the intersection of PT and B\u2032 and a second cell at the intersection of PT and D\u2032. If either the first cell is selected or the second cell is selected, PT transitions from voltage V to a low voltage such as a reference voltage at or near ground; of course, if both the first and second cells are selected PT is also at a low voltage near ground.","Each of the product terms PT, PT, PT, and PT in programmable AND array  carries the NOR combination of all input signals that lead to the select gates of the transistors (FETs) connected to it and the ON or OFF states of the corresponding NV NT block switches in series.

Product terms PT and PT pass through mode select FETs and form inputs to two-terminal OR circuit  whose output drives D-flip flop . The output of D-flip flop  is logic output O. Logic outputs O and O are fed back as logic inputs to programmable\/reprogrammable AND array  as described further above.","When configuring or reconfiguring the cells in programmable\/reprogrammable AND array , configuration controller  mode select  output transitions to a high voltage (Vfor example) and turns OFF corresponding FETs that enable\/disable product terms PT and PT to the inputs of two terminal OR gate  and product terms PT and PT to the inputs of two terminal OR gate .

Input Z to NOR gate  is controlled by the output of nonvolatile nanotube select circuit  such as described further above with respect to . Switching voltages applied to terminals T and T and a mode control voltage applied to the gate of the FET control the resistance values of NV NT switches SW and SW, respectively. When in a logic operating mode, the ratio of the resistance values SW and SW determine whether the input Z is a high or a low value. As illustrated in , if Z is set to a nonvolatile high voltage H, the NOR gate  output C is at a low voltage L regardless of the high or low state of inputs X and Y. As long as input Z remains at a high voltage state forcing output C to a low voltage, none of the corresponding programmable\/reprogrammable AND array  logic array cells connected to input logic (input line), such as input logic (input line) IL shown in , can conduct current regardless of the state of the NV NT switches and regardless of the high or low values of logic inputs X and Y (inputs X and Y become \u201cdon't care\u201d values). However, if input Z is set to a nonvolatile low voltage value L, then output C connected to IL equals (X+Y)\u2032 and IL may be in a high or low voltage state as a function of inputs X and Y.

Logic or memory modes of operation may be controlled by configuration controller  with input INP by providing a low voltage (near ground) mode select signal  for NPLA NanoLogic\u00ae operation or by providing a high voltage (at or near V) for memory switching operations. However, while a memory mode may be useful when switching NPLA  NV NT switches, that is performing a programming (SET) operation or an erase (RESET) operation on programmable\/reprogrammable AND arrays or OR arrays to modify the NPLA  NanoLogic\u00ae function, NPLA  switching operations do not require the addition of memory functions as described further below.","In a NanoLogic\u00ae operating mode, NPLA  logic input circuits  drive horizontal array lines corresponding to logic variables A, A\u2032, B, B\u2032, C, and C\u2032.

In a NanoLogic\u00ae operating mode, each of the product terms is connected to a pull up PFET device connected to a power supply voltage V. Product term lines such as PT may be in high voltage state prior to the activation of input logic signals. In this example, PT and PT transition to a low voltage if the output A of logic input circuit  is at a high voltage because cells at the intersection of array lines IL and PT and IL and PT, respectively, are both in low resistance (ON) states.","In a NanoLogic\u00ae operating mode, the high or low voltage level of NPLA  logic product terms PT, PT, PT, and PT are determined by the low (ON) or high (OFF) resistance states of NV NT block switches and the logic states of logic input circuits  of programmable\/reprogrammable array . Product terms PT-PT act as vertical inputs to gates of select FETs of cells in programmable\/reprogrammable OR array . The drains of select FETs in programmable\/reprogrammable OR array  are connected to horizontal array lines corresponding to sum terms ST, ST, ST, and ST. Sum terms such as ST may be in at high or low voltage for example. For ST, the NV NT block switch at the intersection of PT and ST is the only switch in a low resistance ON state. If PT is at a low voltage, then ST is at a high voltage because pull up PFET connected to voltage V holds ST at voltage V. Other cells along sum term ST at the intersection of ST and PT, PT, and PT in programmable\/reprogrammable OR array  are all in a high resistance (OFF) state and no current may flow whether PT, PT, and PT are at high or low voltage values. However, because the cell at the intersection of ST and PT has a NV NT switch in a low resistance (ON) state, ST change to a low voltage value if PT is a high voltage. In a NanoLogic\u00ae operating mode, PFET pull up devices and NFET transfer devices corresponding to logic input circuits  and output circuits  are ON; all other NFET devices are OFF. The ON and OFF states of PFET and NFET devices are determined by mode select signal  which is held at low voltage by configuration controller  during NanoLogic\u00ae operation. Configuration controller  may be a volatile circuit. Alternatively, configuration controller  may include nonvolatile circuits such as illustrated by various nonvolatile circuit configurations described further above with respect to , for example, such that configuration controller  configures NPLA  in a NanoLogic\u00ae operating mode when voltage (power) is activated. Note that NPLA  may be in OFF state when not required in order to save power. During power-up, NPLA  NanoLogic\u00ae returns to the same NPLA  NanoLogic\u00ae function as used prior to power shut-down.","Nonvolatile NanoLogic\u00ae functions such as NV NT select circuit-based logic described further above with respect to  and NPAL and NPLA logic described further above with respect to , respectively, result in overall low operating power because nonvolatile NanoLogic\u00ae functions can be turned OFF when not in use. This is because unused logic functions can be quickly powered-down to zero power and near-instantly powered-up to full power without loss of logic function in what may be referred to as NanoPower Management enabled by nonvolatile NanoLogic\u00ae functions.","Sum terms ST . . . ST drive output circuits  which generate outputs O, O, O, and O respectively. Output circuits  may be latches, other logic functions, etc. Some of the outputs O . . . O may be fed back as an input to logic input circuits  (not shown in ) as shown in the NPAL  example illustrated in .","Table  illustrated in  illustrates outputs as a function of inputs for NPLA  programmed as shown in  with simple logic variables A, B, C and their complements applied to input lines IL . . . IL. In this example, we assume output circuits  are simple inverter drivers such that outputs O, O, O, and O correspond to the complement of sum terms ST, ST, ST, and ST respectively. Each product term output running vertically carries the NOR combination of all input signals that lead to gates of transistors with corresponding drains attached to it. For example, PT has cells with three NV NT switches in a low resistance (ON) state in programmable\/reprogrammable AND array  with one select FET gate connected to logic function A, a second select FET gate connected to logic function B, and a third select FET gate connected to logic function C\u2032. Therefore, product term PT=(A+B+C\u2032)\u2032=A\u2032B\u2032C which corresponds to the NOR of A,B,C\u2032, that is, PT=NOR(A,B,C\u2032) as illustrated in table . By the same reasoning, PT=NOR(A,B\u2032,C)=(A+B\u2032+C)\u2032=A\u2032BC\u2032.","The programmable\/reprogrammable OR array  is the same kind of nonvolatile nanotube-based array as programmable\/reprogrammable AND array  except that OR array  is rotated by 90 degrees. As in the case of AND array , each of the sum term outputs is the NOR of the product terms signals connected to the select gates of all transistors with corresponding select FET drains attached to it. For example, sum term ST has two cells with NV NT switches in a low resistance (ON) state. ST=NOR(PT, PT)=(A\u2032BC\u2032+A\u2032B\u2032C)\u2032.

Buffer  also drives at least one input of processor . An output  of processor  is connected to a second input of comparator  by connection . A timing-critical path through processor  is selected to provide a representative delay time between inputs and outputs of processor . Comparator  compares pulses from output  of precision timing function  and output  of processor  and provides a difference voltage \u0394V on output  which is fed as an input to voltage regulator .

While in this example processor output  is provided to comparator  by connection , connection  may instead be used to provide a representative delay signal that is independent of a processor  output such as output . Processor  output  may include multiple output lines (not shown).","In operation, the performance (speed) and power dissipation of processor  may be controlled by the voltage Vsupplied by voltage regulator  output . CMOS circuit voltage swings are rail-to-rail, that is, between an applied voltage such as Vand ground. The voltage range Vmay vary over a wide range from V=Vto lower voltages that are just above the threshold voltages of the NFET and PFET devices in CMOS circuits. Operating speed and power dissipation are a function of applied voltage so power supply (power source) V=Vresults in the highest performance but also the highest power dissipation. Vmay be varied from 2.5 volts to 0.5 volts for example. Dynamic power dissipation Pis proportional to the capacitance being switched times the square of the applied voltage V times the clock frequency f (P\u02dcCVf) as described in the reference R. J.

As explained in the Bakoglu reference, the time elapsed for an RC network between the time an input waveform reaches 10% of its value to the time the corresponding output value reaches 90% of its output value is 0.9RC which is the delay metric used in this example. However, other metrics such as the time delay between the 0 to 50% points of input and output waveforms may also be used. By way of example, assume Ris programmed to a value of 50 k\u03a9 for example and that C=2 fF. Then RC=100 ps and 0.9RC=90 ps. Next assume that the critical delay 0.9RC=90 ps programmed for precision timing function  is equal to two waveform cycles (such as clock cycles for example) of processor  shown in . Then each waveform cycle has a periodicity of  ps and the corresponding waveform frequency (such as a clock frequency for example) is 22.2 GHz. If Ris reduced to a value of 20 k\u03a9 for example, then the corresponding waveform frequency is 55.5 GHz.

Z\u2032 may have a different value or the same value as Z. Memory subsystem  has an input characteristic impedance Z<<Zto minimize reflections at input . However, the input circuit at input  may be designed to receive a reduced signal level and still trigger the data access function of memory subsystem  upon the arrival of pulse A. Pulse A also propagates along delay line . Values of Zand Z\u2032 may be in the range of 10 to 200 ohms for example. In this example, Zand Z\u2032 are typically in the range of 50 to 100 ohms. If Zis 80 ohms, for example, then Zmay be 15 ohms, for example without causing a significant impedance mismatch at input  while enabling a sufficiently large signal to trigger a memory subsystem  operation.","In operation, precision synchronization function  is designed to detect reflected inverted pulse B.

Detector DET detects a drop in voltage below Vas a current pulse flows through resistor R. The resistor R value is chosen such that R plus the FET  ON channel resistance is approximately equal to Z, 80 ohms in this example, to prevent a reflection of pulse B at node . A detector output signal to processor  results in a positive voltage applied by processor  to wire  to activate FET  if data pulse A (and subsequent data pulses) are to be stored in data register ; or a positive voltage to wire  to activate to FET  if data pulse A (and subsequent data pulses) is to be stored in data register .

Self-optimization may be accomplished as follows for self-optimized NFPSoC  illustrated in . Controller  selects a clock speed and system access time for a particular operation such as fetch data from memory subsystem  and selects a system access time of two clock cycles for example. Controller  assigns a discrete operation (OP) code (bit set) to form a discrete instruction (bit set) which is sent to detector .

Next, controller  provides a set of test data bits that are stored in data register  and then transmitted through FET  and send\/receive circuit SEND\/REC  to data  line to memory subsystem  and stored. Then, controller  instructs processor  to execute a data retrieve operation as described above with respect to  to retrieve the same data. Controller  also programs NV NPLA  to recognize the corresponding bit set and to apply an output voltage on one of outputs  lines to a gate such as gate G, G, or GK thereby activating corresponding FETs , , or K used to set valid data strobe pulse A timing as illustrated in . Data pulse A and subsequent data pulses are stored in data register  as described further above. At this point in the timing cycle, processor  is instructed to activate comparator  using wire . If the data in data registers  and  match, then no error signal is sent to detector . However, if the data do not match, then controller  changes the timing by reprogramming NV NPLA  and repeating the self-optimization cycle. NV NPLA  may be programmed and reprogrammed multiple times.

These pCNFET and nCNFET devices fabricated using bottom contacts and top gates with semiconductor nanotube fabric may be interconnected to form complementary carbon nanotube integrated circuits such as CCN-NOT circuits for example.","Multiple integrated CNFET devices pairs are formed using various methods of fabrication to generate integrated complementary CNFETs that may be interconnected to form CCN-NOT circuits. Additional complementary CNFET devices may also be fabricated to form more complex digital circuits such as NAND and NOR for example as well as analog circuits.","One method of fabrication is used to form a complementary integrated CNFET pair that uses annealing temperatures and oxygen exposure to generate integrated complementary CNFET device pairs. Another method of fabricating a complementary integrated CNFET device pair includes optimization of electrical characteristics using ion implantation methods. Still another method of fabricating a complementary integrated CNFET device pair enables sharing one contact between an integrated complementary CNFET pair that increases density (reduces circuit area) by approximately 30%. The shared contact includes ion implantation methods to enable shared contact to inject both holes and electrons.","CNFET Devices with Bottom Contacts & a Top Gate","CNFET devices have similarities and differences with respect to structure and electric properties when compared with bulk, SOI, thin film, or other semiconductor FETs. The electrical behavior of CNFET devices may be analyzed in a classical approach in terms of channel region formation, threshold voltage, carriers scattering due to adsorbed impurities on CNT surfaces, and trapped charges at gate oxide\/CNT interfaces for example. Semiconducting CNTs exhibit bandgaps (energy gaps) that are proportional to the inverse of CNT diameters (Eg \u03b11\/dCNT) such that Eg \u02dc0.6 eV for SWNTs with d=1.4 nm and Eg \u02dc0.85 eV for single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) with d=1 nm for individual CNTs for example. While CNFET devices may be formed using multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs) assuming a semiconducting outer wall, higher CNT outer wall diameters such as d\u02dc15 nm, for example, result in smaller bandgaps (less than 0.1 eV) and parallel current paths due to coupling to CNT inner walls that are not controlled by the CNFET device gate thereby making MWNTs less desirable than SWNTs for use in CNFET devices. Electrical characteristics of patterned semiconductor nanotube fabric-based CNFET devices in these examples are formed using patterned semiconducting nanotube fabrics formed with SWNT carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and exhibit electrical characteristics (properties) corresponding at least one or several CNTs in parallel as described further above with respect to . Threshold voltages may be estimated based on gate insulator thickness and relative dielectric constant. Electron or hole mobility in the channel region is limited by scattering due to adsorbed impurities on CNT surfaces and trapped charges gate insulator\/CNT interfaces for example.","Source\/drain regions and associated contacts behave differently when contacting individual CNTs that form CNFET devices than when contacting highly doped regions of bulk or SOI FET devices for example. In the case of bulk or SOI FET devices for example, contacts resistance is approximately ohmic and typically of low resistance in the milliohm to a few ohms range depending on the area of the contact region and the semiconductor doping level. In the case of CNTs, there is a quantum contact resistance between a CNT and a macroscopic contact that exists because of a mismatch between the small number of available conducting channels in the CNT and the large number of conducting channels available in the macroscopic contact. The well known theoretical minimum contact resistance per contact is approximately 6.5 k\u03a9 per contact. Typically, the contact resistance is higher than 6.5 k\u03a9. For Ti\/Pd contacts to SWNTs, measurements indicate a range of 10 k\u03a9 to 30 k\u03a9 resistance per CNT contact. For nanotube fabrics, the contact resistance per contact is divided by the number of parallel active CNTs. The relatively high transconductance associate with CNFET devices is reduced by the contact resistance value.","Another importance difference between contacts to CNTs for CNFET devices and contacts to highly doped semiconductor regions for FETs is that conductors forming contacts to CNTs form both the contact region and the source\/drain region of CNFET devices in the form of Schottky barrier-type junctions. The contact barrier in the contact region may enable or disable injections of holes or electrons for pCNFET or nCNFET devices, respectively, or may enable injection of both holes and electrons for ambipolar CNFET devices as illustrated further above with respect to .","Three-terminal CNFET device structures and corresponding electrical characteristics are discussed further below for CNFET devices with bottom contacts to individual CNTs in a patterned semiconductor nanotube fabric and a top gate on a gate insulator above the patterned semiconductor nanotube fabric that electrostatically couples to the underlying semiconductor nanotube fabric forms and unforms a channel region in the nanotube fabric between a pair of contacts. Integrated pCNFET and nCNFET device structures are illustrated because complementary circuits are required for many high density technology applications to limit dc current and control power dissipation. nCNFET and pCNFET devices may be combined to form complementary carbon nanotube functions such as NOT (inverters), NAND, NOR and other digital logic circuits as well as analog circuits.

The thermal process to activate a particular ion implant in the CNT fabric may depend on several factors such as ion implanted species (mass, chemical reactivity, diffusivity, etc), annealing ambient, annealing time, and the ion implant dose. Depending on the process integration sequence used, the annealing process could follow each ion implant. Alternatively, the annealing process may be combined with other implant anneals or with other thermal processes such as dielectric depositions. The anneal process may be done in standard thermal furnace reactor or in Rapid Thermal Reactor (RTA) to limit diffusion of the ion species; both are commonly found in semiconductor fabrication facilities.","As discussed further above, the contact resistance between contacts - and - and semiconducting nanotube fabric - is dependent on the selection of contact metallurgy, Ti\/Pd and Ti\/W for example, although many other choices are available as described further above with respect to .

For example, a CCN-NOT (inverter) circuit may be formed by connecting gates - and - to each other and to a logic input using known interconnect methods, contact - is connected to ground, and contact - is connected to a power supply such as V. Contacts - and - may be connected together using known methods to form a logic output.

However, ion implantations (not shown) of acceptor atoms such as boron in channel region - and acceptor atoms in semiconductor nanotube fabric - in the regions above contact - and contact - in semiconducting nanotube fabric - corresponding to ion implantions  and  may be used to optimize the electrical performance of pCNFET device -X.","Although ion implantation has been shown as the preferred method of doping of the CNT fabric for modifying conduction and transport properties of the fabric, there are additional methods available such plasma doping, chemical vapor deposition (CVD, PECVD, PhECVD), rapid thermal processing (RTP or RTCVD), CNT functionalization, CNT chemical modification such acid treatments for example In the case of plasma doping, it can be a standalone process such as plasma ion implantation in a processor such as the Varian VIISta 10 P2LAD or it could be in a processor that is very similar to a standard plasma reactor chamber normally used for etch or deposition such a system manufactured by Applied Materials the Applied Materials' Centura platform. In both techniques, the semiconductor wafer which has the CNT film incorporated as film on the wafer is either immersed in the plasma or ions from the plasma are extracted and accelerated to the wafer surface and implanted into the film for doping then subsequently followed by an anneal in-situ or in another reactor to activate the dopants. Key process advantages that may be derived from plasma doping are ultra low ion energies for very thin transparent films, dopant purity control, high throughput with high doses and whole wafer exposure, and isotropic doping which potentially can provide better CNT exposure and dopant functionalization of the CNTs.","Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can be applied for CNT doping in several different techniques 1) thermally activated only which can be in single or batch reactors\/furnaces at either low pressure or atmospheric pressure (APCVD) reactors such as those manufactured by Tokyo Electron, Ltd (TEL), 2) plasma enhance CVD (PECVD) reactor where the thermal CVD process is enhanced or assisted with a plasma reaction that breaks down the chemical dopant precursors (e.g., gaseous organic or inorganic compounds containing B, P, or As dopants for example) allowing lower process temperatures than CVD alone, 3) photo enhanced CVD (PhECVD) where the thermal CVD process is assisted by broad spectrum photons (e.g., arc lamp) or narrow spectrum sources such as lasers, and 4) other CVD enhanced processes are possible such as, but not limited to, microwave surface-wave plasma CVD or filtered Cathodic arc deposition (FCAD), but these other processes have been typically used in a laboratory environment. Typically PECVD is the preferred CVD method for CNT fabric since it allows lower temperature processing and this equipment is available from several commercial suppliers such as Applied Materials, Inc., Tokyo Electron, Ltd., Novellus Systems, Inc. and Kokusai Electric, Inc. to name a few.","Rapid thermal processing (RTP or RTCVD) including sub-millisecond processing (one form that occurs in the sub-millisecond region as described further above as photo enhanced CVD (PhECVD)) is in one form a thermal CVD technique as described further above but occurring at a much shorter time thermal cycle as compared to a mostly isothermal furnace process. The fast thermal cycle limits the amount of dopant diffusion while still activating the dopants. However another RTP application does not require CVD for doping, but instead uses a dopant solution or doped film applied to the wafer after CNT deposition or it could also use a CNT solution with the dopant added prior to CNT film formation. The RTP process is used to diffuse (if needed) and activate the dopant, drive off solvents, and chemically react with unwanted solvents depending on the ambient used in the RTP process. In order for the RTP techniques to be useful forming n and p conductivity regions concurrently, appropriate masking techniques must be employed to form these regions. RTP fabrication equipment is available from the suppliers listed in the previous section.","Integrated Complementary Carbon Nanotube Technology Formed using a Shared Contact Between Adjacent CNFET Devices for Greater Density","Increasing density, that is reducing the area occupied by an electronic circuit, may increase performance, reduce power dissipation or both. In this example, integrated CNFET device pair - with complementary CNFET device pair nCNFET device -X and pCNFET device -X illustrated in  are modified to share an output contact and are formed within the same semiconductor nanotube fabric region by combining the function of contacts - and - into a single output contact as illustrated in . The increased density is realized by eliminating the separation between contacts - and - and eliminating the need for two contacts by combining them into one shared output contact. If each contact and space region is approximately equal, then the overall length for the complementary device pair in the channel length direction is reduced from 7 squares to 5 squares. Contact and space width is assumed to remain approximately the same. Therefore, complementary device pair density is increased by almost 30% for the same layout ground rules and NOT circuits formed using complementary device pairs as described further above with respect to  may also be approximately 30% denser.","In order for a complementary device pair to share a common output contact, this contact must support the injection of both electron and holes.

Norman, Okla. for example. The primary synthesis technologies for producing CNTs in significant quantities are arc discharge, laser ablation, high pressure carbon monoxide (HiPCO), Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) including Plasma Enhanced CVD (PECVD), and controlled flame synthesized SWNTs (e.g., Nano-C). However, CNT materials with 100% s-SWNTs are not as yet available through suppliers thus requiring follow up with additional separation techniques to isolate the s-SWNT from contaminates such as MWNTs, metallic SWNTs (i.e., Eg\u22480; large diameter SWNTs), catalytic metals, amorphous carbon, and other allotropes of carbon. Current separation techniques of metallic SWNTs and MWNTs impurities from s-SWNT result in s-SWNT concentrations in the range of greater than 80%, but less than 100%, with some metallic CNTs remaining. Examples of separation techniques in use are dielectrophoresis (e.g., AC dielectrophoresis and agarose gel electrophoresis), amine extraction, polymer wrapping, selective oxidation, CNT functionalization, and density-gradient ultracentrifugation. Some of these techniques of separating s-SWNTs are on a laboratory scale. However, 100% s-SWNTs using separation on a commercial scale is not presently available.","Other methods of further processing (post processing) of metallic CNTs (m-SWNTs or MWNTs) to either convert them to semiconducting CNTs or remove them after they have formed the CNT nano-fabric layer may require 1) functionalizing the metallic CNTs so that they are converted to semiconducting CNTs or non-conducting CNTs (e.g., opens) or 2) functionalizing the metallic CNTs so that they can be selectively removed from the nano-fabric layer. Process techniques to convert metallic CNTs to semiconducting CNTs such as a plasma treatment to convert metallic CNTs to semiconductor type (Chen, et al., Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, vol 45, no. 4B, pp. 3680-3685, 2006) or using protein-coated nanoparticles in the device contact areas to convert metallic CNTs to semiconductor type (Na, et. al., Fullerenes, Nanotubes, and Carbon Nanostructures, vol. 14, pp. 141-149, 2006) are further described in these references which are hereby incorporated by reference. It has also been demonstrated that due to the higher conductivity and larger diameter of the metallic CNTs that it is possible to attack the metallic CNTs without attacking the higher resistance and smaller diameter semiconducting CNTs (An, et.al., Science 301, pp. 344-347, 2003) which is hereby incorporated by reference. Thus, one or more of these process techniques may be used to either remove or convert the metallic CNTs to semiconductor CNTs. Integrated CNFET devices and associated functions described further above may be formed using less than 100% s-SWNT nanotube fabrics. However, the number of integrated CNFET devices and density per unit area may be increased as the s-SWNT content of the nanotube fabric increases and approaches 100%.","Preferred methods of fabrication include formation of solutions approaching 100% s-SWNTs or removal of non-s-SWNTs from the nanotube fabric as described further above. However, when less than 100% s-SWNTs are available to form s-SWNT solutions, additional post processing of the NRAM\u00ae and NanoLogic\u00ae digital and analog circuits described in this application may be required to remove remaining metallic CNTs may be used until technology is developed that provides 100% s-SWNTs solutions.
