title: Clamp mode emulation
abstract: Various technologies described herein pertain to filling a fill area of a canvas with a source visual object and/or a supplemental visual object to emulate a result of clamping the source visual object onto the fill area of the canvas. A source sub-region of a canvas is filled with the source visual object. Moreover, an extension sub-region of the canvas, which includes at least a part of the fill area outside the source sub-region, is formed based on the source sub-region of the canvas. Further, a supplemental visual object is generated by using a tiling clip on the source visual object and repeated within the extension sub-region of the canvas. The tiling clip specifies a size of the portion of the source visual object used as the supplemental visual object.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Electronic documents can be utilized to publish and exchange information. A layout of an electronic document can preserve document appearance independent of a device on which the document is presented. For instance, a layout of the electronic document and visual appearance of each page of such electronic document can be defined within the electronic document. Moreover, an electronic document format can include rules for rendering, processing, and printing the electronic document.","Graphics rendered to a display conventionally can be converted to an electronic document format. However, functionality utilized for rendering graphics to the display may be unavailable within the electronic document format; thus, the rules for rendering, processing, and printing the electronic document included in the electronic document format can lack various rules utilized to render the graphics to the display. According to an example, a two dimensional graphics application programming interface (API) can include a specification for a clamp mode. The clamp mode can include a set of rules for extending an edge of a tile that includes content from a visual element to a perimeter of a fill area when at least a portion of the fill area is unfilled by the tile. The set of rules included in the clamp mode can extend the edge of the tile to the perimeter of the fill area by maintaining edge values and\/or colors from the tile to the perimeter of the fill area. For instance, when rendered using the set of rules included in the clamp mode of the two dimensional graphics API, a rectangular tile that includes a set of vector elements can be rasterized and edge values and\/or colors from the rasterized tile can be extended outwards to the perimeter of the fill area. Contrarily, an electronic document format can be unable to directly specify a clamp mode (e.g., the electronic document format can lack a set of rules for extending an edge of a tile to a perimeter of a fill area by maintaining edge values and\/or colors from the tile to the perimeter of the fill area). Accordingly, a result of the clamp mode supported by the two dimensional graphics API conventionally can be emulated when the graphics rendered to the display are converted to the electronic document format by converting the tile into a raster graphics image (e.g., bitmap) and using the edge pixels from the raster graphics image for clamping. However, emulating the result of the clamp mode by converting the tile to the raster graphics image can potentially cause a detrimental impact to fidelity (e.g., since the resolution of the raster graphics image is fixed) and performance (e.g., since the raster graphics image would have to be created from the tile), while increasing a size of an electronic document (e.g., to hold the raster graphics image).","Described herein are various technologies that pertain to filling a fill area of a canvas with a source visual object and\/or a supplemental visual object, where the supplemental visual object can be generated from a corner or an edge of the source visual object, to emulate a result of clamping the source visual object onto the fill area of the canvas. Sub-regions of the canvas can be respectively filled with the source visual object and one or more supplemental visual objects generated from the source visual object. More particularly, a source sub-region of the canvas can be filled with the source visual object and an extension sub-region of the canvas can be filled with a corresponding supplemental visual object. The extension sub-region of the canvas can be formed based on the source sub-region of the canvas. For instance, the extension sub-region can include at least a part of a remainder of the fill area of the canvas outside the source sub-region.","A supplemental visual object generated from the source visual object can refer to a portion of the source visual object. For instance, the supplemental visual object can be generated by using a tiling clip on the source visual object. The tiling clip can specify a size of the portion of the source visual object to be used as the supplemental visual object. Further, the supplemental visual object can be repeated within a corresponding extension sub-region to fill the extension sub-region.","The above summary presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the systems and\/or methods discussed herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the systems and\/or methods discussed herein. It is not intended to identify key\/critical elements or to delineate the scope of such systems and\/or methods. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Various technologies pertaining to filling a fill area of a canvas with a source visual object and\/or a supplemental visual object, where the supplemental visual object can be generated from a corner or an edge of the source visual object, to emulate a result of clamping the source visual object onto the fill area of the canvas are now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects. Further, it is to be understood that functionality that is described as being carried out by certain system components may be performed by multiple components. Similarly, for instance, a component may be configured to perform functionality that is described as being carried out by multiple components.","Moreover, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied by any of the following instances: X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B. In addition, the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.","As set forth herein, a fill area of a canvas can be filled with a source visual object and\/or a supplemental visual object. A source sub-region of the canvas can be filled with the source visual object. Moreover, an extension sub-region of the canvas can be filled with the supplemental visual object, which can be generated from a corner or an edge of the source visual object. For instance, the supplemental visual object can be replicated within the extension sub-region of the canvas.","According to an example, the canvas can be filled with the source visual object and\/or the supplemental visual object when graphics rendered to a display using a set of rules included in a clamp mode of a two dimensional graphics API (e.g., a vector graphics API or a raster graphics API) are converted to an electronic document format. For instance, the set of rules included in the clamp mode of the two-dimensional graphics API can rasterize the source visual object and extend edge values and\/or colors from the rasterized source visual object outwards to a perimeter of a fill area as part of the graphics rendered to the display. However, the electronic document format can lack a set of rules for extending edge values and\/or colors of the source visual object to a perimeter of a fill area. Hence, the canvas filled with the source visual object and\/or one or more supplemental visual objects can emulate a result of the clamp mode supported by the two-dimensional graphics API (e.g., the canvas filled with the source visual object and\/or one or more supplemental visual objects can be included in an electronic document). By way of example, it is to be appreciated that the electronic document can be a fixed layout electronic document or a dynamic layout electronic document.","By way of example, the source visual object can include a set of vector elements. Following this example, when the canvas is filled with the source visual object and\/or the one or more supplemental visual objects generated from the source visual object, the source visual object and\/or the one or more supplemental visual objects can be maintained in a vector format (e.g., as opposed to rasterizing the source visual object and using the edge pixels for clamping). Thus, the result of the clamp mode supported by the two-dimensional graphics API can be emulated while mitigating a detrimental impact to fidelity and performance and increase in size oftentimes resulting from conventional approaches. However, it is also contemplated that the source visual object can include a raster graphics image, for example.","Referring now to the drawings,  illustrate filling an exemplary canvas  in accordance with various aspects described herein. The example set forth in  depicts filling a fill area  of the canvas  with a source visual object  and supplemental visual objects generated from the source visual object . A crosshatch included in the drawings represents an unfilled portion of the fill area  of the canvas . While the crosshatch is shown as being within a perimeter of the fill area  of the canvas , it is also contemplated that the canvas  can be at least partially unfilled outside the perimeter of the fill area . The canvas  filled with the source visual object  and the supplemental visual objects can emulate a result of clamping the source visual object  onto the fill area . It is to be appreciated that the example described in  is provided for illustration purposes, and is not intended to limit the scope of the hereto appended claims.","As depicted in , the canvas  includes a source sub-region . The source sub-region  has a rectangular shape and is bounded by a left side , a right side , a top side , and a bottom side . The source sub-region  is within a perimeter of the fill area . However, it is contemplated that a source sub-region can be entirely or partially outside the perimeter of the fill area , for example. By way of further example, it is contemplated that a source sub-region can have a shape other than a rectangle (e.g., a polygon, etc.). Moreover, the source sub-region  is filled with the source visual object .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["202","102","100","108","110","106","108","110","106","202","102","108","106","114","106","110","106","202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["204","104","104","204","106","204","104","202","202","104","204","204","104"]},"As depicted in , the extension sub-region  included within the fill area  of the canvas  is filled with the supplemental visual object generated by applying the tiling clip  to the bottom edge of the source visual object  as illustrated in . The extension sub-region  is filled by repeating the supplemental visual object in a direction perpendicular to a side of the source sub-region  adjacent to the extension sub-region  (e.g., perpendicular to the bottom side  of the source sub-region  as shown in ). Thus, the supplemental visual object is vertically repeated throughout the extension sub-region .","As illustrated in , the fill area  of the canvas  is filled with the source visual object (e.g., the source visual object  of ) and supplemental visual objects generated from the source visual object. Similar to the example set forth in , extension sub-regions other than the extension sub-region  within the fill area  of the canvas  are filled with respective supplemental visual objects generated from the source visual object.","Now turning to , illustrated is a system  that fills a fill area of a canvas with a source visual object  and\/or one or more supplemental visual objects generated from the source visual object  to emulate a result of clamping the source visual object  onto the fill area of the canvas. The fill area can have a perimeter with an arbitrary shape. The perimeter of the fill area and\/or a position of the fill area on a canvas can be specified by fill area parameters . The source visual object  and the fill area parameters  can be inputted to the system . Further, visual object parameters  related to the source visual object  can be inputted to the system . The system  can fill the fill area of the canvas with visual objects to generate a filled canvas  based at least in part upon the source visual object , the fill area parameters , and the visual object parameters , where the filled canvas  can emulate a result of a clamp mode.","The filled canvas  generated by the system  can be a resource associated with a page of an electronic document. For instance, the system  can be employed when calls that specify clamp mode (e.g., as part of a format that natively supports clamp mode functionality) are serialized to an electronic document format; thus, the calls can be converted into a format that can be stored, for example, in a file or memory buffer. The system  emulates the result of clamping since functionality associated with clamp mode is not natively supported within the electronic document format (e.g., the electronic document format lacks a set of rules for extending edge values and\/or colors of the source visual object  to a perimeter of the fill area). Moreover, the filled canvas  can be displayed on an electronic display screen, printed via a printer, retained in a data store, or the like.","The system  can append the source visual object  and one or more visual objects hierarchically produced from the source visual object  to the fill area of the canvas to generate the filled canvas . A visual object can be hierarchically produced from the source visual object  by referring to a portion of the source visual object . A portion of the fill area of the filled canvas  can be filled with the source visual object  and a remainder of the fill area of the filled canvas  can be filled with the one or more visual objects hierarchically produced from the source visual object . The one or more visual objects hierarchically produced from the source visual object  can be referred to herein as supplemental visual objects. Although many of the examples described herein pertain to adding the source visual object  to the fill area of the filled canvas , it is contemplated that the source visual object  need not be added to the fill area of the filled canvas  (e.g., the visual object parameters  can specify a location for the source visual object  that is outside a perimeter of the fill area on the filled canvas ).","The system  includes a source fill component  that receives the source visual object , the fill area parameters , and the visual object parameters . Upon receiving the foregoing inputs, the source fill component  can generate an empty canvas. Alternatively, an empty canvas can be provided to the source fill component . Further, the source fill component  can initiate filling the empty canvas. More particularly, the source fill component  can determine a source sub-region of the canvas from the visual object parameters . The source sub-region of the canvas is an area of the canvas to be filled with the source visual object . The source sub-region can be entirely or partially within the fill area specified by the fill area parameters ; however, it is contemplated that the source sub-region can be outside the fill area specified by the fill area parameters . Moreover, the source fill component  can fill the source sub-region of the canvas with the source visual object .","The source visual object  can include, for example, a set of vector elements (e.g., vector primitives) or a raster graphics image. Examples of vector elements include, but are not limited to, points, lines, line segments, polygons, curves, circles, and ellipses; however, it is to be appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not so limited. For instance, if the source visual object  includes a set of vector elements, then mathematical formulas can be used to represent the vector elements. Such formulas are not dependent on resolution, thereby allowing for scaling to arbitrary dimensions. Yet, it is to be appreciated that the source visual object  can be treated similarly within the system  regardless whether the source visual object  includes a set of vector elements or a raster graphics image.","The visual object parameters  inputted to the source fill component  include parameters related to the portion of the canvas to be filled with the source visual object . The visual object parameters  include a fill origin and a destination geometry area for the source visual object . A shape of the destination geometry area for the source visual object  can be a rectangle. The fill origin can indicate a location of a top-left corner of the rectangle on the canvas, and the destination geometry area can indicate a height and width of the rectangle. However, it is to be appreciated that the fill origin can indicate a location of a disparate corner of the rectangle or any other part of the rectangle (e.g., a midpoint of a side of the rectangle, etc.) on the canvas.","The fill origin and the destination geometry area specify the source sub-region of the canvas, and hence, the source fill component  can determine the source sub-region of the canvas as a function of such parameters. As determined by the source fill component , the source sub-region can be at least partially within the fill area described by the fill area parameters , for example; thus, the source sub-region can be a portion of the fill area. However, it is also contemplated that the source sub-region can be outside the fill area described by the fill area parameters . For instance, as compared to the example shown in  where the source sub-region  is within the perimeter of the fill area , it is to be appreciated that the source sub-region  can be partially or completely outside the perimeter of the fill area .","According to another example, the visual object parameters  can include an affine transformation (e.g., instead of or in addition to the fill origin and the destination geometry area for the source visual object ). Following this example, an inverse of the affine transformation can be applied to the fill area such that a coordinate system axis can be aligned to the source visual object . Further, after sub-region(s) of the fill area are calculated and filled as described herein, the sub-regions(s) of the fill area can be transformed using the affine transformation. Yet, it is to be appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited to use of such affine transformation.","Moreover, the source fill component  can fill the source sub-region of the canvas with the source visual object . For instance, the visual object parameters  can further include a source origin and a source geometry area. The source origin and the source geometry area can be inputted to the source fill component  to specify an area from the source visual object  used for filling (e.g., a portion or an entire area of the source visual object  can be used for filling the source sub-region of the canvas by the source fill component ). Thus, for instance, a clip can be applied to the source visual object , and the source visual object  with the clip applied thereto can be used as a brush for filling the source sub-region of the canvas by the source fill component ; moreover, it is to be appreciated that such clip can have an arbitrary shape and need not be limited to being a rectangle. Similar to the destination geometry area, a shape of the source geometry area can be a rectangle and the destination geometry area can indicate a height and width of the rectangle. Moreover, the source origin can indicate a location of a top-left corner of the rectangle within the area of the source visual object  used for filling; yet, it is further contemplated that the source origin can indicate a location of a disparate corner or any other part of the rectangle within the area of the source visual object  used for filling. It is also further to be appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited to use of the source origin and the source geometry parameters. According to another example, it is contemplated that a skew transform can be applied on a brush used for filling the source sub-region of the canvas (e.g., a skew transform can be applied to the portion or the entire area of the source visual object  used for filling the source sub-region of the canvas).","The system  further includes a partition component  that forms one or more extension sub-regions of the canvas based on the source sub-region of the canvas. The one or more extension sub-regions can be formed within the fill area of the canvas. Further, the one or more extension sub-regions can be formed in a remainder of the fill area of the canvas outside the source sub-region. An extension sub-region is an area within the fill area of the canvas to be filled with a supplemental visual object hierarchically produced from the source visual object . Accordingly, a particular extension sub-region formed by the partition component  can comprise at least a part of a remainder of the fill area of the canvas outside the source sub-region. Further, the particular extension sub-region can be contiguous with the perimeter of the fill area of the canvas and the source sub-region. The partition component  can form the one or more extension sub-regions in the remainder of the fill area of the canvas outside the source sub-region by outwardly extending sides of the source sub-region for example in cardinal directions. By way of example, if the source sub-region is within and not contiguous with a perimeter of the fill area of the canvas, then the remainder of the fill area of the canvas outside the source sub-region can be divided into eight extension sub-regions by the partition component  (e.g., four extension sub-regions can be positioned in non-cardinal directions with respect to the source sub-region and four extension sub-regions can be positioned in cardinal directions with respect to the source sub-region). However, depending upon a position of the source sub-region with respect to the perimeter of the fill area of the canvas, the remainder of the fill area outside the source sub-region can be divided into fewer than eight extension sub-regions by the partition component .","For example, if a bottom side of the source sub-region is outside the perimeter of the fill area of the canvas, a left side and a right side of the source sub-region are partially within the perimeter of the fill area of the canvas, and a top side of the source sub-region is within the perimeter of the fill area of the canvas, then the remainder of the fill area of the canvas outside the source sub-region can be divided into five extension sub-regions by the partition component  (e.g., three extension sub-regions can be positioned in cardinal directions with respect to the source sub-region and two extension sub-regions can be positioned in non-cardinal directions with respect to the source sub-region). By way of another example, if a bottom side and a left side of the source sub-region are outside the perimeter of the fill area of the canvas, and a top side and a right side of the source sub-region are partially within the perimeter of the fill area of the canvas, then the remainder of the fill area of the canvas outside the source sub-region can be divided into three extension sub-regions by the partition component  (e.g., two extension sub-regions can be positioned in cardinal directions with respect to the source sub-region and one extension sub-region can be positioned in a non-cardinal direction with respect to the source sub-region). In accordance with another example, if the source sub-region is positioned below the perimeter of the fill area (e.g., the source sub-region  of  is vertically shifted downwards to be outside the perimeter of the fill area  but not horizontally shifted), then the remainder of the fill area of the canvas outside the source sub-region can be divided into three extension sub-regions by the partition component  (e.g., two extension sub-regions can be positioned in non-cardinal directions with respect to the source sub-region and one extension sub-region can be positioned in a cardinal direction with respect to the source sub-region).","A cardinal direction is a direction along a vertical axis or a direction along a horizontal axis. Moreover, a non-cardinal direction is a direction between cardinal directions with horizontal and vertical components. Although extension sub-regions positioned in cardinal and non-cardinal directions are described herein, it is to be appreciated that the extension sub-regions can be positioned in other directions with respect to the source sub-region. Moreover, according to another embodiment, it is contemplated that an extension sub-region described herein can be split into a plurality of extension sub-regions; thus, the partition component  can form more than eight extension sub-regions.","The system  further includes a supplement generation component  and a supplement fill component . The supplement generation component  generates one or more supplemental visual objects from the source visual object . The supplement generation component  can create a respective supplemental visual object for each extension sub-region formed by the partition component . Moreover, the supplement fill component  fills the one or more extension sub-regions formed by the partition component  with the respective supplemental visual objects created by the supplement generation component . For example, if the partition component  divides the remainder of the fill area of the canvas outside the source sub-region into eight extension sub-regions, then the supplement generation component  can generate eight supplemental visual objects. Following this example, the supplement fill component  can fill a first extension sub-region from the eight extension sub-regions with a corresponding first supplemental visual object from the eight supplemental visual objects, a second extension sub-region from the eight extension sub-regions with a corresponding second supplemental visual object from the eight supplemental visual objects, and so forth. It is to be appreciated, however, that the claimed subject matter is not limited to the foregoing example.","The supplement generation component  generates a supplemental visual object using a tiling clip on the source visual object . The tiling clip specifies a size of a portion of the source visual object  used as the supplemental visual object. The tiling clip is a geometric shape with a given size, where the given size specifies the size of the portion of the source visual object  used as the supplemental visual object. According to an example, the tiling clip can be a square or rectangle; however, it is to be appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not so limited. Moreover, the supplement generation component  applies the tiling clip to a location within the source visual object  filled onto the source sub-region of the canvas. Thus, the supplemental visual object created by the supplement generation component  refers to a portion of the source visual object  filled onto the source sub-region of the canvas with the size specified by the tiling clip (e.g., within a perimeter of the tiling clip) and the location set by the supplement generation component .","The supplement generation component  can further include a clip component  that generates one or more tiling clips that can be employed by the supplement generation component . The clip component  can generate the one or more tiling clips as a function of the source sub-region (e.g., as a function of a size and a resolution of the source sub-region); hence, the clip component  can set sizes for the one or more tiling clips. For example, the clip component  can generate a one-pixel high by one-pixel wide tiling clip with a height corresponding to a height of one pixel in the source sub-region and a width corresponding to a width of one pixel in the source sub-region. According to another example, the clip component  can generate a one-pixel wide strip tiling clip with a width corresponding to a width of one pixel in the source sub-region and a height corresponding to a height of the source sub-region. By way of further example, the clip component  can generate a one-pixel high strip tiling clip with a height corresponding to a height of one pixel in the source sub-region and a width corresponding to a width of the source sub-region. A one-pixel wide strip tiling clip or a one-pixel high strip tiling clip is generally referred to as a one-pixel strip tiling clip.","One or more tiling clips generated by the clip component  can be employed by the supplement generation component . The tiling clip utilized by the supplement generation component  for generating a supplemental visual object can be a function of a relative position of an extension sub-region to be filled with the supplemental visual object with respect to the source sub-region. For instance, a one-pixel high by one-pixel wide tiling clip can be utilized by the supplement generation component  on the source visual object  to generate a supplemental visual object for an extension sub-region that is located in a non-cardinal direction with respect to the source sub-region. Moreover, a one-pixel strip tiling clip (e.g., a one-pixel wide strip tiling clip or a one-pixel high strip tiling clip) can be utilized by the supplement generation component  on the source visual object  to generate a supplemental visual object for an extension sub-region that is located in a cardinal direction with respect to the source sub-region. For example, the supplement generation component  can use a disparate tiling clip from the one or more tiling clips on the source visual object  to respectively generate each of the supplemental visual objects (e.g., a different tiling clip can be generated by the clip component  for each supplemental visual object). According to another example, at least two of the supplemental visual objects can be generated using a common tiling clip from the one or more tiling clips on the source visual object  (e.g., the common tiling clip can be applied to a first location for a first supplemental visual object and a second location for a second supplemental visual object).","Moreover, the location within the source visual object  at which the tiling clip is applied by the supplement generation component  can be a function of a relative position of an extension sub-region to be filled with the supplemental visual object with respect to the source sub-region. The supplement generation component , for instance, can apply the tiling clip (e.g., a one-pixel high by one-pixel wide tiling clip) to a corner of the source visual object  when the extension sub-region is located in a non-cardinal direction with respect to the source sub-region. The corner to which the tiling clip is applied is a corner of the source visual object  adjacent to the extension sub-region when the source sub-region is filled with the source visual object . Further, the supplement generation component  can apply the tiling clip (e.g., a one-pixel strip tiling clip) to an edge of the source visual object  when the extension sub-region is located in a cardinal direction with respect to the source sub-region. The edge to which the tiling clip is applied is an edge of the source visual object  adjacent to the extension sub-region when the source sub-region is filled with the source visual object .","The supplement fill component  can fill the one or more extension sub-regions formed by the partition component  with the one or more supplemental visual objects generated by the supplement generation component  to output the filled canvas . The supplement fill component  can repeat the one or more supplemental visual objects within the one or more extension sub-regions. For example, a particular extension sub-region (e.g., located in a non-cardinal direction with respect to the source sub-region) can be filled with a supplemental visual object generated by the supplement generation component  using a one-pixel high by one-pixel wide tiling clip by repeating the supplemental visual object in two directions (e.g., repeat both horizontally and vertically) throughout the particular sub-region. According to another example, a particular extension sub-region (e.g., located in a cardinal direction with respect to the source sub-region) can be filled with a supplemental visual object generated by the supplement generation component  using a one-pixel strip tiling clip by repeating the supplemental visual object throughout the particular extension sub-region in a direction perpendicular to a side of the source sub-region adjacent to the particular extension sub-region (e.g., repeat either horizontally or vertically).","The system  can form, fill, etc. the source sub-region and the extension sub-region(s) to output the filled canvas . After the source visual object  and the supplemental visual objects have been appended to the canvas, a single global transform can be applied to the filled canvas . Hence, the filled canvas  is a grouping of visual objects that can be acted upon as a single visual object. For instance, the system  can generate the filled canvas , and a single transform can be applied to the filled canvas  to resize the filled canvas  to a particular page of an electronic document rather than having to apply separate transforms to the visual objects of the filled canvas .","According to a further example, if the source visual object  is inputted to the system  in a vector format (e.g., including a set of vector elements), then it need not be rasterized in the system . Rather, the source visual object  appended to the filled canvas , along with the supplemental visual object(s) that refer to the source visual object  which are also appended to the filled canvas , can be maintained in a vector format. Since the source visual object  and the supplemental visual object(s) can be retained in a vector format (e.g., within an electronic document), fidelity can be maintained, even when zoomed to sub-pixel level. For instance, the extension sub-regions and the source sub-region can be calculated at sub-pixel level using floating point arithmetic, while the tiling clips with dimension(s) in pixels can be employed (e.g., a one-pixel high by one-pixel wide tiling clip or a one-pixel strip tiling clip can be utilized when zoomed).","As described herein, the system  can fill the fill area to output the filled canvas , which can be part of an electronic document, to emulate a result of a clamp of the source visual object  onto the fill area. For example, the system  can emulate a result of a clamp mode supported by a two dimensional graphics API where a tile that includes content from a visual element is clamped to a fill area. Thus, if a tile that is clamped to a fill area using the clamping functionality provided by the two dimensional graphics API is converted to an electronic document format, the system  can be employed to replicate the clamping functionality available with the two dimensional graphics API. Accordingly, the visual element can be inputted to the system  as the source visual object . Moreover, a parameter specifying the fill area to which the tile that includes content from the visual element is clamped can be inputted to the system  as the fill area parameters . Based at least in part upon the foregoing inputs, the system  can generate the filled canvas . Yet, it is to be appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited to the foregoing conversion.","With reference to , illustrated is an exemplary schematic diagram  that depicts a hierarchical relationship between visual objects used to fill sub-regions of the filled canvas . In the schematic diagram , the filled canvas  includes a source sub-region  and N extension sub-regions (e.g., extension sub-region  , . . . , and extension sub-region N ), where N can be an integer less than or equal to eight; however, it is to be appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not so limited and N can be an integer greater than eight. The extension sub-region  , . . . , and the extension sub-region N  are collectively referred to as extension sub-regions -. The extension sub-regions - are located within the fill area of the filled canvas . The source sub-region  can be located at least partially within the fill area of the filled canvas ; however, it is contemplated that the source sub-region  can be positioned outside the fill area of the filled canvas . For example, a portion of the source sub-region  located inside the fill area of the filled canvas  can be visible while a portion of the source sub-region  located outside the fill area of the filled canvas  can be concealed; however, the claimed subject matter is not limited to the foregoing example. Further, although N (e.g., more than one) extension sub-regions - are depicted, it is to be appreciated that the filled canvas  can include one extension sub-region.","According to the example shown, the source sub-region  is filled with the source visual object , the extension sub-region   is filled with a supplemental visual object  , . . . , and the extension sub-region N  is filled with a supplemental visual object N . The supplemental visual object  , . . . , and the supplemental visual object N  are collectively referred to as supplemental visual objects -. The supplemental visual object   can be repeated throughout the extension sub-region  , . . . , and the supplemental visual object N  can be repeated throughout the extension sub-region N . Moreover, the source visual object  need not be repeated in the source sub-region .","The supplemental visual objects - each logically point to a respective portion of the source visual object  filled onto the source sub-region . For example, the supplemental visual object   can point to a top-left corner pixel of the source visual object  filled onto the source sub-region  and the supplemental visual object N  can point to a one-pixel wide strip at a right edge of the source visual object  filled onto the source sub-region . According to this example, the extension sub-region   can be filled with the top-left corner pixel of the source visual object  as filled onto the source sub-region  and the extension sub-region N  can be filled with the one-pixel wide strip at the right edge of the source visual object  as filled onto the source sub-region . According to another embodiment, the supplemental visual objects - can each be a copy of a respective portion of the source visual object  filled onto the source sub-region .","The source visual object  and the supplemental visual objects - can be grouped together within the filled canvas . Thus, the filled canvas  can be a higher level visual object that comprises a plurality of lower level visual objects (e.g., the source visual object  and the supplemental visual objects -). For instance, a single transform can be applied to the filled canvas . By way of further example, the filled canvas  can include eight extension sub-regions (e.g., N equals eight). Accordingly, eight supplemental visual objects can be hierarchically created (e.g., by the supplement generation component  of ) from the source visual object . The eight supplemental visual objects can be hierarchically created by referring to respective portions of the source visual object . The eight supplemental visual objects can be grouped together with the source visual object  within the filled canvas . Following this example, the filled canvas  is a collection of the source visual object  and the eight supplemental visual objects that can be acted upon as a single visual object.","Now turning to , illustrated is a system  that fills a fill area with the source visual object  and one or more supplemental visual objects to emulate a result of clamping the source visual object  onto the fill area. The system  includes the source fill component , which obtains the source visual object , the fill area parameters , and the visual object parameters . The source fill component  can identify a source sub-region of a canvas from the visual object parameters , and fill the source sub-region with the source visual object . Moreover, the partition component  can extend sides of the source sub-region outwards in cardinal directions to form one or more extension sub-regions in a remainder of a fill area of the canvas specified by the fill area parameters  outside of the source sub-region. Further, the supplement generation component  can employ one or more tiling clips generated by the clip component  on the source visual object  to generate one or more supplemental visual objects.","The system  further includes a bounds evaluation component  that can identify a perimeter of a bounding box of the fill area. For example, the bounds evaluation component  can determine the perimeter of the bounding box of the fill area based on the fill area parameters . Moreover, the bounds evaluation component  can generate respective estimates of the one or more extension sub-regions based on the perimeter of the bounding box of the fill area. For instance, the bounds evaluation component  can generate the respective estimates of the one or more extension sub-regions from intersections of the extended sides of the source sub-region and the perimeter of the bounding box of the fill area. Further, the supplement fill component  can fill the respective estimates of the one or more extension sub-regions with the respective supplemental visual objects generated by the supplement generation component . When filling a particular extension sub-region with a supplemental visual object, the supplement fill component  can repeat the supplemental visual object to the perimeter of the bounding box of the fill area. For instance, a canvas can extend without bounds; thus, the perimeter of the bounding box of the fill area can supply bounds within which the supplemental visual object can be repeated.","Moreover, the system  includes a canvas clip component  that applies a canvas clip that specifies a shape of the fill area to the canvas. The canvas clip is a region with a shape of the fill area used to identify a portion of the canvas that is inside the fill area. For instance, the canvas clip can be applied to identify respective portions of the respective estimates of the one or more extension sub-regions filled with the respective supplemental visual objects within the fill area. The canvas clip component  can generate the canvas clip based upon the fill area parameters . Accordingly, the respective estimates of the one or more extension sub-regions filled with the respective visual objects can be clipped to the shape of the fill area by the canvas clip component , thereby outputting the filled canvas . Filling the respective estimates of the one or more extension sub-regions with the respective visual objects and generating the filled canvas  by clipping the shape to the fill area using the canvas clip can be less complex, faster, etc. as compared to filling the one or more extension sub-regions with the respective visual objects (e.g., without using the canvas clip) due to the arbitrary shape of the perimeter of the fill area. Although the foregoing examples describe the estimates of the one or more extension sub-regions being bounded by the perimeter of the bounding box of the fill area, it is to be appreciated that the estimates of the one or more extension sub-regions can be unbounded (e.g., the estimates can have infinite bounds) or bounded by a perimeter of a canvas (e.g., canvas bounds) or a perimeter of a portion of the canvas (e.g., clip bounds).","With reference to , illustrated is a system  that supports single and multiple axis emulation of a result of clamping the source visual object  onto a fill area. The source visual object , the fill area parameters , and the visual object parameters  can be inputted to the source fill component , which can identify a source sub-region of a canvas and fill the source sub-region of the canvas with the source visual object . The system  further includes an axis control component  that controls filling the fill area outside the source sub-region on one axis or two axes (e.g., whether the fill area outside the source sub-region is filled with supplemental visual object(s) on one axis or two axes to emulate clamp mode). For example, the axis control component  can receive an input parameter that specifies clamp mode emulation on one axis or two axes. Moreover, for one axis clamp mode emulation, the input parameter can specify horizontal (e.g., x axis) clamp mode emulation or vertical (e.g., y axis) clamp mode emulation.","The axis control component  can manage operation of the partition component , the supplement generation component , the clip component , the bounds evaluation component , the supplement fill component , and\/or the canvas clip component  to emulate clamp mode on one axis or two axes. For example, for clamp mode emulation on two axes, the axis control component  can manage operation within the system  to be substantially similar to operation described in the system  of  and\/or the system  of . According to another example, the axis control component  can alter operation of one of more of the partition component , the supplement generation component , the clip component , the bounds evaluation component , the supplement fill component , or the canvas clip component  for clamp mode emulation on one axis.","The following description illustrates an example of one axis clamp mode emulation controlled by the axis control component . The below example presents vertical clamp mode emulation. It is contemplated that horizontal clamp mode emulation can similarly be effectuated by the axis control component .","For vertical clamp mode emulation, the partition component  can form one or more extension sub-regions of the canvas by outwardly extending a left side and a right side of the source sub-region in cardinal directions. For example, an extension sub-region can be bounded by the perimeter of the fill area, the extended left side of the source sub-region, the top side of the source sub-region, and the extended right side of the source sub-region. According to another example, an extension sub-region can be bounded by the perimeter of the fill area, the extended left side of the source sub-region, the bottom side of the source sub-region, and the extended right side of the source sub-region. Thus, an extension sub-region created by the partition component  for vertical clamp mode emulation can be positioned in a cardinal direction along the y axis with respect to the source sub-region.","Moreover, the clip component  can generate one or more one-pixel high strip tiling clips. The supplement generation component  can generate respective supplemental visual objects corresponding to the one or more extension sub-regions by applying the one or more one-pixel high strip tiling clips on a top edge or a bottom edge of the source visual object . Further, the bounds evaluation component  can identify a perimeter of a bounding box of the fill area, and can generate respective estimates of the one or more extension sub-regions from the intersections of the extended left side and the extended right side of the source sub-region and the perimeter of the bounding box of the fill area. The supplement fill component  can fill the one or more respective estimates of the extension sub-regions positioned in respective cardinal directions along the y axis with respect to the source sub-region by repeating the respective supplemental visual objects to the perimeter of the bounding box of the fill area. Moreover, for example, the canvas clip component  can apply a clip that specifies a shape that bounds the respective estimates of the one or more extension sub-regions and the source sub-region to output the filled canvas . However, the claimed subject matter is not limited to the foregoing example where the canvas clip component  applied such a clip; rather, other clips applied by the canvas clip component  are intended to fall within the scope of the hereto appended claims. For example, the canvas clip component  can alternatively apply a clip that specifies a shape that bounds the extension sub-regions and the source sub-region, a clip that specifies a shape of the fill area (e.g., canvas clip), or the like.","The filled canvas  can be part of an electronic document. Moreover, the filled canvas  can be extended in the horizontal direction to fill the fill area using a different extend mode that is natively supported by an electronic document format. Accordingly, the system  supports emulating clamp mode on a first axis and employing an extend mode natively supported by the electronic document format on a second axis. Examples of a natively supported extend mode that can be used include a repeat extend mode (e.g., the filled canvas  is repeated on the x axis), a mirror extend mode (e.g., adjacent repetitions of the filled canvas  on the x axis are flipped horizontally), or no extend mode (e.g., the filled canvas  is not repeated). However, it is to be appreciated that other extend modes are intended to fall within the scope of the hereto appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIGS. 9-13","FIGS. 9-13","FIG. 1","FIG. 4","FIGS. 9-13","FIGS. 9-13"],"b":["100","102","100","104","100"]},"As shown in , sides (e.g., the left side , the right side , the top side , and the bottom side  of ) of the source sub-region  are extended outwards in cardinal directions.
