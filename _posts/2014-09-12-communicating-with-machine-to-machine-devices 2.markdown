Typically these managed devices will have low computing resources, be restricted in power and have restricted functionality. Nevertheless, large networks of such managed devices may be developed that require maintenance, control and other interaction that require communication with a device manager.","Due to the nature of the managed devices and their limited resources in both power and computing potential, it is often necessary to keep the managed devices powered down, in a reduced power state or in a dormant state until they are required (e.g. to provide a reading or to accept a command). Devices may be scheduled to power up at certain times or intermittently. However, if information is required from such managed devices or if control or other management information needs to be sent outside of such scheduled operation times then this approach has drawbacks. Alternatively, some form of communication between the managed devices and their device manager may be maintained but this requires additional power and bandwidth especially for large networks of managed devices.","Therefore, there is required a method and system for communicating with managed devices that overcomes these problems.","Against this background and in accordance with a first aspect there is provided a method for communicating between a managed device and a device manager, the method comprising the steps of:\n\n","Preferably, the first communications channel may be a cellular channel and the second communications channel is non-cellular channel. Cellular communication channels may include those operating on cellular networks including GSM, UMTS, LTE, 3G, 3GPP, WAP, GPRS, and CDMA, for example. Therefore, these cellular communications channels require a network operator or virtual network operator to manage a network of mobile base stations and cells. Non-cellular communication channels use different technology but can include many different types. These may include fixed lines (e.g. PSTN), wireless channels (e.g. WiFi and WiMax), internet channels (e.g. Ethernet) and others, for example.","Preferably, the first communications channel may be secure, or used to carry a secured message.","Preferably, the second communications channel is also secure and has a different security architecture to the first communications channel. For example, the first channel may be insecure and the second channel may be secure (and so has a different security architecture to the first channel).","The security architecture of either or both channels may include any of GBA, cellular bearer security, public\/private key or symmetric key security, secured fixed line or other cryptographic security.","Optionally, the first communications channel may be within a first communications system and the second communications channel is within a second communications system different to the first communications system.","Preferably, the message may be an SMS or mobile terminated SMS, SMS-MT, WAP-push, or OMA-push. SMS messages may be particularly efficient. Other message types may be used.","Optionally, the second communications channel may be any one of: transmission control protocol, TCP; user datagram protocol, UDP; cellular; wireless; WiFi; WiMax; wired; fixed line; and telephone line. Other communications channels or interfaces may be used.","Preferably, communications between the managed device and the device manager over the second communications channel may be suspended until the message is received. This further reduces power and other resource requirements.","Preferably, the managed device may be in a dormant state until the message is received.","Optionally, receipt of the message at the managed device may additionally cause communications between the managed device and the device manager over a third communications channel to cease and switch to the second communications channel, wherein the third communications channel is different to the second communications channel. Rather than waking the device up from a dormant state (or in addition), this allows a convenient and efficient method for switching between communication channels. For example, the device may be switched between wireless connections or from or to fixed line to or from a wireless mode. This is one example of altering an existing communications channel but there may be others. The third communications channel may use higher (or lower) computing resources (e.g. power, bandwidth, etc.) when compared with the second or current communications channel. Therefore, this method allows more efficient management of the device and network of devices. It is particularly advantageous to switch from wireless to wired (or fixed line) as this may provide greater bandwidth, reliability, power utilisation or other improvements.","Optionally, the communications may be switched to the third communications channel from the second communications channel automatically. This may be an automatic procedure or may cause a user or other entity to make a manual switch.","Advantageously, the message may be sent to the managed device in response to: an increase in data volume; a request to send the managed device a file over a predetermined threshold; a request for a firmware or software update; an increase in electrical power used by the managed device over a predetermined threshold; and a decrease in data transfer rate below a predetermined threshold. The message may be sent or generated following other scenarios or criteria.","Optionally, the message may be a secured SMS message. For example, it may already be protected using generic bootstrapping architecture, GBA, information such as keys derived by GBA. In other words, the SMS channel may be a secured SMS channel, in which case any type of security information may be delivered, e.g. further key or keys to secure the second communications channel.","Optionally, the message may be an unsecured message.","Optionally, the message may be an unsecured SMS messaged containing generic bootstrapping architecture, GBA, push information. In this case, an unsecured SMS channel is being used and so GBA push information should be included with the message.","The GBA Push Info is described in 3GPP TS 33.223, Section 5.2.1. The encoding is defined in Section 5.3.5. See in particular table 5.2.1.1 and FIG. 5.3.5.1 in 3GPP TS 33.223 V12.0.0 (2013 December) that may be found: http:\/\/www.3gpp.org\/ftp\/Specs\/archive\/33_series\/33.223\/33223-c00.zip","Advantageously, the method may further comprise the step of confirming authenticity of the message using the push GBA information and wherein communication between the managed device and the device manager over the second communications channels is initiated following successful authentication. This prevents the unauthorised waking-up of managed devices or the unauthorised switching to a different communications channel of these managed devices.","Advantageously, the message is an SMS message, and the method may further comprise the step of determining if the SMS message is sent over a secured SMS channel.","Advantageously, the first communication channel may be used to establish cryptographic material (e.g. a key or keys or a shared secret) to secure the second communication channel. This may include the use of GBA, GBA-push or using the first channel to send a key which protects the second channel, for example.","Preferably, the managed device is a machine to machine, M2M, device. Other managed devices may be used.","Preferably, the communications between the managed device and the device manager may originate at the managed device. In other words, the message or wake-up message comes from the device manager and the communications are initiated by the managed device.","According to a second aspect there is provided a system for communicating with one or more managed device comprising:\n\n","Preferably, the first communications interface may be a cellular interface and the second communications interface may be a non-cellular interface.","Preferably, the first communications interface may be secure, or used to carry a secure message.","Optionally, the second communications interface may be secure and has a different security architecture to the first communications interface.","Preferably, the first communications interface may be configured to communicate with a first communications system and the second communications interface is configured to communicate with a second communications system different to the first communications system.","Preferably, the first communications interface may be SMS, SMS-MT, WAP-push, or OMA-push.","Optionally, the second communications interface may be any one of: transmission control protocol, TCP; user datagram protocol, UDP; cellular; wireless; WiFi; WiMax; wired; fixed line; and telephone line.","Optionally, the system may further comprise a third communications interface different to the second communications interface, and wherein receipt of the message at the managed device causes communications between the managed device and the device manager using the third communications interface to cease and switch to the second communications interface.","The methods described above may be implemented as a computer program comprising program instructions to operate a computer. The computer program may be stored on a computer-readable medium.","The computer system may include a processor such as a central processing unit (CPU). The processor may execute logic in the form of a software program. The computer system may include a memory including volatile and non-volatile storage medium. A computer-readable medium may be included to store the logic or program instructions. The different parts of the system may be connected using a network (e.g. wireless networks and wired networks). The computer system may include one or more interfaces. The computer system may contain a suitable operating system such as UNIX, Windows\u00ae or Linux, for example.","It should be noted that any feature described above may be used with any particular aspect or embodiment of the invention.","It should be noted that the figures are illustrated for simplicity and are not necessarily drawn to scale. Like features are provided with the same reference numerals.","The system may be described as a Device Management  platform (as shown in ), which may provide a core set of services and mechanisms that can be integrated with customer or user application processes (that may be described as Vertical Applications ).","The applications may form part of a managed device or machine to machine (M2M) platform or may be separate from it.  illustrates a number of vertical applications  all interfacing via a device management (DM) Bus  structure with a device manager that may also be described as a Device Management Application Proxy (DMAP) . The DMAP  may be viewed as an enabling technology that can be used by many different Vertical applications. The Vertical application may be limited to a web platform that can trigger basic Device Management functions, e.g. getter\/setters, firmware management, etc.","The DM platform  may support multiple vertical application categories and types. The DMAP  virtualises physical devices so as to provide a consistent view of those physical devices to the vertical customer or user application. The underlying mechanisms used to achieve this may be transparent to the Vertical Application, and the mechanisms, protocols and data structures used to interface with the physical devices may be part of the functioning of the DMAP .","As illustrated schematically in , the functionality and data flow  of the DM solution can be separated into three architectural components:\n\n","An alternative way of viewing the architectural model is as a component in an Enterprise Architecture environment, where the Vertical Applications  sit above the EA Bus and inter operate with Devices by invoking service orientated architecture (SOA) services using the Device Management Bus .","The DMAP Server  is designed to be an enabling technology intended to satisfy the requirements of many different Device Management applications. As its name suggests it is an Application Proxy. There are many examples of illustrative applications including machine to machine (M2M) terminals , monitoring devices  Energy , Connected Cabinets , ubiquitous computer (UBI) , Mobile Assets , etc. The Vertical Application  may be a web application that allows staff to perform basic Device Management functions. Additionally, a cloud based SaaS approach may be used.","The DMAP  may be accessible by third party customers and may manage third party devices\/assets, so a deployment may have similar security requirements to other types of Application Proxy. In other words, it may be assumed that the DMAP  is an attractive and accessible target for security exploits. The Security approach that is taken is a defence in depth approach using a number of host level security mechanisms not normally used in network elements (file integrity checking, rootkit scanning, security role enforcement, host level firewalling).","Five separate bus structures are described in the following section. Connectivity matrices and firewall (IoD) specifications may map onto these but may be further extended. For example, the DM Bus  may be used to communicate with different vertical applications  with different security requirements. Therefore, the DM Bus  may be separated into multiple physical\/logical communications pathways and with appropriate security controls on each.","The DM Bus  may communicate with an operator hosted web application that may provide access to the DMAP  for use by the operator trusted staff. This may be satisfied with a single VPN connection between the controlling web server (The Vertical Application ) and the DMAP . The DMAP  interfaces with the agents , which may be components (software and\/or hardware) within managed or M2M devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 3","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":["1) End User interface (top arrow), typically this would be a web based UI, but it could be any mechanism as defined by the Vertical applications .","2) Internal Interfaces (arrows two and three from the bottom) connecting the components of the Device Management Application Platform. These may be implemented as accessors to local objects programmatically. Alternatively, an EJB\/OSGi type environment based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and serialisation may be used to split these layers across multiple platforms (e.g. a Cloud environment). In this example these interfaces will be described programmatically. In other words, the NBi , and DM Processing Engine , may run on a single platform.","3) External Interfaces (horizontal arrows, bottom arrow and fourth from bottom arrow) may use connection\/connectionless protocols to provide communication functions between the components they support. There are functionally four types of External Interface in this example:\n        \n        "]}}}},"Device Data Base","Wired and cellular connectivity to Devices may be used. M2M platform managed devices may support a cellular bearer allowing SMS wakeup and APN connectivity. Some devices may also have additional wired connectivity. The M2M platform connectivity may be considered trusted and any other connectivity should be treated on a case by case basis and should be allocated to a separate security domain. Not shown in the diagram are operations and maintenance (O&M) connectivity requirements. These may be implemented locally or use VPNs over the Device Control Bus, for example. These may include DNS, NTP, SNMP, SYSLOG, SSH and Backup protocols, but additional protocols may be supported as required.","Vertical applications  are applications that interface with, manage and manipulate Devices  using the Device Management platform.","Vertical Applications may be used by different sorts of user  with varying security roles, for example:\n\n","The Vertical Application  that a particular sort of user will use may similarly vary. Types of application might include but are not limited to:\n\n","Many other Vertical Applications  may be developed to support the needs of Vertical markets. Example may include UBI, Connected Cabinets, RMCS.","Vertical Applications  may communicate with the DMAP  over the North Bound Interface (NBi) . This is also referred to as the Device Management or DM Bus .","The NBi  may provide a Bus interface for communicating with and controlling physical M2M assets managed by the DM platform.","The NBi  may allow bi-directional communications, between the Vertical Applications  and the DMAP's NBi. Communications may use web services and connections may be established by Vertical Applications  to the DMAP's NBi or from the DMAP  to Vertical Applications , for example.","Connections initiated from the DMAP to Vertical Application are referred to as Callbacks.","DM Bus Protocol",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["80","160","60"]},"Management applications  may include logging, alerts, diagnostics and analytics. Customer applications  may include any of the vertical applications  described previously or additional applications. An enterprise architecture bus  provides an interface between the applications ,  and the DMAP . This may be over an internal or external network, for example. Device security and device control buses provide interfaces between the DMAP  and a single sign-on (SSO)  and a global data service platform (GDSP)  components, respectively. A device data bus  may provide an interface between the DMAP  and managed devices (e.g. individual devices , other DM platforms  or one or more gateway hubs ) over one or more bearer networks . These bearer networks may include cellular, wireless or wired networks.","The DMAP  may require an administration interface for operations people. For example, this may be used to administer access rights for northbound parties that are later enforced by AAA. An O&M interface may be included but this may be treated as a special case and will go into an O&M Security zone. An admin Vertical application may perform admin type\/dashboard functions. Connection management\/timeout\/queuing issues may be addressed by a standardised admin\/kpi capture interface. Assets may be described in terms of data structures where access controls are defined using a role based notation. An authenticated connection may be authorised to have different levels of access to assets using a role based security model. For example, this may use a JSON\/XML model where both requests and responses are described using \u201cwell formed\u201d data structures (i.e. XML).","In order to comply with security requirements, this application\/DM Bus protocol may use SSL encryption based on certificate based authentication mechanisms. Additionally VPNs may be used appropriately to ensure correct separation of data traffic over the DM Bus . DM Bus traffic to internal management applications may run over separate VPNs to traffic that passes to third party Vertical Applications  on the public internet.","DM Bus Access Mechanisms","There may be multiple types of access supported:\n\n","Synchronous requests may arise when a query or an action is requested and the results can be returned immediately. Asynchronous requests may arise when queries are requested and the results will be available at a later point in time. Synchronisation may be maintained by a separate or integrated component or function.","Synchronous Requests","Synchronous requests may be used when the result or status of a resulting action is immediately known. If the status is changing then multiple queries may be used to poll the status. Whilst polling is simple, it may not be very efficient.","Asynchronous Requests","This provides a mechanism for dealing with changing conditions or events in a more efficient fashion. When the action resulting from an asynchronous request generates a result, this result may be supplied back to a specified URL and the result data may be encapsulated using an XML notation. This type of request may be used when:\n\n","Actions to be applied to particular devices or groups of devices may be stored within a storage location within memory (volatile or non-volatile) and then synchronised or applied to the device immediately or after a period of time (either scheduled or as necessary in the immediate conditions). The actions may be to change, add, update or delete a particular value or attribute of a device or to obtain data from the device. Therefore, the synchronisation may be two-way.","The callback mechanism may also be used for sensor data notifications sent from a device. Alerts, sensor data, diagnostics and asynchronous getters may all use the same callback mechanism.","Callback Mechanism","The URL callback mechanism may be implemented as a setter mechanism where the action requested will be communicated back to the invoking Application by means of a specified URL. The advantage of this approach is that it makes very efficient use of resources and can be used to describe sophisticated behaviours in a simple fashion.","Callback\u2014OneTime Result","Asynchronous Requests may be used where a single action is being requested and there may be an unknown time delay between the request and the action. For example, a command to Lock and Wipe a device may only be performed after the DM platform has established contact with the identified device. If the device is turned off it may take some time before the operation is completed (or timed out).","Callback\u2014Multiple Results","Asynchronous Requests may be used where there will be more than one result. This could be no result or potentially an infinite number of results. An example may be a query for devices with a low signal level. There may be a varying number of devices that satisfy this request, returning results over an extended period of time. The callback mechanism provides a mechanism to transfer this sequence of responses in a relatively simple fashion.","Callback\u2014Log Results and Sensor Data","Sensor data results may be supplied to a controlling application by means of the callback mechanism. The requesting application may describe the sensor data of interest, the conditions that will cause it to be supplied and the URL callback to pass this sensor data to. Note: Multiple applications may potentially view the same sensor data, simply by describing multiple callback requests.","Callback\u2014Alerts","Alerts may arise when some event occurs that need to be recorded and the information describing the event needs to be communicated. An alert may be how you describe a trigger that will cause the alert to be generated. The triggering condition could be simple, e.g. a data field has a specific value, or the value enters a specified range.","Alerts and Sensor data shipment may be implemented in the same way. The scheduled shipment of sensor data may also be regarded as Alerts.","More sophisticated alert triggers may be specified with multiple conditions being combined using Boolean logic.","Callback\u2014Diagnostics","Conceptually these function in a similar same way to Callback Alerts. The only difference will be how a diagnostic alert is defined. Diagnostics may be of interest to support organisations with Helpdesk 1, 2, 3line support responsibilities. Diagnostics mechanisms may be managed by Applications  under the control of this type of Organisation.","Callbacks\u2014Specifying Triggers\/Action Pairs","An application may request asynchronous activities (Callbacks) by invoking requests with the URL describing where callback data responses are to be sent. Callbacks for sensor data, alerts and diagnostics may use this same mechanism and may perform their functions by specifying a callback with a trigger condition. The trigger condition and consequent action form a pair. This API may contain:\n\n","Using Callbacks","The callback parameters may be specified in a single API call, or alternatively one can use previously defined and named definitions of:\n\n","In the case of Alerts, diagnostics and sensor data and the named callback plus trigger specification may be associated with a device in one of three example ways:\n\n","When a Device's instance data (a programming term describing the data objects assigned to an object\u2014the object may be a virtualised device object) changes it will first process all callbacks associated with that Device, then it will process callbacks specified at Device Version level and finally it will process callbacks at Device Type level. All callbacks may be named. Once a named callback has been actioned, callbacks with the same name at higher levels (Device Version, Device Type) may not be triggered.","This approach of using named data structures and triggers offers the ability to modify returned data structures and triggers dynamically, without the need to modify application programs, or even the need to restart those applications.","Use Case Examples\n\n","The last step in this Use Case may cause the Alert\/Diagnostic to be associated with the Device Instance structure representing the Device Types. If an Alert\/Diagnostic already exists then it may be overwritten with this new definition.","This approach allows the Alert\/Diagnostic to be specified for a single device, a collection of devices at the same version level or all devices of a specified Device Class.","A named trigger defined to detect a device with a specific hardware error, might be refined over time to trigger under different circumstances. Over time, support personnel or an automated system may refine the trigger, so it is more selective and accurate in identifying a specific fault, condition or criterion. Once modified, the trigger may be activated and all applications using that named trigger may start to receive callbacks for devices that match the new and refined triggering conditions.","This trigger\/action mechanism will allow the support team to create an increasingly sophisticated diagnostic\/alerting capability by refining the triggers over time. As new faults are diagnosed or other criteria met, then triggers may be (re)defined to be more specific and selective.","Similarly when defining the Alert\/Diagnostic, it is possible to define it for individual devices, or devices at specified versions or for all devices of a specified type.","The Northbound API may have any one or more of the following:\n\n","The Get\/Set API or Northbound Interface  may use an API offered to users or customers by a cloud server (e.g. Sierra Wireless's cloud service). SNMP may use the same approach but where callbacks are implemented using trap servers. Using web services to communicate between applications in both directions can be used for managing bi-directional flow of information between web service aware applications.","The DMAP Server","The software may be hosted in a Cloud. Cloud, master\/slave, proxy and forwarder configurations can be used.","The Device Management Application Proxy  may use declarative mechanism to describe all operations, objects and actions. Each DMAP Server may manage:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0197"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["160","55","60","120","155","156","157","158"]},"The DMAP server's Processing Engine  may be limited to a small set of simple processes. An example implementation is schematically shown in . These can be implemented as multiple threads of activity or single threaded processes executed in sequence. The processes can access the Device Instances and synchronisation mechanisms may operate at device instance level (i.e. the processes may not have any visibility of them).","Device Instances","Each physical device  managed by the DM Server may be instanced. These Device Instance data may contain all the latest information pertaining to a physical device  and may be thought of as a virtualisation of a physical device . The contents of the Device's instance data may be referenced using the North Bound Interface  using any of the getter\/setter mechanisms.","Setters are not limited to setting data values, but they may also support the ability to invoke commands. For example, a Data Variable instance representing wipe\/lock, may be used to support the Wipe\/Lock mechanism by performing a setter operation of lock (or lock and wipe) on the Device Instance variable representing wipe\/lock.","The Device Instance data may have a reference to a Device Class Object, (i.e. there may be a single Device Class Data object for each Device type). These data may also include references to a Device Version instance (see Device Version Instancing section) Object.","The Device Version object may contain a data structure that describes the Data Model used by Devices at the specified Version Level.","Thus a Device Instance may have a reference to a Device Version Object that may contain the Data Model used by all Devices of that Device type and Version. These data structures and relationships may support mechanisms necessary to transition Devices between Versions of Firmware, for example.","Device Instance Data Model","A device data model may be defined given a-priori knowledge of the device data models used in TR-069 and OMA LWM2M (as well as other example protocols). The later development of adapters may therefore become more straightforward. This maps directly onto the LWM2M TR-069 and SNMP MIB data models. Additional features and structures may be included.","In this example, the model works at any one or more of four levels:\n\n","Each level may have different requirements but preferably a single XML definition of the device data model may be used and from that the necessary structures for the different levels may be generated (see SDK Data modelling tool).","Device Instance Data may be defined using a Data Model, where each Version of each Device may have a Data Model associated with it. This Data Model may take the form of an XML defined tree structure (for example), where each node on the tree describes either a data element of a specific type with defined attributes and meta information associated with it. Alternatively, it may be a branch node on the tree of data elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0214"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"190"},"The Ring Signals node is shown as a Branch Node and in this example may contain references to multiple different Ring Signal data objects.","Data Model meta information may contain a number of attributes which may constrain how the Device Instance data will be used, this may include (but may be extended):\n\n","Complex Objects","Architecturally the Data model may have a hierarchical structure. This can be represented using a relational data base system, meaning that the developer can use a database if required. However, it may be preferable for the developer to design a data model intelligently.","The Data Model  allows the developer to represent collections of related data structures as though they were single data objects.  shows a further example data model . In this example, the object DM-Lists is a list area and references multiple list structures (e.g. list names that each has list features). Each of these lists represents different categories of data objects.","The advantage of grouping collections of different data items in this way is that data structures with similar uses can be manipulated collectively as though they were single objects. As shown in this figure, three example list structures are shown to have different security roles.","Device Data Model\u2014Meta Data","The device data model allows the developer to describe all the data items associated with a device, in terms of the names, types of data, default values, and valid ranges of values (i.e. for normalisation, validation and optimisation of analytics processing).","Device data models may take three forms in this example:\n\n","The precedence of the multiple models may follow Class-Group-Instance, where instance overrides group which overrides class.","As well as the data type information, the data model may support other types of meta-information about device data items and device capabilities. This may include:\n\n","The following application example maps Feature Lists onto OMA-DM data structures. In this application example the M2M product designer has developed an M2M device for monitoring the 12 Volt power supply to a low voltage consumer appliance. To facilitate use of the appliance he has created three feature lists:\n\n","Defining Feature Lists","The designer of the device will specify the feature lists supported by the device. This specification will describe how the data is mapped from the device into the feature list data structures and this mapping will be described in an appropriate fashion (ie using an XML declaration notation). For example, a temperature sensor reading may be mapped into the List-Sensors feature list described above. In the example there are two different temperature sensors, one is a board sensor intended to measure the temperature of the M2M device and a second sensor designed to measure the ambient room temperature.","Mapping of the data items into the feature list may also involve some data processing, in the case of the temperature sensor the mapping might involve taking the average of a series of readings, or a maximum value reading. Irrespectively, the mechanism allows the device developer to specify which features are available to different applications in a way that is role specific.","Using Feature Lists","Different applications may make use of different feature lists. The example above describes a device with three different feature lists intended to be used by three different sorts of application, each with different security access rights. A third party company providing a service managing the firmware\/software update mechanism may need access to the Version Lists for each device. This allows the company providing Over the Air (OTA) updates a mechanism to confirm the version details of devices that need updates. The third party company does not need to know what the various fields mean in the Version List. All it needs to know is that the contents of the Version List need to match the Version info for a particular version of software prior to commencing the Update process.","The same approach can be used for diagnosing device defects, the company managing the device diagnostics process needs no knowledge of the contents of the feature lists, all it needs is a way to map different feature list values onto actions to take.","By abstracting out the identity of data values and what they represent, it is then possible to make use of advanced analytics on the feature list data, using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. The organisation performing the analytics on captured device data, does not need to know what the various features represent, instead all they need to know is the type of data, and ranges of values. From this information alone it is possible to identify which features in a feature list are important in predicting future results and trends.","Using Time-Series Data in Feature Lists","Using the example Feature Lists above, there is a feature list called List-Sensors. Ordinarily this would be processed simply be \u201cGET\u201d ting the current feature list values. A more advanced application of feature lists supports the use of time-series data, whereby a feature list item was created periodically (i.e. once every 10 minutes).","A multiple row (instance) feature list data structure may support the use of a set of feature list values. This would provide the application with a mechanism to collect data that had been acquired over a period of time.","A set of sensor values may be captured every 10 minutes (or another interval) and an application would \u201cGET\u201d this data for processing and analysis twice a day. Using a multi-row feature list, the device developer may append the most recent set of sensor values into the multi-row feature lists. Applications querying these data may have the ability to select individual values or ranges of values.","Feature Lists provide a mechanism for describing how data maps onto role specific data structures. Many of the mechanisms to describe and access these data structures are borrowed from set theory and relational database technology. By providing a declarative mechanism to describe how collections of data will be organised and arranged within a device (e.g. M2M) environment, it simplifies the tasks involved in making use of that data. As well as simplifying the application developer's job, it also simplifies the security process because in both cases, the Feature List data structures may be used and secured using a role based approach.","A consequence of this abstraction process is that there is no longer a requirement for data processing activities to have knowledge of how data is organised, because the data will always be \u201cserved up\u201d in the same way to the application developer. The developer no longer needs to understand how the data is generated on the appliance or even what the data represents. An output from a temperature sensor is just a number for processing and the processor of that data does not need to know it is a temperature reading that might indicate a fire is about to start. Instead, the processor of the temperature reading will just see a number that is exceeding a maximum value that in turn may trigger an alert process appropriate for automatically initiating a call to the emergency services.","Data Analytics","Different applications may make use of the different lists in different ways. The example of  shows a device with three different lists intended to be used by three different sorts of application, each with different security access rights. A third party entity or company providing a service managing the firmware\/software update mechanism, may need access to the Version Lists for each device. This would allow the company or entity providing Over the Air (OTA) updates a mechanism to confirm the version details of devices that need updates applying. The third party company does not need to know what the various fields mean in the Version List. All it needs to know is that the contents of the Version List needs to match the Version info for a particular version of software prior to commencing the Update process.","The same approach can be used for diagnosing device defects, the company or entity managing the device diagnostics process needs no knowledge of the contents of the feature lists, all it needs is a way to map different list values onto actions to take, by means of the trigger\/action callback mechanisms designed to support device diagnostics.","By abstracting out the identity of data values and what they represent, it is then possible to make use of advanced analytics on the list data, using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, or other analytics for example. The organisation performing the analytics on captured device data does not need to know what the various data items represent. Instead, all they need to know is the type of data, and ranges of values (available via the Device Instance Data Model reflection mechanisms). From this information it is possible to identify which features in a list are important in predicting future results and trends.","Data Model SDK Activities","Device Data models can contain many complex data structures, relationships and attributes, which will require skill to maintain accurately and correctly. A Data Model editing tool may be used by developers to design, develop and maintain Devices. This Data Model tool may create XML or other data structures that describe the functionalities of a device, data items, security etc. that can be instanced as part of the Device Data Model Instance Objects.","Additionally, this data model can be used as a mechanism for describing the processing and operation of the physical device  and the code that runs on it.

The devices could be treated as completely different device types.","The Device Class object  has member data items that are descriptive of the device class object.

All Device instanced data items described in the Device Version Data Model may also support getter\/setters.","The only limitation on getter\/setters may be those described by the role based security model. The security role model for a device may be defined and encapsulated into the Device Version Data Model.

Device Instances that have not been updated because the physical devices they represent are not available (e.g. because they have been turned off) may be very old.","If the DM Server is restarted there is the potential for all this cached Device Instance data to be lost. The remedy in this situation will be to re-acquire the virtualised Device data, from the physical devices\u2014AGAIN. The data may be stored permanently in the M2M platform, e.g. in some database.

The vendor will test this firmware until he is confident it is sufficiently robust to deploy in the live environment. The stages to deploying a version of firmware may then include (note the following description is illustrative only) a sequence of steps to represent an update and all associated activities using a declarative approach. The Update may be defined together with all dependencies and actions in an update data object. The update data object may then be linked into a network data structure that describes the relationship between this update and previous updates.

In the case of Checksums, it is only necessary to record whether a checksum is correct or incorrect and this feature data item can be described as a single bit. The advantage this confers is to reduce the amount of storage required to record and communicate captured feature data.","A mechanism for describing sets of feature data items into feature lists, comprising single compressed sequences of values. The advantage this confers is to minimise the number of communication transactions required in order for an M2M feature data collection mechanism to collect a set of related features from an appliance instead of making multiple requests to query multiple sensors, CRC checksums etc. The feature list collection process will make a single Get Feature Data communication request, and all feature data for the requested feature list type will be collected in a single transaction.","A mechanism for describing multiple feature lists, such that a collection mechanism could request a specific feature list to collect which would be a sub-set of the full set of features and only contain feature data items relevant for the purpose it is being collected.","This would allow different feature list collection agencies to collect feature lists appropriate to their requirements. For example, a medical appliance might contain patient sensitive information such as location and personal identity, which would be valuable for medical diagnostic and epidemiological purposes but of no interest to the equipment vendor.

The hierarchical model structure can then be used to derive a specific model to be used at a particular level (e.g. Vertical Applications level, DMAP level, protocol level, device level). In other words, the same structure could be used for representing information associated with the management of a device (e.g. M2M device) and then be \u201cconverted\u201d so that it can be appropriately used for the right level, each level having specific requirements.","Communication Model Using Surrogate","The general concept is that, by using a \u201csurrogate\u201d of the receiving entity of a DM communication (e.g. an M2M device, another DM platform, a Hub controlling one or more devices), the communication on the two interfaces can be split and simplified in a significant manner.","In particular, a \u201csurrogate\u201d is a replica of the receiving entity within the framework of the DM platform, i.e. it conforms to a unified data structure (e.g. the abstracted model structure) and\/or to a unified protocol defined for a first interface (e.g. the NBi). The \u201csurrogate\u201d is associated with an instance of the receiving entity.","In this way, the communication between the user and the DM platform over the first interface (e.g. NBi) can be performed using a similar message conforming only to the unified data structure, independently of what data structure the actual receiving entity uses. The user effectively communicates with the \u201csurrogate\u201d rather than with the actual receiving entity.","Similarly, the \u201csurrogate\u201d in the DM platform will communicate to its corresponding receiving entity over the second interface by \u201cadapting\u201d the unified data structure into the specific data structure used by the corresponding receiving entity. This is done by way of an adapter.","Additional Mechanisms","Offline Monitoring of Devices","A mechanism for allowing the DM platform to monitor the device \u201con behalf\u201d of the user (e.g. Vertical Application ) based on an indication provided by the user, and then provide information back to the user when the DM platform identifies that certain criteria provided in the indication are satisfied.","The mechanism may include the DM platform receiving an indication from the user or application specifying at least one criterion to be monitored for one or more devices. The indication may include a specified manner to contact the user once the at least one criterion has been satisfied. The indication may be provided by way of an asynchronous connection (e.g. a connection that is essentially set to provide the indication but not to receive the response triggered by the at least one criterion). The DM platform monitors the one or more devices  based on the at least one criterion. The DM platform contacts the user or application in response to the at least one criterion being satisfied. The indication may be a trigger.","Firmware Update","The ability to upgrade the software on a device (so it is up to date) is a highly valuable and important feature of Device Management\u2014but it is difficult to manage if you have many thousands of devices, all at different versions.","The DM platform uses a declarative approach to managing software\/firmware management for collections of devices, that supports different device types, different sequences of actions to perform during updates and most importantly a state machine describing the sequence in which update operations should take place (i.e. where you need to transition the device through multiple updates in order to bring devices up to the latest release level).","Wake-Up Message\u2014Delivery of Secure Data","This is a mechanism to deliver secure parameters directly via the wake-up message (i.e. the message used to wake-up a \u201cdormant\u201d device). The message can be an SMS message, for example. This message is sent by the DM platform in order to trigger a connection (e.g. UDP connection) between the device and the DM platform.","In particular, when using an SMS message, if no existing SMS key is present (i.e. the SMS channel has not been secured), then the message may contain a generic bootstrap architecture (GBA) Push-type of info (because there is no need to secure SMS). On the other hand, if an existing key for SMS is present (i.e. the SMS channel has been secured), then the message can contain any type of security information, for instance further keys that will be used to secure the subsequent connection.","The mechanism may include also a mechanism to determine whether the SMS channel has been secured. One of the advantages of this mechanism is that the signalling between the DM platform and the device may be reduced. It is important to understand that on the present platforms, wakeup from DM platform to device may only be used to wake-up the device. All data communications is always initiated from the device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0346","num":"0594"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["800","860","120"]},"The device manager  contains logic  that is used to control the system (e.g. carry out actions on managed devices) and interface with a plurality of communications interfaces ,  and .

The switching may also be from one wired connection to a different wired connection or to a wireless connection, for example. The switching may be determined, for example, based on detection of a large file to be delivered (e.g. which would take too much bandwidth and\/or time). The message may prompt the device to automatically switch, or prompt a user associated with that device to switch connection.","This mechanism could, for example, save energy in M2M devices and time to download file (connection time).","In the example system  shown in , rather than or as well as causing an initiation of communications from the managed devices , the SMS message sent using the SMS interface  to the managed devices may cause or trigger a switch from using one communications system or interface  (either the interface or system used to send the SMS message or a different one) to another communications system or interface .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0353","num":"0601"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 17"],"b":["900","860","60","120","810"]},"At step , a message is sent over a first communications channel using communications interface  (e.g. SMS). The one or more managed devices  receive this message at step . This causes step , which is an initiation of communications between the managed devices and the device manager  over the second communications channel using interface . Receipt of the message over communications interface  may optionally cause a termination of communications over a third channel (using interface ) at step . This may also be described as a switch of the communications channel from using interface  to interface  (i.e. from one channel to another).","Further Enhancements:\n\n","The DM Platform uses a Declarative approach and using data structures and their relationships to describe how things work.","A \u201cdeclarative approach\u201d is a programming term used to describe a data-driven way of representing solutions to problems. The simplest example is traffic lights. To describe declaratively you would describe the traffic lights states (declare them) as being:","{Red, amber, green, amber}","The traffic light processor would then say loop through the four states forever.","Which is clear and simple.","The procedural approach to programming would describe the processing as being:","If red then next state amber","Else if green next state amber","Else if amber and previous state red then next state green","Else next state red.","Which is more difficult to maintain.","The improved system formalises a mechanism for representing and capturing information and data from appliances especially in M2M applications and simplifies the way the captured data are used and managed. As such it has applications in many areas involving data acquisition from remote appliances.","The system may also facilitate improved diagnostic and functional capabilities, especially when working with other M2M appliances and applications. M2M involves capturing lots of data from a wide range of devices and appliances. The challenge and the opportunity is how you analyse and use this data. The improvement provides a method for organising data acquired on\/from M2M devices that will make it easier to use and make sense of that data.","1) The SNMP protocol supports data structures that are hierarchies of objects, and that facilitate external processes to query these data structures. The data is queried either item by item, or collections of data within a sub-tree of the hierarchy of the data objects can be queried in a single request. This is a mature technology that is widely supported.","2) OMA-DM and the nascent LWM2M protocols support the representation of data structures in a way that is hierarchical and very similar to SNMP but optimised for M2M environments.","A deficiency of these hierarchical data models is that they are restrictive and simplistic. They do not reflect the way that the data is required to be used. As a consequence the application developer needs to understand where and how the data is organised and usually needs to make multiple requests for data in order to capture all the data items of interest. Acquiring the data (using multiple queries) is expensive, designing applications that use the data requires domain knowledge which is costly and limits how that data can be used by applications.","The improvement describes a way of organising and representing data values into list structures where data items are organised into contiguous sequences of values. The data items that are of (potential) interest on an M2M device to application developers are mapped onto list structures. Examples of illustrative lists:","1) Hardware Diagnostics list, sequence of data values representing hardware checks on the appliance (CRC memory checks, electric circuit behaviour, temperature sensor, water ingress sensors etc.)","2) Equipment version List, sequence of version values of all the identifiable components and software elements.","3) Sensor list, list of sensor values, as unprocessed\/processed values. An example of a processed value would be where a temperature sensor value was averaged over a five minute period, or a radio signal-strength was averaged over a three month period.","4) Private Personal list, Location information, personal details of end customer that is subject to data protection law.","5) Time series lists, where multiple lists may be organised into a sequence, such that lists can be accessed and managed in a sequential or random access fashion.","Using smart metering as an example:","1) The Hardware diagnostic list may be used by the organisation maintaining the smart metering equipment in the field and would be used to diagnose and predict defects.","2) The equipment version list may be used by the organisation supplying updates of firmware\/software to verify that the correct version of update was being applied.","3) The sensor list may contain sensor readings that will be used for analytic purposes.","4) The Private Personal List may be used with appropriate security controls to manage customer centric functions.","5) The sensor list (see 3 above) may be managed as a time series list, whereby sensor values are acquired at regular intervals (e.g. every 15 minutes) and placed into a multi-row time series list. Applications may then query the values as appropriate. For instance a meter reading application would query the device twice a day, and read all the time series data acquired throughout the preceding period.","In one aspect simple hierarchical data structures for M2M devices are mapped onto list structures using concepts that are common to relational databases. Many of the constructs familiar to SQL relational database programming can be incorporated into this aspect (e.g. the use of null values, reflection mechanisms, triggers, primary and foreign keys).","There are many features of this approach (please refer to the above clauses), that will make the application developers' use of data held in lists much easier. The idea could be implemented by the designers of hardware who would define the feature lists into the product, in order for third parties to make best use of the products. This could be implemented declaratively by the equipment developer, who would use an XML notation to describe the elements of each list and their properties. For example, a list item was a moving average, with a sample time of x, and with results to be normalised within a range a through b.","List management operations may use set theory constructs and so allow two lists to be queried as a Join (List 1+List 2) or an intersection (List 1 and List 2) or as a difference (List 1\u2212List 2). This may make it easier for application developers to map data queries onto relevant data structures.","List management operations may use the relational (SQL) operations and constructs to query and modify data structures. List components may be mapped onto other data structures at the application level using relational operators and constructs. For example, Temperature Sensor readings may be mapped to a list element as a 30 day moving average. This may make it easier for product developers to present data for application use.","The DM platform may be described as a dataflow machine that uses set theory on input datasets to generate result sets that trigger additional activities (analytics, diagnostics and alerts).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0389","num":"0639"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["600","120","130","140","60","605","610","605","120","130","140","600","620"]},"The device manager  receives instructions or commands to take an action on the one or more stored attributes.
