title: User-friendly data binding, such as drag-and-drop data binding in a workflow application
abstract: A software facility allows for easy binding of a data component to a feature of a software component. Prior to the binding, a graphical indication of the software component and a graphical indication of the feature of the software component are displayed. In addition, an indication of an element of the data component is displayed in a display area approximately adjacent to the displayed software component. The software facility receives a user input command to bind the data component to the feature of the software component. The user input command may include dragging the indication of an element of the data component from the data component display area to the feature of the software component and subsequently dropping it on the feature. As a result, the software facility automatically generates script or code that provides executable instructions to bind the feature of the software component to the data component.

Conclusion"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/532,776, filed Dec. 24, 2003, which is herein incorporated by reference. This application also claims priority to Canadian Patent Application No. 2,443,454, entitled \u201cData Binding Method in Workflow System,\u201d filed Sep. 11, 2003, which is also herein incorporated by reference.","In the context of applications software development, the practice of data binding addresses the common need for an application to access data stored in an independent data source. Generally, data binding involves retrieving data from a data source and subsequently facilitating the use of the retrieved data. In a more specific example, data binding allows a mapping from data (e.g., XML (Extensible Markup Language) data or database data) to a class or other programming structure associated with the application (e.g., a Person class, a Product class, a Meeting class, etc.). In another example, data binding may be used to retrieve data for use in setting up a software component, such as a \u201cweb control\u201d (e.g., list box, drop-down list, etc.) that encapsulates a user interface and other related functionality. After the programmer specifies the data source to be bound (e.g., a data set containing a list of names), a data binding method or function is called, which fills the control with the data (e.g., the names from the list).","Because it provides access to external data, data binding is considered a useful technique. In addition, it also provides some level of protection and integrity for the body of data being accessed. However, traditional data binding techniques have proven awkward and difficult for programmers to control and implement.","Improvements in data binding techniques continue to be made based on specially configured application programming interfaces (APIs) and other tools. Despite these improvements, data binding still proves to be a bottleneck for more rapid application development, especially for beginner programmers who are not comfortable writing the script or code needed to implement data binding.","The headings provided herein are for convenience only and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of the claimed invention.","In the drawings, the same reference numbers and acronyms identify elements or acts with the same or similar functionality for ease of understanding and convenience. To easily identify the discussion of any particular element or act, the most significant digit or digits in a reference number refer to the Figure number in which that element is first introduced (e.g., element  is first introduced and discussed with respect to ).","A portion of this disclosure contains material to which a claim for copyright is made. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or patent disclosure (including Figures), as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but reserves all other copyright rights whatsoever.","The invention will now be described with respect to various embodiments. The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding of, and enabling description for, these embodiments of the invention. However, one skilled in the art will understand that the invention may be practiced without these details. In other instances, well-known structures and functions have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the embodiments of the invention.","It is intended that the terminology used in the description presented be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner, even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments of the invention. Certain terms may even be emphasized below; however, any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this Detailed Description section.","A software facility provides a graphical framework that enables a user with limited programming skills to implement data binding that associates various types of data from data resources (e.g., databases and XML data resources) with specified components and\/or features of a software application (e.g., user interface components such as web controls). In some embodiments, the software facility provides drag-and-drop data binding functionality for ease of use. For example, the drag-and-drop data binding functionality may allow a designer or programmer to bind an XML data object, database element, or other data resource to a software component or feature of a software component without using standard programming techniques (e.g., without writing code or script).","Once the data resource and software component or feature of the software component are bound together, the software facility may load variables associated with the data resource into the software component or feature of the software component when an end user subsequently accesses the software component. In addition, the software facility may allow changes or modifications relating to the bound data to be incorporated back into the data resource once the end user terminates the access of the software component.","In some embodiments, drag-and-drop data binding is performed in the context of a software application (e.g., workflow application) having an integrated development environment, or similar environment, thereby allowing the designer to create custom functionality for subsequent use by end users.","Upon request of the designer, the software application displays a design layer (e.g., design view) of a software component (e.g., form or web form). The designer may select one or more controls or other user interface features to associate with the software component. For example, the control may be a label, button, textbox, checkbox, radio button, combo box, list box, or any other feature configured to display and\/or collect data from a user.","The software application may also display a data resource selected by the designer (e.g., an XML data object or a database data object) to reveal the data resource's elements and\/or nodes. In some embodiments, the data resource's elements and\/or nodes may be displayed hierarchically in a tree view or as a list.","After exposing the data resource, the designer drags and drops one or more of the data resource's elements and\/or nodes onto the control or other feature associated with the software component. In some embodiments, once the data resource's element or node is dragged and dropped onto the control or other feature, an icon may appear that indicates the control or other feature is bound to the data resource. While dragging and dropping is described herein as the primary user input technique for data binding, one skilled in the art would recognize that other user-friendly input techniques could be used without departing from the scope of the invention, such as \u201cclick-and-click,\u201d techniques involving double clicking, techniques involving the use of shortcut keys on a keyboard, techniques involving a touch sensitive display, techniques involving voice commands, etc.","Such actions by the designer result in the software application automatically generating the appropriate script or code used to implement the data-bound component for future use. In some embodiments, the software facility provides a script view so that the designer can view or alter the automatically generated script. Likewise, the software facility may provide property information relating to the control or other feature to help the designer check the success of the drag-and-drop data binding. For example, the property information may include information such as the name of the data resource and the path and name of the element or node. From a related property information view, the designer may update, change, or modify the data binding as needed. The designer may also delete the data binding.","According to these techniques, a designer can quickly create and populate software components such as forms or web forms. In addition, the software facility may allow the designer to create shortcuts for future development. For example, the designer may select a data resource and invoke a shortcut so that the software facility automatically creates a bound control or feature for selected elements (or all the elements) in the data resource.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Aspects of the invention can be embodied in a special purpose computer or data processor that is specifically programmed, configured, or constructed to perform one or more of the computer-executable instructions explained in detail herein. Aspects of the invention can also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks or modules are performed by remote processing devices, which are linked through a communication network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","Aspects of the invention may be stored or distributed on computer-readable media, including magnetically or optically readable computer disks, as microcode on semiconductor memory, nanotechnology memory, organic or optical memory, or other portable data storage media. Indeed, computer-implemented instructions, data structures, screen displays, and other data under aspects of the invention may be distributed over the Internet or over other networks (including wireless networks), may be distributed on a propagated signal on a propagation medium (e.g., an electromagnetic wave(s), a sound wave, etc.) over a period of time, or may be provided on any analog or digital network (packet switched, circuit switched, or other scheme). Those skilled in the relevant art will recognize that portions of the invention reside on a server computer, while corresponding portions reside on a client computer, such as a mobile device.","Referring to , a typical environment  in which the software facility operates includes a host application . For illustrative purposes, the host application  in the illustrated embodiment is a workflow application, but the invention may be implemented in the context of almost any type of applications software (drawing software, data organization software, web design software, etc.). The host application  in the illustrated embodiment provides a set of \u201cbuilt-in\u201d or default components  (e.g., workflow objects, data objects, resource objects, actions, etc.). Examples of such built-in components are web forms and forms, which are illustrated and described with respect to , respectively. An end user  accesses the host application  via a computer , which displays an application interface  on a screen or other output device. In addition to a display screen, the computer  may provide a variety of input\/output features, such as a touch-sensitive screen, a mouse or joystick, directional controls, speakers, a keyboard, voice-activated controls, etc.","The host application  is configured so that a developer  can enhance its functionality by designing one or more custom components  via a development environment  (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio NET) that provides some integration with the host application through an integrated development environment . Once the developer  creates such custom components  and integrates them into the host application , the end user  may access the custom components  via the computer  and application interface , as he or she would access the built-in components .","In addition, the developer may perform data binding techniques associated with both the built-in  and custom  components. A data store  stores data used in data binding associated with the components ( and ) of the host application . For example, the data store  may be a relational or multidimensional database. The data store  may also (or alternatively) store XML data or other types of data.","Referring to , representative computer displays or web pages will now be described from the context of a user interacting with various screens or pages. The screens of  may be implemented in C# or as web pages under XML (Extensible Markup Language), HTML (HyperText Markup Language), or any other scripts or methods of creating displayable data, such as the Wireless Access Protocol (\u201cWAP\u201d). The screens or web pages provide facilities to receive input data, such as a form with fields to be filled in, pull-down menus or entries allowing one or more of several options to be selected, buttons, sliders, hypertext links, or other known user interface tools for receiving user input. While certain ways of displaying information to users are shown and described with respect to certain Figures, those skilled in the relevant art will recognize that various other alternatives may be employed. The terms \u201cscreen,\u201d \u201cweb page,\u201d and \u201cpage\u201d are generally used interchangeably herein.","When implemented as web pages, the screens are stored as display descriptions, graphical user interfaces, or other methods of depicting information on a computer screen (e.g., commands, links, fonts, colors, layout, sizes and relative positions, and the like), where the layout and information or content to be displayed on the page is stored in a database. In general, a \u201clink\u201d refers to any resource locator identifying a resource on a network, such as a display description provided by an organization having a site or node on the network. A \u201cdisplay description,\u201d as generally used herein, refers to any method of automatically displaying information on a computer screen in any of the above-noted formats, as well as other formats, such as email or character\/code-based formats, algorithm-based formats (e.g., vector generated), or matrix or bit-mapped formats. While aspects of the invention are described herein using a networked environment, some or all features may be implemented within a single-computer environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 through 8","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","118"]},"Referring to , a model view  of the workflow application includes a design view  (e.g., model design canvas) that provides a workspace where a user can design a high-level workflow model using custom or built-in workflow components (e.g., workflow objects, data objects, resource objects, actions, etc.). For example, the user can arrange workflow objects, such as tasks , in the design view  to build a business process. In the illustrated embodiment, the model view  also includes a menu bar , an integrated development environment toolbar , a toolbox view , an object tree view , a property view , and a formatting toolbar .","In the illustrated embodiment, the toolbox view  is part of the integrated development environment and contains four panels containing various forms, objects, utilities, and wizards used in designing a workflow model. The toolbox view  may have one or more tabs, such as a workflow tab, a form tab, a web form tab, and an actions tab. Clicking on one of these tabs may display a corresponding specialized toolbox. Alternatively, the appropriate specialized toolbox may be displayed automatically, depending on the user's activities. For example, if a user is working on a form in the design view , the form toolbox may be automatically displayed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1"],"b":["212","212"]},"The object tree view  provides access to resources (including data resources) within a workflow model that a designer is currently working on. As shown in , the object tree view  of the illustrated embodiment is represented by a folder structure similar to Microsoft's Windows Explorer. For example, the folder structure may show the various components of the workflow model. Such components may include workflow objects, data objects, resource objects, actions, etc. In some embodiments, the object tree view  shows each different component type in a separate view. A data object view  and a resource object view  are displayed in . When a hierarchical folder structure is used, the designer can access child elements and nodes of the folder view by clicking on the \u201c+\u201d expand nodes  for each folder.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","300"]},"The designer may create the web form  from the design view  of the workflow application. The designer places and configures controls (such as Microsoft ASP .NET controls) or other features\/user interface components into the web form. Such controls may include buttons , checkboxes , combo boxes , labels , list boxes , radio buttons , text boxes , tables , etc. In some embodiments, the designer can add additional functionality to the web form  and its controls by writing script or other code in a script view (not shown).","When the designer is creating a web form or when an existing web form is displayed in the integrated development environment, the toolbox view  may automatically display a web form tab  from which the designer can select all the available controls or features that can be added to the web form using drag-and-drop functionality. Once a control or other feature is dropped onto the web form , the workflow application automatically generates script or code (not shown) for the web form . In some embodiments, the designer can view and customize the created script or code in a script view (not shown).","Referring to , the designer may select to use a form  instead of a web form when the designer knows that an end user will input or view data in a Microsoft Windows environment, such as a Windows client. Typically, the form  can display a simple or complex user interface, depending on the types of controls or features used and any added functionality.","In the illustrated embodiment, the controls or features available for use with the form  include all the controls (, , , , , , , and ) of the web form  of  in addition to any of the following: date , list view , month calendar , tree view , rich text box , numeric up\/down , tab , tracker bar , etc.","Like the web form , the form  can include any number of offered controls, and the designer may add extra script that can perform functions such as calling another form, accessing a database, sending an email, assembling a document, etc. As with the web form , the designer creates the form  by placing and configuring the offered controls in the design view . When a new form is created or an existing form is displayed, the workflow application automatically displays a form tab  from which all the available controls or other features can be added to the form, using, for example, drag-and-drop functionality. Each time a new control or feature is added to the form , the workflow application automatically generates script for the form, which can be viewed and\/or customized from the script view.","In the illustrated embodiment, there are various types of data objects available for use in the workflow application. These include XML data objects () and database data objects ().","Referring to , XML data objects are typically used to hold data captured during the execution of a process. For example, during the execution of a workflow model application, there may be a number of data items that are used during execution but that are not stored in a database. XML data objects are ideal for this type of data. The XML files can be imported from and exported to a file system for more permanent data storage after a process has finished executing. The workflow application of the illustrated embodiment provides a very simple interface for working with XML data objects that does not require previous knowledge of XML file formats.","Accordingly, contents of XML files may be made available from any task within the workflow model, making the task an ideal data depository for the duration of the workflow model's execution. There may be multiple XML data objects associated with a single workflow model.","Drag-and-drop XML data binding provides a quick and easy way of binding data from the nodes of an XML data object to the controls in a web form () or form (). By binding controls of a web form or form to corresponding elements or nodes in an XML data object, the appropriate XML variables are loaded to the controls in the web form or form. At the closing of the web form or form, property controls associated with the data as it resides in the web form or form are then loaded to the XML variables of the data source.","Referring to , drag-and-drop data binding is performed in the workflow application using primarily the design view . Upon request of the designer, the workflow application displays a web form  and exposes XML data objects in the object tree view . The designer clicks on the \u201c+\u201d expand node of the XML folder in the object tree view  to reveal the XML data structure. The designer clicks on the \u201c+\u201d expand node of the XML data object in the object tree view  to reveal the XML data object's elements and\/or nodes in a hierarchical structure. The designer drags and drops a selected XML data element or nodes onto a control or other feature associated with the component . For example, the control may be a label, button, textbox, checkbox, data, radio button, combo box, list box, etc. As shown in block , the designer has dropped an XML data element or node onto a name list box , an account list box , and an amount list box  of the web form. Such actions by the designer result in the workflow application automatically generating the appropriate script or code used to implement the data-bound web form for future use by an end user. In this way, information entered into the web form by an end user can be populated back to an XML data store when the web form is closed.","Once the XML data element or node is dropped on the control or other feature, an XML icon may appear that indicates the control is bound to the XML data object. In some embodiments, a tool tip associated with the icon identifies the exact node or element that is bound to the control.","In some embodiments, a property of the control or other feature may be available from the property view  to help the designer check the success of the XML data binding. For example, the property may provide information such as the name of the data object and the path and name of the element or node. From the property view , the designer may update, change, or modify the XML data binding as needed. The designer may also delete the XML data binding. The designer can unbound web form controls by clicking or deleting the reference to the XML data object and node from the XML data binding property.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["202","602","604","606","608","610","612","614","616","618","620","622","624"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIGS. 7 and 8"},"By binding controls of a web form or form to corresponding fields in a database data object, the database variables are loaded to the controls in the web form or form.

The designer drags and drops a selected database data element onto a control or other feature associated with the form . For example, the control may be a label, button, textbox, checkbox, radio button, combo box, list box, etc. As shown in block , the designer has dropped a database data element onto a name combo box  on the web form. Such action by the designer results in the workflow application automatically generating the appropriate script or code used to implement the data-bound web form for future use by an end user. In this way, information entered into the web form by an end user can be populated back to the database when the web form is closed.","Once the designer drops the database data element or node on the control or other feature, a database icon  may appear that indicates the control is bound to the database element.
