{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/153,908, filed on Feb. 19, 2009 for MULTI-VENDOR, MULTI-INTERFACE, ORDER-PAYMENT-FULFILLMENT INTEGRATION APPARATUS AND METHOD.","1. The Field of the Invention","This invention relates to computer systems and software and, more particularly, to novel systems and methods for connecting personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, and computers for taking, tracking, delivering, and accounting for orders for goods at points of sale and delivery.","2. The Background Art","Event venues include stadiums, arenas, sports domes, ball fields, concert halls, and so forth. Associated with events, in many instances, are various merchandising operations. For example, refreshment concessions are often associated with events. Sometimes, events may have a substantial presence of multiple concessionaires. Food, drinks, trinkets, memorabilia, fan-appropriate clothing, and so forth, may all be available through one or more vendors present as concessionaires at a particular venue. Leaving one's seat at an athletic event, for example, may be problematic.","If a game or other event is particularly fast moving, such as in basketball or soccer, an individual must often miss a certain portion of the game in order to stand in line at a concessions stand back away from the seating area at some concourse dedicated to such concessions. Not just the wait at a location from which the sporting event cannot be viewed, but the entering and leaving of stadium seating may also obstruct the view temporally of other users, and so forth. The result is to diminish the experience the ticket holder and the other attendees. Moreover, the alternative decision may also cost the venue.","Individuals who prefer not to disrupt their neighbors, nor to miss a part of the game, may not purchase from the concessionaires. Thus, satisfying customers with the products of concessionaires, without disrupting the game is currently not an available option.","Moreover, in some venues, such as baseball parks, concessionaires often hawk products by way of vendors walking among the stadium seating. The hawkers themselves may become a distraction. Likewise, the transactions may also be interrupting to bystanders not involved in the transaction. Such hawkers may eliminate some of the waiting, such as waiting in line on some back concourse waiting for service at a concession booth. However, it is not clear that they produce any less anticipation, distraction, or change in focus for the user.","For example, a user must get the attention of the vendor. Thus, the user must pay more attention to the vendor for some period of time than to the game, in order to make sure that contact is made with the vendor, and that the vendor mentally puts the new potential customer in his or her mental cue for service in the very near future.","What is needed is a faster, more efficient, less disrupted system whereby customers can be satisfied with a maximum exposure to the event at a venue, maximum comfort with access to food, refreshment, memorabilia, or other merchandise, while the venue maximizes its revenue from ticket sales as well as concessions sales or royalties.","In view of the foregoing, in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, a method and apparatus are disclosed in one embodiment of the present invention as including an apparatus, system, article, and method to implement transactions between a core module, a product fulfillment location at a venue, and a wireless communication device of an attendee at an event at that venue.","For example, an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention may provide a database containing records corresponding to customers, products, and fulfillment terminals delivering the products to the customers. This may include providing a core terminal comprising a processor executing instructions programmed to receive orders from the customers, send fulfillment instructions to the fulfillment terminals, and control access to the database. This process may involve obtaining from a customer certain sign-up information, including an identifier uniquely identifying the customer, contact information, and address information for at least one electronic communication channel, such as a cell phone, PDA, or other wireless electronic device.","The core terminal may provide a list of products and prices to customers, and receive orders, which will be delivered to a fulfillment location having a computer terminal to receive order, control preparation and dispatching thereof within the venue, and track the status thereof. The core terminal will typically handle the financial transaction with an appropriate payment gateway, based on the order.","In one embodiment, processors executing instructions and memory devices operable connected thereto, may execute and store, respectively, various executables implementing the invention. Executables (executable modules) may include a fulfillment module used at a location delivering products to customers; a database module creating and managing records corresponding to customers, products, and the fulfillment modules; a core module coordinating with the fulfillment module and controlling access to the database. A customer module may obtain customers information at sign-up, such as an identifier uniquely identifying the customer, contact information, an \u201caddress\u201d such as a phone number or URL for a customer's electronic communication channel, and credit card information.","The core module may provide directly to a customer's communication channel address a list of products and prices, and receive therefrom an order it will deliver to the fulfillment module. The fulfillment module will direct a person to deliver the product, and will receive inputs reflecting the status of the order, including successful delivery and failure of delivery, to be reported to the core module. The core module processes financial transactions based on the order and delivery, through payment gateway modules, such as third party credit card gateways.","It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the drawings herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the system and method of the present invention, as represented in the drawings, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of various embodiments of the invention. The illustrated embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout.","Referring to , an apparatus  or system  for implementing the present invention may include one or more nodes  (e.g., client , computer ). Such nodes  may contain a processor  or CPU . The CPU  may be operably connected to a memory device . A memory device  may include one or more devices such as a hard drive  or other non-volatile storage device , a read-only memory  (ROM ), and a random access (and usually volatile) memory  (RAM  or operational memory ). Such components , , , ,  may exist in a single node  or may exist in multiple nodes  remote from one another.","In selected embodiments, the apparatus  may include an input device  for receiving inputs from a user or from another device. Input devices  may include one or more physical embodiments. For example, a keyboard  may be used for interaction with the user, as may a mouse  or stylus pad . A touch screen , a telephone , or simply a telecommunications line , may be used for communication with other devices, with a user, or the like. Similarly, a scanner  may be used to receive graphical inputs, which may or may not be translated to other formats. A hard drive  or other memory device  may be used as an input device whether resident within the particular node  or some other node  connected by a network . In selected embodiments, a network card  (interface card) or port  may be provided within a node  to facilitate communication through such a network .","In certain embodiments, an output device  may be provided within a node , or accessible within the apparatus . Output devices  may include one or more physical hardware units. For example, in general, a port  may be used to accept inputs into and send outputs from the node . Nevertheless, a monitor  may provide outputs to a user for feedback during a process, or for assisting two-way communication between the processor  and a user. A printer , a hard drive , or other device may be used for outputting information as output devices .","Internally, a bus , or plurality of buses , may operably interconnect the processor , memory devices , input devices , output devices , network card , and port . The bus  may be thought of as a data carrier. As such, the bus  may be embodied in numerous configurations. Wire, fiber optic line, wireless electromagnetic communications by visible light, infrared, and radio frequencies may likewise be implemented as appropriate for the bus  and the network .","In general, a network  to which a node  connects may, in turn, be connected through a router  to another network . In general, nodes  may be on the same network , adjoining networks (i.e., network  and neighboring network ), or may be separated by multiple routers  and multiple networks as individual nodes  on an internetwork. The individual nodes  may have various communication capabilities. In certain embodiments, a minimum of logical capability may be available in any node . For example, each node  may contain a processor  with more or less of the other components described hereinabove.","A network  may include one or more servers . Servers  may be used to manage, store, communicate, transfer, access, update, and the like, any practical number of files, databases, or the like for other nodes  on a network . Typically, a server  may be accessed by all nodes  on a network . Nevertheless, other special functions, including communications, applications, directory services, and the like, may be implemented by an individual server  or multiple servers .","In general, a node  may need to communicate over a network  with a server , a router , or other nodes . Similarly, a node  may need to communicate over another neighboring network  in an internetwork connection with some remote node . Likewise, individual components may need to communicate data with one another. A communication link may exist, in general, between any pair of devices.","Referring to , an apparatus  may host a system  including an application  or core application  stored in memory  and executing on the processor  of a computer .","A system  in accordance with the invention may rely on a core application . The core application  is a central executable operable on a central processing unit (CPU) of a computer or multiple CPU's in multiple computers. That is, for example, the core application  may be a centralized or distributed processing executable for executing all of the functionalities of a system in accordance with the invention.","The core application  accesses a database  stored in a memory device. Of course, the memory device may be in one or more embodiments, and may be distributed or centralized. In one embodiment, in accordance with the invention, the database  may contain records, which may be embodied in various tables, objects, or the like. For example, the database  may contain records identifying information pertinent to individual orders by customers, menu items, menu selections offered by a particular venue, venue administrative data and the like.","In certain embodiments, the database  may also include customer records. For example, a particular customer may sign up for the Mangia\u2122 service, and thereby enter all pertinent data corresponding to that customer. That information need not be reentered every time the customer accesses the system , orders a product, or the like.","In accordance with good security and customer protection practices, the database  may not contain sensitive information. Of particular concern is information that by being compromised may cause a breach of duty of confidentiality owed to the customer. For example, complete credit card numbers, expiration dates, verification codes, and the like necessary to access credit card information need not be saved in the database , in certain embodiments of an application in accordance with the invention.","In one embodiment, a database record corresponding to a particular customer may include one or more codes for cross-referencing or indexing. These codes may then be used as index references, security indices, and the like in order to correspond with a payment gateway , an executable operable by the core application . For example, when the core application  accesses a payment gateway , the payment gateway  on codes in the database  in order to link to its own secured payment information, the desired information needed with respect to a particular customer.","In one embodiment, a payment gateway  may be provided by a third party service. For example, PayPal\u2122 implemented by eBay, as well as other services such as Authorize.net\u2122, and the like provide payment gateways . In one embodiment, the core application  may include an interface for the payment gateway . The payment gateway  interface passes between the core application  and the payment gateway  certain information.","In embodiment, for example, an XML document may contain all of the necessary information required by the payment gateway . This XML document may be provided by the core application  to the payment gateway . One may think of an XML document as a structured format for passing data efficiently. Accordingly, each XML document may also be thought of as a data record being passed between applications.","Accordingly, an XML document containing the data required by the payment gateway  may be passed after preparation by the core application  in order to be processed by the payment gateway . Accordingly, the payment gateway  may then process the transaction, and return (in a suitable XML document to the core application ) a record indicating the disposition of the transaction.","In one embodiment of an application in accordance with the invention, the core application  may provide an additional XML document, or data embedded in an XML document to the payment gateway . Accordingly, a user may access the core application  through the user interface thereof, and bring up the record information corresponding to that customer. Accordingly, the core application  may then pass to the payment gateway , an XML document updating customer information in accordance with the request of the customer.","In one embodiment, an SMS interface may be formed as a part of the core application . In certain embodiments, the SMS interface may be a separate executable accessed by the core application , or may be embedded in a core application .","In yet another alternative embodiment, the application may communicate with an SMS aggregator . A benefit of an SMS aggregator  is that the protocols, short code addresses, negotiations with the SMS services of the different cell phone carriers, and the like may all be handled by an SMS aggregator . Accordingly, the core application  need only communicate with the SMS aggregator  in order to send and receive messages to various SMS addresses of various customers obtaining there the desired access to customers using cell phone services through the various cell phone carriers available.","Accordingly, the SMS aggregator  may have negotiated all the relationships, and consolidated them so that the core application  can access any address. The system  can receive orders from any address of any cell phone user connected to any conventional SMS service. Also, SMS service is typically piggybacked as part of a cell phone service by the cell phone carrier.","In one presently contemplated embodiment of an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention, the core application  may actually communicate with an SMS aggregator  through XML files as well. Accordingly, routing information, customer contacting information, carrier information, and the like may all be included in an XML document passed between the core application  and the SMS aggregator . Accordingly, data may be passed in a much more compact and efficient format to support transactions.","By use of an XML document for passing information between the core application  and the SMS aggregator , the user can be blissfully ignorant of much administrative information. The customer user may successfully conduct a transaction without having to pass necessary administrative information by SMS text messages.","In other alternative embodiments, other interfaces may be used as a format for passing information. For example, the SMPP interface may actually provide higher throughput. However, that volume of information has not been warranted in every application in accordance with the invention Likewise, other proprietary formats for data structures also may be implemented.","Examples of SMS aggregators  may include the mBLOX\u2122 system, one well-established aggregator. One advantage of using a third-party system as an SMS aggregator  is that the need for access between various SMS networks is sufficiently ubiquitous that companies such as mBLOX\u2122 exchange information across networks internationally. Accordingly, their business involves negotiating with carrier systems internationally for addressing information, protocols, and the like in order to implement communications between various messaging systems. Accordingly, as protocols change, carriers come and go, and carrier systems are bought, sold, and modified, the SMS aggregator  may provide a service of creating an interconnecting internet messaging service on which everyone can rely for communicating between various carrier networks.","Thus, the mobile originated and mobile terminated SMS systems  communicating with the SMS aggregator  represent all of the mobile units, regardless of network, that can communicate with one another. Each of the mobile originated  (meaning that the message or messaging content originates with a cell phone or other SMS hardware device of a user) and the mobile terminated (meaning that a message arrives ultimately at a particular cell phone or other SMS device) device  can be accessed by the aggregator  by SMS communication. The various devices controlled or possessed by individuals or entities communicate with one another, over the connection therebetween, which represents all of the carriers. Thus, the connection between the MO\/MT SMS module  and the SMS aggregator  represents each and every communicator or communicating device in the connection with the SMS aggregator , and thus represents the various network communications or network connections between those individual devices, and the SMS aggregator  responsible for inter-network communications.","Notwithstanding, the extensive, even ubiquitous, use by teenagers of instant messaging, not all communications involve the audio frequency bands of the telecommunications industry. That is, for example, a telephone call, whether from a cell phone or other, occupies a particular communication network. Because of the compact nature of a text message, it can be sent as a very small packet consuming extremely small, almost insignificant, amounts of bandwidth. Text messaging may be transferred between telephone systems and between telephone users, over the telephone network. Nevertheless, the internet or other major data networks may rely on email and other data transfer systems that are passed over dedicated data lines or frequency bands.","The Blackberry\u2122, the iPhone\u2122, and other \u201csmart phones\u201d provide extensive web access as well as telephone access. In fact, many cellular phones now include certain data transfer functions with the internet. In some cases, the internet access is not available to the user, but only to the system . In other instances, the cell phone owner may obtain certain web browsing functionality over the cell phone, by way of the internet interface. Thus, in addition to SMS texting, various phones, in increasing numbers, may also access the core application  through the internet over a web browser.","Thus, many cellular telephones today include both SMS texting functionality over audio bands, as well as certain web interfaces over the internet, such as through broadband carriers, and the like. Even cell phones that do not provide access to the internet by a user, may rely on internet applications and internet communication links in order to perform the administrative functionality for the carrier.","Systems such as the Blackberry\u2122, the iPhone\u2122 and other \u201csmart phones,\u201d may include extensive internet access for a user over \u201cdata bands\u201d in addition to telephone \u201caudio bands\u201d access. Thus, whereas the SMS messaging systems operate by sending very compact, efficient, messages in bursts that require almost negligible bandwidth, the internet systems provide access directly over data bands of the internet for browser support.","Since \u201csmart phones\u201d (e.g., Blackberry\u2122, iPhone\u2122) may provide access to web browser-based applications as well as SMS messaging, the core application  may communicate to a user through a particular SMS service, or directly over the web through a smart phone application.","In one embodiment of an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention, a representational state transfer application may interface with the core application . The representational state transfer (REST) services module  is responsible to provide access to the core application  by various other applications. One may think of this as a native application communicating with the core system through HTTPS to the REST services module . Such an application may typically rely on HTTPS. Although such systems may be web enabled, they need not be, and typically would not be, traditional \u201cweb\u201d applications accessed through a browser.","For example, \u201csmart phones\u201d such as the iPhone\u2122 and Blackberry\u2122 systems provide to a user the ability to add specific web applications that run in native code on those particular hardware platforms. Accordingly, in one embodiment, a user may download from the internet, a particular \u201csmart phone\u201d application  with all the desired functionality to access the core application .","By contrast, in other embodiments, a user may simply go to a browser application already hosted on a smart phone, and through that browser access a mobile web application  much as one would simply access a web page of any particular web service. Thus, whether by a dedicated application  hosted in native code on the hardware platform of a user, or through a browser application that accesses a web page of a web application  the REST web services  may provide access to the core application  for a user.","Smart phones today are more powerful than many of the mainframe computers of yesteryear Likewise, many smart phone applications involve nothing more than a user interfacing with the smart phone system as a computer. For example, games, calculators, camera photo albums, and the like are hosted on smart phones. Accordingly, a user may access an application written in native code for the environment provided by the hardware platform of the user.","In one embodiment of an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention, the native code application  downloaded by a user from or through the core application  to the user's own smart phone, through the REST web services module  may access internet functionality as well as functionality on the smart phone itself. Thus, part of the processing, preparation, and other information processing may be done directly on the smart phone by the application .","By the same token, the internet communication functionality may be implemented in internet processing capability of the smart phone directly through the REST web services module . Thus, \u201cclient side\u201d processing, as convenient or necessary, may be executed by the smart phone application . Likewise, downloading, uploading, and accessing web services may be done by the smart phone application  by way of accessing the REST web services module .","Likewise, the browser hosted in native code on a smart phone may access the mobile web application  on the internet. In certain embodiments, the REST web services module  interfaces with both the direct smart phone applications , as well as mobile web applications  hosted on an internet site to be accessible by browsers from elsewhere.","Thus, the processing of information may be done in the core application , but may also be distributed out to the individual mobile web applications  and smart phone applications  to the extent that the client-side processing may be off-loaded to the client processor.","In certain embodiments, the REST web services  may present or expose sign-up services. Thus, through a mobile web application  or through a downloaded and installed smart phone application , a user may access the core application , and thereby bring up the web pages required to sign up for the services of the system .","In an alternative embodiment, an individual may sign up directly over the internet. Just as an individual may access the mobile web application  through a browser of a mobile platform such as a smart phone, an individual may use the customer's own browser on a customer's own computer to access a customer web application . Alternatively, a user may obtain access at a particular venue, by way of a kiosk, in which the computer is owned by the venue, or by the service provider of the core application . Thus, whether by a mobile platform, such as a mobile web browser, or a smart phone, or by a stationary computer application, such as a user's own personal computer or a dedicated Kiosk computer, an individual may access the core application  and navigate the sign up page in order to enter the user's information. Thus, the customer web application may be a particular application hosted over the internet and accessible by a browser from any computer. Meanwhile, a kiosk application  may provide a dedicated link, a dedicated computer, or a combination thereof in order to access the same functionality.","Once connected to the core application , an individual may execute certain executables to obtain functional benefits. Thus, whether accessing the customer web application , the kiosk application , the mobile web application , or the smart phone application , a user may then achieve the services desired.","Referring to , some of these executables may include sign-up services. Sign up services may include functions such as collection and databasing of customer information by a customer information module , preferences by a preferences module , transactional information by a transaction module , credit card information by a credit card module , and the like that will be used and relied upon by the user and the system  in future transactions.","Likewise, other services may include account management account by an management module . For example, viewing order history, receipts, checking payments made, and the like, as well as disputing charges, correcting pricing between advertised and ordered product pricing compared with actual billed pricing, and the like may all be done through the account management module of the customer web application  responsible for account management.","To the extent that users may have relied upon coupons, advertised discounts, status-based promotional discounts, or the like, all may be recorded, maintained, and re-accessed by a user in the account management module of the customer web application  executables. In one embodiment, the system  may automatically incorporate discounts, coupons, and the like. For example, if a coupon is presented to a user by the system , and a user clicks on, or otherwise engages a coupon, then no action is required by the user to implement the use of that coupon in a purchase.","In other embodiments, user traffic may be driven to the system  by advertising in other media, such as television, radio, print media, and the like. For example, if a user access code is provided, a user may then become entitled to the coupon, discount, or other benefit associated with that code. Thus, whether delivered entirely over the system , through the internet, by SMS messaging or the like, or other advertising media, all discounting, couponing, and tracking thereof may be done by the system .","Accordingly, the account management application or executable may then provide a complete record to a user of exactly what was presented to the user, the terms thereof, benefits selected by a user, and how those propagated through the transaction.","One benefit in of account management, to the system  and to a user, is that order histories may be tracked. A customer may interact with the system  to select particular orders as favorites. Some people thrive on variety. Others thrive on routine. Thus, the order histories may be tracked for the benefit of a user, and the system .","In some embodiments, order histories may be used to determine particular advertising and couponing benefits. For example, if a user regularly orders a particular drink, the couponing for another type or brand of drink may be targeted in order to add or build market share for the new brand. By the same token, inasmuch as a user always selects a particular flavor and brand of a particular soft drink, an order from that particular customer found lacking an order for that particular drink may be couponed in order to motivate the user to add on something known by the system  to be a regular and favorite order.","Customer service executables may provide interaction with the user and the system  in order to support orders. For example, clarifications, corrections, cancellations, and the like may be supported by the customer services module. Likewise, problem resolution, whether an order mix up, a pricing issue, a refund issue, or the like may also be treated through the customer services module.","For example, with a digital communication system, most errors can be expected to be created by mis-keyed order information from a user. Thus, correction may be needed to the extent that an order system, despite redundancy, checking, and the like to verify a customer order, and provide a customer order information back to the customer for verification, receives errors that may occur. Even the system , as some have experienced at grocery checkouts, may have pricing input erroneously into the system . Accordingly, it is to the benefit of the operator of the system , as well as to the user to quickly identify and correct mispricing types of information.","A venue web application  or venue module may provide a listing of venues supported by the system . For example, particular locations, with all of the events for those locations may be listed by venue. In another embodiment, events, independent of venues, and sorted by event type, event date, or the like may be presented in an event module. Accordingly, one may select a venue nearby or an event of a particular type desired, by either means, a user may locate an event, a venue, from which to select a desirable event, or the like.","A ticketing module may provide ticketing for a user to a particular event, a particular venue, and a particular date. Likewise, a concessions module may provide for ordering of concessions. A merchandise module may provide for ordering and tracking sales of merchandise. Also, with respect to ticketing systems, a seating module may provide a view of seating, a price and seating comparison chart, and selection by a user of seating and ticketing selections.","In some embodiments, a preferences module may provide for pick up and delivery preferences of a user, and preferred orders. Games related to the ordering process, or promoting ordering may be implemented. Interactive applications with respect to events may be provided.","Often, venues are anxious to provide interaction with a user, and may provide interactive applications for engaging the user in the game or event hosted at a venue. For example, games may require a user to identify how many points were made by any particular player in an event, which players are playing in which innings or quarters of a game, statistics, or the like for individual players may help involve the user, and educate the user as to the game, the players, the teams, the scores, and the like.","In other embodiments, surveys may be taken by a survey module . Because the system  may provide very focused information, surveys may be particularly short, and particularly useful. Surveys may rely on all of the stored information from transactions and users. Information including events attended, and the like may assist in providing a very succinct survey, much less obnoxious than those requiring a user to provide large amounts of demographic information. For example, with permission, the system  may access the demographic information already stored.","Likewise, other statistical modules may provide statistical information regarding events, may provide at the touch of the button the statistics on a particular player, a particular team, or the like. Similarly, scores may be provided on demand, and games involving a user guessing, remembering, or trying to guess the game score by the end, or recalling game scores from other games, and the like may be used to involve the user in the activity attended, through the system .","Referring to , while also continuing to refer generally to , the fulfillment application  is responsible to interact with the core application  to determine whether orders exist in the system that need to be fulfilled. In one embodiment, each instance of the fulfillment application  existing in the system, will be associated with a venue. Accordingly, each fulfillment application instance  may interact with the core application  to determine whether or not the core application  has received orders from customers at the venue pertaining to the fulfillment application .","The fulfillment application  registers with the core application . The core application  is then in a position to make routing decisions according to which fulfillment applications  are open and registered with the core application .","Fulfillment application instances  may actually be running in parallel, simultaneously, at a particular physical venue. However, each fulfillment application  itself, also represents a location or a sub-venue within the main physical venue. For example, a particular section of the stands may be served by a particular concessions outlet. Some number of merchandising outlets may be located therewith or in yet other locations. Each fulfillment location can fulfill orders and may register, through its fulfillment application , hosted at that location. Registration establishes a commercially active fulfillment application .","The administrative web application  asserts the overall control over the input of event information. Each of the administrative web applications  corresponds to a particular physical venue. For example, a stadium, an arena, a performance center, or the like may host an instance of a venue web application  providing information to the core application  concerning events scheduled at that particular venue.","Using the venue web application , an administrator at a venue may provide to the core application  a listing and schedule of all events, seating plans, and so forth associated with that venue and each event. In one embodiment, the information received by the core application  from the venue web application  permits the core application  to interact with the fulfillment application . For example, the core application  \u201cknows\u201d a particular venue is hosting a particular event. Registration by a fulfillment application  with the core application  from that venue, at that time, will then cue the core application  that the event is being serviced by the operating fulfillment application .","However, in some instances, some events may not have been preregistered with a core application . If the fulfillment application  registers with the core application , and the core application  does not yet contain data indicating an event for that venue at that time, then the core application  will still accommodate the request. The core application  will establish an event at the venue at the time by virtue of contact from the fulfillment application . In this way, small events will not be shut out from the system  due to the granularity of venue scheduling not reaching them.","Referring to , the fulfillment application  may include a fulfillment executable . One may think of the fulfillment executable  as being the main process thread at the fulfillment location running the fulfillment application . Just as the core application  must coordinate for the entire system, the fulfillment executable  orchestrates processing at the fulfillment location.","The fulfillment executable  may include modules to do registration of the fulfillment application  with the core application . Likewise, the fulfillment executable  has responsibility to coordinate and interact with other modules in the fulfillment application .","For example, the fulfillment executable  interacts with an order routing module  responsible to direct orders. The order routing module  may actually be an interface with the core application  for handling orders. In another embodiment, the order routing module  may actually be a module within the core application . By either mode, the fulfillment executable  interacts with the order routing module  to determine orders placed by customers, and assign them for fulfillment to a particular fulfillment application .","Thus, the fulfillment executable  may poll the order routing module  on a regular basis to determine orders that have been taken into the system  and assigned to the fulfillment application . In response to that polling, the order routing module  sends information to the fulfillment executable  indicating customer orders, customer locations, and other requirements of the transaction to be completed.","Once the fulfillment executable  receives the information associated with an order, that information is presented in a human readable format to a person operating the fulfillment location. Thus, an input device  may be an interactive input and output device. Brackets herein indicate an \u201coptional\u201d mechanism as one particular implementation contemplated.","For example, the device  receives fulfillment information, regarding an order and a customer, from the fulfillment executable . It may immediately display that information to an operator. Alternatively, it may wait for a prompt or other action from a user. Alternatively the fulfillment executable  may send a prompt to a user and wait for the user to request display of the information. The user, operator, may then in any of the foregoing embodiments act on that information, such as through a keyboard, touchscreen, or the like. A touchscreen input device  may provide both the visible output readable by an operator, and also permit that same operator to immediately input information through the touchscreen as an input device.","In one embodiment, the fulfillment executable  may also interact with a printer . The fulfillment executable , upon receipt of order information from the order routing module  may print a slip by the printer . The slip may travel with the package, box, or other delivery mechanism of an order. For example, the printer  may be responsible to take the information received from the fulfillment executable , print it out on a slip, which slip is then physically stapled, taped, or otherwise associated with a bag or tray that will be delivered to the actual customer. Thus, the printer  provides a certain amount of accuracy check and redundancy in the electronic transfer of information.","For example, if a slip is without a container, then an order assumably remains unfulfilled. Likewise, when a customer receives an order, the slip is a confirmation of the contents of that tray, bag, or other container. Both the delivery person, and the customer can verify against the slip, the contents of the container. They can verify that the electronic transfer of information has resulted in the proper physical transfer of the desired, purchased product.","The slip may be printed in duplicate. This permits a permanent copy to be retained by the fulfillment location, while the other operates as a traveler. The traveler slip may operate as a receipt for the customer. In yet another embodiment, the traveler may actually go to the customer, attached to, or otherwise associated with the delivery container, but be removed after a check of the contents by the customer. The fulfillment person may then retrieve the slip copy and return it to the fulfillment location, thus verifying that the order as represented on the printed slip was fulfilled as requested, delivered as required, and checked out correctly. Thus, the \u201cmanufacturing traveler\u201d of the food fulfillment or merchandise fulfillment operation verifies yet another quality control check by actual human reviewers.","In one embodiment, the fulfillment executable  may also present to an operator a particular screen of orders. Once the printer  has printed a slip, and the fulfillment of the order has begun, the fulfillment executable may so indicate by status indicators such as color, blinking entries, highlights, font changes, or the like. When the delivery person, runner, or the like, returns to the fulfillment location with the slip from the delivered container, the operator at the fulfillment location may input into the fulfillment executable  a code, a verification symbol, or other input that will change the status of the order in the fulfillment executable. The change in status will reflect that the fulfillment executable  has received the feedback that the order has either been delivered, remains unaccepted and undelivered, or otherwise indicating its disposition.","Just as the order routing module  may exist as a module within the code application , or as an interface between the fulfillment executable  and the core application , the order tracking module  may perform in a similar manner a different function.","For example, in one embodiment, the fulfillment order tracking module  may reside in the core application . The fulfillment executable  interacts with the fulfillment order tracking module  to report to the core application  the status of the order. The fulfillment executable  may report to the module  that an order has been received, served, sent out and so forth","Likewise, upon return of the confirmation slip by a runner, the fulfillment order tracking module  may receive that information. Thus, as precisely as a series is desired to be tracked, the fulfillment executable  may report in to the core application .","For example, suppose that a situation exists where an order is received from the order routing module . Thereupon, the fulfillment executable  proceeds with fulfillment of the order. Reporting into the fulfillment order tracking module , the fulfillment executable  reports the order, reports preparation of the food, may report out sending of the runner with the fulfillment container, and so forth.","Now, suppose that the fulfillment executable  receives an input indicating that the order itself has returned, with the contents, container, and slip. The operator at the fulfillment location, reports in to the fulfillment executable  through an interface (e.g., touch screen, keyboard, etc.) that the order has not been delivered. The operator or fulfillment worker may simply touch a touch screen device  indicating a status change to return the order to the fulfillment or location.","Delivery failure may occur for several reasons. For example, suppose that an order were placed, and then a parent had to leave his or her seat with a young child heading for a restroom. A delivery worker (runner, fulfillment personnel) may arrive at the designated seats with an order, only to find the seats empty. The runner will return to the fulfillment location and report that the order has not been delivered because the seats are empty. The fulfillment operator inputs through the device  the new status, received by the fulfillment executable .","In turn, the fulfillment executable  reports through the fulfillment ordering tracking module  to the core application  that the order was not fulfilled. The core application  may also collect the information concerning the reason the order has not been fulfilled. In either mode, the core application may then forward a message back through the SMS module , in the device of the customer who made the order.","The core application  may tell that customer that the order was fulfilled but undeliverable. The message may explain why the order was not delivered. For example, the core application  may include information that the seats were empty and any or all of the slip order information. The customer may then be requested to correct any information previously input improperly.","If a customer has used a wrong seat number, the customer will need to look about, in order to correct the information.","In other circumstances, for example, an order may be returned because it is deemed to be the improper order. Many of these types of corrections may be made immediately on site between the runner and the customer. Inasmuch as the printed slip contains ordering information, the customer will be able to see immediately that the information in the SMS message sent is indeed corroborated exactly in the printed slip.","In the case of a refused order, that information may also be sent by the fulfillment executable  to the fulfillment order tracking module  for disposition by the core application . On the one hand, a customers is responsible to pay for items ordered. If a customer has mis-keyed an order, the customer may still be held responsible. However, the management of the fulfillment location may also decide if an accommodation is to be made. If an accommodation is made, that accommodation may be input into the fulfillment executable , including any change in the order, change of prices, or other accommodation negotiated with the customer.","In one embodiment, a circumstance may arise where an order is delivered to a location where a high level discriminator is input incorrectly by a user. Specifically, for example, having a seat number or a row number off by a single increment is not a major difficulty. However, if a customer inputs a customer location that is off by a section or several sections, the distance from a fulfillment location may be economically insurmountable. The order may simply not be worth the difficulty of delivering it.","Again, some sort of accommodation may be made, or the customer may be held responsible under the agreed upon terms of the fulfillment process. For example, if a customer mis-keys a order, the customer may still be responsible to pay for the order, even if it cannot be delivered. Regardless of any accommodation to satisfy a customer, the core application  may re-visit operation of the order routing module  to determine whether or not this same fulfillment location should still be responsible for fulfillment of the order. In the event that the fulfillment location is not to be responsible a new order may be made up at a new fulfillment location, and delivered by a different runner to the proper location for the ordering customer.","Also, if a fulfillment location runs out of a product, the product may be removed from the menu available to people served by that location. Alternatively, orders for that product may be routed to and fulfilled by a fulfillment location elsewhere at the venue.","Referring to , the kiosk executable  may rely on any suitable platform operating on top of an operating system. For example, in one embodiment the Microsoft \u201cDot Net 3.5\u201d framework provides one suitable platform for executing the kiosk executable .","For example, the Dot Net framework of Microsoft provides a standardized library of executables to perform many of the commonly required functions that any application will need. Every application is going to need some type of input process, output process, access to various peripheral devices, and the like. Accordingly, a library of executables to perform this necessary \u201cinfrastructure\u201d functionality for an application may be pre-built, and ready to be adapted to a particular executable, such as the kiosk executable .","One advantage of a platform like the Dot Net framework is that the functionality desired for a particular application may be built into the main executable, but may rely on well tested, reliable, supporting routines in the libraries, rather than developing them anew with some particular programming interface with every application.","As a practical matter, the core application  may also rely on a certain amount of the Dot Net technology available from Microsoft or a similar system provided by another supplier. However, in the case of the core application , it may typically execute within or on top of a web browser. By contrast, the kiosk executable  may typically execute directly on top of the operating system of the computer on which it runs.","For example, the kiosk executable  and the core application  may actually share some of the infrastructure libraries provided Dot Net framework. Nevertheless, each may operate at a somewhat different level in the computer.","As discussed hereinabove, the core application  may interact with a customer web application , a mobile web application , a smart phone application , or a kiosk application  in order to perform certain functions, such as sign-up of a new customer. Inasmuch as an individual may access the web through any browser, any computer, and any smart phone, such an apparatus may or may not be actually affiliated with the customer. Accordingly, in one embodiment it may be most convenient not to draw any customer information from the application programming interface (API) of any particular device used by a user.","When relying on the kiosk application , particularly for customer sign up, the paradigm changes slightly. For example, at the kiosk application , a user may input a credit card using a credit card reader. Each credit card contains a magnetic strip containing certain key customer information. Accordingly, the kiosk application  is uniquely situated to read and use certain customer information directly.","The kiosk application  may be much more efficient, requiring much less time of the user, and providing greater throughput of users. This may be particularly important at an venue event, where the kiosk application  may be available. There, it may be queued-up with a long line of customers waiting. Of course, customer waiting is anathema to customer service.","It is desired in an embodiment of an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention to minimize lines waiting to access a kiosk application . Inasmuch as kiosk applications  are typically running at venues on kiosks where individual customers have arrived for an event, time is extremely important. Thus, minimizing the time and maximizing the throughput of each kiosk application  has significant commercial benefits.","Nevertheless, one need not suppose that a kiosk application  runs only in a fixed physical location at a particular kiosk at a totally dedicated computer. One of the benefits of a kiosk application  is the fact that it is simply available at a venue for signing up new customers. In one embodiment, the kiosk application  may be loaded onto a battery of computers. For example, a bank of computers may be set up temporarily on tables in a lobby or on a concourse of an event venue.","In other embodiments, individual technicians may provide laptop computers and assistance to customers in a venue location, such as on a concourse, in a lobby, or even in the stands. Thus, the kiosk application  may be loaded onto computers that are brought to a venue for a sign up process, and then are removed to another venue, or put to other uses. Nevertheless, the throughput and wait time issues may still be readily handled by having a kiosk application  running on a computer at a venue, or running on numerous computers at a venue when signing up users is desirable and readily tractable.","For example, in one embodiment, a kiosk application  may be installed on a portable computer. The portable computer may be carried through a crowd, or provided at a desk or table, such as a service counter or simply a temporary table, by a technician. Likewise, an individual may roam through crowds waiting to enter a venue, or through the stands, prior to beginning an event, seeking out individuals who desire to sign up for services.","A peripheral interface, such as a USB interface may connect an electronic card reader to the computer. Moreover, a mobile web access point such as a broadband access point, a wireless modem, a WiFi access point, or the like may likewise be connected to the mobile computer. Thus, an individual technician may bring the kiosk application  to an individual during times when the individual really has few other priorities, such as before or after the customer is able to take a seat assignment. Thus, time waiting in line to enter, or sitting in the stands waiting for the event to begin, or the like may be particularly useful time for signing up customers, as they often have nothing else of priority they can accomplish during that time.","In one example, the customer credit card is passed by a magnetic card reader connected as a peripheral to the computer of the kiosk application . From the card reader, the computer, executing the kiosk executable  may upload to the core application  selected customer information. This may relieve the customer of the need to key in name, credit card number, credit card expiration date, credit card security code, and the like.","Inasmuch as the kiosk executable  of the kiosk application  may be operating on a remote computer, the keyboard, handwriting interface, touchscreen interface, or any other interface may be relied upon to input data from a customer. For example, customer preferences as to food entres, season ticket stadium locations, and the like are not contained on credit card magnetic strips. However, a customer may input such information directly, or a technician may input it for a customer by way of the kiosk executable .","Credit card data, customer name and address information, and the like may be collected in association with, and therefore easily linked to, other customer preference information from menu, to season ticket seating, or the like.","Thus, in general, a kiosk executable  may receive inputs from a physical keyboard , a magnetic strip reader , or an on-screen keyboard . Each of these input devices  may be made available to interact directly with the customer. In other embodiments, the input devices  may be acted upon by the technician \u201cmanning\u201d the kiosk executable  and advising the customer, such as walking them through the signup process.","A representative or technician presenting the \u201ckiosk\u201d computer to a customer has the additional benefit of providing a point of sale presentation to the user, a response to questions of that user as a potential customer. The technician may do trouble shooting of either difficulties or questions that arise upon inputting responses to queries presented by the kiosk executable  to the customer.","The on-screen keyboard  may be configured as a simple touch screen menu, a touch screen template, or the like. A keyboard may be represented on part or all of the on-screen keyboard . Nevertheless, whether inputs come through a conventional keyboard , or some type of a stylized touch screen input device , a customer, a technician, or both may interact with the kiosk executable  to provide inputs, and to read instructions or outputs from the kiosk executable  communicating with them.","In general, any of the applications , , ,  whether hosted on a smart phone, a computer, a user's computer, or the like may interact with a variety of application programming interfaces (APIs). Each of these APIs is programmed to interface with some functionality of the core application .","For example, in , numerous functional modules were identified in association with the core application . In order for one of the web applications , , ,  to interact with the core application , an API dealing with the particular, desired functionality may be connected to interact with, or may be imbedded within, the kiosk executable  or other application , , , . In one currently contemplated embodiment, a customer information management module  may operate as an API to connect the kiosk executable  to the core application  to manage customer information. In general, each of these modules  or APIs  may provide an interface between the applicable application , , , , and the core application .","Referring to , while continuing to refer generally to all , in certain embodiments, the core application  may contain various modules executing certain logical steps. Among those logical steps is accessing data from and inputting data to the database . Likewise, a function of the core application  is also to execute the logical processing required to use data obtained from the database . It will process information in order to provide data to be stored in the database .","Therefore, one API  in the core application , or otherwise operably connected thereto, may be thought of as the data access layer API . One responsibility for the data access layer API  is interacting between the database , and the various processing modules  relied upon by the core application .","For example, the data access layer API  is responsible to know and recognize the executable procedures or the procedures executed by various executables among the modules  for using or preparing data taken from or being returned into the database . Primarily, the modules  may be responsible to put out and to retrieve information for use by executables within the core application . In order to do so, they may interact with the data access layer API . The data access layer API  has programmed into it a knowledge or information reflecting the procedures executed in the database  to store or retrieve information needed by the modules .","Certain efficiencies may be obtained by providing the data access layer API  between the modules  and the database . In one embodiment, each of the modules  may access the database  directly. Nevertheless, considering the complexities and the processing requirements of a database engine and database , the preprocessing available by the data access layer API  provides for streamlining calls to the database . Thus, one may think of the data access layer API  as a broker packaging the calls and data that will be exchanged with the database .","The SMS message interpretation module  receives SMS message from the SMS aggregator . Of course, the SMS messages originate at a message origination or message termination module , MO\/MT SMS module , a device of an individual user capable of sending out and receiving an SMS message. The interpretation module  receives an entire message, including all of its packaging information, such as metadata. In one embodiment, the message may be received as an XML document containing metadata, the actual message content, as well as any message packeting, such as headers, footers, and the like.","The message interpretation module  receives each document or SMS message from the SMS aggregator . The SMS message interpretation module  receives the entire message, and is responsible to subdivide it into its component parts. The interpretation module , for example, takes the message content and begins to parse it, seeking to identify recognizable words or synonyms corresponding to transactional or functional identifiers.","For example, a customer befuddled or otherwise confused or unable to navigate a menu or other transactional screen presented may type in the word \u201chelp.\u201d Accordingly the SMS message interpretation module  will find the text, recognize it as a request for help, and forward to the data access layer module  the request for help. Accordingly, the data access layer module  will then access the database  in order to retrieve the response to an input identified as help.","Meanwhile, the data access layer module  then provides the response back to the appropriate location. For example, inasmuch as a request for assistance or help is not an order for products, the data access layer module  may forward the response information from the database  back to the SMS message response module . Thus, even though the SMS message interpretation module  originates the request for help, the message response module  may actually receive back the content of the response to the help request.","In one embodiment of an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention, the data access layer module  may interact with an SMS order management module . In general, each of the modules  may access the database  through the data access layer module  by polling. The system  may alternatively operate on interrupts. Nevertheless, a system of polling by each of modules  allows each to check periodically whether any new information has been acquired by the database  for use by that particular module .","For example, the order management module  may receive parsed information provided from the message interpretation module . Typically, for example, the message interpretation module  may parse the content of an SMS message and determine whether an order has been placed, what that order is, and where that order is in processing. The order management module  may initiate the process of complying with the order, and may so notify the module , which then notifies the message response module .","Accordingly, the message response module  may rely on the data access layer module  to retrieve from the database  the information and text for the message response module  to build a message notifying the customer of the appropriate details, as the order has been received, thus confirming it. Likewise, the message response module  may also request additional information needed, such as, for example, a seat assignment, as requested by the order management module . Thus, the module  acts as a clearing house for information between the various modules , while also providing a consolidated access to the database  on behalf of all the modules .","In one embodiment, the email generation module  may provide email in messages or information to the email account identified with the customer. For example, a handheld electronic phone or similar device typically provides no written receipt. Nevertheless, when an order has been placed, and a charge has been made against the credit card of a customer, the customer typically will desire some form of receipt. Accordingly, the email generation module  may monitor action with respect to any customer, and report on that action as appropriate.","For example, the email generation module  may generate receipts and send them to the email account of a customer. Likewise, periodic, such as weekly or monthly accounting reports to each customer signed up for the system  may also originate as email from the generation module . Likewise, couponing, discount offers, advertising campaigns, and the like may be communicated to a customer by the email generation module .","Another situation where the email generation module  may be invoked is in signing up a user. The billing payment gateway  may handle all of the secure, confidential, or other sensitive information of a customer. Nevertheless, upon signup, a user may be provided a welcome message Likewise, special advertising, special offers, quick-reference key commands, or the like for interfacing with the system  may be provided by the email generation module  to a customer. The email generation module  obtains, by way of the data access layer module , information from the database , identifying, for example, new users or customers signed up, new actions taken with respect to any customer or order, and so forth.","The billing and payment (or billing\/payment) gateway module  may be invoked for any of several reasons. For example, upon signup of a new customer, a new credit card number and all of its associated information may be gathered by the billing and payment gateway module . Likewise, this billing and payment gateway module  may create a record of card holder information. Meanwhile, authorization may be sought from the card provider in order to verify that the card is valid and can be charged for orders. Meanwhile, the billing\/payment gateway module  may communicate through the module  to the database  to store and security access the customer information, including sensitive customer information.","In another situation, an incoming order may involve the billing\/payment gateway module . After, for example, a runner returns from attempting to deliver an order, or delivering the order, the system  tracks the disposition of that order. If the order was properly delivered and accepted, then the billing\/payment gateway module  may place a hold on the credit card account of the customer for the amount agreed upon.","Optimally, in order to have the benefit of batch processing, the gateway module  may execute all charges incurred during an event after the event is completed. Thus, the charges may be handled with a batch process more efficiently. Also, it is possible at the time an order is delivered that the gate module  is successful in placing a hold for a certain amount of money on a credit card account. Thus, the module  would have communicated to the database  that \u201chold\u201d information in the proper amount for that customer.","However, if a difficulty should arise, such as the actual transfer of money not being permitted, then the gateway module  may notify the module  with the proper information so that the message response module  may communicate that information to a customer. Likewise the gateway module  may send information to the core application  indicating that a billing problem exists with the particular customer, and the credit card number provided.","As a practical matter, the system  may actually be programmed to simply accept the charges, and pay the amount that was held, but actually never billed to the customer. However, the system may acquire information to ascertain customer satisfaction, identify a source of a problem, and eradicate the problem. This may be initiated upon detection of the foregoing failure. Accordingly, various flags may be set in database  identifying problematic account numbers, credit card numbers, customers, and so forth.","The billing\/payment gateway module  may also be invoked when a customer seeks to modify account information by accessing the core application  through one of the web applications , , , . In this instance, the gateway module  may send a request much as would occur at a new signup. Information may be requested from a customer, new authorization may be requested from a credit card provider, and so forth. All sensitive customer billing information may be consolidated to be managed exclusively by the billing\/payment gateway module . The billing\/payment gateway module  may actually be an API operating in conjunction with the data access layer module  of the core application . The actual payment gateway  may typically be operated as a third party service used by the system . It may actually provide the authorizations for transfers of assets in accounts.","In one embodiment, a phone number deactivation module  may be included in the modules  communicating with the data access layer module . The SMS aggregator  responsible to maintain the communication links with various SMS networks may regularly provide lists of phone numbers no longer valid. The deactivation module  may be responsible as an interface to control execution of a comparison of the list of deactivated phone numbers against the list of active customers with their respective phone numbers.","The deactivation module  may then communicate to the database  through the data access layer module  to remove certain phone numbers from the database . Alternatively, the deactivation module  may simply flag wrong numbers, and originate messages sent out by the email generation module  to the user indicating that the phone number no longer works, and that the customer must log into the system  on line to reconfirm or change, as appropriate, the phone number associate with the customer in the database .","In one embodiment, a practical problem may occur when a runner at a fulfillment location at a venue seeks to deliver an order to a particular section, row, and seat number, only to find no one present. When the runner returns to the service location, the worker may input the information indicating the order has failed to be delivered. Accordingly, the fulfillment executable  may, as described hereinabove, identify and initiate notification to the customer of the failure.","Thus, the order management module  and the message response module  may both be invoked to prepare a message to the customer. The customer may be notified of the disconnect in information, and be given an opportunity to correct ordering information, such as seat assignment, section, and the like. Accordingly, the order routing module  may then determine whether to attempt a re-delivery of the original product to the corrected order location, or to do otherwise.","For example, the system may otherwise determine that another fulfillment location may better fulfil the order, accordingly, the order routing module  may communicate to the data access layer module  the order routing information, to be stored in the database , and accessed subsequently and consequently by the fulfillment executable  as described hereinabove.","The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative, and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing description.
