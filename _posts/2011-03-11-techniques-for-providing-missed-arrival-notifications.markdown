In some instances, such unrest is the result of political clashes among political parties that support diverging political policies. In other instances, such unrest is the result of religious clashes among religious sects that support diverging religious views. Many of these countries have also experienced a rise in traditional kidnappings (e.g., a victim is held for a long period of time) and express kidnappings (e.g., a victim is held for a short period of time and taken to an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) to withdraw funds) due to the political climate and the religious climate within their borders. These countries, however, have not implemented systems directed towards limiting the amount of successful kidnappings.","In view of the foregoing, it may be understood that there may be significant problems and shortcomings associated with kidnapping notification technologies.","Techniques for providing missed arrival notifications are disclosed. In one particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as a method for providing missed arrival notifications comprising: receiving, from a user associated with a client device, travel information that indicates at least an expected destination and an expected route to the expected destination, tracking, on a notification system, the client device's progress in traveling the expected route to the expected destination, determining, on the notification system, whether the client device has deviated from the expected route to the expected destination, and initiating, on the notification system, an alert escalation procedure in response to determining that the client device has deviated from the expected route to the expected destination.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the travel information may indicate an expected time of arrival.","In accordance with further aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the expected destination may include a geographic location that is associated with geographic coordinates.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, tracking may further include receiving one or more progress updates from the client device.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, determining may further include comparing the expected route to an actual route.","In accordance with further aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the actual route may be derived based on the one or more progress updates.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, determining may further include applying a narrow travel range to the actual route.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, determining may further include applying a wide travel range to the actual route.","In accordance with further aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the alert escalation procedure may include a first alert level, a second alert level, and a third alert level.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the first alert level may include transmitting an alert to the client device to request a response from the user.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the second alert level may include transmitting one or more alerts to one or more third party systems.","In accordance with further aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the third alert level may include notifying an authority near a current location of the client device.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as at least one non-transitory processor readable storage medium for storing a computer program of instructions configured to be readable by at least one processor for instructing the at least one processor to execute a computer process.","In another particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as an article of manufacture for providing missed arrival notifications, the article of manufacture comprising: at least one non-transitory processor readable medium, and instructions stored on the at least one medium, wherein the instructions are configured to be readable from the at least one medium by at least one processor and thereby cause the at least one processor to operate so as to: receive, from a user associated with a client device, travel information that indicates at least an expected destination and an expected route to the expected destination, track, on a notification system, the client device's progress in traveling the expected route to the expected destination, determine, on the notification system, whether the client device has deviated from the expected route to the expected destination, and initiate, on the notification system, an alert escalation procedure in response to determining that the client device has deviated from the expected route to the expected destination.","In another particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as a system for providing missed arrival notifications system comprising: one or more processors communicatively coupled to a network, wherein the one or more processors are configured to: receive, from a user associated with a client device, travel information that indicates at least an expected destination and an expected route to the expected destination, track, on a notification system, the client device's progress in traveling the expected route to the expected destination, determine, on the notification system, whether the client device has deviated from the expected route to the expected destination, and initiate, on the notification system, an alert escalation procedure in response to determining that the client device has deviated from the expected route to the expected destination.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the travel information may indicate an expected time of arrival.","In accordance with further aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the expected destination may include a geographic location that is associated with geographic coordinates.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the one or more processors may be further configured to track by receiving one or more progress updates from the client device.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the one or more processors may be further configured to determine by comparing the expected route to an actual route.","In accordance with further aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the actual route may be derived based on the one or more progress updates.","The present disclosure will now be described in more detail with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof as shown in the accompanying drawings. While the present disclosure is described below with reference to exemplary embodiments, it should be understood that the present disclosure is not limited thereto. Those of ordinary skill in the art having access to the teachings herein will recognize additional implementations, modifications, and embodiments, as well as other fields of use, which are within the scope of the present disclosure as described herein, and with respect to which the present disclosure may be of significant utility.","Currently, a traveler to a foreign country may inform other individuals (e.g., family members, coworkers) of their expected itinerary (e.g., one or more expected destinations, one or more expected time of arrivals) as a safety precaution. If, for example, one of the informed individuals is unable to reach the traveler at an expected destination (e.g., a hotel) at an expected time, the individual may alert authorities, travel companions, or other family members in an attempt to locate the traveler and ensure the traveler's safety. Such a safety precaution, however, is grossly inefficient.","In one embodiment, certain techniques for providing missed arrival notifications are provided. In such an embodiment, a notification system (e.g., a server) may be communicatively coupled to a client device of a traveler. Accordingly, a traveler may enlist the missed arrival notification services provided by the notification system by subscribing to receive such missed arrival notification services.","Once a traveler has subscribed to receive the missed arrival notification services (e.g., creating an account, creating a username to access the account, creating a password to access the account), the traveler may input travel information into the notification system via the client device. Travel information may include any data that indicates any, or a combination, of an expected destination, an expected route to an expected destination, and an expected time of arrival.","Based on the travel information received, the notification system may initiate a tracking process that tracks the traveler's progress (e.g., the client device's progress) in traveling to the expected destination. The tracking process may include receiving one or more progress updates (e.g., Global Position System (GPS) updates) from the client device as the client device travels to the expected destination. In one embodiment, the tracking progress may be configured to track that the client device is generally headed toward the expected destination over time. In such an embodiment, the tracking process may track the progress of the client device in moving closer to the expected destination from one point-in-time to another point-in-time (e.g., a later point-in-time). In another embodiment, the tracking process may be configured to track the traveler's progress on an expected route to the expected destination. In such an embodiment, the tracking process may track the progress of the client device in moving from one sub-destination (e.g., a destination along an expected route to an expected destination) to another sub-destination along the expected route to the expected destination. In another embodiment, the tracking process may be configured to determine whether the traveler arrived at an expected destination by an expected arrival time.","In certain embodiments, the notification system may determine whether the client device has deviated from an expected route to an expected destination. Accordingly, the notification system may continuously compare an actual route of the client device (e.g., based on the progress updates provided) to an expected route of the client device. If, for example, the notification system determines that the client device has deviated (e.g., by applying a narrow travel range, by applying a wide travel range) from the expected route, an alert escalation procedure may be invoked.","The alert escalation procedure may include a first alert level, a second alert level, and a third alert level. In some embodiments, the alert escalation procedure may be configured to start at the first alert level, move next to the second alert level, and end at the third alert level. In other embodiments, the alert escalation procedure may be configured to start or end at any of the first alert level, the second alert level, and the third alert level. In one embodiment, the first alert level may include transmitting an alert to the client device requesting that the traveler input a code (e.g., a security code). In such an embodiment, if the traveler fails to input the code (e.g., within a predetermined amount of time), the alert escalation procedure may proceed to the second alert level. In such an embodiment, if the traveler inputs a covert distress signal (e.g., by pressing a particular button), the alert escalation procedure may immediately notify one or more authorities (e.g., police authorities near the client device's current location).","In another embodiment, the second alert level may include transmitting an alert to one or more third party systems (e.g., systems belonging to travel companions associated with the traveler, systems belonging to family members of the traveler, systems belonging to coworkers of the traveler, systems belonging to hotel workers located at a hotel at which the traveler is scheduled to stay). In such an embodiment, the users of the third party systems may attempt to contact the traveler. If such contact is successful and the traveler is not in danger, the alert escalation procedure may end. If such contact is not successful, the alert escalation procedure may proceed to the third alert level.","In another embodiment, the third alert level may include notifying one or more authorities near a current location of the traveler. In such an embodiment, the current location of the traveler may be derived from one or more progress updates provided by the client device.","The notification system may also be configured to initiate an alert escalation procedure in the event the traveler fails to arrive at an expected destination by an expected time of arrival. Prior to initiating the alert escalation procedure and near the expected time of arrival, the notification system may request that traveler indicate whether they have arrived at the expected destination using the client device (e.g., by entering a code). If, for example, the traveler indicates that they have arrived at the expected destination, the notification system may not invoke the alert escalation procedure. If, however, the traveler fails to indicate that they have arrived at the expected destination, the notification system may invoke the alert escalation procedure described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","100","110","120","140","140","200","110","120","140","140","150","140","160","1","140","160","1","140","142","144","146","140","140","170","170","180","1","140","140","110","120","150","140","190","120","122","124","126"]},"With reference to computer system  of , modem , network interface , or some other method may be used to provide connectivity from one or more of client  and client  to network .

A travel range may indicate how much a user (e.g., client device) may stray from an expected route before it is considered a deviation. A narrow travel range may allow for a minimal amount of straying (e.g., no more than 100 yards from an expected route, no more than 200 yards from an expected route). A wide travel range may allow for a large amount of straying (e.g., 50 miles from an expected route, 100 miles from an expected route).","In certain embodiments, progress tracking module  may determine whether to apply a narrow travel range or a wide travel range based on conditions within a country in which a user (e.g., client device) is traveling. For example, progress tracking module  may determine to apply a narrow travel range based on a recent report that foreigners have been targeted for kidnappings within the country in which a user (e.g., client device) is currently traveling. In another example, progress tracking module  may determine to apply a wide travel range based on a report that indicates that kidnappings are not common within the country in which a user (e.g., client device) is currently traveling. In other embodiments, progress tracking module  may determine whether to apply a narrow travel range or a wide travel range based on preferences of a user or design preferences.","If, for example, the progress tracking module  determines that a user (e.g., client device) has deviated from an expected route, an alert escalation procedure may be invoked.","Alert escalation module  may be configured to invoke and execute an alert escalation procedure.

In yet another example, travel information that indicates that a user expects to arrive at a home in Mexico City, Mexico at 8 PM and an expected route to the home may be received.","At block , the client device's progress in traveling the expected route to the expected destination is tracked on a notification system. A tracking process may track the client device's progress in traveling to the expected destination. The tracking process may operate by receiving on or more progress updates (e.g., Global Position System (GPS) updates) from the client device as the client device travels to the expected destination.","At block , whether the client device has deviated from the expected route to the expected destination is determined on the notification system. In one embodiment, determining whether the client device has deviated from the expected route to the expected destination may include applying a narrow travel range to the actual route. In another embodiment, determining whether the client device has deviated from the expected route to the expected destination may include applying a wide travel range to the actual route.","At block , an alert escalation procedure is initiated on the notification system in response to determining that the client device has deviated from the expected route to the expected destination.","At block , the method  may end.","At this point it should be noted that providing missed arrival notifications in accordance with the present disclosure as described above may involve the processing of input data and the generation of output data to some extent. This input data processing and output data generation may be implemented in hardware or software. For example, specific electronic components may be employed in a progress tracking module or similar or related circuitry for implementing the functions associated with providing missed arrival notifications in accordance with the present disclosure as described above. Alternatively, one or more processors operating in accordance with instructions may implement the functions associated with providing missed arrival notifications in accordance with the present disclosure as described above. If such is the case, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that such instructions may be stored on one or more processor readable storage media (e.g., a magnetic disk or other storage medium), or transmitted to one or more processors via one or more signals embodied in one or more carrier waves.","The present disclosure is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein.
