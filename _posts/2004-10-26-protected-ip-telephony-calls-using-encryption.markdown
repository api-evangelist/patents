title: Protected IP telephony calls using encryption
abstract: Communication information transmitted in the broadband communication system may be in a packet format and secured using encryption techniques, for example encryption software, including a means for providing an initial security key and updated security keys to the various pieces of communication equipment located throughout the broadband communication system. When communication equipment, for example a gateway, is first registered with, for example, an IP central station, the IP central station assigns an initial encryption key to the gateway that is assigned and retained by a server, for example a call manager server, and the gateway (e.g., broadband residential gateway). This initial encryption key may be used to establish a secure two way communication between two pieces of communication equipment as an originating point communication equipment and a terminating point communication equipment.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 09\/475,661 filed Dec. 30, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,889,321 which is incorporated herein by reference.","A cross-reference list of related applications is provided at the end of the Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments section of the present application.","The present invention relates to communication between users in diverse communication systems, and more particularly, to providing secure communications in a broadband communication system including an Internet Protocol Telephony Network and public switched telephone network.","Present day telephony voice networks, have a network built around circuit switches, end offices, a toll network, tandem switches, and twisted pair wires. These voice networks are referred to as a public switched telephone network (PSTN) or plain old telephone service (POTS). Due to bandwidth limitations of plain old telephone service (POTS), there is an inherent inability to efficiently integrate multiple types of media such as telephony, data communication for personal computers (PC), and television (TV) broadcasts. Accordingly, a new broadband architecture is required. This new architecture gives rise to a new array of user services including new ways of securing communications.","Communications, for example telephone calls, made on existing wireline PSTN have a certain level of security since they are comprised of a dedicated hard-wired systems. On the other hand, communications made using packet-based broadband communication networks (e.g., IP telephony) are transmitted through a shared media may be accessed by unauthorized hackers that have access to the shared media. The level of security on a shared media system is thus less than the level of security offered by traditional dedicated hard-wired systems. Therefore, there is a need to increase the security of communications (e.g., IP telephony call) made using a packet based broadband communication system.","Aspects of the invention include providing broadband access capabilities or enhanced services for use in conjunction with a packetized network such as an Internet Protocol (IP) based system infrastructure.","Other aspects of the invention include providing one or more of the following either individually, or in any combination or sub-combination:","a new broadband architecture;","broadband network capabilities, including local access;","enhanced services for use in conjunction with a packetized network such as an Internet Protocol (IP) based system infrastructure. One such enhanced service includes enhanced security communications.","The present invention provides for protected communications in a powerful, facilities-based, broadband communications system that guarantees voice, data and video communication reliability and security to users for an multimedia system including integrated telephone, television and data network. Packetized communication information transmitted in the broadband communication system may be secured using encryption techniques, for example encryption software. Such techniques may include a means for providing an initial security key and updated security keys to the various pieces of communication equipment located throughout the broadband communication system, for example a customer premises gateway (e.g., a broadband residential gateway (BRG)) or a gateway for inter-linking with another communication network (e.g. voice gateway (VG)).","In one variation of the invention, when equipment, for example, a gateway, is first registered with, for example, an IP central station, the IP central station assigns an initial encryption key that is retained by a server, for example a call manager (CM) server, and the gateway. The network entity in the IP central station that assigns the initial security key (e.g., encryption key) may be, but is not limited to, an authentication server. This authentication server may be interconnected to a central router in the IP central station. This initial encryption key may be used to establish a secure communication between two or more communication entities. Such entities might involve an originating point communication equipment (OPCE) and a terminating point communication equipment (TPCE), for example, the BRG (OPCE) and the CM (TPCE), the BRG (OPCE), BRG, and another BRG (TPCE), BRG, or the BRG and a gateway for interfacing with another communication system (e.g. VG). Whenever a user first activates a secure communication feature before or during a communication session, the origination point communication equipment (e.g., BRG) may send the terminating point communication equipment (e.g., BRG) a packet that includes a private key which may be the BRG's initial encryption key. Subsequently the two pieces of communication equipment will encrypt and decrypt communication packets to one another using the private key. A private key as used in the context of the present invention may be confidential to a user and the system or may be a private key as in the context of known private key\/public key encryption systems known in the art. If the communication is between a gateway and, for example, the server that assigned the initial private key to the gateway, then the origination point communication equipment may begin encrypting communications with the terminating point communication equipment (in this case a server) without first sending the private key to the terminating point communication equipment. The secured encrypted packets may be part of one or more legs in, for example, a conference call, a teleconference, or a multimedia session.","In another variation of the present invention, the encryption key (including the initial encryption key) may be repeatedly updated and changed at various time intervals. The repeated updates may be at periodic (e.g., daily) or at random time intervals. Updates of the encryption key may occur when the secure call feature is active or inactive, so that a hacker that breaks an encryption key at any point in time will not have continuous communication security intrusion. For additional security the system may assign a unique randomly generated encryption key to each packet during the communication session and provide each new key to the communication equipment (e.g., BRG) in each prior information packet transmission.","In still another variation of the present invention, a secure call feature may be activated and deactivated by the user at anytime before or during (i.e., real time activation) an existing communication session (e.g., telephone call, data, video, and\/or multimedia session). The customer premises equipment (e.g., the BRG) may have, for example, a \u201csecure\u201d button to allow the caller to activate the secure feature on calls or data sessions. The entire session (e.g., IP telephone call) or a portion thereof may be secured using encryption in response to the user pressing the \u201csecure\u201d button. If the user presses the \u201csecure\u201d button again the security encryption may turn off, so that only a portion of a communication session will be secure. Alternatively, the feature could be activated or deactivated by using a feature code input via a POTS phone set or a command entered using a PC.","In yet another variation of the present invention, the secure call feature may by used to secure one type of media using encryption while not securing other types of media in a multimedia communication session. A user may enter a secure session feature code which encrypts the data (or text) portion of a multimedia session while the voice portion is not encrypted. Thus, a user may send certain documents securely to one party while they are talking with the party and\/or other parties at the same time. Alternatively, different media types, for example audio, text, and multimedia audio and video, may be secured at different levels of security using for example different encryption types or algorithms (e.g., DES, PGP, RSA, etc.).","In an even further variation of the present invention, a server, for example a call manager (CM) may coordinate a secure communication between two pieces of communication equipment by translating between two different encryption algorithms in two separate legs of a communication session (e.g., a telephone call). Alternatively, the server may send algorithms to a piece of communication equipment so that the various pieces of communication equipment are using the same algorithm. A dedicated server for handling secure transmissions may be coupled to a central router in the IP central station.","In another variation of the present invention, control of the secure communication may be transferred from, for example an originating gateway to a terminating gateway. In this case the encryption of a secure communication session may begin by using the originating gateway's key but then start using the terminating gateway's key.","Additional levels of security may be provided by utilizing further keys. For example, one additional private key may be a secret serial number, a manufacturer's assigned unique number, or a system assigned address for the BRG or PC. Further, the user may share a password with the intended recipient. If the private key assigned by a CM is used together with a secret serial number and a password, at least three levels of security are provided depending on the appropriately shared algorithm.","The on net communications, for example telephone calls, within the broadband communication system may be encrypted but the on net to off net communications for example telephone calls including a PSTN portion, may be partially encrypted. By using the \u201csecure\u201d feature confidential information can be protected from hackers while the information is transmitted through the communication network. However, any communication which includes a leg in another communications system, such as a PSTN, may only have encryption security while the communication packets propagates in the broadband communication system (e.g., IP network). Once the communication enters for example the PSTN, it has only that security provided by the traditional wireline PSTN. On the other hand, the voice gateway entry to the PSTN may coordinate with the terminating voice station to provide on or multiple levels of security.","Although the invention has been defined using the appended claims, these claims are exemplary and limiting to the extent that the invention is meant to include one or more elements from the apparatus and methods described herein and in the applications incorporated by reference in any combination or sub-combination. Accordingly, there are any number of alternative combinations for defining the invention, which incorporate one or more elements from the specification (including the drawings, claims, and applications incorporated by reference) in any combinations or sub-combinations.","A manner of providing for secured communications in a broadband communication is provided. Communication information transmitted in the broadband communication system may be packetized and secured using encryption techniques, for example encryption software, including a means for providing an initial security key and updated security keys to the various pieces of communication equipment located throughout the broadband communication system. The security key may be updated by the system at various time intervals. The user may activate the security feature at any time before or during a communication. The use may also select the level of security used and the type of media to which security is to be applied.","A new system is provided for broadband access and applications such as the secured communications. Unless otherwise indicated by the appended claims, the present invention is not limited to the preferred embodiments described in this section but is applicable to other integrated multimedia communication systems.","I. Integrated Communication System Overview","Referring to , an exemplary embodiment of a broadband network . The broadband network generally provides interconnection between a plurality of customer locations utilizing various interconnection architectures including Internet Protocol (IP) based network, various existing systems (legacy systems) such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), ATM networks, the Internet, signaling networks, as well as other systems. The broadband network provides versatile intelligent conduits that may carry, for example, Internet Protocol (IP) telephony or multimedia signals between the customer premises over, for example, the public switched telephone network, Internet, or wireless communication networks.","Again referring to , the broadband network  may include one or more customer premises equipment (CPE) units . The customer premise equipment  may be variously configured. In one example, the customer premise equipment  may include one or more local control devices such as a broadband residential gateway (BRG) . Although the broadband residential gateway is preferably disposed in a residence for many aspects of the invention, in exemplary embodiments, it may also be disposed in a business or other location. The broadband residential gateway  may be variously configured to provide one or more integrated communication interfaces to other devices within the customer premise equipment  such as televisions (TV), personal computers (PC), plain old telephone system (POTS) phone(s), video phones, IP enabled phones, and other devices. For example, the broadband residential gateway  may provide one or more telephone port connections (e.g., plain old telephone system), Ethernet connections, coaxial connections, fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) connections, wireless local area network (LAN) connections, firewire connections, and\/or other connections to a plurality of devices such as plain old telephones, IP based phones, television converters, e.g., cable television (CATV) set top devices, televisions, digital televisions, high definition televisions (HDTV), video phones, and other devices. In exemplary embodiments, the broadband residential gateway  may support communications between any of the aforementioned devices in intra-premises calling and\/or extra-premises calling. Further, when the broadband residential gateway  is used in a business environment, it can function as a private branch exchange or key type telephone system.","In , broadband residential gateway  is illustrated as a single physical device. This configuration is appropriate where centralization of maintenance and control is desirable. Alternatively, the broadband residential gateway  may be separated into more than one physical device allowing functionality to be distributed to a plurality of different physical locations in the customer premise and\/or broadband network . However, in many embodiments, having a centralized broadband residential gateway  located in a single location provides ease of maintenance, control, and re-configuration as well as a reduction in cost due to shared functionality. For example, the broadband residential gateway may be configured to provide the intelligence needed to allow each of the customer premises equipment devices to operate within the broadband network . For example, analog voice may be converted to digital data and packetized for transmission in an appropriate output protocol such as an Internet protocol (IP).","In exemplary embodiments, the broadband residential gateway  may function to couple devices within the customer premise equipment  to the rest of the broadband network  using any suitable broadband communication mechanism. In the embodiment shown in , the broadband residential gateway  utilizes a hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  to couple the broadband residential gateway  to the rest of the broadband network . The hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  may be preferred in many embodiments over other broadband communication mechanisms because of the large number of homes currently connected to cable networks, the capacity for shared access, and the ability for asymmetric data access speeds which allow high quantities of data to be distributed to the various devices in the customer premises equipment . The hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  may include coaxial cable and\/or optical fiber networks in any suitable combination. The hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  may provide an intelligent broadband conduit between the broadband residential gateway  and a gateway such as the head-end hub (HEH) . The head-end hub  may be variously configured to provide various services and\/or interconnections with the rest of the broadband network . For example, the head-end hub  may provide an interconnection point to gather and aggregate external services (e.g., off air and satellite video, public switched telephone network voice, multimedia messages, and Internet data) for distribution to and from the hybrid fiber-coaxial plant . With respect to telephony and multimedia calls, the head-end hub  may function as intelligent conduit for connection and communication between the hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  and external networks such as an IP network  and\/or an ATM\/frame relay\/cell relay network .","The broadband network  may include any number of interconnected head-end hubs , IP networks , and\/or ATM networks . Further, the IP network  and\/or ATM network  may be connected to one or more other networks and devices such as:\n\n","The IP network  and\/or ATM network  may include one or more routers and\/or other devices to route, for example, telephony calls, multimedia calls, signaling messages, administrative messages, programming messages and\/or computer data between the various devices in the broadband network  such as the head-end hub , the public switched telephone network , the private branch exchange (PBX) , as well as the other devices discussed above. In preferred embodiments, the information traveling in the IP network  may be packetized and formatted in accordance with one of the Internet protocols. The IP network  may also include gateways to interface with the various other networks and\/or devices. For example, the gateways may be distributed at the edge of the IP network where the IP network interfaces with one of the other devices or networks. Alternatively, the gateways interfacing the IP central station  to, for example, the Internet , public switched telephone network (PSTN) , signaling system 7 (SS7) , wireless networks , ATM\/frame\/cell relay networks  may be provided in the IP central station , or in both the IP network  and the IP central station , and\/or partially distributed between the IP network  and the IP central station . Where the gateways are separated by an IP network , an appropriate transport protocol may be utilized to logically connect the IP central station  to the particular gateway.","The IP central station(s)  may be connected to, for example, one or more IP networks , ATM networks , secure management data networks , and\/or administration centers . The IP central station  may be variously configured to include one or more servers and\/or one or more gateways. In exemplary embodiments, the servers and gateways provide the necessary intelligence and traffic management capabilities to enable information, e.g., IP telephony signals, to travel through the broadband network . For example, the IP central station  may be configured to manage voice information transfer from the public switched telephone network , through the IP network , and into and out of one or more devices such as those connected to a broadband residential gateway . The IP central station may be configured to store various control and system information such as location, address, and\/or configurations of one or more broadband residential gateways , as well as other routing and call set-up information.","In exemplary embodiments, one or more administration centers  may be connected to the IP network  and provide billing and local directory number portability administration. The local number portability may be handled by one or more Local Service. Management System (LSMS) which may be included in the administration center  and\/or in the IP central station . Further, the Secure Management Data Network  may also include a mechanism for transferring various information such as billing, call tracking, and\/or customer service provisioning. Various existing systems may be utilized to provide this information such as existing billing systems (OSS)  and\/or one or more network operations center (NOC). The network operations centers may be included in the administration center , the IP central station , and\/or the billing system . The network operations center (NOC) may be variously configured to include a translation server to allow communications with the various disparate entities (e.g., legacy systems) in the broadband network .","The IP network  and\/or the ATM network  illustrated in  may include one or a plurality of sub-networks. Each of the sub-networks may include its own IP central station  in a distributed configuration, with certain routing data replicated across all IP central stations or each sub-network may be connected to a single centralized IP central station . Where the IP network  includes one or more sub-networks, each sub-network may be connected to multiple head-end hubs . Further, each head-end hub  may be connected to multiple hybrid fiber-coaxial plants , and each hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  may be connected to multiple pieces of customer premises equipment  and\/or broadband residential gateways . The IP network  provides an interconnected broadband network which may be utilized to transport and route packetized information to and from diverse geographic locations and may be used on a national or international basis. Further, the IP network  and\/or ATM network  may utilize private network facilities and\/or may be provisioned over a shared network such as the Internet.","The IP central station  may be configured to provide connectivity for the broadband residential gateway  to the Internet  (e.g., World Wide Web (www)), as well as connectivity to other external networks such as public switched telephone network  and signaling system 7 (SS7)  for end-to-end voice, multimedia, and data applications, for example voice over IP telephony. IP packets traveling through the IP network provide for priority so that, for example, voice packets are given priority over data packets to maintain certain VoIP telephony QoS requirements and a leased line concept for packet traffic which may have an even higher priority. However, the system is sufficiently flexible so that the priority can be dynamically altered according to customer preferences, variable billing rates, traffic patterns, and\/or congestion.","A. Internet Protocol Central Station","Referring to , the IP central station  may be variously configured. In preferred embodiments, it may be configured to ensure seamless integration of IP based communication system including the IP network  with the public switched telephone network , signaling system  (SS7) network , and the Internet  so that packetized data, for example, voice calls and information data, is properly transferred between the broadband residential gateway , the public switched telephone network  and\/or the Internet . In one embodiment, the hybrid fiber-coaxial plant , head-end hub , and IP network , provide a virtual signaling conduit for packetized voice and data which may, with the coordination of the IP central station , be provided in the appropriate format between the broadband residential gateway  and the public switched telephone network  and\/or Internet .","Again referring now to , the IP central station  may include a central router , for example, a gigabit switch, which may be utilized to interconnect various servers and gateways contained in the IP central station . The central router  provides for example Ethernet switching and aggregate traffic between servers, gateways and the IP network  and\/or ATM network  backbone. In one exemplary embodiment, the central router  provides high-speed, non-blocking IP and IP multicast Layer 3 switching and routing. The IP central station  may include one or more of the following servers: the least cost server (LCS) , the time of day (TOD) server , the dynamic host control protocol (DHCP) server, the trivial file transfer protocol (TFTP) server, and the domain name service (DNS) server , the system management (SM) server , the call manager (CM) server , the announcement server (AS) , the multimedia server (MS) , and\/or the conference server (CS) . As illustrated in , the servers may be separate servers, for example the call manager server , or may be incorporated into a single server. In the exemplary embodiment, the dynamic host control protocol server ; trivial file transfer protocol server , and the domain name service server  are each incorporated in a single server facility. Each server in the IP central station  may include computer(s), storage device(s), and specialized software for implementing particular predefined functions associated with each server. In this manner, the servers in the IP central station may be provisioned as a main server and one or more back-up servers to provide redundant processing capabilities. Similarly, the router may be implemented as a main router and a back-up router with similar routing functionality.","The IP central station  may also include, for example, one or more of the following gateways: a element management gateway (EMG) , an accounting gateway (AG) , an Internet (Boarder) gateway (IG) , a signaling system 7 (SS7)) gateway (SG) , a voice gateway (VG) , and\/or a multimedia gateway (MG) . The IP central station  may utilize one or more of these gateways to provide centralized system intelligence and control of voice and\/or data IP packets.","In exemplary embodiments, the dynamic host control protocol server  and domain name service server  may operate to dynamically assign IP addresses devices in the customer premise equipment . Where a dynamic IP assignment scheme is used, the customer premises equipment may be provided with one or a plurality of dynamic IP assignment when activated initially, and\/or at the initiation of each active secession. Where an IP address is assigned when the device is initially activated, it may be desirable to assign a single IP address to a single broadband residential gateway and assign a port address to devices connected to the broadband residential gateway . In other embodiments, an individual IP address may be assigned to each device coupled to the broadband residential gateway . For example, the broadband residential gateway may include and\/or be coupled to one or more cable modems, IP phones, plain old telephone system phones, computers, wireless devices, CATV converters, video phones, and\/or other devices which each may be assigned a unique static and\/or dynamic IP address and\/or a port of a one of these IP addresses. The particular protocol for allocating IP addresses and\/or ports may be specified using protocols defined in the dynamic host control protocol server . In exemplary embodiments, the dynamic host control protocol server  and DN server  may be configured to assign available IP addresses from address pools based, for example, on the identity or type of requesting device, the amount of use expected for the requesting device, and\/or predefined assignment protocols defined in the dynamic host control protocol server  and DN server . In centralized embodiments, it may be desirable to configure the call manager (CM)  to provide sufficient information such that the domain name service server  can distinguish between static IP devices, dynamic IP devices, registered devices, unregistered devices, and registered devices that have been assigned to a particular class of service e.g., data vs. telephony, un-provisioned, vs. provisioned, etc.","The trivial file transfer protocol (TFTP) server  may be configured to transfer certain information to\/from one or more broadband residential gateways . In exemplary embodiments, the trivial file transfer protocol server  provides Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) configuration information containing QoS parameters and other information required for the broadband residential gateway  to operate optimally.","The time-of-day (TOD) server  may include a suitable facility for maintaining a real time clock such as an RFC 868-compliant time server. In exemplary embodiments, the time-of-day server  provides system messages and\/or responses to system inquiries containing a coordinated time, e.g., universal coordinated time (UCT). The universal coordinated time may be used by any of the servers and\/or devices in the broadband network . For example, the broadband residential gateway  may use the universal coordinated time to calculate the local time for time-stamping error logs.","The system management (SM) server  may include responsibility for the overall operational state and functioning of components the broadband network , either alone, or in combination with other system management servers . The system management (SM) server  may be variously configured to provide monitoring and administrative functions for devices within the broadband network . For example, the system management server  may be configured to provide management of various database functions, memory buffer functions, and software utility functions within the broadband network . Software management includes, for example, version control, generic control, and\/or module control.","The least cost server (LCS)  may be variously configured to enable the system to determine the least cost routing of telephone and data transmission throughout the network. The least cost server  may also provide one or more broadband residential gateway users capability to select between, for example, cost and Quality of Service (QoS).","The announcement service (AS) server  may be variously configured. In exemplary embodiments, it may store and send announcements to specified destinations and\/or all destinations based on instructions received by, for example, the call manager (CM) server . The announcement server  receives, for example, Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) or later signaling (e.g., HGCP\u2014an ITU standard Gateway Control Protocol) control messages from the call manager , and sends announcements to one or more voice gateways (VG)  and\/or the one or more broadband residential gateway  (e.g., using Real Time Protocol (RTP) packets). The announcement server  may send an announcement once, a predetermined number of times; or in a continuous loop. The announcement server  may detect when a phone or other device has been taken off-hook and play an advertisement or other announcement to the user. Where a user has signed-up for an advertising plan whereby phone rates are reduced in return for advertising revenue generated by the advertisements, the announcement server  may be utilized to track the number of individuals with a particular income, age, or other profile which hear the advertisement. The announcement server  may respond to requests from individual system devices such as one of the broadband residential gateways  and\/or under control of, for example, the call manager . Where the announcement server is under control of the call manager , the call manager may be configured to control various operating parameters of the announcement server. For example, the call manager  may request that certain announcements are sent once, a specified number of times, or in a continuous loop.","In still further embodiments, announcements may be generated elsewhere in the broadband network , stored as files, and distributed to one or more announcement servers via a file transfer protocol or resource such as the trivial file server  using one or more file transfer protocols. In many embodiments, it is desirable to store announcements in an appropriate encoding format (e.g., G.711 or G.729) within the Announcement Server. The announcement may have an audio component and\/or a audio\/video component. The audio\/video component may be stored using a combination of an encoding format (e.g., G.711) and\/or a standard file format such as wave (WAV), MPEG, and other suitable formats.","In one exemplary method of operation, a user picks up a telephone which sends a signal to the call manager . Subsequently, the call manager  may established a connection to the announcement server  and play one or more pre-recorded and\/or predetermined announcement (hypertext and\/or audio). Signaling tones such as a busy signal may be played by the broadband residential gateway  or the call manager , but Special Information Tones (SIT) and\/or messages may also be included as part of an announcement file. In this way, the user experience is enhanced such that the user receives a busy message and\/or hypertext announcement providing one of several options for contacting the called party. The announcement server  may have information entered by a user using, for example, a broadband residential gateway to provide additional information to the called party. The additional information may include the ability to leave a message, type-in a chat note, page the called party, barge-in on the call, and\/or other user or system defined call handling capabilities.","The announcement server  may also be programmed with various system messages such as an announcement indicating that a number dialed is incorrect or that the call did not go through as dialed, that the lines are busy, that all lines between two countries are currently busy, that the called party has changed numbers, that the called parties phone has been disconnected, that one or more system errors have occurred, and\/or other announcement messages.","The call manager (CM)  may be variously configured. In exemplary embodiments, the call manager  provides a centralized call control center for supporting call set-up and tear-down in the broadband network . The call manager  may be configured to include trunk and line information maintenance, call state maintenance for the duration of a call, and\/or user service features execution. The call manager  may also provide for call processing functions such as a standardized call model for processing the various voice connections such as voice over IP calls. In exemplary embodiments, a standardized \u201copen\u201d call model may be utilized which supports standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) to provide transport services and other user functions such as calling cards. An open application programming interface and call set-up interface in the call manager will enable third party applications to be loaded into the call manager  and broadband residential gateway . This will facilitate the development of third party applications for enhancing the functionality of components in the broadband network . For example, third parties and other equipment vendors may manufacture various broadband residential gateways  for use in the broadband network  by writing applications to support the open call model of the call manager . The call manager  and\/or broadband residential gateway  may also be configured to execute and\/or accept commands form a standardized scripting language which may generate instructions for the call manager  and\/or broadband residential gateway  to execute various functions. The scripting functionality may include the ability to execute an entire call model including interfaces to the signaling system 7 (SS7) , public switched telephone network , IP network , ATM\/frame\/cell relay network , and\/or other functions within, for example, IP central station  such as the multimedia server , announcement server , system management server , conference server , time of day server , least cost server , and\/or domain name server .","The call manager  may also be configured to maintain the call states for each call it handles (e.g., a voice over IP call) and respond to system events created by, for example, the multimedia gateway control protocol (MGCP) messages and\/or integrated services digital network user part (ISUP) messages for signaling system 7 (SS7) protocol that may occur during the processing of a call. Exemplary events handled by the call manager  include call state changes, call feature changes\/call feature triggering events, changes in the status of lines and trunks, and\/or error conditions. Further, the call manager  may interact with devices connected to a single circuit on the public switched telephone network  and\/or a device connected to a port of the broadband residential gateway . In this manner, new devices may be added to the infrastructure and operate using the open call model contained in the call manager .","The call manager  may also include storage for subscriber and network configuration, a cache server for faster access to frequently used data, a routing engine for selecting an appropriate routing algorithm (e.g., least cost routing), and\/or a service broker which provides the data and logic for specific services. In addition, the call manager  may include an authentication (AC) server  that provides authentication of various devices, objects, packets and users in the integrated multimedia system. In this manner, a user may verify the identity of the calling or called party.","The call manager  may interact with the signaling gateway (SG) , the accounting gateway (AG) , the element management gateway (EMG) , the voice gateway (VG) , and the multimedia gateway (MG)  using any suitable protocol such as IP and an interconnection mechanism such as the central router . In one preferred embodiment, the call manager  may be configured to utilize signaling messages such as: a) ISUP messages over Common Object Broker Architecture (COBRA) interface to and\/or from signaling gateway , b) MGCP, SIP\u2014simple internet protocol, H.GCP, and\/or other suitable control messages to and\/or from the announcement server , c) call event records in modified Radius format to the accounting gateway , d) Radius (or Enhanced Radius or compatible protocol) control messages to and\/or from the voice gateway  and\/or the broadband residential gateways , and e) signaling network management protocol (SNMP) messages to and\/or from the element management gateway .","The call manager  may incorporate one or more databases. For example, the call manager  may include database information such as (1) a' resources database that provides an identification of what resources are connected to the broadband network  and their current state; (2) a trunk\/gateway database that indicates which gateway serves what circuits in a trunk; (3) a customer database which indicates whether a call is authorized, identifies what services a line supports and determines whether a telephone number is on or off the integrated IP communication network; (4) a numbering plan\/least cost routing database which provides routing information that enables the IP central station  to choose the correct trunk as a function of the call number; and (5) a local number portability (LNP) database that indicates the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) and associated prefixes which are open for association with the number portability service; and (6) an address of the service control point (SCP) towards which requests for translating these local portability numbers should be routed.","In exemplary embodiments, the broadband network  includes equipment compatible with the COBRA standard. COBRA may be utilized to allow applications from a plurality of vendors to operate with each other. The COBRA standard allows a company, such as AT&T, to build its network using multi-vendor equipment and yet ensure seamless integration and operation. Some of the major areas covered by COBRA v. 2.2 includes: Inter-ORB Bridge Support, General Inter-ORB Protocol (GIOP) support, Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (HOP) support, and Environment Specific Inter-ORB Protocol (ESIOP) support. The call manager  may integrate these protocols to facilitate call set-up with diverse equipment. This is advantageous in that equipment from a plurality of vendors may inter-operate over the broadband network  without modification.","The multimedia server (MS)  may be variously configured. For example, one or more multimedia servers may provide support for multimedia messaging service and\/or the overall management of multimedia voice and mail messages transmitted across the broadband network . The multimedia server may be configured to support e-mail (e.g., html) messages, voice mail (audio) messages, and\/or video mail (audio and video) messages. The multimedia messages may include standard pre-configured system messages, advertising messages, and\/or user defined messages. In either event, where the messages are stored in a centralized location, the multimedia server may provide such storage. Where the multimedia server  provides storage for the multimedia messages, a database may be utilized for indexing, storage, and retrieval of such messages. In exemplary systems, the user may access predetermined ones of these messages. The multimedia server  may utilize IP as a method of communicating with other devices across the broadband network .","The conference server (CS)  may be configured to provide for multiparty conference calls using, for example, IP voice packets during an IP telephony or multimedia session call. The conference server  may include specialized software that runs on a computing platform having associated multiplexing and demultiplexing capability for segregating and aggregating user information packets. For example, the conference server may log several calls into a conference session. When information packets are sent from one or more phones, they are aggregated and sent to the other phones on the conference call. The conference server  may use any suitable communication protocol such as H.GCP or SIP. The conference server  may function to aggregate user information from two or more users onto a single call path. The conference server  may include one or more \u201ccall-in numbers\u201d and be controlled from any location, e.g., a centralized operator location and\/or one or more broadband residential gateways . It may be desirable to have the conference server  configured such that some callers simply monitor the call without voice interruption while other callers have both voice transmit and receive capabilities. Where a caller is not given the privileges associated with active participation in the call, voice packets from these users are discarded. For example, a CEO may have a conference call with a plurality of financial advisors and invite the press to listen on the call without interruption capabilities.","The gateways in the IP central station  may be configured to provide translation of signals to and\/or from the various servers in the IP central station , the IP network , the public switched telephone network , the signaling system 7 (SS7) network , the Internet , and\/or the secured management data (SMD) network . The gateways typically support one or more of the following group of functions: call processing; signaling system 7 (SS7) connectivity; billing support; OAM&P support; connection to public switched telephone network; control CoS\/QoS parameters; and enhanced services.","The voice gateway (VG)  may be connected to the public switched telephone network  and operate to convert between IP based voice packets and standard public switched telephone network  voice traffic. Voice gateway  may be configured as multi-frequency (MF) or ISUP gateways on a per-T1 basis. Where multi-frequency (MF) trunks are used, one embodiment utilizes signaling between the call manager  and the voice gateway  using MGCP, SIP, H.GCP and\/or other compatible protocol. Multi-frequency trunks may be compatible with Feature Group D (FGD), Operator Service (OS) Signaling protocol and\/or Termination Protocol (TP).","The IP central station  may be variously connected to the public switched telephone network. For example, the IP central station  may be connected directly to the public switched telephone network using, for example a bearer channel (e.g., a T1 or T3 carrier) and\/or interconnected using one or more networks such as an IP network and\/or ATM\/frame\/cell relay network . Where a T1 network is utilized, it may be desirable to utilize one or more of ISUP or MF, FGD, and OS to interconnect a service bureau in the public switched telephone network . Alternatively, the service bureau in the public switched telephone network  may be interconnected using an alternative network arrangement such as an IP network  and\/or a ATM\/frame\/cell relay network . The service bureau may coordinate with the IP central station  in providing operator services, directory services and provisioning for 311, 611, and 711 services. Emergency 911 services may be routed to an E911 tandem switch that has the appropriate databases and interfaces with a Public Safety Answering Position (PSAP). Emergency 911 services may be coordinated by the call manager  and\/or public switched telephone network based service bureau.","Voice gateway  may be router-based and include one or more voice feature cards and\/or DSP Module cards to perform voice processing. The voice gateway  may optionally include host processors; LAN\/WAN ports, Ethernet ports, T1 or E1 telephony interface cards, Voice Feature Cards with DSP. Modules providing voice compression transcoding (G.711 and G.729), carrier-quality echo cancellation with 8 ms-32 ms tail length, a de jitter buffer which adapts to delay variations in the network in order to minimize the delay, packet loss concealment that generates concealment frames for lost packets using information from previously received data, and\/or tone detection and generation. This function detects Multi-Frequency (MF) tones and generates MF and call processing tones (e.g. dial tone, call-waiting tone etc.).","In exemplary embodiments, the voice gateway  may include T1\/E1 interfaces with internal Channel Service Units (CSUs). It may also be desirable to configure the voice gateway  such that ISUP, MF and Centralized Attendant Services (CAS) trunks are supported with a configuration done on a per T1 basis. Additionally, multi-frequency tones and Centralized Attendant Services may utilize a \u201crobbed bits\u201d communication scheme where bits are \u201crobbed\u201d from sub-frames to transmit in-band signaling. The multi-frequency tones may be converted to and\/or from, for example, simple gateway control protocol (SGCP) signal requests and events by the voice gateway . For example, multi-frequency tones and\/or lower level signaling and timing functions may be translated to and\/or from any of the following indications: simple gateway control protocol Notify functions, simple gateway control protocol Notification Requests, Connection requests, Modify Connection requests, off-hook and\/or on-hook indications.","An Ethernet interface with a RJ-45 connector may be used to connect the voice gateway  to the central router  (e.g., Gigabit Switch or High Speed Router (HSR)). The multimedia gateway control protocol may be used as the interface between the voice gateway  and the call manager . For example, call control, signaling, and multimedia data stream, real time protocol (RTP) connections, IP addresses, UDP ports, codec choice etc, may be configured in any suitable manner such as by using a multimedia gateway control protocol. In exemplary embodiments, audio streams may be passed directly between customer premises equipment  using real time protocol connections over, for example, a user datagram protocol (UDP). Thus, the multimedia gateway control protocol may be utilized to request the voice gateway  to initiate, cancel, and\/or otherwise modify connections in order to set up and tear down RTP media streams. A similar procedure may also be utilized to request continuity tests and results.","In exemplary embodiments, it may be desirable to adapt the IP network to carry signaling system 7 (SS7) Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) messages over the IP network  and\/or the ATM\/frame\/cell relay network . The transport of signaling system 7 (SS7) transaction capabilities application part (TCAP) messages over the packet networks allows signaling operations to be supported by multiple connections to the same host, multiple host connections, and distributed processing of call set-up information using, for example, multiple call managers  in the broadband network . Thus, the IP network  and\/or ATM\/frame\/cell relay network may be utilized to interconnect a plurality of ESS switches to transport signaling information, voice, and\/or data. In embodiments where the signaling gateway (SG)  is configured to support signaling system 7 (SS7) signaling transport using transaction capabilities application part (TCAP) messages, it may be desirable to include a translator for converting between multimedia gateway control protocol (MGCP) messages and transaction capabilities application part (TCAP) messages and\/or ISDN User Part (ISUP) messages.","The point where ISUP and TCAP messages are terminated at a signaling system 7 (SS7) signaling gateway is defined as a Service Switching Point (SSP) to the signaling system 7 (SS7) network . The call manager  may be configured with a standardized Application Programming Interface (API) to allow interaction with the signaling system 7 (SS7) by, for example, sending and\/or receiving ISUP and TCAP messages from a service switching point (SSP). Full class  signaling system 7 (SS7) functionality may be included in the call manager  including the ability to provide all of the information necessary for billing as defined in the GR-246-Bellcore standard. The signaling gateway  may be arranged to perform: signaling system 7 (SS7) message handling (message discrimination, message distribution, and message routing); signaling link management. (e.g., link activation, deactivation); signaling route management (managing Point Code [PC] route status based on route received management messages such as Transfer Prohibited, Transfer Allowed, Transfer Restricted, etc.); and signaling traffic management (diversion of traffic based on unavailability, availability, restriction of signaling link, route, and Point Code.) The signaling system 7 (SS7) architecture supports the necessary redundancy component scheme for system reliability and availability during scheduled maintenance and\/or software\/hardware upgrades. The signaling gateway  may be configured to directly provide for lower level signaling system 7 (SS7) processing.","In exemplary embodiments, the signaling gateway  interacts with the call manager  using an appropriate open interface (e.g., Common Object Request Broker Architecture (COBRA)). In these embodiments, it may be desirable for translation software in the signaling gateway  to add Message Transfer Part (MTP) layer information to the ISUP and\/or TCAP data to create a complete signaling system 7 (SS7) message. The complete signaling system 7 message may then be sent to the Signaling Transfer Point (STP) in the external signaling system 7 (SS7) network . Conversely, the signaling gateway  may be configured to remove ISUP or TCAP application layer data from the signaling system 7 (SS7) messages received from the STP prior to converting the information to an appropriate open interface (e.g., COBRA) and forwarding the information to the call manager  via the central router .","The accounting gateway (AG)  may be configured to receive messages representing events from the call manager  via a suitable transport mechanism such as the central router . Typically, two messages are received for each call, the first when the call is established, and second when the call terminates. In the case of unsuccessful calls, only the failure message will be logged. The messages provide details about the calling and called parties, the timing of the call set-up, the duration and the quality of the call. Accounting gateway  may be duplicated using a redundant computer, with each gateway having dual-mirrored disks. The accounting gateway  stores usage records and may then distribute them to linked destinations (e.g., billing centers) for processing. Billing centers typically include bill processors that receive accounting information from the accounting gateway  and generate appropriate on-line or paper billing to customers. The accounting gateway may be configured to accommodate multiple days worth of accounting records such as the records for one day, two days, three days, four days, a week, or a month. The period in which the data is retained in the accounting gateway may be dependent on business needs, hardware restrictions, and\/or the billing cycle. For example, as the end of the billing cycle nears, it may be desirable to shorten the period the accounting gateway holds the data such that calls placed the day the bills are printed are included on the bills. Further, the accounting gateway may both retain and forward data to the billing centers. In this manner, if the equipment at the billing center fails, the accounting gateway  may serve as a backup. Similarly, the billing center may act as a backup where the accounting gateway  fails.","An Automatic Message Accounting (AMA) format is typically used by circuit-switching systems, packet-switching systems, and other network elements to provide billing usage measurements data (e.g., the Bellcore\u00ae Automatic Message Accounting Format (BAF)). This data may be utilized either to permit charging the customer for use of network resources or to permit charging other carriers (e.g., InterExchange Carrier (IEC) and other Local Exchange Carrier (LEC)) for assistance in placing call connections. The accounting gateway  may be configured to convert this information into an Automatic Message Accounting Format (AMA) Format (e.g., BAF) records and send these records to the external billing systems using, for example, a TFTP (trivial file transfer protocol). Time-stamp accuracy is typically based on the accuracy of the call manager  clock which may be derived from the TOD  server. To create appropriate AMA records, the event information produced by the call manager  preferably has appropriate information for the telephone service specified such as phone number of the calling party (customer), phone number of the called party (customer), time of call, duration of the phone call, and use of any discretionary features. Different AMA structures may be generated between On-Net calls (defined as within a network service provider IP network ) vs. Off-Net calls (defined as outside of service provider IP network\u2014e.g. public switched telephone network) for billing purposes.","The element management gateway (EMG)  may provide system management functionality that includes, for example: a) status and performance monitoring for the Operation Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning center, to gauge the ongoing operation of applications; b) extensive information exchange with a network operations center responsible for ongoing maintenance of one or more applications; c) customizable operations interface to allow the network operations center to view only information required, thus reducing the time spent filtering information; d) centralize distributed application configuration allowing for the centralized configuration of objects residing on a plurality machines; e) proactive network management capabilities to remove the need for constant operator intervention making the day-to-day operations more efficient; and\/or f) intelligent display of status information to separate critical issues from low-priority problems allowing the operation center to assign resources to the right problems at the right time.","The multimedia gateway (MG)  may be configured to connect to the public switched telephone network  and to convert IP based multimedia packets into standard public switched telephone network  traffic. The multimedia gateway  may include an intelligent trunking interface that communicates with the call manager  for automatic trunk sizing and allocation between the IP network  and the public switched telephone network . For example, when an system user at the customer premises is using a PC and\/or a multimedia phone to communicate with a traditional public switched telephone network  user, the communication session involves the transmission of video and audio data. The bandwidth that is required for this type of communication is much greater than that required for a PSTN-to-PSTN voice call or an IP-to-PSTN voice call. The multimedia gateway , as the interface between two systems, may negotiate a larger bandwidth to facilitate the call if the called party is also video enabled. This bandwidth negotiation process typically occurs with a 5ESS or a Local Digital Switch within the public switched telephone network . Typically, a multimedia call, including live video, audio and data, will require bandwidth ranging from 56K to 1.544 Mbps. However, as the number of users sharing the same link grows, the quality of the transmission deteriorates significantly. The multimedia gateway  must be able to monitor bandwidth usage and make appropriate adjustments so as to maintain an acceptable quality of service. Further, it may be desirable for the call manager  and the multimedia gateway  to communicate between themselves and\/or the customer premises equipment  to determine whether the user has authorized the additional bandwidth and hence expense of the call. For example, even where a called and\/or calling party is video enabled, it may nonetheless refuse to authorize payment for the increased bandwidth necessary for video.","The Internet gateway (IG)  may be connected to the Internet (e.g., World Wide Web (www)) and provide a means for IP based data packets to be routed between the IP network  and the Internet . Alternatively, IP based voice packets may be routed via the Internet . In exemplary embodiments, the Internet gateway  routes data-only packets which share the same priority level with other lower priority, non-real-time traffic consistent with computer data communications presently experienced with the Internet . Consequently, low priority and low latency data traffic on the IP network  utilize the Internet gateway  to communicate with other IP data networks such as the www. Voice packets may be routed through another network such as the ATM\/frame\/cell relay network , a private IP network , and\/or the public switched telephone network  where committed information rates may be easily obtained.","In exemplary embodiments, the broadband network  includes the interfaces which enable connections to existing Operation, Maintenance and Provisioning (OAM&P)  systems that support, billing, accounting, provisioning and\/or configuration management functions. A Secured Management Data (SMD) Network  may be utilized to connect the OAM&P  to the accounting gateway  and element management gateway . The Secure Management Data network  may include a Network Service Division's NSD Net. The Secure Management Data network  helps ensure that only secure communication can occur between the IP central station  and the OAM&P . This eliminates one potential means of tampering with the billing and provisioning functions in the OAM&P. The billing systems (OSS)  may include the Network Operations Center (NOC). The NOC may include a translation server which includes functions for allowing communications and control of diverse networks.","B. Broadband Residential Gateway (BRG)","Referring to , a preferred embodiment for a broadband residential gateway (BRG)  will now be described and explained. The broadband residential gateway  may be configured as the interface unit between the remainder of the customer premise equipment  devices and the external network. The broadband residential gateway  may be connected to the remainder of the broadband network  using any suitable mechanism such as a gateway directly into an IP network and\/or a cable connection. In the most preferred embodiments, a hybrid fiber-coaxial plant connection is utilized such as hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) plant . The hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  allows numerous broadband residential gateways  to be included on an existing hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  without modification to the plants infrastructure.","The broadband residential gateway  may be variously configured to, for example, provide high-speed cable modem capabilities to interconnect one or more associated PCs with each other and with the remainder of the broadband network , provide functionality to one or more TVs (using, for example, either an integrated or separate decoder functionality, e.g., set top box ), one or more telephone connections such as plain old telephone service (POTS) phones and\/or digital telephones, displays, wireless interfaces, voice processing, remote control interface, display interface, and\/or administrative functions.

In exemplary embodiments of the broadband residential gateway , the high speed bus  may include one or more of the following functional units a) a universal remote control receiver module  for receiving wireless (e.g., infrared, and\/or RF) signals (e.g., keyboard signals and\/or remote control signals) for control of the broadband residential gateway  and\/or any connected devices, b) a display, display driver, touch screen logic module for driving one or more local and\/or remote displays for interfacing with the broadband residential gateway  and\/or one or more connected devices, c) one or more TV port modules  for interconnecting televisions, set-top devices, and\/or other audiovisual devices to the broadband residential gateway , d) one or more data port modules  for connecting\/interconnecting data enabled devices (e.g., personal computers, palm top devices, etc.), e) one or more telephony port modules  for interconnecting one or more analog and\/or digital telephones, f) one or more peripheral port modules  for interconnecting one or more peripheral devices such as disk drives, data storage devices, video cassette recorders, DVD devices, audio devices, video devices (e.g., camcorders, digital cameras, digital video recorders, stereos, etc.), g) one or more external\/internal intercom modules  for interconnecting remote intercom and\/or security monitoring devices, h) one or more wireless interface modules  for interconnecting with various wireless extension devices such as wireless TVs, cordless and\/or wireless telephones, wireless LANs, etc., i) one or more voice recognition\/voice synthesis modules  for generating voice announcements, voice messages, and voice prompts and for recognizing voice generated commands and data, j) set-top box module  for performing the functions associated with a set-top box locally and\/or for communicating with one or more remotely coupled set-top boxes, k) memory  (e.g., DRAM, RAM, flash, and\/or other memory) for storing information and operating data within the broadband residential gateway , ) transceiver  for communicating with one or more external broadband networks m) operating program store  (e.g., ROM, flash, etc.) for storing at least portions of the operating programs for the broadband residential gateway  and\/or interconnected devices, n) security processor, smart card and\/or credit card interface module  for providing secure processing functions and\/or credit card\/smart card transaction functions, and\/or o) distributed processing controller  which may be a microprocessor and\/or one or more interconnected distributed processing modules for controlling the broadband residential gateway . Where the distributed processing controller  includes one or more distributed processing modules, the modules may include a telephony processing module (P) , data processing module (P) , video processing module (P) , auxiliary processing module (P) , IP processing module (P) , and\/or an operations administration maintenance and provisioning processing module (P)  interconnected through one or more busses such as processor bus . The processor bus  and\/or high speed bus  may include any suitable interconnect bus including intelligent bus configurations incorporating smart buffer logic (not shown in ) to facilitate data transfer between interconnected processors and\/or modules. The various modules and\/or processing components of the broadband residential gateway  may be powered by for example, a power supply unit (not shown). Each of the individual modules of the broadband residential gateway will now be described in more detail.","The transceiver  may include circuits for converting digital signals to and from RF signals suitable for transmission across a broadband network such as the hybrid fiber-coaxial plant . The transceiver  may include one or more input\/output ports such as a cable interface (e.g., an F connector cable connection) and\/or a fiber optic interface connected to a communication media (e.g., hybrid fiber-coaxial Plant ). The transceiver  may be compatible with the DOCSIS 1.0 or later specifications. For signaling purposes, the broadband residential gateway  may be compatible with the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) or other compatible signaling protocol (e.g., SIP or H.GCP) to support telephony applications. The transceiver  may serve as a modem, a translator and\/or a multiplexer\/demultiplexer. Data received from the network may be de-multiplexed and placed on the data bus for dispatch to the appropriate peripherals and\/or ports. Data from the various ports and peripherals may be multiplexed together for distribution over one or more broadband networks (e.g., the hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) plant ). Where a hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  is utilized, the data may be multiplexed onto various frequency bands of the hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  in a continuous data stream(s) and\/or packetized data stream(s). To facilitate data transfer for various networks, the transceiver  may be include one or more registers for data queuing and\/or IP tunneling of data packets across the broadband network.","Although the illustration of a display, display drivers, and touch screen logic device  suggests that the a display is integral to the broadband residential gateway , alternative embodiments of the broadband residential gateway  may provide a user interface via the TV screen, PC screen, video telephone, and\/or other display device in addition to, or in lieu, of, a display integral to the broadband residential gateway .","The peripheral ports module  may include a plurality of ports providing connectivity to external peripherals. Exemplary interfaces include, PCI, Firewire, USB, DB25, etc. Devices which incorporate one or more of these interfaces may utilize the broadband residential gateway  to interconnect to the remainder of the broadband network .","The external\/internal Intercom Module (IM)  may include one or more microphones\/speakers, voice CODECs, telephony processors, and\/or interface ports. Where an intercom module  is utilized, the built-in circuitry may be configured to detect, for example, unused plain old telephone system telephone(s) and generates a special intercom tone on these unused telephones. In this manner, existing plain old telephone system telephones, digital phones, and\/or other devices may serve as an intercom throughout the residence. The controller  (e.g., such as the P telephony processor ) may function to command the intercom module  to determine an appropriate intercom path to select an intercom connection between various locations. In exemplary embodiments, the CODEC may be configured to convert the analog voice signal into IP packets for transmission over one or more data ports , TV ports , display modules , telephony ports , peripheral ports , external\/internal intercom ports , wireless interface ports , and\/or set-top boxes .","In yet further embodiments, multiple broadband residential gateways  may be configured through, for example, IP tunneling, to set-up an intercom connection between multiple remote broadband residential gateways . In this manner, an administrative assistant at the office may be contacted via an intercom connection present at the users home. Thus, one or more individuals disposed at either local and\/or remote locations with diverse types of equipment may communicate as an intercom group without the need to communicate via normal dialing procedures.","In addition to intercom services, the intercom module  may also configure intercom services for other telephony services (e.g., extension transfer, call conferencing, internal caller ID), high speed data services (e.g., LAN connections), facsimile transmission\/reception, e-mail transmission\/reception, video conferencing, and\/or CATV\/HDTV (Cable Television\/High Definition Television) using standard industry protocols such as DOCSIS 1.0 or higher and IP tunneling transmissions. These services are advantageous in that once configured, the user may simulate a work environment in his home.","Though processing may be accomplished by a single processor performing all functions (e.g., processing controller ), in the preferred embodiment shown in , the architecture employs a distributed processing controller , and a plurality of processors P-P -. In the distributed processing architecture, each of the plurality of processors P-P may be configured to have a dedicated function to provide predetermined services or applications. The processors may be coupled together via any suitable mechanism such as the processor bus  and\/or high speed bus (HSB) .

Each of the above processors may be an entirely separate processing unit with included RAM, ROM, Flash memory, or may share RAM, ROM, and\/or Flash memory. Where shared RAM, ROM, and\/or Flash memory is utilized, the memory may be located within the distributed processor controller  and\/or on the processor bus . Alternatively, the memory may be integrated into the operating program store  and\/or into memory .","The Distributed Processing Controller  with its associated processors (P-P) may be coupled to the various elements of the broadband residential gateway  so as to enable proper operation of each of the individual components. For example, the distributed processing controller  (with any associated processors (P-P)) may also coupled to the security processor, smart card\/credit card, and interface module , the peripheral port(s) module , and\/or the External\/Internal Intercom Module  for providing control and coordination among devices coupled to the high speed bus .","The display  may include, for example, an interactive LED\/LCD module positioned in a suitable location such as within or attached to the broadband residential gateway . The display  may include an interface to notify, display and receive user inputs and processing status.

The keypad may be a remote control, numeric keyboard, and\/or alphanumeric keyboard.","In one embodiment of the display  operation, a user may touch an icon representing a pending voicemail and\/or multimedia mail message. The panel may be configured to send an electronic signal to the processing controller  and\/or an attached processor such as the telephony processor. On receiving the signal, the P telephony processor  may be configured to generate an IP packet via the transceiver  across portions of the broadband network  to the multimedia server  in IP central station . The multimedia server  may authenticate the request by, for example, verifying location of the request and\/or the identity of the requesting party. Where identity of the calling party is being verified, the user enter an access password by an audio and\/or keyboard request. Where an audio request is generated, the user may utilize the external\/internal intercom module  of the broadband residential gateway , or via a text message entered into the display . The user may then enter the appropriate access code via the onscreen soft keypad, microphone, and\/or keyboard. Alternatively, the message could be stored locally in the broadband residential gateways  memory  and depending on whether there is a password lock on the broadband residential gateway , the user may not have to enter a password to access the message. Where the message is stored locally in the broadband residential gateways  memory  rather than IP central station, the display  simply recalls the message from memory and presents to the user to provide one-touch instant message retrieval.","In embodiments where the broadband residential gateway  supports multiple mailboxes, the icons on the LCD\/LED may be personalized to show the identity of the owner of the message. Each user may have a different password to ensure privacy of access. An activity log which tracks past and present messages and\/or archives multimedia messages may be presented on display . The archive may be stored locally, or at a remote location such as IP central. The archive may be utilized by the user to recall messages which have long since been erased from local storage but may be retrieved from IP central on tape and\/or disk storage. This is preferably an optional feature for those users who are less security conscious. The multimedia messages need not be displayed only on display . In alternate embodiments, any of the peripheral devices attached to the broadband residential gateway  are capable of receiving the multimedia messages.","The memory  may be variously configured to include one or more field-upgradeable card slots for permitting memory expansion. Certain users may wish to enable higher end applications such as near video on demand (e.g., pausing of shows via buffering in memory), video conferencing of multiple users, multi-party conferences, call waiting for multiple parties, etc. Accordingly, the use of a broadband residential gateway  allows the user to upgrade memory via inserting additional cards. Alternatively, the user may use system memory in IP central and buffer data remotely.","Operating program store  may be configured to receive updates. This may be accomplished by having the user replace one or more memory cards or automatically by the IP central station downloading new operating code into one or more residential gateways .","As previously indicated, smart buffer logic (SBL) may be coupled to the telephony port(s) , data port(s) , TV port(s) , peripheral port(s) , and\/or the distributed processing controller (DPC) .

Echo cancellation and automatic gain control may also be utilized in the telephony port(s)  circuitry. In one embodiment, RJ-11 connectors for a plurality of lines (e.g., 4) are provided for connection to one or more existing plain old telephone system  telephone units. However, the broadband residential gateway  may contain any number of telephone connection ports. In this manner, any number of existing user phone may connected directly to the broadband residential gateway  without modification. Alternatively, the broadband residential gateway can be configured to support, in addition to or as alternative to the plain old telephone system telephone units, ISDN telephones and\/or other digital phones (e.g., IP telephones) using an appropriate interface.","The data port(s)  interface may be variously configured. In one configuration, the data ports include high speed data service connections to, for example, a personal computer (PC) using a LAN connection. For example, the data ports  may include an Ethernet 802.3 connection compatible with category  unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable and a RJ-45 connector. The data port(s)  may include the necessary interface circuitry for coupling to remote computers.","The TV port(s)  may include an interface for conventional television, HDTV and\/or CATV services.

In exemplary embodiments, the hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  typically includes both coaxial cable and optical fiber networks, though, where desired, the network may include only coaxial cable or optical fiber. The hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  may be coupled to a head-end hub (HEH) . The head end hub  may provide an interconnection point to gather and\/or transform external services (e.g., off air and satellite video, public switched telephone network voice, and Internet data) into a format suitable for distribution on the hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  for use with the customer premise equipment . The head-end hub  may include one or more cable modem termination systems (CMTS)  coupled between the hybrid fiber-coaxial plant , a Head-end (HE)  and\/or an Edge Router (ER) . The edge router  may be coupled to the cable modem termination system  and to one or more ultra high speed routers (UHR) . One or more ultra high speed routers  may be interconnected to each other and\/or through a centralized mechanism such as an IP network database to form a high speed network. The high speed packet network is one example of the network  (e.g., IP network) shown in .","In the embodiment shown in , the high speed network includes the ultra high-speed routers (UHR)  configured in a ring configuration. Although this embodiment shows the use of the IP network database (IND) , other configurations are also suitable. Where an IP network database  is utilized, it may be desirable to incorporate one or more data sets such as: a IP local number portability database (IP LNP) which may be utilized for transferring local DN among service providers when a user changes their service provider; an IP caller name database (IP CNAME) which may be utilized to provide a database of names relating to IP addresses and\/or domain names; an IP line information database (IP LIDB) which may provide alternative billing and allow flexibility in determining who pays for a call; and an IP 1-800 Database (IP 8YY) which may provide a database of 1-800 numbers relating to the IP network . Alternatively, the IP local number portability database may be located at another location, such as at an IP central station (IP Central) . Where desired, a local service management system (LSMS)  may be arranged to provide management of the IP local number portability database. Where a local service management system  is utilized, a plurality of local service order administration (LSOA) units  may be coupled to the local service management system by, for example, a number portability administration center (NPAC) . In this manner, directory numbers may be transported among different service providers. In such a case, a NPAC  is generally coupled to the LSMS  and uses the LSMS  to synchronize the numbering databases and to coordinate the porting process.","As indicated above, the broadband network  may include a plurality of interconnected high performance networks . Each high performance network may include a separate IP central station  and\/or share a single IP central station. Having distributed IP central stations located throughout the broadband network  provides improved performance and quicker response time for an individual user. Although not illustrated, each high performance network , may be connected to multiple head-end hubs , each head-end hub  may be connected to multiple hybrid fiber-coaxial plants , and each hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  may be connected to a plurality of customer premises equipment , each containing one or more broadband residential gateways .

The IP central station  may be configured to provide seamless integration and control of the high performance network  (e.g., an IP based communication system) interface with the public switched telephone networks (PSTN) , signaling system seven (SS7) , and\/or the Internet  so that packetized data voice calls, and other signaling information is properly transferred between the broadband residential gateway  and the public switched telephone network  and Internet . In certain configurations, the hybrid fiber-coaxial , head-end hub , and high performance network , provide a signal conduit for packetized voice and data which may, with the coordination of the IP central station , be provided in the appropriate format between the broadband residential gateway , the public switched telephone network , and\/or the www .","D. General Operation of Integrated Communication System","The typical home user is currently required to purchase multiple intelligent data conduits such as multiple set-top boxes, a plurality of conventional, DSL and\/or ISDN phones, cable modems, HDTV receivers, satellite receivers, home PC LANs, etc. The integrated communication system of the present invention provides a user friendly versatile communication system that enables voice over IP telephony, information data (e.g., PC and Internet), and television services in a system with one intelligent customer premise equipment  interface, the broadband residential gateway . The broadband residential gateway  in conjunction with the IP central station  provides a flexible communication system that can provide any number of integrated communication service features and functions without requiring the user to become familiar with numerous, diverse types of equipment.","In one exemplary application of the voice over IP operations, the broadband residential gateway  digitizes the analog telephony signal using, for example, G.711\u03bc law coding (64 Kbps Pulse Code Modulation). The digital samples may then be packetized in, for example, the broadband residential gateway  into IP packets. The broadband residential gateway  may be configured to encapsulate the IP packets into, for example, DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications) frames for transmission back to the head-end hub (HEH)  over the hybrid fiber-coaxial plant . The hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  may then be configured to transport signals for both upstream (to head-end hub ) and downstream (to the broadband residential gateway  and customer premise equipment ) directions. Although the DOCSIS protocol is utilized in this example, any future protocol may also be used for the digitizing and packeting of data. Where the protocol changes, it may be desirable to download new operating code from, for example, IP central station  to the individual broadband residential gateways , to update the communication protocols dynamically. When new protocols are adopted, the IP central station may utilize, for example, the system management server  to download new protocol data into, for example, the protocol manager in the call manager  and the program store  in the broadband residential gateway .","Where voice packets are sent over constant bit rate (CBR) channels using unsolicited grants, additional packet data channels may be used to support signaling messages (e.g., SGCP, Simple Gateway Control Protocol), high-speed cable modem service and\/or other upstream packet data services. The upstream packet data services may be sent using available bit rate (ABR) channels such that the voice channels not impacted by data traffic.","1. TV Signal Reception","The head-end  may originate CATV signals for transmission over the distribution network. However, in alternate embodiments, signals may be inserted at other points in the distribution network, such as at various hubs or may arise at remote locations in the network such as IP central. Down stream channels may be utilized to facilitate the transmission of signals from the head-end or other input distribution point to the subscriber premise. Where analog RF signals arrive at the broadband residential gateway  of the customer premise equipment , typically, the transceiver circuitry  will detect if the signal is addressed to this broadband residential gateway . If so, the transceiver will allow reception of the RF signal. Upon conversion to a digital format, the signal is typically output over the high speed bus (HSB)  to one or more associated devices for processing. For example, where the signal is a TV signal, the signal may be output directly to the TV port  and\/or processed by the set top box  prior to outputting to the TV ports  and\/or display . Where user channel selection is preformed directly in the broadband residential gateway , channel selection may be preformed by remote control receiver  using an external device such as a remote control. The remote control receiver may receive a plurality of individually coded remote control commands from different receivers and process the signals for only one associated device in accordance with the received commands. Alternative channel inputs include the display  and\/or any associated keypad. Authorization to certain channels may be controlled by security processor .","Where a remote set top box is utilized, the box may be coupled directly to the HFC for individual frequency tuning and\/or receive a digital feed from the broadband residential gateway  after decoding the digital signal. For example, where hybrid fiber-coaxial plant  contains fiber connections to locations near the individual homes, it may be desirable to download one or more simultaneous individually requested programming stream(s) and\/or digital data stream(s) to the broadband residential gateway . In this manner, the number of channels, movie selections, and\/or entertainment options available to the user are unlimited. Cost is minimized since only a single intelligent user interface is used in the home and all televisions, phones, computers, and\/or other user interface devices use the same intelligent user interface to the broadband network . In this manner, the broadband network  may offer premium television, voice and\/or data services to multiple conventional televisions, phones, and PCs without the use of multiple set boxes, modems, and external connections. Thus, the users are provided a single unified interface to satisfy their external data needs.","2.

This alternative may be desirable to save resources at the call manager  where multiple incoming lines are available to handle any additional calls. Thus, even though one phone is off-hook, the broadband residential gateway  determines that other lines are available and does not initiate the off-hook signal until all dialing digits have been collected.","2.

Once the connection is provisioned, the VG  may provide an open connection acknowledgement  back to the call manager .","8. For off network connections, it is often necessary to enter a second phase of the connection process involving the appropriate link signaling to establish a call. For example, the call manager  may send an ISUP IAM (Initial Address) message  containing the directory number (DN) of the called party to the signaling gateway (SG) . This process is often utilized to allocate the appropriate voice trunk for communication. The call manager  may also send an alerting message  t the broadband residential gateway to produce an alerting signal, e.g., a ringing tone. The signaling gateway  may make the appropriate connections when the trunk has been allocated and acknowledge the request with an ISUP A call manager (Address Complete) message .","9. Once the called party has answered the call and connection is established, the signaling gateway  may send an ISUP ANM (Answered) message  to the call manager  indicating that the called party has answered.","10.

As such, other methods of signaling may be substituted for signaling system 7 (SS7).","12. When the called public switched telephone network user terminates the link, an on hook signal may be sent to the appropriate public switched telephone network switch, such as a 5ESS. The signaling network may then send a call termination message (not shown) to the signaling gateway  as notification of the call termination status.","13. The signaling gateway  may then generate a release  signal to the call manager .","14.

As with the on network communication session, packet  may also include an indication of the type of encryption algorithm to be used and the type of media (e.g., audio, video, text, multimedia, etc,) to be secured.","In another example, the user may request the secure communication feature by pressing the \u201csecure\u201d button on the BRG  which may send a signal to the CM  to activate encryption.

The BRGs thereby establish a secure link session using the shared key information provided by the CM  using the secure key to encode, for example IP packets, for all communication during the communication session.","Although the invention has been explained above using an example where the user activates the secure communication feature using CPE , the secured communication may be activated by a subscriber using remote equipment via, for example, the PSTN  (e.g., entering the secure communication feature using a POTS keypad or voice activation). Further, the on network call may be routed through the IP Central Station  and the secured communication feature server . In addition, the secured communication terminating gateways  and  may be associated with other secured communication servers other than secured communication server , which communicated with secured communication server  to coordinate the secured communication feature.

When communication equipment, for example a BRG , is first registered and with, for example, an IP Central Station , the IP Central Station  assigns an initial encryption key that is assigned and retained by a server (e.g., call manager (CM)  server) and the BRG . First, at step , the system, for example the system management server , determines if a new communication device has been added to the broadband communication system. If so, then at step  the system, for example the secured communication feature server , determines if the new device may be an originating point or a terminating point in a secured communication. If so, the system, for example the secured communication feature server , may assign an initial security key to the new device.

Whenever a user first activates a secure communication feature, whether before or during (on the fly) a communication session, the origination point communication equipment (e.g., BRG ) will send the terminating point communication equipment (e.g., BRG ) a packet including a private key which may be the BRG's initial encryption key. Subsequently the two pieces of communication equipment will encrypt and decrypt communication packets to one another using the private key. If the communication is between a communication gateway and, for example, the secured communication feature server that assigned the initial private key to the communication gateway, then the origination point communication equipment may begin encrypting communications with the terminating point communication equipment (in this case a server) without first sending the private key to the terminating point communication equipment.","However, as indicated in step , the system (e.g., secured communication feature server ) determines if the initial security key assigned to a particular piece of equipment is to be updated to a new security key. If so, the system will update the initial security key with a new security key at step . The security key update may be provided by the secured communication feature server  and\/or the particular piece of equipment whose security key is to be updated. For example, if the system is programmed to update the security keys at various time intervals then the CM  may send the BRG , the VG , the MG , the IG , etc., updated security keys to replace the initial security keys. Alternatively, the devices themselves may update their own security keys based on a group of keys initially assigned by the CM . As such, the encryption key (including the initial encryption key) may be repeatedly updated and changed at various time intervals. The repeated updates may be at periodic (e.g., daily) or at random time intervals. Updates of the encryption security key may occur when the secure call feature is active or inactive, so that a hacker that breaks an encryption key at any point in time will not have continuous communication security intrusion.","Referring to  shows a process flow diagram is provided illustrating one method for activating a secured communications in a broadband communications system. First, at step , the system, for example an originating gateway , determines if a subscriber (user) has requested a secure communication session. If so, at step  the system (e.g., originating gateway ) determines if the user has designated secure communication for only a particular media type (e.g., audio, video, text, multimedia, etc.). If not, then at step  the system, for example originating gateway , begins encrypting each of the communication information packets (after a first secure communication packet is sent including the security key to be used) sent from the originating gateway  to a terminating gateway (e.g., terminating gateway  or ). If the secure communication originating gateway is, for example, a BRG , then a security processor  may use one of a number of encryption methods, for example Data Encryption Standard (DES), Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA), etc., and the security key or combination of security keys providing multiple levels of security to encrypt the packets. For example, the secret serial number of the BRG  and a user password may provide additional keys and\/or levels of security according to their use with a given encryption algorithm. If the user has designated a particular media type, for example text or audio, then at step  only packets with that media type information will be encrypted. In either case, then at step , the system (e.g., the originating gateway ) will determine if the user has selected a particular level of security. If not, at step , the system (e.g., originating gateway ) will encrypt the information packets using a system designated encryption method and the security key. Otherwise, at step , the system (e.g., originating gateway ) will encrypt the information packets using an encryption method consistent with the user designated security level or type. For example, if the user has requested just a basic security level then the system might encrypt the information packets using DES or PGP. On the other hand, if the user has requested the most secure communication possible the system might encrypt using RSA, etc. Further, the system may combine the most secure type of encryption algorithm with more frequent changes in security keys to offer an ultra secure communication session. Another method for providing multiple levels of security may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/395,789, which is hereby incorporated herein for all purposes.","As indicated above, the secure communication feature may be activated and deactivated by the user at anytime before or during (i.e., real time activation) an existing communication session (e.g., telephone call, data, video, and\/or multimedia session). The customer premises equipment  (e.g., the BRG ) may have, for example, a \u201csecure\u201d button on a keypad or touch screen to allow the caller to activate the secure feature on calls or data sessions. The entire session (e.g., the audio of an IP telephone call) or a portion of a session (i.e., when the security feature is activated on the fly in real time during a conversation) may be secured using encryption in response to the user pressing the \u201csecure\u201d button. The secure communication feature may be deactivated by user command. For example, the user may presses the \u201csecure\u201d button again during a secure session and the security encryption may turn off, so that only a selected portion of a communication session will be secure. Alternatively, the feature could be activated or deactivated by using a feature code input via a POTS phone set or a command entered using a PC.","In the case where the user selects the secure communication feature to secure one or more types of media using encryption while not securing other types of media in a multimedia communication session, a user may enter a secure session feature code which encrypts the for example, the data (or text) portion of a multimedia session while the voice portion is not encrypted. Thus, a user may send certain text documents securely to one party while they are talking with the party and\/or other parties at the same time. Alternatively, a user may enter a code so that different media types, for example audio, video, text, and multimedia audio and video, may be secured at different levels of security using for example different encryption types or algorithms (e.g., DES, PGP, RSA, etc.).","The system may include the ability to transfer control of the security feature from one gateway to another or to alternately use the security encryption keys of the originating gateway and the terminating gateway in respective packeted information. Referring to , a block diagram of another preferred embodiment for providing secured communications in a broadband communications is illustrated. In this case; a second security key, key , and a third security key, key , is provided to the secure communication originating gateway  and the secure communication terminating gateway . This process of supplying new keys to the originating and terminating equipment may be repeated continuously at various time intervals. As a first round, first packet  is encrypted using key  of the originating gateway  and the packet includes key . The secure communication terminating gateway  then sends its next information packet , encrypted using key  and containing key , to secure communication originating gateway . The switching of encryption keys from one assigned to the originating gateway to one assigned to the terminating gateway may occur one time in response to a user request (e.g., user enters a feature code) to transfer control of the secure communication feature, or on a continuos basis (or somewhere in between) in response to a users request for increased security. In either case, the secure communication session may begin by using the originating gateway's key but then start using the terminating gateway's key.","Further, a secure communication session may include a server, for example a call manager (CM) , coordinating a secure communication between two pieces of communication equipment by translating between two different encryption algorithms in two separate legs of a communication session (e.g., a telephone call). In the case where the originating gateway  and the terminating gateway  are using different encryption methods, for example the originating gateway may be using PGP and the terminating gateway  may be using RSA, the packet information may the sent to the secured communication feature server , translated into the encryption method that is being used on the respective receiving gateway, and forward it on to the intended receiving gateway. So, the secured communication feature server  may act as an encryption translator. Alternatively, the server may send encryption algorithms to a piece of communication equipment on the fly so that the various pieces of communication equipment are using the same algorithm. As with previous embodiments, there may be more than one secured communication feature server involved in the secure communication feature process.","By using the secure communication feature according to the present invention, confidential information can be protected from hackers while the information is transmitted through the broadband communication system. However, any communication which includes a leg in the PSTN  will only have encryption security while the communication packet propagates in the broadband communication system. Once the communication enters the PSTN  it has only that security provided by the traditional wireline PSTN .","Although particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to the preferred embodiments and it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims.","The following co-pending U.S. Patent applications, originally filed the same day as the present application, are hereby incorporated by reference:\n\n","All publications, patents, and patent applications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
