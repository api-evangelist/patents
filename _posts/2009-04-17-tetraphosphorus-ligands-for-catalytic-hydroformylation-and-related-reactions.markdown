No. 11\/639,438, filed Dec. 15, 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,531,698, which in turn claims the benefit of priority of Provisional Application No. 60\/750,733 filed Dec. 15, 2005, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. GM058832, awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to new phosphorous ligands and their applications in hydroformylation and related reactions. More particularly, the present invention relates to transition metal complexes having chelating tetraphosphorus ligands with multichelating modes. Tetraphosphorus ligands with multichelating modes can enhance coordinating abilities for transition metals such as Rh and Ni, and thus enhance selectivities of catalytic reactions. The transition metal-tetraphosphorus complexes according to the present invention are useful as catalysts in hydroformylation, isomerization-hydroformylation, hydrocarboxylation, hydrocyanation, tandem reactions such as isomerization-formylation, and hydroaminomethylation.","Hydroformylation, discovered by Roelen in 1938, has been the largest homogeneous catalytic process in industry. More than 15 billion pounds of aldehydes and alcohols per year have been produced based on Fe, Zn, Mn, Co, Cu, Ag, Ni, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru and Ir based catalysts. In these processes, achieving high selectivity to linear products is extremely important for commercial application. Despite the extensive investigation by both academic and industrial groups such as BASF, Dow, Shell and Eastman, among others, there still remain fundamental and practical problems regarding selectivity. New concepts for controlling selectivities are very important in catalytic reactions. Highly efficient selective catalysts will allow some bulky chemicals to be produced in an environmentally sound manner under milder conditions.","Cobalt catalysts (e.g., HCo(CO)) dominated industrial hydroformylation until rhodium catalysts (e.g., HRh(CO)(PPh)) were introduced in earlier 1970's. In 2004, it is estimated that approximately 75% of all hydroformylation processes were based on rhodium triarylphosphine catalysts. Achieving high regioselectivity to linear aldehydes is critical for hydroformylation and related reactions. The resulting aldehydes are converted to alcohols, carboxylic acids or other derivatives, which are used as plasticizers, detergents, surfactants, solvents, lubricants and chemical intermediates.","Scheme 1 below shows the dissociation of a Rh catalyzed hydroformylation catalyst.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"34.97mm","wi":"72.47mm","file":"US07709659-20100504-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The successful commercialization of HRh(CO)(PPh)technology has been based on the key discovery of Pruett at Union Carbide and Booth at Union oil that the use of rhodium with excess phosphine ligand can lead to forming active, selective hydroformylation catalysts. The need for excess phosphines is due to the facile Rh\u2014PPhdissociation in the catalytic system as illustrated by Scheme 1. Loss of PPhfrom HRh(CO)(PPh)results in more active, but less regioselective hydroformylation catalysts B and C. In the commercial process, up to an 820 fold excess of PPhto Rh is used to assure high linear:branch selectivity ratio, i.e., up to 17:1, for the hydroformylation of 1-hexene. Commercial hydroformylation of propylene has been run with a 400 fold excess of PPhto Rh with a linear:branch selectivity ratio of 8-9:1 being achieved.","Rh\/PPhcatalyzed hydroformylation is the key for making all oxo alcohols. Propylene is the largest single alkene hydroformylated to produce butylaldehyde, which can be hydrogenated to produce butanol, or dimerized by an aldol condensation and then hydrogenated to form 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, the largest single product produced by hydroformylation (over 5 billion lbs a year). 2-ethyl-1-hexanol is usually reacted with phthalic anhydride to produce dialkyl phthalic esters that are used as plasticizers to keep polyvinyl chloride plastics soft and flexible.","In the hydroformylation process, it is critical to get cheaper feed stocks for starting materials. For example, internal higher alkenes (SHOP alkenes) such as 3-octenes are desirable for converting the alkenes to linear aldehydes. Direct use of raffinate II (a mixture of n-butenes\/butanes) and 1-butene and 2-butene mixtures are useful for hydroformylation. For hydroformylation of n-alkenes, it is important to obtain high linear selectivity. Hydroformylation of allylic alcohol and subsequent reduction can lead to 1, 4 butenol. Functionalized internal alkenes can be used as alternative routes to bifunctional building blocks for polymers. Hydroformylation of methyl-3-pentenoate leads to making starting materials for polyamides and polyesters. In the tandem-isomerization and hydroformylation processes, high isomerization rates combined with high selectivity towards terminal aldehydes are desirable with minimized undesirable hydrogenation reactions and minimum isomerization towards conjugated compounds.","To overcome the need of using large excess of phosphines in the hydroformylation processes and achieve high regioselectivity, a new generation of transition metal catalysts were developed using bisphosphine ligands. For example: Bisbi by Eastman Chemical; Xantphos by Prof. Leeuwen (University of Amsterdam), Bernhard Breit, Acc. Chem. Res. 2003, 36, 264-275, Bernhard Breit, Wolfgang Seiche, Synthesis 2001, 1, 1-36); and UC-44 by Union Carbide.

However, because of the dissociation of phosphines from the Rh\u2014CO coordination, is a problem for achieving high regioselectivity, that is high linear to branch ratios of the products produced. Developing families of phosphorus ligands with multi-chelating coordination modes is attractive. The tetraphosphorous ligands of the present invention, because of their coordinating abilities through multi-chelating coordination modes, lead to highly regioselective transition in metal-ligand catalyzed hydroformylation and related reactions to provide high linear to branch ratios than those previously obtained. Also, the symmetric nature of these ligands allows these ligands to be prepared easily.","In the present invention, we introduce a variety of tetraphosphorus ligands (Type A) with multi-chelating coordination modes as illustrated below to enhance coordination abilities:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"95.00mm","wi":"66.21mm","file":"US07709659-20100504-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["2","1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"14.56mm","wi":"92.03mm","file":"US07709659-20100504-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"The present invention is directed to tetraphosphorous ligands having multi-chelating coordination modes to used as catalysts for hydroformylation and related reactions.

the ligand. The transition metal salt is a salt of a transition metal selected from the group consisting of Fe, Zn, Mn, Co, Cu, Ag, Ni, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru and Ir. Examples of the transition metal salts are FeX, Fe(OTf), Fe(OAc), Mn(OAc), Mn(OTf), MnX, Zn(OTf), Co(OAc), AgX, Ag(OTf), Ag(OTf), AgOAc, PtCl, HPtCl, Pd(DBA), Pd(OAc), PdCl(RCN), (Pd(allyl)Cl), Pd(PR), (Rh(NBD))X, (Rh(NBD)Cl), (Rh(COD)Cl), (Rh(COD))X, Rh(acac)(CO), Rh(ethylene)(acac), (Rh(ethylene)Cl), RhCl(PPh), Rh(CO)Cl, RuH(CO)(PPh), Ru(Ar)X, Ru(Ar)X(PPh), Ru(COD)(COT), Ru(COD)(COT)X, RuX(cymen), Ru(COD), RUCl(COD), (Ru(COD))X, RuX(PN), RuCl(\u2550CHR)(PR\u2032), Ru(ArH)Cl, Ru(COD)(methallyl), (Ir(NBD)Cl), (Ir(NBD))X, (Ir(COD)Cl), (Ir(COD))X, CuX (NCCH), Cu(OTf), Cu(OTf), Cu(Ar)X, CuX, Ni(acac), NiX, (Ni(allyl)X), Ni(COD), MoO(acac), Ti(OiPr), VO(acac)and MeReO, wherein each R and R\u2032 is independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl or aryl; Ar is an aryl group group; X is a counteranion, such as BF, ClO, OTf, SbF, CFSO, B(CH(CF)), Cl, Br or I; OTf is OSOCF; DBA is PhCH\u2550CHCOCH\u2550CHPh, NDB is norbornadiene; COD is cyclooctodiene and COT is cyclooctotriene. The mixture is placed in an autoclave that is purged with nitrogen and subsequently charged with CO and H.","All reactions and manipulations in the example set forth below were performed in a nitrogen-filled glovebox or using standard Schlenk techniques. THF and toluene were dried and distilled from sodium-benzophenone ketyl under nitrogen. Methylene chloride was distilled from CaH. Methanol was distilled from Mg under nitrogen. Column chromatography was performed using EM silica gel 60 (230\u02dc400 mesh). 1H, 13C and P NMR were recorded on Bruker WP-200, AM-300, and AMX-360 spectrometers. Chemical shifts were reported in ppm down field from tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as the internal standard. MS spectra were recorded on a KRATOS mass spectrometer MS 9\/50 for LR-EI and HR-EI. GC analysis was carried on Helwett-Packard 6890 gas chromatography using chiral capillary columns. HPLC analysis was carried on Waters\u2122 600 chromatography.","The following procedure was used to synthesize ligand having the structure L1. To a solution of chlorodipyrrolyphosphine (4.4 mmol, 0.87 g) in THF (10 mL) was added dropwise triethylamine 1 mL and a solution of tetraol (1 mmol, 0.218 g) in THF (5 mL) at room temperature. Tetraol was synthesized according to Lindsten, G.; Wennerstroem, O.; Isaksson, R., 1987, 52, 547-54, and chlorodipyrrolyphosphine was prepared according van der Slot, S. C.; Duran, J.; Luten, J.; Kamer, P. C. J.; van Leeuwen, P. W. N. M. 2002, 21, 3873-3883. Triethylamine.HCl salts were formed immediately after the addition. The reaction mixture was stirred for 6 h at room temperature. The triethylamine.HCl salts were then filtered off and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography on basic aluminum oxide eluted with hexane\/EtOAc\/NEt(6:1:0.01) to produce ligand L1 (0.31 g, 36%) as a air-stable colorless solid. H NMR (300 Hz, CDCl) \u03b4 7.23 (t, 2H, J=8.3 Hz), 6.68 (m, 20H), 6.21 (m, 16H); C NMR (90 Hz, CDCl) \u03b4 152.86 (d, J=12.2 Hz131.0, 121.4 (d, J=16.8 Hz), 118.1, 115.3 (d, J=13.7 Hz), 112.7; 31P NMR (146 Hz, CDCl) \u03b4 107.3. HRMS (ES) calcd. for CHNOP[MH] 867.2045, found 867.2021.","To a 2 mL vial with a magnetic stirring bar was charged the tetraphosphorus ligand L1 prepared in the previous example (3 \u03bcmol, 2.6 mg) and Rh(acac)(CO)(1 \u03bcmol, 0.1 mL of 10 mM solution in toluene). The mixture was stirred for 5 min. Then 2-octene (10 mmol, 1.56 mL) was added followed by decane (0.01 mL) as internal standard. The reaction mixture was transferred to an autoclave. The autoclave was purged with nitrogen for three times and subsequently charged with CO (5 bar) and H(5 bar). The autoclave was then heated to 100\u00b0 C. (oil bath). After 12 h, the autoclave was cooled in icy water and the pressure was carefully released in a well ventilated hood. The reaction mixture was immediately analyzed by GC.","The remarkable regioselectivities using a multi-chelating tetraphosphorus ligand L1 for hydroformylation of styrene, 1-octene and 1-hexene are demonstrated in Table 1. Normally, styrene is a difficult substrate for achieving more than 2:1 ratio of linear to branched products when compared to bisphosphorous ligands of the prior art such as xantphos and UC-44. As shown in Table 1, the new tetraphosphorus ligands (Type A) such as LI is more selective hydroformylation ligand than the prior art bisphosphorous ligand (Type B). The reaction conditions included 0.1 mol % Rh(CO)(acac) and ligand, reaction temperature 80\u00b0 C. for 1 hour at 20 atm of CO and H. These results indicate that tetraphosphorus ligands with multi-chelating coordination can be used to increase coordinating abilities of bisphosphine ligands. The regioselectivity with Type A is the highest reported to date.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"266pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

To optimize the reaction conditions, the following experiments have been carried out with tetraphosphorus ligand (L1).

As shown in Table 4, increasing the ligand metal ratio slightly decreased the reaction rate. On the other hand, the ligand to metal ratio significantly affects the regioselectivity. At lower ratios, low regioselectivity were observed. A minimum ligand to metal ratio of 2 is essential to achieve high regioselectivity, which allows the tetraphosphorus ligand to be coordinated in a multi-coordination mode.
