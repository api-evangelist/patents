{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Sellers participating in a marketplace facilitated by an electronic commerce site can employ a fulfillment network associated with the electronic commerce site to fulfill orders by users in the marketplace. To this end, sellers may send shipments containing one or more parcels with products to one or more fulfillment centers in a fulfillment network. Accordingly, products associated with an inventory of a seller may become damaged in the fulfillment network. Additionally, products may also be lost in the fulfillment network as well as during transit to the fulfillment network. Sellers can be compensated for such a loss if it is determined that the loss is the fault of the fulfillment network.","Embodiments of the disclosure are directed to systems and methods that detect damage and\/or loss of inventory housed within and\/or in transit to a fulfillment network. Sellers participating in an electronic marketplace may employ services of a fulfillment network comprised of one or more fulfillment centers to fulfill orders placed by customers in the marketplace. Accordingly, sellers may ship inventory to the fulfillment network to be warehoused in anticipation of orders. Items in a fulfillment center can be damaged and\/or lost by personnel during transit, receiving, handling, or shipment to customers during fulfillment of orders. In other words, inventory defects may occur during the course of the lifetime of an item in connection with the fulfillment network. Therefore, embodiments of the disclosure can detect these inventory defects as well as determine whether the fulfillment network is at fault and then generate a resolution for the inventory defect (e.g., compensation for the seller).

Products can include any good, service, software download, multimedia download, social networking profile, or any combination, bundle, or package thereof, that may be offered for sale, purchase, rental, lease, download, and\/or any other form of consumption as may be appreciated. The various data stored in the product data  may include, for example, titles, descriptions, quantities, conditions, images, options, weights, customer reviews, customer ratings, keywords, shipping restrictions, prices, tax classifications, unique identifiers, and any other data related to products.","Seller accounts  can include information about sellers who employ the services of a fulfillment network  to house inventory and\/or fulfill products to customers placing orders from the seller in an electronic marketplace. Each seller employing the services of the fulfillment network  can be associated with a seller account , which may include, for example, a seller inventory  relating to products that are in the inventory of a seller. Entries for products can include a quantity, condition, and other information about items in a seller inventory . A seller account  can also include an account balance or other financial accounting data with which a seller can conduct business with customers in a marketplace, and\/or an operator of the fulfillment network  and computing device .","A seller account can also be associated with seller shipments , which can specify information about shipments potentially containing inventory that are made by a seller to the fulfillment network . Seller shipments  can define information about parcels in a shipment, such as the products contained in a shipment, their quantities, and other information. In one embodiment, the seller can define various data that is accessible on a shipping label, packing list, manifest, or other documents regarding a shipment and\/or parcels that are accessible in the fulfillment network . For example, the seller can specify a shipment tracking number associated with a particular parcel of a shipment as well as the products and quantities contained within the parcel.","The data store  can also contain shipment data  that is related to shipments and parcels included in shipments that are received and\/or processed in the fulfillment network . Shipment data  can include information identified by a fulfillment center  such as shipment tracking information, the condition of parcels received in the fulfillment center , parcel weights, items contained within shipments, and other information that is identified when a shipment is received in a fulfillment center . As is described below, the shipment data  identified by the fulfillment network  about shipments received in a fulfillment center  can be used to determine whether there are inconsistencies between seller shipment  provided by a seller and the actual data about a shipment that is captured when a shipment is received in the fulfillment network . Inventory events  can include data regarding events received from one or more computing devices  associated with fulfillment centers . Inventory events  are events that are related to occurrences within a fulfillment network  such as the receipt of inventory associated with a seller, damaged items, missing items, inventory counts, and other occurrences. The inventory management application  can analyze inventory events to identify whether a seller should be compensated for missing and\/or damaged items in a fulfillment network .","The data store  can also include information about seller claims . In various embodiments of the disclosure, a seller can submit a claim via a user interface provided by the inventory management application  regarding items in a seller inventory  that the seller believes are lost or damaged. Accordingly, as is described below, the inventory management application  can determine the validity of a claim and generate a resolution for the claims on behalf of an operator of the fulfillment network . The data store  can also include data regarding a holding account . A holding account  can be an account that is associated with an operator of the fulfillment network  to which items that are related to loss claims filed by a seller can be assigned. As will be described below in further detail below, items associated with a seller inventory  may be lost in fulfillment network . Therefore, a seller account can be compensated for this loss. However, if such an item is later found, the ownership of the item can be assigned to a holding account , as the seller has already been compensated for its loss. Other examples and variations of the potential applications of the holding account  are described in further detail below.","The carrier system  can include one or more computing devices from which shipment data about parcels can be received in the computing device . The carrier system  can include shipping data  that is related to parcels that can be associated with orders in an electronic commerce site. Shipping data  can include tracking data  related to various parcels that is maintained by a carrier. Tracking data  can include a tracking number as well as scan data that tracks each time a parcel is scanned by a carrier in transit to or from a customer as can be appreciated. The carrier system  can also provide an API  through which tracking data  can be retrieved by the carrier connector . In some embodiments, the carrier system  can push tracking data to the computing device  via an API provided therein. It should be appreciated that the carrier system  can be representative of multiple carrier systems  that may also be associated with various carriers, who may provide varying APIs  or other ways to retrieve tracking data  related to parcels that are associated with customer orders. In other embodiments, a carrier system  and the carrier connector  can communicate via electronic data interchange messages or other methods to communicate tracking data  as can be appreciated.","The client  is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The client  may comprise, for example, a processor-based system such as a computer system and\/or mobile device. Such computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, set-top box, music players, web pads, tablet computer systems, game consoles, or other devices with like capability. The client  may be configured to execute various applications such as a browser  and\/or other applications. The browser  may be executed in a client , for example, to access and render network pages, such as web pages, or other network content served up by the inventory management application  to facilitate management of inventory, submission of claims, etc. A client  can also be configured to execute a special purpose application, such as a mobile application, which may include client side code that renders a user interface that includes data provided by another system.","Next, a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment  is provided. To begin, the inventory management application  can detect and generate resolutions for various scenarios related to loss and\/or damage of items in connection with a fulfillment network . One example of such a scenario includes damage to an item that can be attributed to the fault of the fulfillment network .","For example, if employees or other personnel associated with the fulfillment network  cause an event that damages an item (e.g., the item is dropped by personnel), the inventory management application  can generate a resolution that compensates a seller associated with the damaged item for the damage. Damage to an item can occur during receiving of a shipment to the fulfillment network , transfer of the item to an inventory storage location, transfer of the item to a shipping area during order fulfillment, or any other event that can cause damage to the item. In one embodiment, personnel associated with the fulfillment center  can cause a damaged inventory event associated with a damaged item to be generated, which can be transmitted to the inventory management application . In one example, a computing device  such as a handheld data entry device can allow personnel to enter information about a damaged inventory event, which can include a seller identifier, product identifier, information about the type of damage to the item, a cause of the damage, images of the damaged item, and other information. To this end, the handheld data entry device may include a barcode scanner, camera or other input devices with which data can be captured about the damaged item. Upon receiving a damaged inventory event from the computing device , the inventory management application  can generate an inventory defect that is associated with a seller account .","The damaged item can also be rated or scored by personnel in the fulfillment center  so that a value of the damaged item can be determined by the inventory management application . In one example, the item can be rated on a numerical scale that reflects condition of the item. In another example, the damaged item can be rated according to various categories that allow the inventory management application  to assess compensation for the seller. For example, categories that can include \u201ccosmetic damage,\u201d \u201cdamage to packaging only,\u201d \u201cdestroyed,\u201d and other categories reflecting a condition of a damaged item can be established and provided in a user interface on the computing device . Accordingly, personnel in the fulfillment network  can select the applicable categories in the user interface, and the selected categories can be transmitted to the inventory management application  as a part of the damaged inventory event associated with the damaged item. Accordingly, the inventory management application  can store the damaged inventory event in the data store . In some embodiments, the computing device  associated with a fulfillment center can communicate directly with the data store  via the network  to store the damaged inventory event.","In response to a damaged inventory event retrieved from the data store  and\/or received from a computing device  associated with the fulfillment network , the inventory management application  can determine a resolution. In one embodiment, if the damaged inventory event reflects that the item was damaged in the fulfillment network  for reasons that are the fault of the fulfillment network , the inventory management application  can initiate reimbursement to the seller of a replacement value determined by the inventory management application .","The replacement value of the damaged item can be determined by analyzing various factors associated with the item. In one embodiment, the inventory management application  can extract a listing price of a sales listing for the item that associated with the seller from the product data , and initiate reimbursement of the seller account  by this amount. In another embodiment, the inventory management application  can determine an average listing price over a specified time period that is associated with the item across one or more other sellers associated with a sales listing for the item in a marketplace. In other embodiment, the inventory management application  can determine the lowest listing price over a specified time period that is associated with the item that is associated with any other seller in a marketplace. In yet some embodiments, the data store  may include data regarding default replacement values for various products. Accordingly, the inventory management application  can determine if the damaged item is associated with a product identifier for which a default replacement value exists in the data store . Upon determining a replacement value associated with the damaged item, the inventory management application  can initiate reimbursement of the seller account  for the damaged item. In other embodiments, a seller may refuse reimbursement of replacement value calculated by the inventory management application  and demand return of the damaged item. Accordingly, the inventory management application  can direct the fulfillment network  to ship the damaged item to the seller. In other embodiments, the inventory management application  can purchase the item from another seller housing a like item in the fulfillment network  and transfer ownership of the item to the seller.","Upon generating a resolution (e.g. reimbursement) for a seller in connection with a damaged item, ownership of the damaged item can be transferred to the holding account . As referenced above, a holding account  can be an account that is associated with an operator of the fulfillment network  to which items that are related to loss claims filed by a seller can be assigned. Because the seller has been compensated for the loss of the item, ownership of the item can be transferred. Accordingly, an operator of the fulfillment network  can resell, liquidate or otherwise dispose of the item.","In some embodiments, inventory in the fulfillment network  associated with various sellers can be commingled. In other words, because certain items are fungible, they may be commingled in the inventory without regard to a specific seller to which a specific item belongs. Accordingly, a damaged inventory event generated by fulfillment network  personnel via a computing device  may not be associated with a particular seller in the case of a damaged item that is in a commingled inventory. Therefore, the inventory management application  can implement an algorithm to identify a seller from among multiple sellers having a quantity of the item in a seller inventory  to which compensation in the form of reimbursement of replacement value should be initiated. In one example, the inventory management application  can randomly select a seller from among sellers having a quantity of the item in a corresponding seller inventory . Other algorithms for assigning ownership of the damaged item from a commingled inventory to a seller can also be employed.","The inventory management application  can also generate a resolution in the case of items that are lost in the fulfillment network . As can be appreciated, items associated with a seller inventory  can be lost for a host of reasons. In some embodiments, a periodic actual inventory count for various items warehoused in a fulfillment network  can be captured by fulfillment network  personnel and transmitted to the inventory management application  via the computing device . In one embodiment, fulfillment center  personnel can perform inventory counts on a periodic basis at various inventory locations in a fulfillment center  that are associated with sellers and\/or items, and the inventory count data can be transmitted to the inventory management application . In some embodiments, the inventory counts reflecting actual inventory in the fulfillment network  can be performed on an automated basis.","Accordingly, the inventory management application  can generate an inventory snapshot reflecting an actual quantity of various items in the fulfillment network  corresponding to various seller accounts . The inventory snapshot can be stored in the data store  in the seller inventory  and updated as additional inventory counts are received from the fulfillment network . The inventory management application  can compare the inventory snapshot associated with a seller account  against an expected seller inventory  to determine whether there are missing and\/or surplus items in the fulfillment network . Such an inventory snapshot can be generated periodically based upon the most recent inventory counts received from the fulfillment network . In one embodiment, the inventory snapshot can be generated periodically, such as, for example, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc. In some embodiments, a fulfillment center  computing device  can generate missing item events, which can be received by the inventory management application  from the computing device  via the network . A missing item event can include a seller identifier, a product identifier, and other information related to a missing item associated with a seller. Similarly, the inventory management application  can receive found item events that correspond to items that are found in the fulfillment network . Upon receiving such an event, the inventory management application  can update an actual inventory in the seller inventory  in the data store .","In order to identify whether an item can be classified as missing, the inventory management application  can employ a waiting period after a deficit of an item in a seller inventory  is detected. Because items lost in a fulfillment network  can later be found, the inventory management application  can employ such a waiting period before designating a deficit as a loss and triggering a resolution. In one embodiment, the inventory management application  can employ a thirty day waiting period upon detection of a deficit of an item in a seller inventory . Other waiting periods can be employed as can be appreciated. Upon the passing of the waiting period, if a deficit associated with an item persists and a subsequent inventory count does not reflect that the item has been found, the inventory management application  can designate the item as missing and generate a resolution. Upon classifying an item as missing, the inventory management application  can generate an inventory defect and associate it with the seller account . Accordingly, the inventory management application  can initiate a resolution in the form of compensation to a seller for the missing item. In one embodiment, the inventory management application  can initiate reimbursement of replacement value to the seller account  as described above in reference to compensation for a damaged item. Upon compensating a seller account , the inventory management application  can reduce the seller inventory  by a quantity corresponding to the number of missing items for which the seller was compensated.","As also referenced above, inventory in the fulfillment network  associated with various sellers can be commingled. Accordingly, an inventory count associated with a commingled item may be received on an aggregate basis. That is to say, a total inventory count associated with the commingled item may be received, and the inventory management application  can determined whether an item is missing by comparing the aggregate count against a total quantity of the item in the seller inventory  of all sellers having a quantity of the item in their inventories in the data store . Therefore, the inventory management application  can implement an algorithm to identify a seller from among multiple sellers having a quantity of the item in a seller inventory  to which compensation in the form of reimbursement of replacement value should be initiated. In one example, the inventory management application  can randomly select a seller from among sellers having a quantity of the item in a corresponding seller inventory . Other algorithms for assigning ownership of the damaged item from a commingled inventory to a seller can also be employed.","In some embodiments, a missing item may be found in the fulfillment network  after the waiting period has passed and a seller has been compensated for the missing item. Accordingly, the inventory management application  can handle such a scenario in various ways. As one example, if an inventory snapshot based upon inventory counts and\/or found item events reflect a surplus for a particular seller account , the inventory management application  can transfer ownership of the surplus items to the holding account . Thereafter, if a subsequent deficit associated with a seller account  is detected by the inventory management application , it can transfer ownership of this surplus item from the holding account  to the seller account  reflecting a deficit without having to initiate reimbursement of replacement value corresponding to the item.","The inventory management application  can also facilitate loss claims initiated by a seller that are related to inbound shipments to the fulfillment network . In one embodiment, a seller can define data regarding inbound shipments to the fulfillment network via a client . An inbound shipment can include one or more parcels containing items to be housed in the fulfillment center  and associated with the seller inventory . Accordingly, seller shipments  can define the expected product identifiers and quantities associated with an inbound shipment, shipment identifiers, tracking data, purchase order data, bill of lading data, or any other data associated with a shipment.","When one or more parcels associated with an inbound shipment arrives to a fulfillment center  in the fulfillment network , a shipment identifier, tracking identifier, purchaser order identifier, or any other identifier with which the inventory management application  can associate the inbound shipment with a seller shipment  in the data store  can be extracted and transmitted to the inventory management application . The inventory management application  can store any data regarding an inbound shipment received in a fulfillment center  as shipment data  in the data store. Additionally, the one or more parcels can also be weighed as a part of the receiving process and the weight of the one or more parcels of the inbound shipment can also be provided to the inventory management application  and stored as shipment data .","Products contained within the inbound shipment can be scanned or otherwise counted, and inventory addition events associated with the seller account  that correspond to a quantity of the products contained within the inbound shipment can be generated by a fulfillment center  computing device . Inventory addition events associated with an inbound shipment can be stored as shipment data  in the data store . In one embodiment, such a computing device  can include a handheld device with a barcode scanner that can scan product identifiers, shipment labels, or other data included with an inbound shipment. These inventory addition events can be transmitted to the inventory management application  via a fulfillment center  computing device , and the inventory management application  can update the seller inventory  associated with the seller account . In one embodiment, inventory addition events can be stored as shipment data , and the inventory management application  can process the events to update a seller inventory .","Accordingly, sellers may submit loss claims to the inventory management application  via a user interface on a client . Loss claims can be related to items a seller believes should be reflected in a seller inventory  associated with a seller account  and that the seller believes were lost from an inbound shipment processed by the fulfillment network . A loss claim can be associated with a particular inbound shipment that can be identified by shipment tracking data, shipment identifier, purchase order identifier, or any other information with which an inbound shipment of items to the fulfillment network  can be identified. The inventory management application  can employ various methods to validate a claim submitted by a seller to determine whether the claim should be approved or denied. In other words, the inventory management application  can determine whether a seller should be compensated because the fulfillment network  has lost items from an inbound shipment sent by the seller to the fulfillment network .","In one embodiment, the inventory management application  can compare a weight of the one or more parcels associated with an inbound shipment against an expected weight of the shipment. An expected weight of parcels of a shipment can be determined based at least upon an expected quantity of a particular item associated with a parcel. The inventory management application  can determine the expected weight of a parcel based upon a weight associated with one or more products in a parcel, which can be retrieved from the product data  and the expected quantity of the products in a parcel. If the expected weight is within a weight threshold percentage of the actual weight of the parcel, the inventory management application  can determine that the expected quantity was likely contained within the parcel. The actual weight of the parcel can be determined by a weight measurement taken with a weighing apparatus in a fulfillment center  upon receipt of the inbound shipment. In some embodiments, the actual weight can be determined by extracting the weight of a parcel via the carrier connector  from a carrier system  that provides tracking information and other data regarding shipments.","If the actual weight of a parcel associated with an inbound shipment is less than a calculated expected weight, the inventory management application  can deny the claim submitted by the seller. If the actual weight of the parcel is within a weight threshold of the expected weight, the inventory management application  can flag the claim for additional investigation and\/or approve the claim, triggering compensation for the seller.","In some embodiments, a fulfillment network  may reject one or more parcels associated with an inbound shipment if they violate one or more shipping policies. A shipping policy can include a policy regarding hazardous materials shipment, packaging requirements, governmental regulations, seizure by a governmental authority, or any other policy that can cause the fulfillment network  to reject a parcel. Accordingly, if the fulfillment network  rejects a parcel associated with an inbound shipment, the inventory management application  can store information about the rejection, such as information about the shipping policy that was violated, as shipment data  in the data store . Therefore, if a loss claim submitted by a seller is associated with an inbound shipment that violates a shipping policy, the claim can be rejected by the inventory management application .","In another embodiment, the inventory management application  can determine whether a parcel associated with a claim submitted by a seller has not been received in a fulfillment center . The inventory management application  can retrieve tracking data  associated with a parcel from the carrier system  via the carrier connector  and determine whether the carrier status information associated with the parcel reflects that the shipment has not been received by the fulfillment network . If the parcel associated with the loss claim has not been received from the fulfillment network , the inventory management application  can deny the claim.","In another embodiment, the inventory management application  can determine whether a parcel associated with a claim submitted by a seller has been damaged by the carrier with which the seller shipped the inbound shipment to the fulfillment network . The inventory management application  can retrieve tracking data  associated with a parcel from the carrier system  via the carrier connector  and determine whether the carrier status information associated with the parcel reflects that the shipment was damaged by the carrier. If the carrier employed by the seller is on an approved carrier list, the inventory management application  can approve the claim and compensate the seller for the damaged items associated with the inbound shipment. In some embodiments, the inventory management application  can flag the claim for additional investigation so that inventory management application  personnel can determine the extent of the damage caused by the carrier. If the carrier employed by the seller is not on an approved carrier list, the inventory management application  can deny the claim.","The inventory management application  can also determine validity of a claim submitted by a seller by identifying potential errors in seller shipments  defined by a seller. As one example, a seller may transpose quantities of various products in an inbound shipment when specifying information an inbound shipment. For example, the seller may specify that an inbound shipment contains a quantity of five of product X and a quantity of six of product Y. However, the inventory addition events may specify that the shipment processed by the fulfillment network  contained a quantity of six of product X and a quantity of five of product Y. Accordingly, the inventory management application  can deny a loss claim from a seller related to a shortage of product Y if there is a corresponding surplus of another item in the inbound shipment compared to the information defined by the seller in seller shipments .","In some embodiments, fulfillment network  personnel may associate an inbound shipment with the wrong seller. Accordingly, the seller inventory  associated with the wrong seller may reflect a surplus of one or more products. If a loss claim is received by a seller for products for which a surplus is reflected in the seller inventory  of the wrong seller, the inventory management application  can transfer ownership of the items from the wrong seller to the seller submitting a claim. If the items for which a surplus is reflected in the seller inventory  of the wrong seller are sold, lost and\/or damaged, the inventory management application  can approve the claim and trigger compensation for the seller.","Referring next to , shown are flowcharts that provide examples of the operation of a portion of the inventory management application  according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowcharts of  provides merely examples of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the inventory management application  as described herein. As an alternative, the flowcharts of  may be viewed as depicting examples of steps of a method implemented in the computing device  () according to one or more embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["121","115","201","121","115","115","203","121","115","121","115","204","121","115","115","121","205","112","121","115","121","207","121","209","115"]},"Reference is now made to , which illustrates an example of a process in which the inventory management application  can detect a missing item in a fulfillment network  by performing periodic inventory snapshots associated with a seller inventory .

The inventory management application  can request additional information from a seller in connection with the claim and validate the claim based upon shipment data associated with shipment as well as the additional information provided by the seller. In some scenarios, shipment data associated with a seller shipment  provided by a seller may not include carrier tracking data, bill of lading information, or other information related to the shipment. Accordingly, the step of validating a claim can include prompting a seller for additional information related to the shipment as well as items in a shipment. For example, the inventory management application  can prompt a seller for carrier tracking information, with which the carrier connector  can retrieve carrier tracking data, weight data, or other information from a carrier system . The depicted user interfaces of  are illustrated to show some examples of functionality of the user interfaces that can be generated by the inventory management application . In some embodiments, the inventory management application  can also generate user interfaces that show a status of a loss claim, a status of loss claims on an item by item basis, an amount credited to the seller as compensation for missing items, and other information related to loss claims.","With reference to , shown is a schematic block diagram of the computing device  according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The computing device  includes at least one processor circuit, for example, having a processor  and a memory , both of which are coupled to a local interface . To this end, the computing device  may comprise, for example, at least one server computer or like device. The local interface  may comprise, for example, a data bus with an accompanying address\/control bus or other bus structure as can be appreciated.","Stored in the memory  are both data and several components that are executable by the processor . In particular, stored in the memory  and executable by the processor  are the inventory management application , carrier connector , and potentially other applications. Also stored in the memory  may be a data store  and other data.
