title: Methods and devices for optically recording and imaging representations of interactions of an object with its environment
abstract: Using an array of optical sensors affixed to measure interactions on a surface of an object, in combination with a specially configured personal computer, dynamic mapping of interaction is provided. One application maps washover of an object towed in a large body of water. Data are collected on optical characteristics of the interaction such as reflectivity at a boundary. For example, in one embodiment the reflectivity at an optical fiber/seawater boundary is compared to that of an optical fiber/air boundary and dynamic measurements made using an optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR). These data are then processed using specialized software to yield representation of the dynamics (spatial and temporal) of selected washover events on a surface of interest. The system specifically provides a real-time representation of washover, including two and three-dimensional visualization of washover, as well as recording selected data for future use. Methods of employment of the system are also provided.

This patent and related ones are available for licensing. Contact Sharon Borland at 703 428-9112 or Phillip Stewart at 601 634-4113.","The present invention relates generally to detection of parameters by optical means and more particularly to the real time detecting, recording and presenting representations of interactions with an object, such as a fluid passing over an object.","Washover is defined as the condition of occasional (not \u201cfrequent,\u201d continuous or permanent) partial or complete inundation and exposure of a top surface of a floating object to a fluid. Typically, at sea washover is caused by wave action, wind action, the dynamics of towing a floating object (body) or a combination of the interaction of these factors. Washover may adversely affect performance of floating objects equipped with electronic devices such as antennas, photovoltaic arrays, instrumentation, radio, and auditory or visual beacons. For a low-profile towed body, washover depth is usually within the range of less than a centimeter (0.4\u2033) to 30 cm (12\u2033). Typically, an inundation lasts less than one second.","Fiber optic-based methods of the present invention provide three dimensional (3D) spatial and temporal detection, measurement and visualization of washover in both freshwater and seawater and may be applied to other transparent or translucent fluids. Temporal and spatial optical-based washover measurements provide an empirically-based benchmarking process for assessing the computational fluid dynamics of fluid flow around an arbitrarily shaped surface of an object.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention permits simultaneous measurement of temporal and spatial washover dynamics that are non-invasive both physically and electro-magnetically. For example, measurements may be made while taking measurements of water wave\/electromagnetic (RF) interaction of onboard electronics, e.g., low profile antennas. Data may be acquired and displayed in real-time, as well as stored for post-processing, analysis, playback and display.","The ability to capture key parameters of washover as data, as well as to visualize washover events in real-time, enables designers to improve hydrostatic and hydrodynamic profiles of these objects. Currently, there are no purpose-built non-interfering devices, systems, or methods that provide this information. Thus, there exists a need for an optical washover measurement system that permits real-time acquisition, three-dimensional mapping, and visualization of seawater washover dynamics without interfering with the operation of onboard electronics. The real-time data acquired with this system may be used to analyze hydrodynamics and electromagnetic interaction with seawater while an electromagnetic device is operating on the object. It is also useful for use in conjunction with computer simulations and modeling to optimize hardware design \u201coff the bench.\u201d","A preferred embodiment of the present invention was developed to meet the need to temporally and spatially quantify seawater wave interactions in the VHF through microwave frequency range while electromagnetic energy emanates from a low profile towed body. At these RF frequencies, the skin depth (a measure of the maximum depth to which electromagnetic energy penetrates) is on the order of one centimeter (0.4\u2033).","Skin depth, \u03b4(m), is defined as the depth at which a conductor's current is reduced to 0.368 of the surface value, the equivalent to a power loss of 8.7 dB. Doubling the value of \u03b4doubles the loss. Skin depth is frequency dependent, i.e., the higher the frequency, the shallower the skin depth. Skin depth can be defined mathematically as: \n\n","where:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Currently, there are no existing devices, systems, or methods that can provide this information in a non-interfering manner when washover patterns must be studied simultaneously with the evaluation of an onboard electromagnetic antenna or other electromagnetic device. A technique using electrically powered electrodes makes appropriate washover measurements but not on a non-interference basis. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/318297, filed Dec. 13, 2002, by Yankielun and Clark. This technique relies on an extensive network of metallic wired electrodes, which interfere with electromagnetic radiation patterns when applied in the immediate proximity of an antenna under test. Accordingly, it may not be used to perform non-interfering measurements simultaneously with operation of onboard electronics.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention uses opto-electronic techniques to provide a method and apparatus that facilitates real-time acquisition of pertinent parameters to enable two or three-dimensional mapping and visualization of washover. In a specific application, it provides an empirically based benchmarking process for computational fluid dynamic assessments of turbulent flow around arbitrarily shaped surface-towed bodies.","A system detects, measures and records interaction of an object with its environment, in particular, fluid washover of an object, including displaying a representation thereof in real time. In one embodiment, it uses optical fiber arranged to form an array of separate optical sensors to measure the interaction on the external side of a surface of interest of the object. The configuration of the array, i.e., spacing between each sensor and overall size, is chosen to complement the pulse width, and possibly the pulse repetition frequency, of the light source and to provide a pre-specified level of detail needed for display. The configuration of individual optical sensors in the array may be by way of individual optical fibers inserted through the surface, T-connectors, Y-connectors, simple loops of a single fiber exposed to ambient conditions above the surface, or like means. Ambient light or a separate light source providing modulated pulsed light through a separate optical fiber may be used to operate the system. Further, a single optical fiber may be employed for transmitting and receiving light from all sensors used in the system. An optical fiber, or fibers, provides feedback on sensor status to a signal conversion, collection, processing, recording and display sub-system, e.g., a personal computer (PC) loaded with appropriately configurable software and equipped with a monitor and an optical to digital electronic (O\/E) data converter\/collector\/processor, such as a multi-channel multiplexed printed circuit board incorporating a phototransistor, and an analog-to-digital (A\/D) converter.","The sub-system collects (captures) data representing the sampling of at least one optical characteristic at each sensor in the array. The optical characteristic chosen for measurement may be any of the following: wavelength, pulse width, amplitude, phase, phase delay, modulation, and any combination thereof.","The optical fibers may be any of various types of flexible, robust, plastic, optical fiber that may be inserted through the outer surface of the object to be tested. The means for insertion include drilling holes through the appropriate portion of the outer surface to accommodate a tight fit of a T- or Y-connection of an optical fiber \u201cstub\u201d or \u201clacing\u201d a continuous optical fiber through an array of holes drilled in the surface to form an optical path. If a lacing arrangement is used, the optical fiber exposed on the outer surface is separated from any opaque cladding so that light may be received by each of the exposed loops. The return signal from each sensor in the array is converted to an electrical signal at a phototransistor, converted from analog to digital format and further processed for immediate display or stored for future use. The optical fiber sensors may also be embedded in a thin flexible (conformable) panel, i.e., a panel <0.25 cm (0.1\u2033) thick at its greatest depth. This thin conformable panel configuration enables non-destructive testing of an object while minimizing any disruption to washover patterns at the surface being measured.","An embodiment of the present invention envisions the fluid to be a liquid with the object floating in the liquid such that a part of the object is free from contact with the liquid when the liquid is not acted on by external forces. A specific embodiment displays a dynamic representation of seawater washover of a towed body.","Also provided is a method for using a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The method for detecting, measuring and recording interaction of an object with its environment, such as fluid washover of an object, includes displaying a representation of the interaction in real time. It is accomplished by providing an array of exposed optical fibers upon a surface of interest. In its most basic embodiment, each exposed optical fiber is separately provided to the surface of interest. In one embodiment the array may be mounted to the external side of a surface of interest of said object via waterproof gasketed through-holes by either a T- or Y-connector to a stub optical fiber that serves as an individual fiber optic sensor in any array that is fed by one optical fiber connected to a common light source and data collector. In another embodiment a single optical fiber may be woven through an array of watertight gasketed holes in the surface, thus providing a single path for data to be acquired using a suitable means, such as a time domain multiplexer (TDM). The loops on the external surface that are formed by the weaving are stripped of any opaque cladding and serve as the individual sensors in the array. By pulsing light through the fiber optical cable, and any of the stubs in certain configurations, specific optical characteristics are collected as data during selected washover events. These characteristics are selected based on the likelihood of variation based on the amount and timing of fluid accumulating over each individual sensor in the array. These data are converted from light pulses to electrical pulses and further processed. Selected data are either displayed in real time, recorded for later use, or both. This method enables visualization of representations of selected washover events via a real time display as well as recording selected representations of washover events for future use. Optical characteristic that may be measured include: wavelength, pulse width, amplitude, phase, phase delay, modulation, and any combination thereof.","A preferred method involves pulsing light at a pulse width that enables pre-specified parameters of washover to be monitored. In a preferred embodiment, the pulsed light signal is modulated to distinguish changes in ambient lighting from changes due to washover. In a preferred embodiment, this method is used to determine washover of a liquid with the object floating therein such that only part of the object is covered with the liquid when the liquid is not acted on by external forces. In a specific application, the object is a towed body that may be washed over by seawater.","Further, a preferred embodiment of the present invention may be implemented in a simulator such that an expensive object of interest is simulated by a model that mimics its shape, center of gravity, mass, orientation, etc. The model may be provided as a full-scale or partial scale replica of the object with the configuration of the optical sensor array scaled accordingly.","In another preferred embodiment, a \u201cdistributed sensor\u201d arrangement employing the principles of optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) uses a single optical fiber with either T- or Y-connectors to the individual sensors in the array. By measuring the roundtrip time for a light pulse to travel to each of the sensors in the array and also reflect from the termination of the optical fiber, values for operation in a pre-specified quiescent state, e.g., dry ambient air, may be collected and used as a reference to various conditions of washover and may even be used to determine the composition of washover, e.g., seawater, ice, snow, fog, steam, etc.","Implementation of a preferred embodiment of the present invention provides continuous non-interfering, real-time acquisition, processing, mapping and visualization of washover events for military, industrial, and commercial users. It uses a fiber optic array to provide continuous, real-time mapping and visualization of washover. It specifically provides real-time spatial and temporal visualization of washover, including two and three-dimensional visualization of washover. Some applications include:\n\n","There are several general advantages to the implementation of a preferred embodiment of the present invention in any of the above applications:\n\n","Optical systems and methods for measuring the interaction of an object with its environment are provided. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, optical systems and methods for measuring washover thickness of seawater, i.e., \u201cwashover mapping,\u201d are provided.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention acquires and records the changing reflectance levels at known lengths along an optical fiber (cable) as a function of a change in the refractive index contrast of light in any of the visible, IR, and UV spectra at the boundary of the optical fiber path and the overlying composition, e.g., air or seawater. If the optical fiber is exposed to air, there will be a specific and measurable level of reflectance. If instead, the optical fiber were to be exposed to seawater (as would occur during washover) a different level of reflectance is measured. By noting the difference between reflectance levels occurring with air and seawater, washover may be monitored dynamically by taking samples at appropriate pre-specified levels according to the needs of the user.","The combination of several fundamental properties of optics, including Snell's Law, and the concept of geometric spreading is exploited to enable dynamic detection, measurement, and display of washover. For further reference see: Allard, F. C., , McGraw-Hill, N.Y., 1990, and Udd, E., , Wiley, N.Y., 1990.","Refer to FIG. . The primary concept employed in this technique relies on Snell's Law, where at an arbitrary refractive index interface boundary, ab, a first fraction  of the energy enters the material from a to b, and the reflection coefficient, \u03c1, represents the second fraction  of the total energy  incident on the boundary ab that is reflected. The reflection coefficient, \u03c1, is defined as: \n\n\nwhere:\n\n","Under Snell's law, light incident at a normal (90\u00b0 to the surface) incident angle, i.e., the angle at which \u03b8goes to zeros has the associated normal refractive angle \u03b8=0, such that the reflection coefficient for a normal incident wave upon an arbitrary refractive index boundary discontinuity results in: \n\n","Complementing the reflection coefficient is the transmission coefficient, \u03c4, representing the fraction  of light energy that passes through the refractive index boundary, given as:\n\n\u03c4=1\u2212\u03c1\u2003\u2003(4)\n","Thus, the fraction  of incident energy that is reflected is dependent on the relative magnitudes of the refractive index of the two materials that meet at an interface boundary. To monitor or measure washover, the value of \u03b7is fixed as the refractive index of the fiber optic transmission medium. A plastic optical fiber core has a nominal index of refraction of \u03b7=1.492. The value \u03b7will vary with the overlying composition, e.g., for a towed body in seawater it would be either of the discrete values of 1 (air) and 1.3 (nominal for seawater).","In the case of washover measurement, there are three distinct refractive index boundary cases. When the optical fiber is submerged by washover there are two boundaries to consider: an optical fiber\/water boundary and a water\/air boundary, each of which have associated reflection coefficients. When there is no washover present, there will be only one boundary of concern: an optical fiber\/air boundary.","Refer to FIG. .  represents the one-boundary case (optical fiber\/air)  of no washover and  represents the two-boundary case (optical fiber\/water , water\/air ) of washover. For the one-boundary case , the fraction  of light reflected back at the air\/water interface is dependent on one coefficient, \u03c1. At the water\/air boundary , the fraction  of the incident light associated with the coefficient, \u03c1, reflected back down through the water is also of interest together with the fraction  of light associated with the coefficient, \u03c1. Of course, the fraction  of light associated with the coefficient, 1\u2212\u03c1, that is emitted into free space in  is of no concern. However, as discussed further below, the fraction  of light associated with the complementary coefficient, 1\u2212\u03c1, that continues from the fiber optic\/water interface  during washover must be taken into consideration since it also continues to the air\/water interface . For nominal values of seawater, the reflection coefficient, \u03c1, at the water\/air boundary is: \n\n\nwhere:\n\n","At the optical fiber\/water boundary , the fraction  of light transmitted through this boundary  and up into the overlying water column is of interest. For nominal values of seawater, the reflection coefficient, \u03c1, at the optical fiber\/water boundary  is: \n\n\nwhere:\n\n","At an optical fiber\/air boundary , of interest is the fraction  of light reflected back from that boundary  into the optical fiber  since there is no other reflecting boundary overhead. In this case, i.e., no washover present, the reflection coefficient, \u03c1, at an optical fiber\/air boundary  is: \n\n\nwhere:\n\n","For light emitted from the small aperture  at the end of an optical fiber  the power per unit area or irradiance, I, in the direction of propagation of a spherical wavefront of light varies inversely as the square of the distance, r, from the source aperture, such that: \n\n","Refer to FIG. .

Dis the diameter of the footprint  from the light reflected back to the plane of the optical fiber aperture  from the water\/air interface . The angle, \u03b8, is the maximum angle for the optical fiber to collect light. It is the maximum angle through which light can enter or leave the optical fiber aperture  of a step index optical fiber. This value, called the numerical aperture, NA, is provided by the optical fiber manufacturer and can be described by:\n\n=sin \u03b8=\u221a{square root over (\u03b7\u2212\u03b7)}\u2003\u2003(9)\n\nwhere\n\n","The area, A, of the optical fiber aperture  is given by: \n\n\nThe area of the of the water\/air boundary reflection footprint , A, is given by: \n\n\nwhere\n\n","For an optical fiber aperture  submerged beneath a depth, d, of water, the reflected signal intensity, S, at the optical detector (e.g., the photo transistor  of FIG. ), relative to the source (e.g., the red LBD  of FIG. ), is the ratio of the area, A, of the aperture  of the optical fiber to the area.

In a specific test, a fiber optic washover sensor array test cylinder  consists of an array of four single point optical fiber (cable) terminations  appearing flush with the top (closing) surface  of a PVC pipe cap  of diameter d and depth L. For this test, the PVC cap  was 10 cm (4\u2033) in external diameter by 7.5 cm (3\u2033) deep. Four fiber optic terminations  are centered in the bottom  of the capped cylinder  (PVC cap) and form the corners of a square with a dimension of b. For this application, b=5 cm (2\u2033). The optical fiber used for this application is a one mm, step index plastic optical fiber with a numerical aperture, NA, of 0.51, a core refractive index, \u03b7, of 1.492, a cladding refractive index, \u03b7, of 1.402, and an attenuation of <0.20 dB\/m.","Refer to  showing a relational diagram of a test configuration for a towed body  and  depicting the electronic schematic  for connections to a single sensor such as the sensor  in an array as may be configured in a laboratory. Each fiber optic cable  is connected to a directional optical coupler .","Refer to  for a diagram of a directional fiber optic coupler . At the coupler body , each of the two optical fibers associated with the four ports -, are stripped of their cladding within the coupler body  as depicted at . The stripped sections are embedded in a stabilizing material  to assure maintenance of the correct orientation. Light energy entering Port  is divided in half with equal components exiting through Ports  and . Virtually no light entering Port  exits through Port . The coupler  functions similarly for light entering any of the four ports -. The coupler  permits a single optical fiber  to act simultaneously as a receiver and a transmitter.","Refer to . The first port  of the coupler  is a dark termination  implemented by covering the aperture  with black plastic tape. A second port  for inputting light to the system is terminated in the test cylinder  shown from its side . An optical receiver , such as a phototrarisistor, is connected to a third port  of the coupler . To complete the connections, a visible light source , e.g., a 660-nm red LED, is connected to a fourth port . Each of the four optical sensors  in the array of  is configured similarly.","Since the present invention is used under a variety of ambient light conditions, this \u201cbackground\u201d light is sensed by the phototransistor  (or power meter in an alternate configuration) and, without further accommodation, interferes with accurate measurements. This period of notable change in light intensity as sensed by the phototransistor  may be on the order of seconds. Refer to FIG. . Additionally, this change in ambient light may occur during washover  of the installed sensor array , during which time the ambient light is also partially attenuated by the washover fluid, e.g., water, and the changing ambient light may give a false reading as to those portions  of the object  not being inundated. Note that portions  not affected by wave action washover  should remain at the quiescent level used as a reference.","The variation of ambient light intensity (from the sun, moon, stars, lightning, artificial lighting, or a combination thereof) due to changing cloud cover, for example, is a relatively slow process. Further, in an artificially lit environment, such as in the laboratory, the fluorescent or incandescent lighting generates light intensity fluctuation at 120 Hz that may interfere with the expected response of an optical sensor if the response is not augmented with appropriate signal conditioning. Thus, to eliminate interference from all types of ambient lighting, a modulating signal such as a 3-kHz square wave source  is used to modulate the signal from the red LED . The signal received by each phototransistor  is input to a high-pass filter , eliminating low-frequency components of the signal and permitting \u201ccleaner\u201d analog processing of the received 3-kHz modulated signal. This filtered signal, now frequency down converted to a radio frequency (RF) from an optical frequency, is then passed to an amplifier  from which the amplified signal is peak rectified in a detector , resulting in a DC voltage proportional to the intensity of the received modulated LED light. The output of the detector  is digitized, e.g., using a 16-bit PCMCIA analog-to-digital (A\/D) converter card (not shown separately) installed in a laptop computer . The subsequent data stream is processed in accordance with pre-specified user requirements, and either stored for later use, displayed in real time, or both.","Refer to  for one example of specific circuitry ,  to accomplish the modulation of the source LED  and preprocessing (conversion) (O\/E)  of the optical signal to an RF (electronic) signal usable by the specially configured PC .","Refer to FIG. . For a specific test, the data acquisition, processing and display software may be written in LABVIEW\u00ae, a graphical user interface (GUI)-based language. Two display formats may be created for visualization of the real-time dynamic washover data.  provides a \u201csnap shot\u201d sample  of test data as an analog representation of washover. It is displayed as a three-dimensional (3D) graph  of a dynamically changing rectangular plane  with corner points  (exaggerated for illustration only) representing the location of the four optical sensors (optical fiber terminations)  used in the configuration  of FIG. .","Refer to FIG. . As further demonstration of how washover data may be presented, a display  provides a binary representation in alphanumeric  and graphical ,  format of the washover state relative to a monitored threshold . The threshold  may be set to a predefined depth. Above that depth the status  is defined as wet; below that depth, it is defined as dry. A real-time display  of washover state (wet or dry) is graphically presented as well as a statistical representation  of the percent of time that the four-sensor array of  has been inundated during a given period of interest.","Refer to FIG. . To illustrate the real-time dynamics of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a test cylinder  was filled with seawater to a depth of approximately 0.5 cm (0.2\u2033). The cylinder  was manually rotated and tilted at an angle permitting the water level to vary and sequentially submerge and expose elements  in a sensor array.","Refer to .  depicts a sequence  of \u201csnapshots\u201d of dynamic washover from a test using the configuration of  in which the circular  represent a simulated top-view of the test cylinder  showing the relative position of the four washover sensors  in the array.

Each associated three-dimensional graph  displays the actual acquired washover data. A value for each corner  of the graph in the X-Y plane represents the location of an optical sensor (optical fiber termination)  and the value along the Z-axis represents a water depth of 0 to 1 cm (0.4\u2033).

The ordinate is inverted to compensate for the inversion inherent in the output of the analog electronics  and to present data in a manner consistent with the theoretical 1\/rfalloff curve  plotted as a reference.","To ensure that the system functioned under a variety of lighting conditions, tests were performed under natural skylight, incandescent light, fluorescent lighting, and in the dark. All lighting variations produced identical results.","Using basic concepts derived from optical transmission theory, multiple test instrumentation methodologies may be pursued. A photosensor  will \u201csee\u201d a different amount (magnitude) of light emanating from a remote, diffuse source such as ambient light or \u201cnatural sky light,\u201d depending on whether it is exposed to the light directly via ambient air or through a layer of another fluid, such as seawater. The effect of \u201cseeing\u201d through a layer of fluid is even more pronounced if, as with seawater, the fluid contains additional mineral and biologic elements that promote scattering and consequent attenuation of the received incident light.","Refer to . A layer of fluid \u201cbridgin\u201d (as at  in ) an optical source\/receiver pair ,  may be sensed to provide indication of inundation  of the surface of an object to which the receiver  of the source\/receiver pair ,  is affixed. For example, a configuration may be established such that when the source\/receiver pair ,  is dry, the light from the source  of the source\/receiver pair ,  is not coupled to the receiver , but upon inundation , the light may be coupled from source  to receiver  via one or more of the mechanisms of optical scattering, reflection, and refraction.","Using multiple optical fibers, there are three distinct optical washover implementations pursued in preferred embodiments of the present invention with variations of these also possible. These are: the \u201creflectivity method,\u201d the \u201ccross-coupled method,\u201d and the \u201cambient illumination method.\u201d","Refer to FIG. . The reflectivity method uses an array  () of single point optical fiber (cable) terminations (FIG. A), each termination  appearing flush with the surface of interest of the test object . Each termination  of the array  is connected to the converging port of an optical splitter  (or circulator). An optical receiver (photosensor)  is connected to one of the two diverging ports of the splitter  and an optical source (transmitter)  to the other. The receiver , transmitter , and splitter  may be replaced with an optical power meter (not shown separately) that measures the reflected photonic power present in an optical fiber . The power meter monitors both the transmitted optical power and the reflected photonic power, producing a signal that is proportional to the normalized reflected photonic power.","The reflectivity method, as do the other two methods, monitors \u201cfairly rapidly\u201d changing reflectance levels at the end  of an optical fiber . It monitors the change in reflectivity at the boundary represented by the end  of the optical fiber  and its overlying material, be it ambient air, lake water, seawater, or any of a number of materials having a different reflectivity than that of the material representing the \u201cnormal\u201d operating state for the optical fiber .","For example, if the optical fiber  as provided in an array  of  normally terminates in ambient air as shown in , the reflectance will be known and established as the quiescent condition. Any deviation from this value indicates a different material (as illustrated at  in ) is \u201ccovering\u201d the optical fiber termination . Knowing the reflectance of a number of materials that could be expected to cover the optical fiber termination , one is able to determine instantaneously not only the state of the surface of the test object  at that termination  but also what is causing the change, e.g., snow, ice, seawater, steam, fog, etc. Using appropriate optical to electronic converters , wire connections (not shown separately except as an umbilical ), and data processors, such as an appropriately configured PC , a real time display of the status of the test object  may be generated. As well, data may be recorded for later analysis, playback and display. Finally, a light source (transmitter) , as shown in the block diagram of , may be modulated (as shown in  at ) to assist in distinguishing unwanted (ambient) light from source light.","Refer to FIG. C. An array  need not be physically inserted into a test object  as described for , but may be configured on a thin flexible (conformable) panel  that may be temporarily affixed to an object not specially configured for testing.","Refer to FIG. . As shown in , the cross-coupled method uses two separate co-located optical path terminations  for each point in the array , one a source , the other a receiver (sensor) . Transmission variation, also termed \u201ccross-talk,\u201d is used to indicate a change in the material covering the pair of terminations . For example, to monitor washover of an object floating in a liquid, if the path between the two terminations  is dry, negligible cross-talk occurs, indicating the quiescent condition, i.e., no washover. Upon inundation of the two terminations , a \u201cconducting bridge,\u201d as shown at  of , is formed over them, facilitating a cross-talk path. In a manner similar to the reflectivity method, knowing the magnitude of cross-talk caused by different \u201ccovering\u201d materials , allows one not only to monitor dry vs. wet conditions, for example, but also to determine the type of material covering the object . The same type of optical to electronic processors  and optical source  as used with the reflectivity method and shown in the block diagram of  may be used with this method, although splitters  are not needed since data are taken from the receivers  alone. Again, the array  need not be permanently affixed to the object, but may be installed in a thin conformable panel  as shown in FIG. C.","Refer to FIG. . As shown in , the ambient illumination method relies on a single optical fiber end (sensor)  and a single photosensor (receiver)  at each location within the array  affixed upon the test object . Again, the quiescent condition in the case of a washover sensor is the dry state. For a dry sensor array  illuminated by sunlight or other broad-beam light source , all sensors read approximately the same level of photonic intensity. When washover occurs, some and possibly all of the sensors  will be inundated. While inundated, the sensor  receives less ambient light  than when dry, thus indicating a covering exists, as shown in  at . By sampling the received light at intervals pre-specified to yield appropriate dynamic information, one is able to \u201cplay back\u201d what occurs during these events, either in real time or after some post-processing, or both, depending on the needs of the user. Again, as depicted in the block diagram of , the same type of optical to electronic converters  may be used with this method as with the other two previously described methods.","Refer to . For each of the above described methods, an umbilical , comprising either fiber optic cables (optical fibers) or hard wires, depending on implementation specifics, is arranged to lead from a watertight port  on the test object  to a data processor, typically a multi-channel multiplexed data acquisition board interfaced to a personal computer  at a location remote from the test object , either onboard a vessel or on land. Using custom software, the PC  performs data acquisition, storage, processing, mapping, and display (visualization) functions, providing graphical, digital, and analog outputs as needed by a user.","The non-distributed test configurations for each of the methods described above are suitable for use in benign environments or for one-time setups such as employed in a laboratory to verify bench-scale models employing multiple open-ended optical fibers, i.e., one for each sensor. Additionally, in any practical embodiment, any of the non-distributed configurations require more expensive processors in that each must use a synchronized multiplexer to time division multiplex (TDM) the output of each of the individual sensors onto a single metallic or fiber transmission path for interconnection to a data acquisition system. This type of instrumentation may be available in a laboratory routinely, but robust versions for use in the field may prove to be an unnecessarily expensive burden as compared to distributed sensor systems.","In the present example, a method and instrumentation technique are employed with but a single optical fiber (cable) in communication with a series of \u201cdiscrete\u201d washover sensors. Refer to , illustrating the basic concept of a distributed fiber sensor array  on an instrumented test object , where each of the inverted \u201cU-shaped\u201d features  (exaggerated in size for illustrative purposes) represents a discrete sensor. The configuration  employs the individual sensors  as \u201cbared\u201d sections of a single optical fiber, i.e., a section of fiber optic cable extending between adjacent holes in the test object  has been stripped of its outer cladding to form each U-shaped sensor . This single optical fiber  is \u201cwoven\u201d through the outer surface of the test object  to form an array  of sensors , each sensor comprising a bared section of the single optical fiber  stretching between two holes on the external surface of the test object (or through a thin flat conformable panel as shown at ).","Refer to , providing further detail on the U-shaped sensors . In this embodiment, the individual sensors  are discrete only in respect to their physical location, i.e., each U-shaped sensor  is a part of a single optical fiber  with a central core . The optical fiber  is inserted through the outer skin of the test object , stripped of its external cladding, and the test object's skin is sealed from water intrusion by gaskets  or caulking. Thus, the difference between the optical fiber  and the \u201cdiscrete\u201d sensor  is the absence of opaque cladding where the sensor  is exposed along the surface of the test object .","Refer to FIG. B. It is important to provide a small physical profile of the sensor  upon the surface of the test object , thus, the configuration represented in  is a preferred embodiment where the optical fiber  is woven through the test object  to fit tightly against the skin of the test object , or even be recessed to fit flush with the surface. Another embodiment provides the same reduced profile as  but in a thin panel  for temporary attachment to an object one does not wish to modify in order to test. Thus, for non-destructive testing (NDT), a thin panel  may be \u201cwoven\u201d as just described and affixed temporarily to the skin of an object that may be used later for its intended purpose, i.e., not just for testing. The thin panel  may be less than 2.5 mm (0.1\u2033), and bonded to the surface of interest with a strong but temporary adhesive. The umbilical  leads from the thin panel , rather than from the interior of the test object  as is the case with previously described test configurations. This would provide a means for testing an object  without permanently altering its configuration, i.e., drilling holes through its external shell.","Refer to . An umbilical  provides two-way communication between an optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR)  (not separately shown in",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0135"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["701","2100","2101","2110"]},"The principle of time domain reflectometry (TDR) is widely known, described in the technical literature, and applied to numerous measurements and testing applications. A light source, such as the LED  of , is coupled to the OTDR , generating a very short duration light pulse, e.g., on the order of a nanosec. The OTDR in turn couples the light pulse to an optical fiber  that functions as a fiber-optic transmission line. That light pulse propagates down the optical fiber  at a fixed and calculable velocity that is a function of the speed of light, c, and the optical and physical characteristics of the optical fiber . The light pulse propagates until the end of the optical fiber  is reached and then is reflected back towards its source, i.e., the OTDR . The time, t, in seconds, that it takes for the light pulse to make the round trip is given by: \n\n\nwhere:\n\n","Refer to . A distributed fiber optic sensor array  or system employs serial connections of fiber optic sensors  distributed along a single fiber optic cable (transmission path) . This concept is discussed in depth in Udd (1990). The application of OTDR with a distributed fiber optic sensor  is discussed in Allard (1990). An optical fiber  may be configured in such a manner to include numerous discrete sensors  distributed uniformly, or by some other advantageous distribution, along its entire length. The index of refraction contrast at each discrete sensor  is caused by the insertion of that sensor  at points along the length of the optical fiber . This causes a small reflective pulse  to appear on the OTDR trace  for each of the sensors  so inserted. Under quiescent conditions, e.g., \u201cwashover\u201d sensors  exposed only to ambient air, these pulses  are of minimal amplitude. When the environment surrounding a sensor  changes, e.g., the sensor  is inundated by seawater , the reflection coefficient at the sensor\/environment boundary changes causing a pulse  present on the display associated with the OTDR  to change magnitude.","At any change of the environment about an individual sensor  along the optical fiber , e.g., from optical fiber\/air  to optical fiber\/water , a refractive index contrast (or discontinuity) exists. As a light pulse traveling down the optical fiber  from the light source  used with the OTDR  encounters these changed sensor conditions, a portion of the energy in the pulse of light is reflected back to the source  from the discontinuity. A portion of the energy continues to propagate through the optical fiber  until another boundary discontinuity such as a discrete sensor , is encountered or the end of the optical fiber  causes all or part of the remaining energy to return along the optical fiber  to the source . Measuring the round trip \u201ctime of flight\u201d of the pulse along the optical fiber  permits calculation of the physical distance from the OTDR source  to each of the discrete optical sensors  encountered. Knowledge of the refractive index of the optical sensor component  and the surrounding medium, e.g., air or water, facilitates calculation of a reflection coefficient, \u03c1. The value of \u03c1 provides an indication of the environment to which the individual optical sensor  is exposed, e.g., wet or dry. The relative magnitude of the reflection is proportional to the reflection coefficient, \u03c1, as defined in Eqn. (3) above, and some small, often inconsequential, attenuation at the sensor  due to the distance of the sensor  from the OTDR source .","The length of the optical fiber  and number of discrete sensors  able to be included is a function of the calculated maximum transmission losses. The far (distal) end (not shown separately) of the optical fiber  may be terminated either in a reflection-free termination (not shown separately) or left open. By keeping the optical fiber  open ended, a mismatch reflection will occur and be visible on the OTDR  display. Having this mismatch reflection present is useful to indicate the location of the distal end of the optical fiber  in relation to the array  of distributed sensors .","The near (proximal) end of the optical fiber  may extend up to several hundred meters as part of an \u201cumbilical\u201d (not shown separately) to connect to an OTDR  beyond the test object . In practical applications any umbilical such as that umbilical  to and from the test object  to the processor(s) ,  should be strain-relieved and armored.","Refer to , illustrating how a distributed sensor  incorporating T-connectors  functions and how the associated OTDR trace  may appear when sensors  are covered, e.g., wet , as highlighted in the shaded area  and when sensors  are dry as indicated by pulses  of minimal amplitude. A linear array  of fiber optic sensors  is partially covered in water . Sensors  surrounding the wetted sensors (not visible under the washover  of ) are dry.","The OTDR trace  shows a reflection pulse ,  representative of each one of the sensors  in the optical array . Sensors  that are wet with washover as represented by the cross-hatched area , exhibit a larger magnitude pulse  than pulses  from dry sensors . The general slope (exaggerated for illustration) of the trace  is due to linear attenuation with distance from the source (associated with the OTDR ) along the optical fiber . This attenuation is usually referenced in decibels (dB) per length, e.g., dB\/km. The general slope of the trace (curve)  is proportional to loss due to attenuation. For a short array , e.g., less than 10 m, this loss is negligible and the slope approaches zero. The maximum length of the optical fiber  and maximum number of included discrete sensors  is a function of the maximum transmission path attenuation encountered and the sensitivity of the OTDR  employed. The minimum spacing between discrete sensors  is a function of the selected pulse width. A narrower pulse width permits closer placement of distributed sensors  along a given length of optical fiber  and provides greater detail about washover geometry. As first discussed above, the distributed sensor  also may be implemented in a flexible, reusable, conformal sensor panel  that would not require drilling holes in an object  to be tested while still minimizing disruption of washover geometry at the surface of its application to the object .","While the invention has been described in terms of its preferred embodiments, one skilled in the art will recognize that the invention may be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For example, although the system is described in specific examples for mapping, visualizing, or imaging washover, it may operate on any surface and in conditions that one would wish to map occurrences on a surface. For example, although the system is described in specific examples for mapping, visualizing, or imaging washover, it may operate on any surface and in conditions that one would wish to map occurrences on a surface, such as drifting snow, drifting sand or silt, sediment, etc., both in a practical implementation and in a scaled experimental testing facility such as a wind tunnel, wave tank, etc. It may be suitable for other applications such as determining operating conditions in a manufacturing plant, e.g., calibrating the process establishing the thickness and uniformity of a transparent or semi-transparent polishing liquid use on a silicon wafer for purposes of optimizing polishing, quality sampling the process for layering a transparent coating of sugar on a confection, etc. Further, monitoring 3-D depth of any transparent or semi-transparent film of molten wax, oil or liquid plastic in a wave-coating tank may be another possibility.","Thus, it is intended that all matter contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative rather than limiting, and the invention should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents.","The abstract is provided to comply with the rules requiring an abstract, which will allow a searcher to quickly ascertain the subject matter of the technical disclosure of any patent issued from this disclosure.
