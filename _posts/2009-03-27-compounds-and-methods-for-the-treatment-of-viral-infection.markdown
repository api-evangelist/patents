Accordingly, the Government of the United States has certain rights in and to the invention.","The human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 is characterized by a very high mutation frequency. Because the virus mutates so frequently, drug resistance to antiviral therapies s is an ongoing challenge. Common regimens of anti-HIV drugs include Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) that mimic thymidine (AZT, stavudine), deoxycytidine (Lamivudine, Emtricitabine) or deoxyguanosine (Abacavir) nucleosides.","Acyclovir (ACV) is a deoxyguanosine analogue particularly active against \u03b1-herpesiviruses HHV-1, HHV-2, and HHV-3 (respectively known as herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 and varicella zoster virus). ACV is phosphorylated in herpesvirus-infected cells by a viral kinase. The resulting monophosphate is then converted into ACV triphosphate (ACV-TP) by cellular enzymes and is subsequently incorporated in the nascent viral DNA chain, causing its obligate termination. Moreover, the incorporated ACV-TP causes the viral DNA polymerase to become irreversibly bound to the terminated chain.","In one aspect, the invention provides a compound represented by the formula (Formula I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"44.28mm","wi":"66.72mm","file":"US08946243-20150203-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Ar is an aryl group having 6 to 30 carbon atoms or a heteroaryl group having 6 to 30 atoms, wherein the aryl or heteroaryl group may be substituted with 1-3 substituents; Q is O, S, or CRR, wherein Rand Rare independently selected from H and C-Calkyl;","X is H, or CHOH;","Rand Rare independently selected from H, or the group consisting of optionally substituted C-Calkyl, C-Calkenyl, Calkoxy, C-Calkynyl, or C-Ccycloalkyl; or Rand Rare fused to form a contiguous carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring which may be 3-20 members in total;","each of R and Ris independently selected from the group consisting of H, and optionally substituted C-Calkyl, C-Ccycloalkyl, C-Calkenyl, Calkoxy, or C-Calkynyl; or R and Rare taken together with the carbon and nitrogen atoms to which they are respectively attached to form a 4-6 membered ring;","and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, and prodrugs thereof;","with the proviso that if Ar is phenyl, R is H, Ris methyl, Ris H, Ris H or methyl, and X is H, then Q cannot be O.","In certain embodiments, R and Rare taken together with the nitrogen and carbon atoms to which they are respectively attached to form a 5 membered ring.

In certain embodiments, Ar is phenyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, or naphthyl. In certain embodiments, Ar is phenyl, or 1-naphthyl. In certain embodiments, Ar is phenyl.

At low concentrations, these prodrugs suppressed the replication of HIV-1 in MT-4 cells while non-phosphorylated ACV does not affect HIV-1 replication at all. For example, at a concentration of 5 \u03bcM, ACV prodrug Cf2649 inhibits replication of HIV-1 by 99% in the MT-4 cell line while both ACV-MP and ACV at the same concentration are inefficient in inhibiting HIV-1.","Moreover, these compounds may be efficient in preventing HIV transmission. Since the structure of these compounds is close to ACV, the low-toxicity drug that is used to treat herpes-virus infection, there is a strong possibility that they are non-toxic in vivo and have few if any significant side-effects. These drugs may be used in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. In particular, (i) application of these compounds topically (as microbicides) to the mucosa of HIV-infected persons will reduce the HIV viral load in their genital or rectal compartments thus reducing the probability of HIV transmission; (ii) topical application of these drugs to the mucosa of genitals or rectum (microbicides) to HIV-negative individuals may prevent transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive partner; (iii) given the inherent activity of ACV against HSV-2, the cause of frequently seen genital infections, the application of the ACV prodrugs will further decrease the incidence of HIV infection due to inhibition of HSV-2 infection; (iv) systemic application of these drugs may lead to control the HIV viral load in the plasmatic compartment thus achieving a major goal to reduce and slow down progression of the disease.","Thus, the present invention provides a method of treating HIV infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).","Treatment of HIV Infection and AIDS","The invention provides methods of treatment for, or prevention of, HIV infections, which methods in general comprise administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a monophosphorylated prodrug of acyclovir (e.g., a compound of Formula I or IA) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof to a subject such that HIV infection or AIDS is treated or prevented. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the monophosphorylated prodrugs of acyclovir is converted into an effective amount of acyclovir triphosphate.","In certain embodiments, monophosphorylated prodrugs of acyclovir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, is administered to a subject (e.g., a mammal, e.g., a human) concurrently with one or more other biologically active agents. By \u201cconcurrently\u201d it is meant that acyclovir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof and the other agent are administered to a mammal in a sequence and within a time interval such that monophosphorylated prodrugs of acyclovir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof can act together with the other agent to provide an increased or synergistic benefit than if they were administered otherwise. For example, each component may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time; however, if not administered at the same time, they should be administered sufficiently closely in time so as to provide the desired treatment effect. Preferably, all components are administered at the same time, and if not administered at the same time, they may all be administered from about 6 hours to about 12 hours apart from one another.","When used in combination with other therapeutic agents, monophosphorylated prodrugs of acyclovir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof and the therapeutic agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically. In one embodiment, monophosphorylated prodrugs of acyclovir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof is administered concurrently with another therapeutic agent in the same pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment, monophosphorylated prodrugs of acyclovir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof is administered concurrently with another therapeutic agent in separate pharmaceutical compositions. In still another embodiment, monophosphorylated prodrugs of acyclovir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof is administered prior or subsequent to administration of another therapeutic agent. In one embodiment, combination therapy involves alternating between administering monophosphorylated prodrugs of acyclovir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof and a pharmaceutical composition comprising another therapeutic agent, e.g., to minimize the toxicity associated with a particular drug. In certain embodiments, when monophosphorylated prodrugs of acyclovir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof is administered concurrently with another therapeutic agent that potentially produces adverse side effects including, but not limited to toxicity, the therapeutic agent can advantageously be administered at a dose that falls below the threshold that the adverse side effect is elicited. In certain embodiments, a monophosphorylated prodrug of acyclovir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof is administered concurrently with a second, and a third (and, optionally, a fourth) therapeutic agent (e.g., one or more agent(s) used for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)).","Monophosphorylated prodrugs of acyclovir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof may be used in combination with other medicaments such as nucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors, HIV fusion inhibitors, HIV attachment inhibitors, CCR5 inhibitors, CXCR4 inhibitors, HIV budding or maturation inhibitors, or HIV integrase inhibitors or combinations thereof.

Suitable dosages can also be based upon the text and documents cited herein. A determination of the appropriate dosages is within the skill of one in the art given the parameters herein.","In terms of treatment, an effective amount is an amount that is sufficient to palliate, ameliorate, stabilize, reverse or slow the progression of an enveloped virus infection, HIV infection, AIDS or the symptoms thereof. A therapeutically effective amount can be provided in one or a series of administrations. In terms of an adjuvant, an effective amount is one sufficient to enhance the immune response to the immunogen. The effective amount is generally determined by the physician on a case-by-case basis and is within the skill of one in the art.","As a rule, the dosage for in vivo therapeutics or diagnostics will vary. Several factors are typically taken into account when determining an appropriate dosage.","These factors include age, sex and weight of the patient, the condition being treated, the severity of the condition and the form of the antibody being administered. In an exemplary embodiment, the dosage of a monophosphorylated ACV prodrug is about 0.1 mg\/kg\/day to about 100 mg\/kg\/day, or about 0.5mg\/kg\/day to about 50 mg\/kg\/day.","In certain embodiments, the subject is identified (i.e., diagnosed) as suffering from or susceptible to HIV infection (e.g., the subject has tested positive for HIV-1- or HIV-2 infection).","A therapeutically effective amount can be administered in one or more doses. The term \u201cadministration\u201d or \u201cadministering\u201d includes routes of introducing the compound(s) to a subject to perform their intended function. Examples of routes of administration which can be used include injection (subcutaneous, intravenous, parenterally, intraperitoneally, intrathecal), oral, inhalation, rectal and transdermal.","The phrases \u201cparenteral administration\u201d and \u201cadministered parenterally\u201d as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticulare, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal and intrasternal injection and infusion.","The phrases \u201csystemic administration,\u201d \u201cadministered systemically\u201d, \u201cperipheral administration\u201d and \u201cadministered peripherally\u201d as used herein mean the administration of a compound(s), drug or other material, such that it enters the patient's system and, thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes, for example, subcutaneous administration.","Such dosages may vary, for example, depending on whether multiple administrations are given, tissue type and route of administration, the condition of the individual, the desired objective and other factors known to those of skill in the art.","Available routes of administration include subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal, oral, intranasal, intrapulmonary (i.e., by aerosol), intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracavity, intrathecally or transdermally, alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents.","Oral Dosage Forms","Monophosphorylated prodrugs of acyclov or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate and compositions comprising monophosphorylated prodrugs of acyclovir that are suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as, but are not limited to, tablets (e.g., chewable tablets), caplets, capsules, and liquids (e.g., flavored syrups). Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients, and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See generally, 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1990).","Typical oral dosage forms of the invention are prepared by combining the active ingredient(s) in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. For example, excipients suitable for use in oral liquid or aerosol dosage forms include, but are not limited to, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, and coloring agents. Examples of excipients suitable for use in solid oral dosage forms (e.g., powders, tablets, capsules, and caplets) include, but are not limited to, starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents.","Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid excipients are employed. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers, finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if necessary.","For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredients in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.","Examples of excipients that can be used in oral dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, binders, fillers, disintegrants, and lubricants. Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, (e.g., nos. 2208, 2906, 2910), microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof.","Examples of fillers suitable for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof. The binder or filler in pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is typically present in from about 50 to about 99 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form.","Suitable forms of microcrystalline cellulose include, but are not limited to, the materials sold as AVICEL-PH-101, AVICEL-PH-103 AVICEL RC-581, AVICEL-PH-105 (available from FMC Corporation, American Viscose Division, Avicel Sales, Marcus Hook, Pa.), and mixtures thereof. A specific binder is a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sold as AVICEL RC-581. Suitable anhydrous or low moisture excipients or additives include AVICEL-PH-103.TM and Starch 1500 LM.","Disintegrants are used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Tablets that contain too much disintegrant may disintegrate in storage, while those that contain too little may not disintegrate at a desired rate or under the desired conditions. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too much nor too little to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredients should be used to form solid oral dosage forms of the invention. The amount of disintegrant used varies based upon the type of formulation, and is readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. Typical pharmaceutical compositions comprise from about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, specifically from about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant.","Disintegrants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums, and mixtures thereof.","Lubricants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar, and mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel (AEROSIL 200, manufactured by W. R. Grace Co. of Baltimore, Md.), a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica (marketed by Degussa Co. of Plano, Tex.), CAB-O-SIL (a pyrogenic silicon dioxide product sold by Cabot Co. of Boston, Mass.), and mixtures thereof. If used at all, lubricants are typically used in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms into which they are incorporated.","Parenteral and Intravascular Dosage Forms","Parenteral and intravascular dosage forms can be administered to patients by various routes including, but not limited to, subcutaneous, intravenous (including bolus injection and constant infusion), intramuscular, and intraarterial. Because their administration typically bypasses patients' natural defenses against contaminants, parenteral and intravascular dosage forms are preferably sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, solutions ready for injection, dry products (including, but not limited to lyophilized powders, pellets, and tablets) ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions.","Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms of the invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.","Compounds that increase the solubility of one or more of the active ingredients disclosed herein can also be incorporated into the parenteral dosage forms of the invention.","For intravascular administration, for instance by direct injection into the blood vessel, or surrounding area, it may be desirable to administer the compositions locally to the area in need of treatment. This can be achieved, for example, by local infusion during surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as silastic membranes, or fibers. A suitable such membrane is Gliadel\u00ae provided by Guilford Pharmaceuticals Inc.","Transdermal, Topical, And Mucosal Dosage Forms","Transdermal, topical, and mucosal dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, ophthalmic solutions, sprays, aerosols, creams, lotions, ointments, gels, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, or other forms known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th and 18th eds., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1980 & 1990); and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 4th ed., Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia (1985). Dosage forms suitable for treating mucosal tissues within the oral cavity can be formulated as mouthwashes or as oral gels. Further, transdermal dosage forms include \u201creservoir type\u201d or \u201cmatrix type\u201d patches, which can be applied to the skin and worn for a specific period of time to permit the penetration of a desired amount of active ingredients.","Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that can be used to provide transdermal, topical, and mucosal dosage forms encompassed by this invention are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will be applied. With that fact in mind, typical excipients include, but are not limited to, water, acetone, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, mineral oil, and mixtures thereof to form lotions, tinctures, creams, emulsions, gels or ointments, which are non-toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable. Moisturizers or humectants can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms if desired. Examples of such additional ingredients are well known in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th and 18th eds., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1980 & 1990).","Depending on the specific tissue to be treated, additional components may be used prior to, in conjunction with, or subsequent to treatment with active ingredients of the invention. For example, penetration enhancers can be used to assist in delivering the active ingredients to the tissue. Suitable penetration enhancers include, but are not limited to: acetone; various alcohols such as ethanol, oleyl, and tetrahydrofuryl; alkyl sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide; dimethyl acetamide; dimethyl formamide; polyethylene glycol; pyrrolidones such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; Kollidon grades (Povidone, Polyvidone); urea; and various water-soluble or insoluble sugar esters such as Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) and Span 60 (sorbitan monostearate).","The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form, or of the tissue to which the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is applied, may also be adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Similarly, the polarity of a solvent carrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can be adjusted to improve delivery. Compounds such as stearates can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms to advantageously alter the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In this regard, stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying agent or surfactant, and as a delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent. Different salts, hydrates or solvates of the active ingredients can be used to further adjust the properties of the resulting composition.","Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the present invention, certain specific methods and materials are described below. The materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.

Effect of ACV Monophosphorylated Prodrugs on HIV Replication","A. Materials and Methods","Cells","Human T-lymphocyte MT-4 or CEM cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va.) and cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 2 mM L-glutamine and 0.075 M NaHCO.","Viruses","HIV-1(III) was provided by Dr. R. C. Gallo and Dr. M. Popovic (at that time at the NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). A closely related HIV-1 variant (LAI.04) was obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program.","Antiretrovirus Assays","a. In Cell Line","Briefly, CEM cells (4.5\u00d710cells per ml) were suspended in fresh culture medium and infected with HIV-1 at 100 CCID(cell culture infective dose-50) per ml of cell suspension. Then 100 \u03bcl of the infected cell suspension were transferred to microplate wells, mixed with 100 \u03bcl of the appropriate dilutions of the test compounds, and further incubated at 37\u00b0 C. After 4-5 days, giant cell formation was recorded microscopically in the CEM cell cultures. The 50% effective concentration (EC) corresponded to the compound concentrations required to prevent syncytium formation by 50% in the virus-infected CEM cell cultures. MT4 cells (1\u00d710cells per ml) were suspended in fresh culture medium and infected with 10 uL of HIV-1viral stock at 260 CCID(cell culture infective dose-50) per ml of cell suspension. Then infected cell suspensions were transferred to microplate wells, mixed with 1 mL of the appropriate dilutions of the test compounds, and further incubated at 37\u00b0 C. After 7 days, p24 production was measured in the MT4 cell cultures supernatant. The 50% effective concentration (EC) corresponded to the compound concentrations required to suppress by 50% the production of p24 in the virus-infected MT4 cell cultures.","b. In Ex vivo Human Tonsillar Tissue Culture","Tonsillar tissues from routine surgery were obtained from the Children's National Medical Center, Washington D.C. Tissues were dissected into 2-mmblocks and placed onto collagen sponge gels at the air-liquid interface. Tissue blocks were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids (1 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), amphotericin B (2.5 \u03bcg\/mL) and gentamicin (50 \u03bcg\/mL). The culture medium was changed every 3 days and prodrugs were replenished. Blocks of human lymphoid tonsillar tissues were inoculated ex vivo with X4and treated with increasing concentration of each prodrug (0,1; 0.5; 1; 5 and 10 \u03bcM). HIV-1 replication was monitored by measuring p24accumulated in culture media over 3 day periods. For each donor, HIV-1 replication in 9 treated blocks was compared with that in 9 untreated blocks from the same donor.","B. Results.","I. In Cell Lines","a.
