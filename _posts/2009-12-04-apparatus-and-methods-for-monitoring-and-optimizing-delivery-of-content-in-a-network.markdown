title: Apparatus and methods for monitoring and optimizing delivery of content in a network
abstract: Methods and apparatus for delivering content to a user so as to optimize and enhance the “experience” of the content. In one embodiment, an optimization and monitoring entity (OME) is used which determines, evaluates, and provides notification and/or recommendation of alternative content delivery platforms which are available to a user. The OME receives requests for content forwarded from a content server containing information identifying requesting devices and/or subscriber accounts. The OME examines the capabilities of the registered devices, and identifies/recommends alternative devices based on e.g., video/audio quality, picture size, bandwidth availability, and/or any other additional capabilities of the client devices. A notification is then sent to the client devices indicating which of the user's devices may receive the content alternatively, or in addition to, the requesting device. The notifications may be interactive, allowing the user to select one or more of the devices for delivery.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","1. Field of Invention","The present invention relates generally to the field of optimizing the operation of a content delivery network such as for example a cable, Hybrid Fiber Copper (HFCu), or satellite network. More particularly, the present invention is in one exemplary aspect related to apparatus and methods for monitoring and optimizing delivery of programs including across a plurality of delivery platforms.","2. Description of Related Technology","Recent advances in digital information processing and technology have made a whole range of services and functions available for delivery to consumers at various types devices for very reasonable prices or subscription fees. These services and functions include digital content or programming (movies, etc.), digital video-on-demand (VOD), personal video recorder (PVR) and networked PVR (nPVR), Internet Protocol television (IPTV), digital media playback and recording, as well high speed Internet access (including so-called \u201cInternet TV\u201d, where television programming is delivered over the Internet without QoS) and IP-based telephony (e.g., VoIP). Other services available to network users include access to, and recording of, digital music (e.g., MP3 files).","Currently, many of these services are provided to the user via a wide variety of different equipment environments and delivery paradigms including, inter alia, cable or satellite modems or QAMs, HFCu (i.e., Hybrid Fiber-copper distribution via indigenous POST\/PSTN wiring in a premises), Wi-Fi\u2122 hubs, Ethernet hubs, gateways, switches, and routers, to a plurality of user equipment types. For example, content may be delivered to users at set-top boxes, personal (desktop) computers, laptop computers, other mini-computers (such as so-called \u201cnetbooks\u201d, mini-notebook computers), and\/or other devices. Recent advances in consumer electronics have also led to the widespread introduction of a variety of portable media devices (PMDs) such as, inter alia, portable digital music devices such as the well known Apple iPod\u2122 and other so-called \u201cMP3 players\u201d, cellular telephones\/smartphones, handheld computers, and personal digital assistants (PDA), which allow users to store and playback audio and video files.","Although a myriad of services, equipment, data formats and providers are available, current systems offer little to no interoperability or \u201cintelligent\u201d interrelationship between devices. The request for and playback of audio and video files from a first device is often limited to playback via the device itself. In other words, a user may utilize a device to only select delivery of audio and video files to be played back on that same device. Thus, if a user requests video content, the user is often limited to delivery of the requested content to that device. Further, the request messages are frequently determined by a specific protocol tied to the device or software that maybe incompatible with other device and software protocols thereby creating incompatibility issues. Current technology allows one device to browse the directory structure of other compatible devices (see, e.g., DLNA technology); however, there is no real intelligence or over-arching cognizance of the relationship of all of the devices associated with a given user or subscriber account, and their relationship to different types of content available over the various networks or delivery paradigms.","Nor is their any analysis of what devices or combinations of devices, encodings, etc. would give the user the best \u201cexperience\u201d with respect to given content, including consideration of user-specific preferences. Rather, extant solutions are generally completely passive, and take no active role in evaluating, recommending, or selecting content formats, delivery modes or user platforms and translating multiprotocol message requests.","Therefore, what are needed are improved apparatus and methods for distributing content to a plurality of a user premises and PMD devices. Such improved apparatus and services would ideally, upon user request for content, provide users with recommendations for optimizing the user's experience and\/or the network workload. For example, mechanisms would be provided to exploit the various features of the different ones of the user's available devices, as well as that user's delivery preferences.","Moreover, it would be desirable to permit the user to view their content anywhere (and on any device) they desire, at any given time, including the ability to transfer extant content \u201csessions\u201d between different devices, the latter which may include heterogeneous hardware\/software environments.","The present invention satisfies the foregoing needs by providing, inter alia, improved apparatus and methods for optimization and monitoring of content delivery, including monitoring and optimizing content delivery across a plurality of delivery platforms associated with a single user or premises.","In a first aspect of the invention, a method for providing content is disclosed.

One salient functionality of the present invention is to provide the user (e.g., a subscriber of an IP, cable or satellite network) with the best possible \u201cuser experience\u201d at all times, depending on the various hardware\/software environments they have available to them, and their current usage needs and preferences.","In one embodiment, an optimization and monitoring entity (OME) is utilized in conjunction with other network and user premises components to provide the aforementioned functionality. The OME comprises one or more software applications which work in conjunction with one another (and with one or more content servers) to determine, evaluate, and provide notification to a user of one or more alternative content delivery platforms, such as for example when a request for content is received. Alternative services, transports, and delivery models, may also be recommended in another variant of the invention.","In one exemplary use case, requests for content are received at a content server, and forwarded to the OME. The content server may satisfy the request, or may first require selection of a delivery platform. Information identifying the requesting device (such as IP address, MAC address, etc.) and\/or the subscriber account or specific user (such as account number, physical address, login\/password information, etc.) is derived from or embedded in the content requests (or otherwise retrieved from information contained within the request). The OME uses the collected information to determine whether the requesting device is registered to a known user account by comparing the identification to a database of registered accounts and devices. The OME uses the aforementioned database to compile a list of all of the other known client devices in a specific user's account. Software applications running on the OME further differentiate the various features and capabilities of the different types of client devices registered to a user account and which may be used to receive content. In one variant, the OME comprises a \u201crecommendation engine\u201d that determines whether requested content may be provided to the same user on a different platform; e.g., on a different one of the client devices associated with the user's account. Such an alternative device may be recommended based on e.g., video\/audio quality, picture size, bandwidth availability, and\/or any other additional capabilities of the recommended client device, or may be recommended based on historical usage or other information about the user (or a specification of user preferences associated with the account and accessed by the OME).","In one implementation, a list of the alternative delivery platforms and\/or modes is presented to a user via a notification generated by the OME (or generated by the CPE after being triggered by the OME). The notifications sent to the client device(s) indicate which, if any, of the user's other devices may receive the content alternatively (or in addition to) the content being received at the requesting device. The notifications generated\/triggered by the OME may, in one embodiment, be interactive in nature and provide a user the ability to select one or more of the presented content delivery platforms, as well as features or configurations associated therewith.","The client devices requesting content and\/or being recommended for the delivery of content may include, inter alia, consumer premises devices (CPE)  (such as digital set top boxes (STB), IPTV devices, media bridges (MB), converged premises devices (CPD), etc.), personal video recorders (PVR), digital video recorders (DVR), network DVR, computer devices (such as personal computers (PC) and laptop computers), and mobile devices (including personal media devices (PMD) and mobile telephones). In one variant of the invention (so-called \u201cchain mode\u201d), the recommendation engine evaluates two or more communicating client devices along a \u201crendering path\u201d to determine the ultimate delivery configuration to the user (e.g., to prevent instances where the first device encountered in the chain provides the recommendation engine with a false representation of the quality of the entire rendering chain of devices).","In another aspect of the invention, a centralized control device is disclosed which permits the transfer or migration of content delivery sessions (e.g., SIP-based IPTV sessions or the like) between two or more devices. In one implementation, the user's premises gateway or DSTB or PC is used as the host device for a user interface which shows the various premises (and \u201coff-net\u201d) devices associated with the user\/subscriber account, and their interconnectivity. GUI functionality (e.g., a multi-touch-screen GUI, drag-and-drop, speech recognition application, or other interface\/input device) allows the user to rapidly designate particular devices for communication and establishment of a session\/delivery of content, and\/or transfer existing communication sessions between capable devices (such as may be determined by the OME recommendation engine).","Methods for utilization of the foregoing functionality, and a business rules engine for directing or adjusting the use of the optimization process, are also described herein.","Exemplary embodiments of the apparatus and methods of the present invention are now described in detail. While these exemplary embodiments are described in the context of the aforementioned hybrid fiber coax (HFC) cable system architecture having an multiple systems operator (MSO), digital networking capability, and plurality of client devices, the general principles and advantages of the invention may be extended to other types of networks and architectures, whether broadband, narrowband, wired or wireless, or otherwise, the following therefore being merely exemplary in nature. For example, a satellite receiver and delivery network, or alternatively an IP-based delivery network may be utilized. A WiMAX (IEEE Std. 802.16) broadband delivery network or transport could also be utilized.

Myriad other applications are possible.","It is further noted that while described primarily in the context of a cable delivery system with 6 MHz RF channels, the present invention is applicable to literally any network topology or paradigm, and any frequency\/bandwidth, such as for example 8 MHz channels. Furthermore, as referenced above, the invention is in no way limited to traditional cable system frequencies (i.e., below 1 GHz), and in fact may be used with systems that operate above 1 GHz band in center frequency or bandwidth, to include without limitation so-called ultra-wideband systems.","Also, while certain aspects are described primarily in the context of the well-known IP or Internet Protocol (described in, inter alia, RFC 791 and 2460), it will be appreciated that the present invention may utilize other types of protocols (and in fact bearer networks to include other internets and intranets) to implement the described functionality.","In a further embodiment, if the content is real-time streaming, streaming to the second device may begin as soon as possible after streaming to the first device ceases.

It will be appreciated that while a bar or bus LAN topology is illustrated, any number of other arrangements as previously referenced (e.g., ring, star, etc.) may be used consistent with the invention. It will also be appreciated that the headend configuration depicted in is high-level, conceptual architecture and that each MSO may have multiple headends deployed using custom architectures.","The architecture  of further includes a multiplexer\/encrypter\/modulator (MEM)  coupled to the HFC network  adapted to \u201ccondition\u201d content for transmission over the network. The distribution servers  are coupled to the LAN , which provides access to the MEM  and network  via one or more file servers . The VOD servers  are coupled to the LAN  as well, although other architectures may be employed (such as for example where the VOD servers are associated with a core switching device such as an 802.3z Gigabit Ethernet device). As previously described, information is carried across multiple channels. Thus, the headend must be adapted to acquire the information for the carried channels from various sources. Typically, the channels being delivered from the headend  to the CPE  (\u201cdownstream\u201d) are multiplexed together in the headend and sent to neighborhood hubs via a variety of interposed network components.","Content (e.g., audio, video, data, files, etc.) is provided in each downstream (in-band) channel associated with the relevant service group. To communicate with the headend or intermediary node (e.g., hub server), the CPE  may use the out-of-band (OOB) or DOCSIS channels and associated protocols.

One exemplary delivery paradigm comprises delivering MPEG-based video content, with the video transported to user PCs (or IP-based DSTBs) over the aforementioned DOCSIS channels comprising MPEG (or other video codec such as 11.264 or AVC) over IP over MPEG. That is, the higher layer MPEG- or other encoded content is encapsulated using an IP protocol, which then utilizes an MPEG packetization of the type well known in the art for delivery over the RF channels. In this fashion, a parallel delivery mode to the normal broadcast delivery exists; i.e., delivery of video content both over traditional downstream QAMs to the tuner of the user's STB or other receiver device for viewing on the television, and also as packetized IP data over the DOCSIS QAMs to the user's PC or other IP-enabled device via the user's cable modem.","Referring again to , the IP packets associated with Internet services are received by edge switch , and forwarded to the cable modem termination system (CMTS) . The CMTS examines the packets, and forwards packets intended for the local network to the edge switch . Other packets are discarded or routed to another component.","The edge switch  forwards the packets receive from the CMTS  to the QAM modulator , which transmits the packets on one or more physical (QAIVI-modulated RF) channels to the CPE. The IP packets are typically transmitted on RF channels that are different that the RF channels used for the broadcast video and audio programming (e.g., DOCSIS QAMs), although this is not a requirement. The CPE  are each configured to monitor the particular assigned RF channel (such as via a port or socket ID\/address, or other such mechanism) for IP packets intended for the subscriber premises\/address that they serve.","\u201cPacketized\u201d Networks\u2014","While the foregoing network architectures described herein can (and in fact do) carry packetized content (e.g., IP over MPEG for high-speed data or Internet TV, MPEG2 packet content over QAM for MPTS, etc.), they are often not optimized for such delivery.

The server entity  of the BPS  in one embodiment comprises a control and protocol translation server. In one embodiment, the protocol translation is implemented in a cable modem home gateway or other such premises device. The cable modem home gateway translates between an MSO-specific private network-facing protocol and a CE-device facing protocol. According to this embodiment, the MPEG video is carried in MPEG transport streams on 6 MHz QAM channels without any DOCSIS framing or IP wrappers. The modem in the home applies the IP wrapper at the time the flow out of the modem is initiated, and includes source and destination addresses. Tuning or other stream acquisition and termination transactions may also be included in this translation.","The BPS  may be used to collectively refer to one or more of the headend  entities discussed above with respect to , and may further comprise additional entities discussed herein below.

For example, one or more components of the BPS  may be disposed at various other locations (i.e., besides the headend ) as desired, consistent with the architecture implemented; e.g., at the BSA hub in a BSA network, or at a third party location off MSO premises.","In one embodiment, content is provided to the client devices  directly via the server  of the BPS ; e.g., as an IP packet stream or via a SIP session. In another embodiment, the BPS  merely directs other content delivery processes or entities to deliver content to the CPE .","In the illustrated embodiment, the server  receives content requests from various ones of the client devices  and, only after it is determined that the requesting client device  is \u201centitled\u201d to receive the content, the server  provides (or causes the provision of) the content thereto. The determination of whether a device is \u201centitled\u201d to receive content is accomplished using any number of different mechanisms; see, e.g., the methods and apparatus disclosed in co-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/536,724 filed on Aug. 6, 2009 and entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MANAGING ENTITLEMENTS TO DATA OVER A NETWORK\u201d incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As discussed therein, a request for content is received from the client device  at the server entity  of BPS . An entity at the BPS  (such as the OME , the server , or another entity) obtains information identifying the user account (such as subscriber identification number, account number, device ID such as MAC address or IP address, etc.), and uses this information to request entitlements from an entitlements server (not shown) located elsewhere at the headend . Based on the results returned from the entitlements server, the BPS  will either grant or deny the request. The entitlements server accesses subscription information in a subscriber and device database  to obtain sufficient information to determine the entitlements of the subscriber. In one implementation, the content server  or OME  may include the functionality of the aforementioned entitlements server therein.","In one embodiment, the server  of  comprises an application server (AS) such as the Mystro\u2122 server device of the type utilized by the Assignee hereof as discussed in co-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

As discussed therein, the client devices  may communicate with the AS to receive content and\/or notifications. The AS may be further adapted to perform content processing functions such as e.g., reformatting program streams (transcoding, transrating, etc.), and implementing trick mode functionality.","The OME  may comprise one or more software applications which, inter alia, monitor content requests received at the content server  of the BPS . A copy of each of the content requests received at the content server  is forwarded to the OME  (e.g., via inter-process message, or other communications link between the two processes). The content requests include information identifying the requesting device  (such as IP address, MAC address, TUNER_ID, etc.). The content request may further identify the subscriber account, such as account number, subscriber address, or by a user entered login password combination, etc., although it will be appreciated that only one piece of device- or account\/subscriber-specific information is required to initiate the optimization process. In other words, a content request may be made by a subscriber subsequent to, or in conjunction with, logging or signing in (such as via their on-screen display, to a website or other service, etc.). As will be described in greater detail below, the OME in other embodiments may function to optimize user delivery platforms and\/or mode on a \u201cpassive\u201d or unsolicited bases (e.g., periodically, or not upon any particular user content request or other action).","The OME  determines, based on the unique identification of the requesting device  and\/or information regarding the subscriber account, whether the device  is registered to a known user account by comparing the identification to a database  of registered accounts and devices. As will be discussed below, the database  includes a plurality of records associating one or more devices to individual user accounts.","Software applications running on the OME  (discussed below) differentiate and evaluate the various features and capabilities of the different types of client devices  which may be used to request and receive content for that account.","The OME  software application's evaluation of the above-disclosed information determines (i) whether requested content may be provided to the same user on different platforms; e.g., on one or more other client devices  associated with the user's account, and (ii) recommends delivery at ones of these devices to the user. This process is generally conducted with respect to an optimization goal or strategy (or according to a prescribed rule set), such as maximizing \u201cuser experience\u201d. As used herein, the term \u201cuser experience\u201d generally refers without limitation to the quality and\/or level of satisfaction that a user obtains from viewing or experiencing the content. However, other optimization goals\/rule sets may be employed, such as for example maximization of profit or revenue for the MSO (or advertisers or content providers), bandwidth conservation, and so forth.","In one exemplary implementation of the aforementioned \u201cuser experience\u201d optimization, a client device  may be recommended to the user based on e.g., video\/audio quality (e.g., SD versus HD or up-converted SD capability), picture size, bandwidth availability or capability (e.g., broadband versus narrowband data delivery), and\/or any other additional capabilities of the recommended client device , as will be discussed if further detail below.","The recommended devices  are in one embodiment presented to the user in a notification message, on-screen display window, icon, etc. which enables the user to select one or more devices for delivery. In an alternative embodiment, the notification may include all devices irrespective of any evaluation\/recommendation (or, with the recommended devices annotated or highlighted within the complete list). A priority order (e.g., best-to-worst option ranking) or similar function may also be provided.","In yet another embodiment, the OME  may comprise the functionality and storage capability disclosed above as being attributed to the database . illustrate other exemplary embodiments of network architectures configured according to the present invention. The network architectures in evidence various ones of the aforementioned client devices  which may be used to receive content, and the various pathways for content delivery thereto (and movement of content there between).","In the example illustrated in , one client device  is a PMD , which receives content via either a converged premises device (CPD)  or a media bridge . Other illustrated client devices include a PC , and a IP-enabled DSTB  passing content to a DVR  and\/or display device .","The CPD  of may, for example, be of the type described in co-owned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/378,129 filed Mar. 16, 2006 and entitled \u201cMETHODS AND APPARATUS FOR CENTRALIZED CONTENT AND DATA DELIVERY\u201d, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As discussed therein, the CPD  comprises a WLAN (e.g., Wi-Fi) and\/or PAN (e.g., Bluetooth or 802.15) wireless interface. Packetized (e.g., IP) traffic may be exchanged between the CPD  and one or more PMD  via, e.g. the WLAN\/PAN interface. Hence, in one embodiment, the PMD  may request content from the CPD , which in turn requests content from the BPS . The requested content may then be provided to the PMD  via the CPD  accompanied by the list of other client devices  which are recommended by the OME  for receiving the requested content. Where content is requested at a device  other than the PMD , the PMD  may appear on a list of recommended devices provided to that requesting device .","Also illustrated at , a media bridge (MB) apparatus  may be utilized to provide content to the PMD . The MB apparatus  may be, for example, of the type disclosed in co-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/480,597 filed Jun. 8, 2009 and entitled \u201cMedia Bridge Apparatus and Methods\u201d, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As discussed therein, the MB apparatus  acts as a connection between a PMD  (which may include e.g., an impo, handheld computer, smartphone, PDA, etc.) and a network. This bridging apparatus  may be used, for example, to convert content stored on the PMD  to a format capable of being presented on a user's set-top box or other client device. The bridging apparatus  may also be utilized for transmitting content to the PMD  (such as by converting the content to a format capable of being stored\/presented on the PMD ), provided the user of the PMD  is authorized to receive the content. When the PMD  requests content from the network  via the media bridge , the OME  may recommend alternative delivery platforms (e.g., other client devices ) for viewing the content. Further, the OME  may suggest a PMD  for content delivery (via the MB ) when a request for content is received from another client device .","In yet another embodiment, the client device  may comprise a personal video encoder (PVE) or comparable device (not shown). For example, the \u201cSlingbox\u201d device manufactured by Sling Media of San Mateo, Calif. is one such exemplary device which is capable of enabling a user to watch TV programming from various locations via an Internet-connected PC or similar device. The device is generally connected between the subscriber's cable\/satellite video drop and DSTB (or other device), and has a TV tuner inside. The user tunes to a given channel, and the PVE encodes the video streamed over the cable\/satellite in Windows Media or similar format. The encoded content is streamed to a client application on a Windows XP-based or similar PC via an IP network such as the Internet, and hence the user can view the data locally (i.e., at the same premises) or remotely so long as they have access to the IP distribution network. This functionality can be made part of a separate physical component, or alternatively have some or all of its functionality disposed within the PVE itself. It may also be integrated with other devices (such as connected CPE  or PMDs ). It will be appreciated that the PVE may also be configured to receive other device recommendations and may be recommended as a platform alternative for other devices as discussed above.","In the context of the exemplary architecture of , suppose for example that a user registers the PC  and the STB  (in communication with the DVR  and display device ) with the MSO billing system . The device registration is then updated to the OME , so that the OME may build a database  of user accounts and devices registered thereto (as will be discussed below with respect to ).","Suppose now that the user uses the PC  to request \u201cIP TV\u201d content (i.e., IP protocol packetized video content); this request is forwarded through the network  to the OME . As the requested content is prepared for transmission to the requesting device (i.e., PC ) via the content server , the OME  determines the subscriber account associated with the request and determines whether any other devices in the subscriber's account should be recommended as alternate delivery platforms. In the present example, the OME  will determine that the user of the PC  is also associated with the IP-enabled DSTB  (here, in communication with both a DVR  and display device ). In one embodiment, the OME  will provide the user of the PC  a message or display notification indicating that the IPTV content is available for viewing at the display device  and\/or delivery to the DVR . Alternatively, the notification may be reserved only for those instances where an evaluation of the both the PC  and the DSTB  (including display  and\/or DVR  options associated therewith) reveals that, based on the capabilities of these devices, there is some advantage in providing the content to the user on these devices , , . For example, the OME  may evaluate the PC  (e.g., based on device profiles maintained at the headend\/OME, or via profiles obtained from the device themselves upon request) and DSTB  and determine that, based on picture and sound quality available at the display device  and\/or based on the convenience associated with the DVR , it is more desirable for the user to view and\/or record the live broadcast programming content at the display device  or DVR  rather than (or simultaneous to) viewing at the PC .","Referring now to , another exemplary embodiment of network architecture useful with the present invention is given. According to this embodiment, a gateway device  is utilized to provide internet content from an internet content server  to one or more client devices  via the network . The gateway device  may be of the type disclosed in co-owned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/582,619 entitled \u201cGateway Apparatus and Methods for Digital Content Delivery in a Network\u201d filed on Oct. 20, 2009 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As discussed therein, the gateway device  is disposed at the headend  of the network  and is configured to request and receive internet content from one or more host servers  via the Internet. The internet content is then processed and delivered to one or more client devices . In one embodiment, processing at the gateway device  may include de-encapsulating the received internet content from a first media file container format and subsequently re-encapsulating the internet content to a second media file container format which is compatible with one or more receiving devices (such as client devices ). According to this embodiment, the gateway device  may process received content automatically into various alternative encapsulation formats or, may encapsulate as needed to the format of the specific requesting device ; the gateway device  may also store the requested and re-encapsulated content to satisfy future user requests. It is further appreciated that the gateway apparatus  may function to provide multiple alternative delivery paradigms for the delivery of internet content to the client devices , including delivery according to traditional broadcast mechanisms (e.g., linear delivery via downstream in-band QAM) and VOD delivery mechanisms.","As is also illustrated, a user's PC  may directly access internet content from the internet content server  via the IP network. Still further, a user may access internet content at a PMD  via a base station  in communication and connected to the internet content server  via both the IP network and a cellular service provider (CSP) network and interface.","Content delivery controlled by the server  to one or more. PMD  may occur via the methods and apparatus discussed in co-owned and co-pending U.S. patent application. Ser. No. 11\/258,229 entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus For On-Demand Content Transmission and Control Over Networks\u201d filed Oct. 24, 2005, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As discussed therein, content may be delivered on-demand to the PMD  via a \u201cpoint-to-point\u201d approach, wherein a session is established between a content receiving entity (such as a PMD ) and a distributing entity (e.g., server ). In one variant, session establishment and data flow control are advantageously implemented using protocols and bandwidth that are typically used for (i) providing on-demand services to subscribers within the cable network, and (ii) delivery and control of streaming multimedia to client mobile devices. Thus, information regarding distribution of content to various PMD  as well as other information regarding the user's activities with respect to the content (such as stopping, restarting, fast forwarding, etc.) may be collected at a server entity  of the headend , via the associated IP gateway and cellular service provider, and processed to (AMDR) messages, which are stored and\/or analyzed.","Hence any of the PMD , PC  and CPD  of may receive alternative platform notification or recommendations, and\/or be listed as recommended\/available devices. Suppose for example that a user registers each of the illustrated client devices , ,  to the user's account. This information will be stored in a database  in communication with the OME  (as will be discussed below with respect to ). When a user at the client device  requests content from the internet content server  (via a the gateway apparatus ), the OME  determines, based at least in part on a query of the user account and device database , that the user of the client device  may access the same content at the user's PC  and\/or PMD . The OME  may automatically recommend one or more of the other user devices (e.g., PC  and\/or PMD ) for delivery of the content, based on a user preference template or rule set (e.g., \u201calways recommend other available platforms between the times of 7:00 am and 9:00 pm\u201d). Alternatively, the OME  may utilize an algorithm for determining whether it would be optimal to provide the content at any of the other user devices (e.g., PC  and\/or PMD ).","It should be noted that the embodiments described herein of the premises network topology shown in are merely exemplary of the broader principles of the invention; many other network configurations and possible topologies can be utilized.","Referring now to , an exemplary user account and device database  is given. As shown, the database  contains a plurality of records , , . Each user account record  identifies a single user account (such as by name, address, and\/or account number).","The user account records  are linked to one or more client devices  which are each identified in the database  by a device identifier . In one embodiment, the device identifier  may comprise a MAC address, IP address, TUNER_ID, or other unique device identifier. The user account records  may further comprise information relating to a login and password combination used by a user to verify the user as being associated with that account. The device identification records  are updated via messages received from the billing system , or another entity (such as an MSO server used to service subscriber logins and account changes performed over the Internet). In this manner, only current devices and current subscription information is kept in the database  and used for recommending delivery platforms.","Each device  may be optionally associated with a device description file . The device description file  describes the features and capabilities of the devices  within a user's account, such as for example configuration information. This configuration information might include e.g., (i) type and version of operating system; (ii) type and version of codecs installed (e.g., H.264, MPEG, Real, WMP, etc.); (iii) memory and\/or mass storage device capacity; (iv) display type and resolution (e.g., 1080p); (v) communications interfaces\/protocols (e.g., USB, IEEE-Std. 1394, Ethernet, UPnP, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, DOCSIS, etc.); and (vi) capabilities\/function support (e.g., DRM, DNLA, DCAS). The device description file  may be derived by the OME  and\/or the billing system  based on the device identification (see below). Alternatively, the devices  themselves may be configured to provide capabilities information in the form of a description file  or message (as will be discussed further below).","In another embodiment, the network architecture described in U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/256,903 entitled \u201cMETHODS AND APPARATUS FOR PACKETIZED CONTENT DELIVERY OVER A CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK\u201d previously incorporated herein, may be utilized in conjunction with or as an alternative to the architecture discussed above with respect to . As discussed therein, a substantially session-based and packetized content delivery approach (e.g., using the well known Internet Protocol) is used, which allows for temporal, device, and location flexibility in the delivery of the content, and transportability\/migration of user sessions, as well as service\/content personalization (e.g., on a per-session\/user basis) and blending (integration). This approach uses a common or unified delivery architecture. In one exemplary implementation, the network is based on an IMS (IP Multimedia System) which includes SIP session protocols, as well as a Service Delivery Platform (SDP). The IMS\/SDP also uses a common control plane and service layer, which advantageously provide a high level of service integration. In another implementation, the network comprises both \u201cmanaged\u201d and \u201cunmanaged\u201d (or off-network) services, so that a network operator can utilize both its own and external infrastructure to provide content delivery to its subscribers in various locations and use cases. In another aspect, the invention leverages so-called \u201csuper\u201d headends (which provide a high degree of centralization of functions such as content storage, processing and back-office functions) to allow for more flexible delivery, as well as enhanced \u201cservice velocity\u201d. A substantially network-based user interface (UI) architecture is employed which permits the network operator (or a designated proxy entity) to manage and rapidly reconfigure the UI for particular premises, subscribers (or even particular devices of that subscriber\/premises), thereby greatly aiding personalization and service velocity. For example, a new service selected by a user can be reflected in that user's UI simply based on a download and installation from a network \u201cUI\u201d server, so that no service call or \u201ctruck roll\u201d is needed. Moreover, the different UIs of the network operator can be adapted to different device paradigms (e.g., premises DSTB\/HDTV monitor, PC, laptop, handheld mobile device, etc.), so that a common user and\/or account \u201ctheme\u201d and preference set is maintained across the different devices. This UI architecture can also leverage next-generation content display, organization, interactivity, and recommendation engine technologies, thereby providing for a richer and more subscriber-specific (personalized) media experience.","Methodology\u2014","Referring now to , a first embodiment of the method for monitoring and optimizing content delivery in a content delivery network is given.","Per step  of the method , content is requested by one or more CPE . The content request is received at the server entity  of the BPS  and a copy of the request is forwarded to the OME . The content request may constitute for example an on-demand request (e.g., VoD or the like), PPV request, IPTV delivery session establishment (e.g., via SIP session), request for an application download (e.g., a gaming application from a carousel or other location), accessing and requesting download from an Internet website or server location, or request for an EPG or content directory.","In one embodiment, the requested content may be immediately provided to the requesting device by the server , provided the requesting device is entitled to receive the content. For instance, information within the content request identifying the device (such as by IP address or MAC address) and\/or the subscriber account (such as by subscriber account number or other subscriber identification) may be used to determine the entitlement of the requesting device to receive the content. The methods and apparatus disclosed in co-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/536,724 filed on Aug. 6, 2009 and entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MANAGING ENTITLEMENTS TO DATA OVER A NETWORK\u201d previously incorporated herein, may be utilized to determine content access entitlements. Alternatively, the requested content may only be delivered to an entitled requesting device once the user has selected a delivery option from among the recommended options, as discussed below.","Per step , the OME  uses information contained in the content request (information identifying the device and\/or the subscriber) to determine whether the device is registered. In order to determine whether a device is registered, the OME  may compare the information received to information stored in the subscriber and device database . For example, if the request comprises information identifying the device (e.g., MAC address, IP address, TUNER_ID, or other unique device identifier) the OME  will query the database  for that device by the identifying information and the query returns a subscriber account record  if the device is registered. If the request comprises information identifying the subscriber account, the OME  may use this information to determine (based on a query of the subscriber account and associated device records ) whether content is being requested by a device listed to that subscriber account.","It will also be appreciated that in other embodiments, so-called \u201coff subscriber\u201d devices may be made accessible to the OME. For instance, in one such variant, the subscriber may specify that certain designated devices owned by third parties known to the subscriber can be considered \u201ctarget\u201d devices for purposes of upgrades and session migration. For example, an MSO subscriber might designate his girlfriend's PC or DSTB (via, e.g., its MAC or IP address) as an approved device for content delivery, since he frequently watches movies or television at her house. The subscriber's friend may or may not also be an MSO subscriber. Where both parties are MSO subscribers, their accounts may be linked so that one or the other (or both) can be designated as available devices from the perspective of the OME. In the case where the friend is not an MSO subscriber, delivery may necessitate carriage of the content \u201cover the top\u201d of another operator's network (e.g., a competing cable or satellite or HFCu service provider), such as via over the Internet, non-competitor controlled link (e.g., WiMAX transport), or via a cooperative arrangement between the network providers. The subscriber would, in one such variant, log into an MSO portal or website via a user login, password, etc. to initiate a \u201cpull\u201d of content from an extant delivery channel\/device to the friend's premises device. For example, the login may allow for a network-generated UI (akin to a website page) being generated on the friend's client device, via which the subscriber could select the content for delivery at the friend's device. Login via the Internet (e.g., via a PC) may be used as well.","It is also appreciated that various embodiments of the invention may be configured so as to distinguish specific users versus accounts. For example, a given subscriber account number may be associated with the premises of a family, yet have multiple different users (family members) associated therewith. Hence, the present invention contemplates that: (i) the account or premises may have a profile or preference set associated with it as a whole (e.g., one preference set for all family members, and a listing of all family member devices); (ii) that individual users may have their own preference sets and device listings, which may or may not overlap with other members (e.g., two different family members might list the living room DSTB\/DVR as \u201ctheir\u201d device); and (iii) combinations of (i) and (ii) (e.g., such as where each member has a separate preference set and device list, but there is a default \u201cfamily\u201d profile). Hence, content may move or be \u201cupgraded\u201d for individual users largely independent of other users within the same subscriber account under one embodiment of the invention (except e.g., where a \u201ccollision\u201d or resource contention would occur, such as where two family members are frying to move different content to the same device at the same time). As used herein, the term \u201cuser\u201d therefore can refer to one user or multiple aggregated users.","If the requesting device and\/or subscriber account identification information does not match an entry in the database, the device has not been registered. A device must be registered before content may be provided thereto. Hence, per step , the device is registered by providing information identifying the device and\/or subscriber to the OME . At step , the OME  associates the device to a subscriber account. In one embodiment, this occurs by automatically querying the billing systems via the devices MAC address to develop a default profile. In another embodiment, the device may be configured to automatically provide device identification and\/or subscriber account information to the BPS . The server maintains historical heuristic data which \u201cmines\u201d or determines device content usage patterns in order to determine a more precise custom profile against client future behavior and usage, in one embodiment. Alternatively, a user may enter some or all of the aforementioned information at a user interface (e.g., web portal run by the MSO), such as by entry of a login and password during a registration process to create a default profile. The OME  may verify the entered information at the billing system . The OME  may also request additional information at the billing system . For example, if the device only provides device identification information, the OME  may query the billing system  for the subscriber account to be associated therewith (step ). Per step , the device and associated subscriber account information are reported to and updated in the database  records , .","The OME  may also periodically request updates from the billing system  or other cognizant entity to update records in the subscriber and device database . In this manner, only the most recently updated lists of devices  are used for providing delivery platform notifications (as will be discussed below).","If the requesting device identification matches an entry in the database, the device is determined to be registered and, at step , the subscriber account and device database  is evaluated to determine whether there are additional delivery platforms (e.g., other devices  registered to the user's account) available for the provision of the requested content. To this end, the OME  may run one or more computer applications for evaluating the available devices  listed in the database as being part of the user's account. As will be discussed in greater detail below, the aforementioned computer applications running on the OME  may also be utilized to evaluate whether one or more \u201cbetter\u201d or more appropriate platforms exist, such as by taking into consideration various of the aforementioned configuration factors, available bandwidth, and\/or bandwidth requirements for each platform. Alternatively (or in conjunction), the evaluation may be based at least in part on the user (e.g., via user-specified rules or preferences).","The present invention recognizes the fact that \u201cbest\u201d or \u201cbetter\u201d may be highly account or user-specific terms, and predicated on an analysis or preference from the user which at all times may not seem rational. For example, a user may specify a preference to watch a smaller\/lower resolution monitor, or PC monitor, versus their best quality platform, simply because they enjoy the location of the smaller\/less capable monitor better, have other functions they can be performing while watching programs (e.g., it's in the garage, kitchen, laundry room, out by the pool, etc.). As previously noted, templates or rules can also be applied, such that certain preferences are only in effect in certain scenarios, under certain preconditions, at certain times of day, etc. Hence, user-based preferences or inputs (which may also include passively obtained data, such as history of user usage of certain devices, watching certain modes of delivery (e.g., VoD HD versus SD PPV, etc.) may also be used as a component in the \u201crecommendation engine\u201d of the present invention.","Moreover, QoS-based considerations can be used in the evaluation of delivery modes\/platforms according to the present invention. For instance, a given delivery channel such as IP-based MPEG-4 encoded content may be delivered over an in-band or DOCSIS QAM in a cable or satellite network, each of which carries with it inherent QoS and FEC requirements. However, the same content may also be streamed over a non-QoS channel (e.g., via the Internet, which has no such QoS\/FEC requirements, thereby potentially impacting user experience). Certain users may be amenable to non-QoS delivery in exchange for example time and\/or place utility (e.g., so they can watch it on the platform of their choice when they want to watch it).","Cost is yet another factor that may be considered in evaluation of delivery mode\/platform. For example, a user may be amenable to watching a lower-quality free version of a given content element or program versus a high-quality \u201cpay\u201d version. This may also be viewed from the network operator's perspective (e.g., the network operator may always opt to deliver the higher-quality \u201cpay\u201d version so as to increase revenue or profit, or seek to deliver the version or via the mode with the least incremental cost (e.g., that is locally cached, or does not use up bandwidth that could be applied to a higher-revenue use).","It is also noted that in certain embodiments of the invention, available alternative delivery platforms may be specified or selected based on the availability of the requested content in an encoded format that is suitable for the platform. For instance, if the content is only available in MPEG2 format, a prospective alternate client device having only an H264 decoder would not be a suitable alternative, and hence would be eliminated from consideration (despite the fact that it may satisfy other optimization goals such as providing better user experience, use less bandwidth (H.264 consumes roughly half the bandwidth of MPEG2), etc.","Accordingly, the present invention further contemplates distinguishing \u201crequired\u201d factors from \u201celective\u201d factors. Required factors might for example include suitable codec support, suitable container decoding support (e.g., MP4 container), suitable transport, suitable QoS support (if required), and so forth. Elective factors might include HD or upconversion capability, QoS support (if QoS is not required), HD audio capability, display monitor size\/resolution, \u201csurround sound\u201d, recording capability, and so forth. Hence, potential alternative devices can be effectively screened in one embodiment of the invention by first evaluating all of the required factors (for a requested content element and designated delivery mode) against the available devices, and filtering those which do not meet all requirements.","Per step , a notification is sent to the user indicating the alternative delivery platforms (e.g., other user devices  associated with the user's account), if any, and enabling the user to select individual ones of these platforms for the delivery of the requested content. The user is notified in any number of ways; for example, the notification may be transmitted only to the device  on which the user is currently receiving content or has requested content. Alternatively, the notification may be transmitted to all of the client devices  associated with the subscriber's account. The notification may intentionally list the recommended devices  according to a hierarchy based on the suitability of the device  for delivery of the requested content.","The notification in one variant comprises an interactive application which enables the user to select one or more of the given platforms for content delivery. In response to the notification, the user may select to view the content on the requesting client device , continue viewing the content on the current client device , or the user may select an alternate client device  for simultaneous or alternative content provision. In other words, the user may: (i) select to continue or to begin viewing the content on the requesting client device, (ii) may also have the content sent to one or more second client devices, or (iii) or may select to only receive the content on the second client device(s).","In another embodiment, all devices  of a given user account are presented as delivery options regardless of their desirability for providing the content. In other words, the user is able to choose, from among all the devices  associated with the user account, the devices  on which to receive the requested content. These devices can also optionally be ranked; e.g., according to the aforementioned recommendation hierarchy based on the foregoing evaluation, so as to apprise the user of which are the best choices (while also allowing them to see all options). Moreover, those that are incompatible or ineligible for delivery can be so noted (e.g., with an icon, different coloration, etc.).","Once the user's selection(s) are received (step ), the requested content may be provided to the selected platform(s) at step .","The notification may, in another embodiment, be of the type described in co-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/706,620 filed on Feb. 14, 2007 and entitled \u201cMethods and Apparatus for Content Delivery Notification and Management\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As discussed therein, the notification may offer the user one or more choices, including the choice to either cancel the request or to accept delayed delivery of the requested content on one or more of the available client devices . As also discussed therein, if content is requested by the subscriber during a time (or for a time) where the network capacity or bandwidth available for delivery of that content is limited, the notification may alert the subscriber of a potential unavailability of requested content. Similarly, the notification can be made to be dependent on the status of the \u201ctarget\u201d device(s). For instance, if the user selects a device which is \u201cavailable\u201d per the billing system, but may not be powered on or connected to the network (and hence not available to receive the data\/session associated with the content delivery), then the user of the requesting device will receive notification to this effect, and either allow them to wait or retry after a timeout period, or select another device.","The notification may further provide the subscriber with a projected delivery or availability time for the requested content (either at the requesting client device , or at another available device ). The notification may also allow the subscriber to specify a date and\/or time of delivery, such as one convenient to them at any one of the available client devices  (e.g., \u201cten minutes from now\u201d). Still further, the notification may provide the subscriber with a \u201ccontent\/device ready\u201d notification when (i) the content is actually ready for delivery; and\/or (ii) the device is ready to accept or display it. The notification may also automatically program or operate the requesting client device  or other available client device  based on projected or actual delivery information.","Suppose for example, User A registers a PC, a mobile device, a digital set top box (DSTB), and a DVR to the user's account. This information is stored at the database , and when User A requests broadcast content on his\/her PC (step ), the OME  uses the database  to determine that the same content may also be viewed by User A on the other registered devices. The OME  evaluates the other features and capabilities of the other registered devices  (step ). Suppose that the evaluation results in the OME  determining that the requested broadcast content is better delivered to User A on either his DSTB or recorded on his DVR. Thus, the OME  generates and transmits a message to User A informing the user of the \u201cbetter\u201d delivery options (step ). User A may then select to receive the content as requested (e.g., at the requesting PC) or may select delivery at one or more of the recommended devices (step ). For example, User A\u2032s selection may result in the requested content being simultaneously or alternatively recorded at User A\u2032s registered DVR, and\/or may result in a forced \u201cchannel\u201d change of User A\u2032s registered DSTB (e.g., to a QAM or packet streaming session).","The present invention may be further configured to provide selection of a delivery platform without user intervention (e.g. automatically). For example, the evaluation may give a clearly \u201cbest\u201d device  for delivery, the delivery may be effected to that device, and the notification merely indicates to the user that the content will be delivered to the \u201cbest\u201d device. This can also be subject to user confirmation (e.g., \u201cOK to switch?\u201d), and\/or user-based preferences or rules sets (e.g., \u201cnever switch from 1080p plasma display to PC\u201d).","In another example, a master scheduler may be used. The master scheduler may enable the user to select one or more of the CPE  associated with the user's subscriber account for delivery of the requested content. The master scheduler, in one instance, may deny programming to client based on profiles, during certain periods, based on the programming content itself, etc. For example, adult programming may be denied when it is known that the client device is associated to a minor and\/or during certain periods. In another instance, the master scheduler can initiate a push of content to certain devices that have storage capabilities. The content push may be based on the content itself, the time of viewing, etc. In another instance, the master schedule is configured to move content from devices around the networks based on specific criteria, local storage maximization, device usage, and\/or period usage. For example, the master schedule may assist a user in moving requested content to their vacation home during a vacation, or routing phone calls.","It will also be appreciated that the logic of the method of may be modified such that it is event-driven; e.g., the powering-up, network access negotiation, and\/or logging on of a user device\/user may trigger one or more of the foregoing processes. For instance, in one such variant, the startup of a device and establishment of communication with the content delivery network (e.g., via an upstream \u201cstartup\u201d message or request for network address, etc.) is used to trigger the OME to evaluate the newly initiated device relative to the extant delivery platform. If the newly initiated device is ranked higher or more optimized for delivery of the content, then a notification will be generated and sent to the user on the current recipient device, apprising them of the prospective \u201cupgrade\u201d.","Alternatively, a complete evaluation (such as that described in , where all associated devices within the subscriber\/user account are evaluated) may be performed.","Referring now to , a second embodiment of the method for monitoring and optimizing content delivery in a content delivery network is given.","As shown in , the method  is generally instituted periodically or anecdotally (e.g., upon the occurrence of a prescribed event or sequence of events). In one variant, the OME  periodically queries or obtains status on the devices connected to and operable at the premises, and updates an \u201cavailability\u201d list based on this status information. For instance, where a PMD is not wirelessly coupled (via e.g., Wi-Fi) to a premises CPD or network, it is considered \u201cinaccessible\u201d even though it may be actively in use. Similarly, if a DSTB does not display a \u201cheartbeat\u201d, or is powered off, it may be considered unavailable. Likewise, the failure to generate an appropriate voltage or signal on a pin of a DisplayPort, IEEE-Std. 1394, RJ-45\/LAN, or USB interface may indicate a lack of connection.","To this end, a distributed application (DA) with a \u201cserver\u201d portion and \u201cclient\u201d portion can be utilized. For example, the client portion may be disposed on a network gateway or CPD at the premises, and run so as to periodically poll or determine status of the various registered devices on the premises network. This information is used by the client portion to either (i) generate notifications or recommendations locally at the premises; or (ii) generate a message or signaling upstream to the OME server portion, so that the latter can generate notifications or recommendations.","At step  of the method , the OME (or its proxy) selects a first device (\u201cn\u201d) from a listing of available devices for that premises. This listing may be obtained locally (e.g., at the premises itself, such as one stored on a gateway, CPD, PC, or other device), or via the aforementioned subscriber database.","At step , the status of the selected device as a current delivery platform is determined. For instance, in one variant, the OME  determines whether content is actively being delivered to that device from the network (e.g., via in-band QAM, IP session, WiMAX transport, etc.). The control and protocol translation server may, in one embodiment be configured to store information relating to what the content currently being sent to any subscriber premises and\/or devices associated therewith. The server generates this information based on its role in receiving all of the content request messaging, whether on or off the network, as programmed in the client device or software. The server may then use this information to manage the device states.","In another variant, each of the user's devices can be equipped with a client portion or application which allows the user to \u201cpull\u201d content delivery to that platform.","As previously noted, devices outside the user's premises may also be included within a device listing associated with a given account. For example if User A frequently visits their neighbors down the street (who are not MSO subscribers) and watches movies there, such as every Saturday night, they could add the MAC address or other identifying data associated with their neighbor's CPE (e.g., DSTB) to their account profile. When they arrive at their neighbor's house, the subscriber could log in (i.e., user-based login\/password\/security challenge, etc.) via their neighbor's IP-enabled CPE, and then request content from that CPE (e.g., via an IP-based delivery transport such as the Internet, which may even include for example a DOCSIS delivery over another MSG's network).","If the neighbors are also MSO subscribers, but perhaps may not have the same privileges or features (e.g., HBO subscription) at their house, the same logic may be applied, yet delivery of the HBO content may occur, yet via in-band QAM, WiMAX transport, or other MSO-operated delivery infrastructure.","These delivery use cases illustrate the \u201cTV anywhere\u201d concept afforded to MSO subscribers under one embodiment of the present invention.","If the selected device is currently being used to receive content from the network (step ), this device is marked as \u201ccurrent\u201d, and the next device in the listing selected per step . If not, then the selected device is evaluated by the OME to determine its capabilities per step . The evaluation may be as simple as determining whether the selected device is capable of receiving the requested content (e.g., it may be rendered at a resolution incompatible with the selected device, may be encoded using an incompatible codec or container format, may require more delivery bandwidth than the transport can sustain, may not meet QoS requirements, etc.). However, more sophisticated evaluations may also be conducted (e.g., to characterize the device in various different aspects).","At step , it is determined whether the selected device that was evaluated at step  was the last device on the listing (i.e., whether all devices associated with the premises or account have been evaluated). If so, then the results of the evaluations, and any templates or user-specified rules sets, are processed by the OME  to determine a recommendation\/hierarchy per step . If not, the additional remaining devices in the listing are processed as above.","In another embodiment of the invention, a user-assigned heuristic regarding the desirability of each device in their listing can be used as the basis of ranking or selection. For instance, a user is on one variant presented with a GUI listing the several devices available at the premises (e.g., HDTV monitor (54 inch), HDTV monitor (32 inch), PC, laptop, and smartphone). The user may specify that it is always most desirable to prioritize the 32-inch monitor, since that is where the user watches most of his\/her programs (even though the 54-inch may give a better \u201cuser experience\u201d in terms of video and audio quality). However, when the user is not at their premises, the primary desired mode of delivery might be listed as the laptop computer (followed by the smartphone).","Audio aspects can also be considered as part of the evaluation\/ranking. For instance, in the context of the foregoing example, one of the HDTV monitors may also include \u201csurround sound\u201d or similar, which greatly enhances the audio aspects of the content presentation. These may be combined with (e.g., according to a weighting function) video aspects of \u201cuser experience\u201d as part of the evaluation process.","Session Transfer\u2014","Referring now to , one embodiment of a generalized method for managing and transferring content delivery sessions is disclosed. As noted elsewhere herein, one operational scenario in which the present invention may be employed comprises a user having content delivered to a first client device (e.g., DSTB), and then wanting to transfer that content \u201cmid stream\u201d (and in some cases without significant loss or discontinuity) to another client device, such as pursuant to a notification\/recommendation from the OME. One approach for effecting this transfer would be to simply have the user power-on the target (transferee) device, and then tune or switch that device to the appropriate delivery channel, and then subsequently switch off the transferor (original) device. However, this approach is far from elegant, and does not optimize user experience in that the foregoing switch may take time and result in loss of content (especially where the content being delivered is linear or broadcast).","Accordingly, the improved methods and apparatus of the present invention seek to provide a substantially seamless mechanism for such transfers. In one embodiment, an extant session (e.g., SIP session between a content delivery server and the first client device (transferor)) is maintained and modified to add the transferee device, with subsequent removal of the transferor device from the session. As described elsewhere herein, \u201cstate\u201d information may optionally be utilized consistent with this approach in order to allow for transfer without significant discontinuity, even where the transferee device is not yet powered up or available.","As shown in , the first step of the method  comprises establishing a communication session between a content source and a first recipient device (transferor) using a session-based protocol adapted for use on a packet-switched network, e.g., SIP (step ). Content is then transferred to the first recipient device within the session, such as via an RTP stream per step . Next, a communication session is established between said content source and a second recipient device (e.g., transferee) per step , and delivery of the content to the second recipient device is commenced per step . This may be pursuant for example to a notification\/recommendation generated by the OME as described elsewhere herein; e.g., that the transferee device is somehow \u201cbetter\u201d or more optimal for delivery of content at that point in time.","Delivery of content to the first device may then be ceased as desired (step ).","It is noted that in step , the session established between the content source and the second recipient device may be the same or a different session than that established in step  with the first device; e.g., a SIP session can advantageously have multiple participants within the same \u201csession\u201d (e.g., via conferencing), and hence deliver a given content stream to multiple endpoints, although such use of a unified session is by no means a requirement of the invention.","For instance, in one implementation of the method , the content source comprises an IP TV (Internet Protocol television) server disposed within a content delivery network (e.g., a satellite or Hybrid Fiber coaxial (HFC) cable television network, and the packetized content is delivered according to a unicast session via one or more DOCSIS or other QAM channels). In one embodiment, live content is also delivered via a multicast delivery system. If the consuming device capabilities do not align, more than one multicast may be initiated. In some instances, this has the desired effect of improving the efficiency of the delivery mechanism when more than one customer requests a stream in the same service group, and entails little penalty in terms of bandwidth even when only one device is consuming the stream.","The aforementioned method may also be performed automatically (i.e., without substantial user intervention) if desired. For instance, once a notification of a prospective \u201cupgrade\u201d is sent to the user, if the user opts to accept the upgrade, the foregoing transfer can be automatically invoked without further user action.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0195","num":"0194"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"]},"Moreover, various techniques can be invoked and used within the foregoing methods so as to avoid loss of \u201cstate\u201d of the delivered content. For example, where the content delivery mechanism within the first session is non-linear (e.g., VoD, nPVR, or similar), a simple command or signal to the content delivery server to pause the stream can be used, thereby preventing any loss of content from the user's perspective. In cases of linear content delivery (e.g., live broadcast), a network- or premises-based recording function can be invoked, such as where a network DVR or premises DVR function is messaged to start recording the stream from a prescribed timing coordinate, packet ID, or cue until the second session is established or the user affirmatively allows content delivery via the second session (e.g., selects an \u201cOK\u201d function on the second device, thereby allowing for continued content delivery).","In yet another implementation, the linear packet stream can simply be buffered (e.g., at the server, such as in a FIFO buffer sized appropriately for a suitable transition time), and the buffer contents read out when the second session has been established and the user has OK'd further delivery.","It is appreciated that the foregoing functionality may be implemented according to any number of different network architectures. For example the well known IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) associated with 3GPP and other relevant standards can be used as a basis for the foregoing SIP sessions and functions. IMS is particularly designed with a common control plane architecture which advantageously facilitates \u201cblending\u201d of control functions of services and applications, such as is described in U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/256,903 entitled \u201cMETHODS AND APPARATUS FOR PACKETIZED CONTENT DELIVERY OVER A CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK, previously incorporated herein. This technology is particularly useful in cross-network (e.g., off-net to on-net, and vice versa) transfers of sessions such as those contemplated by the present invention, since the common control plane architecture allows for handover of the session across network boundaries. For example, in one such scenario, a user may wish to transfer an extant \u201cbroadcast\u201d session delivered over say a cable or satellite or HFCu network to a cellular, WiMAX, or FLO (Forward Link Only)-enabled handset or mobile device, such as when the user is leaving their premises but wishes to keep watching a given program. By instantiating delivery of the broadcast\/linear over say a SIP session to the premises device, and then transferring the session to the handset (and hence delivering the packetized media stream over the IMS infrastructure off-net), the user can experience a seamless handoff to the handset, which will then receive the packet stream via the designated wireless infrastructure (e.g., UMTS\/3G, WiMAX, FLO, etc.), yet which is still originated from the MSO network sources. In this fashion, MSO-derived content (which may come from off-net sources itself, such as the Internet) can be delivered to MSO subscribers both on-net and off-net, and switching back and forth is easily accomplished.","Optimization and Monitoring Entity\u2014","Referring to ; an exemplary embodiment of the OME apparatus  is illustrated. As shown, the OME  generally comprises a network interface , a processor  having associated storage , and a plurality of back end interfaces . Other components which may be utilized within the OME  include amplifiers, board level electronic components, as well as media processors and other specialized SoC or ASIC devices (not shown). Support for various processing layers and protocols (e.g., 802.3, DOCSIS MAC, OOB channels, DHCP, SNMP, H.323\/RTP\/RTCP, VoIP, SIP, etc.) may also be provided as required, such as in support of data and \u201crules\u201d interchange between the OME  and the client devices .","The network interface  enables direct or indirect communication between the OME  and various entities of the network , such as e.g., the client devices . It is noted that the network interface  may comprise a plurality of interfaces for use with other network apparatus such as RF combiners, IP routers and other packet network devices, network management and provisioning systems, local PCs, etc. The interface  may be e.g., an IEEE-1394 interface, a USB interface, a LAN interface, an ASI\/GBE interface, wireless (e.g., WiMAX) etc.","The back end interfaces  comprise a plurality of interfaces (e.g., IEEE-1394, USB, LAN\/WAN, Wireless, etc.) which facilitate communication between the OME  and other network devices, such as those in the BPS  (e.g., the server  and database ). The back end interfaces  may also facilitate communication with other devices (not shown) in the BPS  or elsewhere in the network  as needed, such as other management processes.","The processor  is configured to run a monitoring application , an evaluation application  and a notification application  thereon. In the illustrated embodiment, each of these applications , ,  work in conjunction with one another and with the BPS  entities to determine, evaluate, and provide notification of one or more alternative content delivery platforms, each of the applications , ,  will be described in turn herein below.","The monitoring application  running on the OME  monitors the devices  receiving content by communicating with the server  to receive copies of content requests which were sent to the server  from the client devices . In other words, as a client device  requests content from the server , the request is copied and forwarded to the OME . Other schemes may be used as well, however, such as where the content requests are routed through the OME first and forwarded to the server, delivered in parallel, or one entity signals the other without copying or forwarding the request (which may include extraction of relevant information, and creation of a separate message in the appropriate format for inter-process communication between the entities).","The monitoring application  uses information in the content requests to identify the client device  requesting content and to identify the subscriber account associated with the client device . For example, the content requests may contain a unique device identifier (such as e.g., IP address, MAC address, digital signature (e.g., hash or residue, etc.); the content requests may further contain information identifying a subscriber account (such as e.g., subscriber account number, subscriber address, login and password combination, secret image or challenge question information, etc.).","In the event that only the device  identification is provided in the content request, the monitoring application  will determine the subscriber account with which the device  is associated (if any). In one embodiment, the monitoring application  will do so by querying the device description records  stored at the database  to find a subscriber account association (e.g., to find the subscriber account record  linked thereto). In another embodiment, the monitoring application  may query the billing system  to find an association of the given device  to a particular subscriber account.","Once the monitoring application  identifies the device  and its associated subscriber account, the application passes this information to either the notification application , or the evaluation application , or both. If the information is passed directly to the notification application , the application  simply generates notices to the subscriber indicating all of the devices  which are available. If the information is passed to the evaluation application , the application  determines whether any of the available devices  is a \u201cbetter\u201d or more appropriate platform for the delivery of the requested content, and makes a recommendation. The recommendation is then forwarded to the notification application  so that a notice may be sent to the user reflecting the information generated by the evaluation application  (e.g., a hierarchical ranking of options, deletion of those not meeting a specified criterion or level of service \u201cquality\u201d, etc.).","The evaluation application  running on the processor  of the OME  comprises one or more computer programs adapted to evaluate content delivery modes\/platforms, once it is determined one or more client devices  are available for delivery of the requested content (e.g., are registered to the same account as the requesting device ) As previously discussed, the application  may also include a \u201crecommendation engine\u201d which recommends one or more for alternative and\/or additional delivery of the requested content. In other words, in the exemplary embodiment, the monitoring application  determines all of the devices  in the subscriber's account, and forwards this information to the evaluation application . The evaluation application  evaluates each of the available devices based on one or more criteria, and provides a list or other means of indicating one or more delivery platforms which are deemed to be appropriate for the delivery of the requested content (or more appropriate than the requesting device ). It is noted, however, that in alternate embodiments, the monitoring application  may pre-process or filter the list of \u201cavailable\u201d devices before sending this information to the evaluation application, such as where the monitoring application determines the state of each device associated with a user (or account), and filters them based on lack of accessibility. Devices may also be arranged by the monitoring application by tier or classification; e.g., currently powered-on versus powered-down devices, HD-capable versus non-HD capable devices, fixed versus mobile devices, etc. This may be accomplished based on configuration information contained within the subscriber\/device database, via a query to each device (or monitoring some aspect of device operation, such as a periodic heartbeat), query to the user for device status, or any combination of the foregoing, as described in greater detail subsequently herein.","As noted above, the appropriateness of a content delivery device  may be determined based on one or more of a variety of criteria, including without limitation: (i) device availability\/current status; (ii) capabilities (e.g., hardware\/software configuration); (iii) cost implications to the user; (iv) cost\/revenue implications to the network operator; (iv) picture\/audio quality and \u201cuser experience\u201d; (v) network parameters\/limitations (e.g., bandwidth, need to instantiate a new session or QAM for delivery, etc.); and\/or (vi) user preferences and\/or \u201ctemplates\u201d provided by the user. For example, the evaluation application  may be configured to evaluate each of the devices based on bandwidth requirements\/availability. In one embodiment, the apparatus and methods disclosed in co-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/243,720 filed on Oct. 4, 2005 and entitled \u201cSelf-Monitoring and Optimizing Network Apparatus and Methods\u201d, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, may be used by the evaluation application  to recommend devices  for optimized content delivery. As discussed therein, the evaluation application  may employ a substantially automated and anticipatory mechanism whereby a content delivery network, such as a broadcast switched architecture (BSA) network, can effectively \u201cself-monitor\u201d and optimize its bandwidth allocation based on, inter alia, data received from the receivers (e.g., DSTBs) within its service area, or from the network as a whole. The evaluation application  analyzes information gathered from the devices  (as well as optionally other information relating to, e.g., the network itself or other historical periods) to determine the expected statistical variations of the system as a function of time and various events (e.g., holidays), and the expected statistical viewing behavior of known future details of the offered content, in effect allowing it to predict subscriber behavior and make adjustments to the operational parameters of the network based on these predictions.","As another example, the methods and apparatus of co-owned co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/881,034 filed on Jul. 24, 2007 and entitled \u201cMethods and Apparatus for Format Selection for Network Optimization\u201d, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, may be utilized to determine which devices of a subscriber's available devices would be best suited for providing optimized content delivery. Accordingly, the evaluation application  may be configured to evaluate and recommend devices  for content delivery which minimize bandwidth consumption while also maximizing subscriber satisfaction and service level (e.g., video and\/or audio quality).","The evaluation application  may also take into account what is known about the devices  (e.g., HD capabilities, MPEG2 or MPEG4 decoding capabilities, etc.) to determine which devices should be recommended (or how the multiple devices should be ranked). For example, if it is known that a group of user devices  in a service area are HD-capable, then the evaluation application  may recommend a user utilize the ones of the user's devices  which are HD capable, thus enabling these devices  to tune to any available HD versions of programs to reduce the instances of duplicate programming, and to satisfy SD programming requests using HD programming. Conversely, in times of constrained bandwidth, the evaluation application  may recommend only SD capable devices (and\/or not recommend HD devices)  so that an SD version of a program (or a lower bitrate stream of the HD program) may be delivered, including during instances where an HD program is requested. The evaluation application  may further take into account whether particular ones of the user's available devices  have up-conversion capability, in which the user may still advantageously experience substantially \u201cHD-quality\u201d video, even though the device  input has been switched to SD, and may recommend these devices in instances of constrained bandwidth.","The evaluation application  may also evaluate the devices  identified by the monitoring application  as being within the subscriber's account, and make recommendations based at least in part on what is known about the user. For example, the evaluation application  may be configured to record information regarding the viewing habits of the subscriber with respect to the one or more devices  held within the subscriber's account, and utilize this information to recommend (based on the type of content requested and\/or the requesting device ), other platforms for delivery of the content, and\/or other content for delivery on the requesting device .","Suppose for example, that previous (historical) viewing patterns for User A indicate that User A enjoys viewing broadcast or \u201clinear\u201d content the vast majority of the time on his in-home DSTB. Accordingly, when a request is received from User A from a mobile device for broadcast content, the evaluation application  may utilize the historical information to determine that it is possible that User A would prefer to view the content on his DSTB (or record the content on his premises DVR for later viewing), and may therefore recommend this device to User A. In addition, the evaluation application  may, based on the aforementioned viewing patterns, recommend content similar to the content being requested (and which is in a compatible format) for viewing by User A on the mobile device.","The aforementioned historical data collection and storage may be provided using e.g., the methods and apparatus disclosed in co-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/243,720 filed on Oct. 4, 2005 and entitled \u201cSelf-Monitoring and Optimizing Network Apparatus and Methods\u201d, previously incorporated herein.","The aforementioned embodiment of the evaluation application , wherein it recommends alternative delivery platforms (e.g., alternate devices  associated with the user's account) based at least in part on the capabilities of the various devices  available to the user, may be configured to obtain the device capabilities via a variety of mechanisms. For instance, a device profile defining the various features and capabilities (including content decoding capabilities, security features, etc.) of the devices  may be transmitted to the network (e.g., the billing system , the OME , or a storage entity in communication with either located at the BPS  or elsewhere at the headend ) from each client device . These device profiles may be part of a content request (e.g. as part of a message payload, metadata, etc.), or sent as a separate communication, and may be of a standardized format as well, thereby facilitating ingestion into the network. These profiles may be periodically or anecdotally updated as well, such as via a \u201cpush\u201d from the CPE to the network (e.g., upon startup), or a \u201cpull\u201d from the network (e.g., a request sent from the OME or other network entity to the CPE when an update is required). In one embodiment, the methods and apparatus disclosed in co-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/904,408 filed on Sep. 26, 2007 and entitled \u201cMethods and Apparatus for Device Capabilities Discovery and Utilization Within a Content delivery Network\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, are used. This disclosure describes inter alia apparatus and methods for determining and selecting digital coding and\/or decoding technology, delivery bitrates, and resolution parameters for programming and data delivery over, e.g., a content delivery network. Hardware and software functions\/modules of the different devices  on the network contain various capabilities and options, including conditional access capabilities, video coding or compression capabilities, encryption schema, and network interfaces. These are transmitted to a headend entity (e.g., the OME ) in the form of a capabilities profile for analysis. The headend entity determines the one or more capabilities possessed by client devices , and evaluates one or more program or content choices for possible delivery to each of the devices  based on its profile. In the context of the present invention, the evaluation application  may evaluate the device capabilities discussed above when making device rankings or recommendations. The evaluation application  may further take into consideration network and\/or device operational considerations, such as conservation of downstream bandwidth, device uprating capability, client device power consumption, and the like according to this embodiment, as discussed elsewhere herein.","In another embodiment, the client device  capabilities may be derived exclusively from the OME , billing system , or other headend entity. For example, when a user registers a device  to the billing system  (and information regarding the device  is stored at the subscriber device database ), the billing system  and\/or OME  may utilize information identifying the device (such as the IP address, MAC address, etc.) to generate a device description record  (as shown in ) which is associated to the particular device description record  in the database . In other words, the OME  and\/or billing system  (or other entity) at the time a device  is registered may generate capabilities information regarding the device (based on information obtained during registration) in order to generate a device description record .","The evaluation application , in another embodiment, may utilize the MAC address associated with the requesting devices  and received by the OME  as a part of a content request to determine recommendations. The OME , upon receiving the MAC address, may identify a portion of the address (such as e.g., the organizationally unique identifier or OUT) as indicative of the type of device requesting access to content. The OME  may utilize this information to determine the precise one of a subscriber's devices which is requesting content, and recommend an alternative delivery platform based thereon (e.g., based on another device with similar capabilities\/configuration profile). For example, suppose the OUI of the MAC address of the requesting device indicates that the device is manufactured by Scientific Atlanta, and also that a subscriber has registered a Dell PC, a Motorola MR-DVR, an Apple laptop computer, and a Scientific Atlanta STB within their MSO account. The OME  is configured to deduce that the requesting device is the STB based on the MAC address OUI (indicating Scientific Atlanta). The evaluation application  may then determine whether to recommend either of the other devices in the subscriber's accounts as indicated above, such as based on comparable capabilities (e.g., the Motorola MR-DVR may be comparable in capabilities or configuration as far as content delivery is concerned, and hence may be a viable candidate). In this regard, the MAC address may also feasibly be used to determine device configuration. For example, part of the MAC address or range of values may correspond to a known device type or family from the manufacturer associated with the OUI (i.e., the OUI indicates a Scientific Atlanta STB, and a second portion of the MAC indicates a 3250-family device). The evaluation application  can then pull a pre-stored template (or obtain one from a third party, such as Scientific Atlanta) indicating generally the capabilities of the requesting device. The evaluation application  can then determine if any of the other devices in the subscriber's account have similar or sufficient capabilities with respect to one or more predetermined attributes.","The recommendations made by the evaluation application  are in one embodiment provided to users via notices generated by the notification application .","The notification application  running on the OME  generates and provides notifications to the client devices  indicating which, if any, of the user's other devices  may receive the content alternatively (or in addition) to the content being received at the requesting device . The notification application  receives information from the monitor application  and\/or the evaluation application  indicating one or more devices in a subscriber's network which are capable of displaying the requested content (or which represent an improvement or \u201cupgrade\u201d). The notification application  compiles this information into one or more notices. The notices may be delivered only to the requesting device , to only active or communicate devices within the user's account, or all of the devices  which are identified as being a member of the requesting user's account (whether currently active or not).","The notifications generated by the notification application  are, in one embodiment, interactive in nature. For example, the notifications may be adapted to enable the user to select one or more of the presented content delivery platforms. Suppose for example, that the notification application  generates a notification listing the user's requesting device , as well as a DVR  and STB  as other devices in the user's network. The user may then select to continue (or begin) viewing the requested content on the requesting device , as well as optionally select to have the content delivered to either or both the DVR  and STB  (or one of those devices, and not the requesting device ).","As indicated above, the notification may, in one embodiment, be of the type described in co-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/706,620 entitled \u201cMethods and Apparatus for Content Delivery Notification and Management\u201d previously incorporated herein. As discussed therein, the notification application  may generate notifications which enable users one or more choices, such as, choosing the delivery platform, scheduling delayed delivery, canceling a request, etc. Further, the notification application  may work in conjunction with the monitoring application  to determine whether the network has capacity or bandwidth available to service the request at each of the user's devices, and may generate notifications which alert the subscriber of a potential unavailability of requested content on various ones of these devices .","The notifications generated by the notification application  may further provide a projected delivery or availability time for the requested content (either at the requesting client device , or at another available device).","It is further appreciated that a master scheduler application (not shown) may also be run on the processor  of the OME . The master scheduler application enables the user to select one or more of the CPE  associated with the user's subscriber account for delivery of the requested content, and schedule delivery of content thereto (as discussed above). In one embodiment, the master scheduler functionality is included within the aforementioned notification application , which is configured to receive and process delivery scheduling commands or input, thereby enabling a user to enter a specific date and\/or time for delivery of content for individual ones of the available client devices . For example, the user may be able to specify delivery of certain content to their DSTB\/HDTV in the living room from 8:00 pm to 11:00 pm, and then at their second receiver\/smaller monitor in the bedroom from 11:00 pm through 8:00 am. As described elsewhere herein, an extant content delivery session may also be moved seamlessly between the two environments, such as by e.g., adding the second device to an existing IP unicast or multicast, and then removing the first device at the prescribed time (e.g., via SIP multi-party \u201cconferencing\u201d or similar protocols).","State Information\u2014","In one embodiment, a network entity (e.g., a REST search\/recommendation entity such as that described in U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/256,903 entitled \u201cMETHODS AND APPARATUS FOR PACKETIZED CONTENT DELIVERY OVER A CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK, previously incorporated herein) may be utilized to provide state transfer capabilities between devices. As used herein, the term \u201cstate\u201d refers without limitation to the status, temporal, or other context associated with one or more content elements. For example, the aforementioned exemplary REST search\/recommendation entity enables a user to \u201cbook mark\u201d content at a first device, and have the content moved to a different place in the premises and\/or a different device. In other words, the state of the content at the first device is identified and transferred (as metadata) along with the content, to a second device. The second device may then begin playback of the content according to the state identified in the metadata. Other states may be transferred as well including e.g., a pause, StartOver, etc. function. The state transfer capabilities may be automatic (such as upon teardown) and\/or subject to user request. The above-disclosed state transfer capabilities may be affected via a uniform user interface (present on each of the devices) and enable content state transfer across multiple, different platforms.","In one embodiment, the general state transfer concepts are of the type discussed in co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,486,869 issued Feb. 3, 2009 and entitled \u201cSystem And Method For Controlling A Digital Video Recorder On A Cable Network\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As discussed therein, signaling associated with the answering or initiation of a digital telephone call by a digital telephone subscriber is used to issue commands to a digital video recorder (DVR). For example, a signal is generated by a first device at a first event (such as e.g., a signal is generated when a telephone is enters an \u201coff-hook\u201d state), the signal is sent to a second device indicating the event (such as e.g., a DVR). In response to receiving the signal, the second device takes some action with respect to content (e.g., pausing or initiating a recording of the content at the DVR). A second signal received from the first device may, in one embodiment, be generated on the happening of a second event, transferred to the second device and cause a second response at the second device. The aforementioned state messages may be sent over an out-of-band channel\/path between the devices.","In another embodiment, the aforementioned state transfer capabilities may be utilized to provide state transfer operations between legacy devices and IP capable devices by e.g., utilizing a VOD mechanism to move a state message there between. Various other approaches may be used as well consistent with the present information.","Client Device Implementations\u2014","Referring now to , an exemplary implementation of a client device  is given. The exemplary client device  includes a network interface , a processor  and associated storage , and a plurality of back end interfaces  for communication with other devices. As discussed above with respect to and -, the client devices  may comprise any number of device types including, for example, CPE  (such as DSTB, MB, CPD, etc.), PVR, DVR, network DVR, computer devices (such as PC and laptop computers), and mobile devices (including PMD and mobile telephones). The device  of  is intended to represent the features of each of the aforementioned devices generally, and any design or configuration changes between the various types of devices will be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill given the present disclosure.","The illustrated client device  can assume literally any discrete form factor, including those adapted for desktop, floor-standing, or wall-mounted use, or alternatively may be integrated in whole or part (e.g., on a common functional basis) with other devices if desired.","It will also be recognized that the device configuration shown is essentially for illustrative purposes, and various other configurations of the client devices  are consistent with other embodiments of the invention. For example, the device  in  may not include all of the elements shown, and\/or may include additional elements and interfaces such as for example an interface for the HomePlug A\/V standard which transmits digital data over power lines, a PAN (e.g., 802.15), Bluetooth, or other short-range wireless interface for localized data communication, etc.","The network interface  of the illustrated client device  receives content and\/or data from the content distribution network (e.g., HFC, HFCu, satellite, etc. network ). In one embodiment, the network interface  may comprise a traditional video RF front end (e.g., tuner) adapted to receive video signals over, e.g., one or more QAMs. For example, the RF front end may comprise one or more tuners, a demodulator, decryption module, and demultiplexer of the type well known in the art, although other configurations may be used. A wideband tuner arrangement such as that described in co-owned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/013,671 entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Wideband Distribution of Content\u201d filed Dec. 15, 2004 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, may also be utilized, such as where the content associated with one or more program streams is distributed across two or more QAMs. The network interface  may, alternatively comprise any number of a mechanisms for the receipt of content and\/or data.","Additionally, the network interface  modulates, encrypts\/multiplexes as required, and transmits digital information for receipt by upstream entities such as the CMTS or a network server. Programming data may also be stored on the device storage unit  (discussed below) for later distribution by way of the video interface, or using a Wi-Fi interface, Ethernet interface, FireWire (IEEE Std 1394), USB\/USB2, or any number of other such options.","The network interface  may further comprise a cable modem (CM) of the type known in the art. In this fashion, and content or data normally streamed over the CM can be received and distributed by the client device , such as for example packetized video (e.g., IPTV) or broadband Internet data.","Programming and other types of data including pictures, video, music or MP3 files, software applications, metadata files, etc. may also be received by way of the various digital interfaces in the client device . These data may be stored locally (e.g., in the storage unit ) or even on a device or network agent in communication with the client device , for later use by a user as is discussed in co-owned co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/378,129 filed Mar. 16, 2006 and entitled \u201cMETHODS AND APPARATUS FOR CENTRALIZED CONTENT AND DATA DELIVERY\u201d, previously incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As discussed therein, a user may receive a video, JPEG, etc. MP3 file, from a friend's smartphone or PMD, which can then be \u201cpushed\u201d to a corresponding interface on the client device , wherein the data is stored on the mass storage device . Similarly, video data from a connected DVD player\/burner might be streamed from the player to the device  for storage thereon (or distribution via yet another interface, such as via the Ethernet interface to another client device ).","The mass storage device  of the illustrated embodiment comprises a Serial-ATA (SATA) or Ultra-ATA (also known as Ultra-DMA, or ATA-4\/5\/6\/7) hard disk drive for the operating system and content storage of at least 300 GB, although higher capacities and even RAID arrays may be used for this purpose.","A registration application  (located in the storage unit  or program memory) is run on the processor  of the client device . The registration application  is utilized by the client device  to provide information regarding the device and the subscriber to the OME  and\/or billing system . In one embodiment, the device  identifier (e.g., MAC address) is manually entered by a technician or other MSO personnel. For example, the user may, via telephone, email, text message, etc. give an operator a MAC address to be added to his\/her account. Alternatively, a technician may connect the device  to the user's premises and facilitate its addition to the user's account (e.g., via a service call) using the registration application . In another embodiment, when a user plugs a client device  into an existing home or premises network, a series of communications automatically occur between the added device  and one or more headend  entities (such as the OME  and\/or billing system ) resulting in the registration of the device  to the user's account without requiring a substantial user, operator and\/or technician action or intervention.","The client device  is further configured to run a client application  thereon (which may be integrated with the aforementioned registration application, or other applications of the CPE if desired). The client application  enables the device  to receive and display notifications from the notification application , and also enables the user of the device to interact with the notifications. The client application  may be further configured to analyze the client device  capabilities, and report these to the OME  for storage in the database  as device description records , as described elsewhere herein.","In another implementation (not shown), content and\/or data may be distributed to the client devices  via Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) transport; see IEEE Std. 802.16e-2005 entitled \u201cIEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks\u2014Part 16: Air Interface for Fixed and Mobile\u2014Broadband Wireless Access Systems Amendment 2: Physical and Medium Access Control Layers for Combined Fixed and Mobile Operation in Licensed Bands\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example, multiple WiMAX base stations may be established by the MSO or other content provider. One or more of the WiMAX stations transmit programming or other content and\/or data to the client devices  (which may include simultaneously, so as to ensure a robust signal is received and to potentially support any QoS requirements). In one embodiment, a client device  may transmit registration information out-of-band data via WiMAX transport. In this fashion, the WiMAX transport acts as a wireless data \u201cpipe\u201d in parallel to the normal DOCSIS or in-band RF channels (e.g., QAMs) transmitted over the cable or satellite distribution network.","In the context of the present invention for example, the client device  might transmit content requests via the cable network to the server  (which are subsequently passed to the OME ), yet receive requested content (at the requesting device and\/or at a second device) via the WIMAX broadband interface. Alternatively, the WiMAX interface could be used to transmit the requests to the server  (via a WiMAX interface associated with the latter), with delivery of the requested content being via in-band or DOCSIS RF QAMs. The aforementioned WiMAX interface may also be utilized by the client device  and\/or the OME  and billing system  during the registration process. Various other permutations of the foregoing will be recognized by those of ordinary skill given the present disclosure.","User Interface\u2014","In another aspect of the invention, a substantially centralized user interface and control device is disclosed which permits the transfer or migration of content delivery sessions (e.g., SIP-based IPTV sessions or the like) between two or more devices. In one implementation, the user's premises gateway or DSTB and associated display device, or PC, is used as the host (control) device for the user interface, the latter which shows the various premises and \u201coff-net\u201d devices associated with the user\/subscriber account, and their interconnectivity (i.e., which devices are currently in communication with others via wired or wireless interfaces, etc.).","For example, \u201con-net\u201d devices might include the user's premises gateway or CPD, DSTB, DVR, WiMAX-enabled receiver, HDTV, etc., while \u201coff net\u201d devices might include the user's Wi-Fi-enabled laptop or smartphone, cellular smartphone (which may be the same device as the former), PMD, etc. As used herein, the terms \u201con-net\u201d and \u201coff-net\u201d are used merely to highlight the difference between services or delivery modes provided by the MSO and those provided by an outside or third-party operator (e.g., cellular service provider or wireless service provider), although these terms are by no means determinative, and in fact devices can switch hosting (e.g., go from on-net to off-net, and vice versa), or be multi-functioned. For example, a WiMAX-enabled portable receiver may be serviced by the MSO infrastructure for delivery of MSO content as described elsewhere herein, or be serviced by a separate wireless service provider not associated with the MSO, or both.","In one variant, the control device includes a GUI functionality (e.g., a multi-touch-screen GUI, drag-and-drop, speech recognition application, or other interface\/input device) allows the user to rapidly designate particular devices for establishment of a session\/delivery of content, and\/or transfer existing communication sessions between capable devices (such as may be determined by the OME recommendation engine). Remote control devices associated with extant devices such as DVRs, DSTBs, etc. can for example be modified to include the foregoing UI\/GUI functionality, or a separate dedicated device provided.","In another variant, a separate centrally located \u201calways on\u201d device with touch screen functionality is provided, so that the user can see the status and connectivity of all devices, and control the transfer of content delivery sessions via the device. For example, the UI shows all devices in premises, and touch screen and \u201cdrag and drop\u201d functionality allows the user to select an icon associated with a given device with an active content delivery (e.g., SIP) session, and literally drag their finger to the icon of a second (and\/or third) device desired to receive the content. This drag and drop function will then be treated as the user \u201cOK\u201d to transfer the session automatically as described elsewhere herein (which may also include \u201cstate\u201d preservation functions if desired).","In another embodiment, a substantially network-based user interface is employed; see e.g., the exemplary implementation described in co-owned and co-pending U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/256,903 filed Oct. 30, 2009 previously incorporated herein. In this embodiment, a network entity (e.g., server) is used to manage and update UI's generated on the client devices within the network, including generation of graphics, listings, etc. illustrating different device delivery options as described elsewhere herein. For instance, in one scenario, the user requests delivery of a particular content element via their IP-enabled DSTB and associated monitor. The resulting evaluation of associated user\/premises devices produces a recommendation or listing of other devices, which are then displayed on the UI (e.g., in a graphical format, table, etc.), akin to adding another \u201cservice\u201d.","In yet another embodiment, a speech recognition and command interface of the type well known in the digital signal processing arts is used in conjunction with the aforementioned client device to move sessions from one device to another. This embodiment operates substantially similar to those previously described (e.g., remote control, display, or touch-screen controlled), yet using predetermined commands to effect session transfer. For example, plain language commands such as \u201cMove Transformers to Bedroom\u201d or the like may be employed via the speech interface. In one variant, the speech recognition system can be trained by the user as to particular commands, which may be location- or device-based (e.g., \u201cMove Living Room to Bedroom\u201d or \u201cMove DSTB1 to PC\u201d), or alternatively may be context or content based (\u201cMove [content identifier] to [location] or [device]\u201d), and so forth. The content identifiers selected by the user may in another variant be sent up to the OME or other entity within the network for future access or use; i.e. to allow for encoding of the metadata associated with a particular user session \u201con the fly\u201d so that the voice command interface will be operative and recognize that particular user's commands. For instance, one user might call the movie \u201cTransformers\u201d by that name, whereas another use might say \u201cmovie on HBO\u201d or \u201cmovie about transforming robots\u201d, and hence prior knowledge by the network of a given user's commands enables the encoding specific to that user. Metadata encoded with content may also or alternatively include several keywords (e.g., \u201ctransformer\u201d, \u201crobot\u201d, \u201cMegan Fox\u201d, \u201cHBO\u201d, etc.), which may be used by a search function or engine disposed on the client device (or the network entity) to identify the relevant content element. Other commands may also be programmed in; e.g., \u201cMove Transformers to Bedroom in Five Minutes and Shut Down DSTB\u201d, or the like.","Voice commands may also be user-specific, such that only a particular user's voice is operative to command session transfer (e.g., via biometrics).","In another variant, speech or another user attribute can be used to determine user presence\/movement within a premises. This information can be fed into the client-side application (or even transmitted to the OME) so as to allow for command-prompted or even automatic session transfer within the premises. For example, in one scenario, the user merely says \u201cI am here\u201d when they desire to transfer the session to their new location. The speech recognition engine\/command interface receives this input and determines where \u201chere\u201d is (e.g., bedroom, by virtue of the location of the microphone or other device receiving the voice signal), and transfers the session.","Alternatively, a sensor (such as Passive IR or the like, which may even be associated with another host system such as a premises security system) can be used to transfer, initiate, or terminate sessions or other device functions (e.g., power up\/down, tuning, etc.). Hence, when a user walks from the living room to the bedroom, the client application and\/or OME can receive information regarding the user's location, and move (or replicate) the session automatically. Of course, this type of approach is best suited for a situation where relatively infrequent movement occurs by very few or one individual (e.g., an older person who lives alone and does not move room-to-room very often), although it is not so limited to such applications.","Business Models and \u201cRules\u201d Engine\u2014","In another aspect of the invention, one or more computer programs running on the processor  of the OME  (or other entity such as e.g., server , BSA hub entity, client device , etc.) includes a so-called \u201crules\u201d engine. This engine comprises, in an exemplary embodiment, one or more software routines adapted to control the operation of the client devices  (and optionally supporting network infrastructure) in order to achieve one or more goals relating to operations or business (e.g., profit). Included within these areas are network optimization and reliability goals, increased maintenance intervals, increased subscriber or user satisfaction, increased subscription base, higher revenue or profit (e.g., from increased advertising revenues), more subscriber \u201cviews\u201d of given content, higher data download speed, increased bandwidth and responsiveness to changing demands for bandwidth, reduction of undue QAM replication, and so forth.","These rules engine may comprise a separate entity or process, and may also be fully integrated within other processing entities (such as the aforementioned OME), and controlled via e.g., a GUI displayed on a device connected to the relevant device or server. In effect, the rules engine comprises a supervisory entity which monitors and selectively controls the operation of the clients  at a higher level, so as to implement desired operational or business rules. The rules engine can be considered an overlay of sorts to the more fundamental algorithms used to accomplish client device recommendations (e.g., the \u201crecommendation engine\u201d discussed above).","For example, the OME  or client device  may invoke certain operational protocols or decision processes based on information or requests received from the device , conditions existing within the network, demographic data, geographic data, user preferences, etc. However, these processes may not always be compatible with higher-level business or operational goals, such as maximizing profit or system reliability. Hence, when imposed, the business\/operational rules can be used to dynamically (or manually) control the operation of the client process on the client device . The rules may be, e.g., operational or business-oriented in nature, and may also be applied selectively in terms of time of day, duration, specific local areas, or even at the individual user level (e.g., via specific identification of the client device  via MAC address, IP address, cryptographic hash or digital signature, or the like, or via user-specific or account-specific login).","For example, one rule implemented by the rules engine may comprise only providing certain types or formats of programming to certain subscribers or classes of subscribers, and\/or on certain ones of the subscriber's registered devices. As noted previously, these rules may be implemented at the device level (e.g., client device ), or at the OME  (such as by placing information regarding these rules into the database ). A particular client device  may possess an MPEG-4 decoder, for example, but the device  may not be recommended for delivery of requested programs rendered in MPEG-4 encoding, unless the subscriber meets certain criteria (e.g., \u201cpremium\u201d subscription, etc.). Similarly, if any of the subscriber's registered devices  do not possess a required codec, CA keys, DRM, or network interface, recommendation of the device  by the evaluation application  may be controlled, and\/or the download of the missing component\/capability may be restricted to only subscribers meeting certain criteria. As indicated above, in one embodiment, information regarding the subscriber subscription level and other factors affecting content delivery, as well as the rules themselves, may be stored at the database  and implemented by the OME  (or retrieved by the OME, such as from the network BSS).","Another rule might impose a moratorium or restrictions on upstream data or information messages (e.g., SSP) or requests for content from the client devices  during conditions of very heavy loading (e.g., until a certain minimum threshold of available bandwidth is present), thereby avoiding contention for bandwidth resources with \u201cpremium\u201d services. Similarly, program-related or other processing typically done upstream of the client devices  could be dynamically shifted to the devices  under such circumstances so as distribute the processing load (and hence upstream messaging bandwidth consumed) to the client devices .","The rules engine may further establish that recommendations by the OME  (i.e., recommendation engine previously described) may be limited to only certain subscribers and\/or certain types of devices . For example, the processes of monitoring, evaluating and notifying (as performed by the monitor application , evaluation application  and notification application ) may be limited to only those devices having a premium service level. Additionally, the aforementioned services may be limited to only certain ones of a subscriber's devices , the additional devices being added to the service at a premium.","Yet another rule might impose restrictions on establishing or allocating new physical channels\/QAMs or IP-packetized delivery sessions to the subscriber channel requests based on device  profile data (e.g., the presence or lack of a certain required interfaces, codecs, CA, DRM, etc.). As previously discussed, bandwidth\/QAM resource allocation and other relevant network considerations may be used as a basis of determining device  recommendations in a broadcast switched network. This process can also be made dynamic if desired; such as where QAM loading and similar parameters can be continuously or periodically re-evaluated, and the operation of the network altered accordingly. For example, when sufficient bandwidth is again present, the subscriber of the previous example may be switched over to a program stream associated with the higher bandwidth codec, or allocated an HD session versus SD on the same HD-capable device (with the switch-over being effectively imperceptible to the subscriber).","Still further, the system may be modified such that during instances of increased demand on the network, certain classes of subscribers (e.g., lower tier subscribers) may only be permitted to view content at particular ones of client devices. In other words, as bandwidth demand increases, certain subscribers may no longer be able to view content on certain devices. As a result, when a requesting device  requests content, the subscriber may be restricted as to which devices are available, or in the extreme not be given a choice as to which device to receive the requested content on, but rather will be immediately directed to a device selected by the network. Hence, under this paradigm, the user's available device population\/delivery mode \u201cmatrix\u201d grows and shrinks as a function of network loading.","The present invention also lends itself to various business models in terms of distribution, operation, and service provision. Specifically, by having remote monitoring, configuration and provisioning capability, the service provider (e.g., MSO) is given greater flexibility in, inter cilia, (i) troubleshooting and repairing faults within the CPE  or other connected premises devices which may otherwise require a service visit; and (ii) changing or reconfiguring a given subscriber's service package or capabilities remotely, again obviating a service visit or actions by the subscriber while simultaneously being able to provide requested content at other ones of the subscriber's devices . For example, as previously described, new client devices  are immediately updated to a subscriber account (as well as removal of devices), then provided to the database , thereby allowing the OME  to rapidly switch service options on a per-subscriber or per-device basis (enhancing so-called \u201cservice velocity\u201d).","Under the foregoing model, the MSO may also utilize the OME and supporting processes to mitigate service outages for the subscriber. For instance, in one variant, the device population for a given user or subscriber account is periodically or anecdotally scanned and evaluated for the then \u201cbest\u201d alternative or second option for the user, based on e.g., the output of the recommendation engine. At any given time, the subscriber may be utilizing the \u201cbest\u201d option, and the rules engine could utilize the recommendation engine to rank the available options to periodically determine the second-best option. Hence, when a device failure or other delivery issue of the (then) \u201cbest\u201d option occurs, the OME would be primed to immediately swap the subscriber over to the second-best choice at that time, and display a notification (or generate an audible cue, etc) on the then-selected (alternative) platform (and the failed platform, to the degree it is operable to do so) to alert the user as to the switch and why it occurred (e.g., \u201cMalfunction on Option No. 1\u2014Network-imposed Switched to Option 2\u201d, or the like). This approach advantageously maintains subscriber program continuity to the maximum degree possible, rather than having the subscriber staring at a blank of fuzzy screen with no explanation why.","For example, in one implementation, the ROM of each device (e.g., DSTB, gateway, CPD, etc.) might include the aforementioned alert message, so that if it and its associated display are at least marginally functional, the alert could be displayed (rather than having the subscriber have to hunt for which platform was designated \u201cnext best\u201d at that moment to find the ongoing program stream).","The foregoing functionality may also be masked by other factors or device considerations, such as sensed availability of alternates at any given time (e.g., only consider then powered-up and registered devices as viable alternatives).","In yet another aspect, the methods and apparatus of the present invention may be tied to additional consideration from the subscriber for changes in service delivery. For example, incremental changes in \u201cservice quality\u201d (including e.g., video quality, audio quality, service coverage or reliability, transportability of sessions, access to features (such as e.g., \u201cblended\u201d services such as those described in co-owned and co-pending U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/256,903 filed Oct. 30, 2009 entitled \u201cMETHODS AND APPARATUS FOR PACKETIZED CONTENT DELIVERY OVER A CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK\u201d, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), access to off-net content, etc.), may be associated with an additional charge. In one variant, an \u201cunlimited\u201d package is offered, wherein the subscriber is given an unlimited number of uses or \u201cupgrades\u201d for an unlimited (within their device capability profile) number of different services, all for an extra monthly premium. Alternatively, a \u201cper use\u201d payment model may be employed, or a finite limit per time period for a given premium. The user may also \u201cbarter\u201d for the upgrades in another variant; e.g., such as by exchanging actions (e.g., taking a survey, reviewing a sample advertisement\/promotion, etc.) in exchange for the \u201cupgrade(s)\u201d This approach can also be used as a \u201cteaser\u201d for enhancing existing subscriptions; i.e., by offering the subscriber enhanced capabilities for a trial period, they may request an upgrade to their subscription level or addition of the service (for added cost).","Many other approaches and combinations of various operational and business paradigms are envisaged consistent with the invention, as will be recognized by those of ordinary skill when provided this disclosure.","It will be recognized that while certain aspects of the invention are described in terms of a specific sequence of steps of a method, these descriptions are only illustrative of the broader methods of the invention, and may be modified as required by the particular application. Certain steps may be rendered unnecessary or optional under certain circumstances. Additionally, certain steps or functionality may be added to the disclosed embodiments, or the order of performance of two or more steps permuted. All such variations are considered to be encompassed within the invention disclosed and claimed herein.","While the above detailed description has shown, described, and pointed out novel features of the invention as applied to various embodiments, it will be understood that various omissions, substitutions, and changes in the form and details of the device or process illustrated may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the invention.
