title: Method and apparatus for automatic placement of advertising
abstract: A computer system for automatic replacement of direct advertisements in scarce media includes an advertising server for selecting a direct advertisement based on certain criteria. Transaction results of the direct advertisement placement are reported back to the advertising server, and an associated accounting system. In one embodiment, the direct advertiser's server reports transactions back to the advertising server by email. In a second embodiment, a direct proxy server brokers the user's session (or interaction) with the direct advertiser's server, including transaction processing and the direct proxy server reports the results of transactions back to the advertising server and its associated accounting system. A direct proxy provides an independent audit of transactions at a remote direct advertiser's web site. The feedback of the results of direct advertisement transactions provides an efficient utilization of direct advertising space by way of an automated computer system with a predictive model for selection and distribution of direct advertising.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["Applicants hereby claim the benefit of priority of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/048,940, filed Jun. 16, 1997 and U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/049,877 filed Jun. 17, 1997.","This invention relates to computer systems for automated replacement of advertisements in scarce media. In particular, the present invention relates to the automated selection of direct advertising in advertising campaigns in order to utilize scarce media space efficiently and optimize revenue.","Scarce media is defined as media providing limited amount of space. For example, newspaper and magazines have limited amount of page space; radio and television have a limited amount of air time slots; Internet web pages have limited amount of viewable screen space and\/or bandwidth; and so on. Media providers (such as magazines and newspaper publishers, radio and television broadcasters, Internet content providers and advertising networks) commonly bill advertisers based on two prevalent pricing models.","The first pricing model, based on the number of impressions delivered, is often referred to as \u201cCPM\u201d pricing (i.e. cost per thousand impressions). In CPM pricing, an advertiser pays a media provider a fixed amount based on the circulation of their advertisement, regardless of whether the advertising campaign is successful.","The second pricing model, based on explicit customer feedback, is sometimes referred to as \u201cDirect Response\u201d or \u201cCPA\u201d advertising (i.e. cost per actions). CPA pricing is distinguished from CPM pricing, because in CPA pricing, a marketer compensates a media provider a variable amount based on the success of the advertising campaign. Successful ad campaigns are measured, for example, by the number of survey forms filled out, leads generated, sales transacted, software downloaded, and so on.","Whereas in CPM pricing, an advertiser is entirely at risk for an unsuccessful advertising campaign, in the case of CPA pricing, the risk of an ad campaign's success is placed wholly on the media provider. It is therefore an important objective of media providers to select successful direct advertising campaigns in order to utilize scarce media space efficiently and optimize revenue.","A significant economic problem exists for media providers billing on CPA models, wherein two or more direct advertisers wish to advertise on the same scarce space and only one can be accommodated. The media provides would normally prefer to allocate its space to direct advertisers so as to maximize revenue. A revenue maximizing strategy dictates that media providers allocate space to the most successful direct advertising campaign, however, successful campaigns are not known on a pro forma basis. Consequently, media providers are currently burdened with the task of estimating the performance of direct advertising campaigns. Selection of direct advertising, which is currently done in an ad hoc fashion, is usually a manual process.","Further, current media allocations do not make reference to, or precisely measure, the \u201ccontext\u201d in which each direct advertisement performs best. Context is defined as the particular user to which the Advertisement is shown; and\/or the particular date and\/or time during which the Advertisement is displayed; and\/or the particular \u201cDivision of Media\u201d (a term defined below) in which the Advertisement is placed. Current selection of direct response advertising for CPA models is therefore highly inefficient and prone to error, often resulting in sub-optimal allocations of scarce media. Poorly performing direct advertisements represent a cost of opportunity and therefore an economic loss for the media provider. Conversely, better performing direct advertisements would generate more revenue and make better use of scarce media space.","In summary, there is an important need for a method and apparatus for improved selection of direct response advertisements and more efficient utilization of scarce media in direct response advertising.","The present invention provides a method and apparatus for efficient utilization of direct advertising space in scarce media. An advertising server (also referred to herein as an advertisement server) selects a direct advertisement, based on certain criteria, for automatic replacement in scarce media. Transaction results of the direct advertisement placement are reported back to the advertising server. In one embodiment, the direct advertiser's server reports transactions back to the advertising server by email. In a second embodiment, a direct proxy server mirrors the direct advertiser's server, including transaction processing. The direct proxy server reports the results of transactions back to the advertising server (and associated accounting system) without requiring an email program modification of the remote direct advertiser's web site. The use of a direct proxy for reporting transactions provides an independent audit of transactions at the remote direct advertiser's web site. In either embodiment the feedback of the results of direct advertisement transactions is used to provide an efficient utilization of direct advertising space by way of an automated computer system with a predictive model.","As used herein, the terms \u201cadvertising server\u201d and \u201cadvertisement server\u201d are used interchangeably to refer to a server that selects an advertisement for display to a user. The invention is embodied in an automated computer system with a predictive model that has any and\/or all of the following process functionality:\n\n","The present invention provides a method and apparatus for media providers to correlate particular advertisements with particular divisions of media space, so the media provider can further optimize scarce media space. Divisions of media space are, for example, individual pages of web sites; time slots for TV and radio commercials; sections of magazines and newspapers; and so on.","The present invention provides a method and apparatus for media providers to correlate particular advertisements direct with particular users and groups of users of media, so the media provider can further optimize scarce media space. Users of media are, for example, browsers of web sites; viewers of television and CATV; listeners of radio; readers of magazines and newspapers; and so on).","The present invention provides a method and apparatus for the automatic prevention of ad \u201cburn out.\u201d Burn out is defined as the circumstance in which a viewer sees a particular advertisement, or a type of advertisement, too many times and is thereby desensitized to it, making it unlikely that he or she will respond. The same functionality for ad selection and targeting, as described in this invention disclosure, also alleviates user burn out.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for the dynamic replacement of advertisements according to context (defined above). For example, advertisements for Christmas trees have been historically shown to perform well from late-November until December 24, whereas the same advertisements perform poorly other times of the year. The same functionality for ad selection and targeting, as described in this invention disclosure, also dynamically allocates advertisements according to Context. In this example, the media allocation based upon Context of a date would cause more Christmas tree advertisements to run from late-November until Christmas Eve, and then the system will shut off such ads. While the solution in foregoing simple example would normally be evident to a manual operator, the important feature is that in the present invention, the dynamic media allocation is automatic and does not require manual intervention. Other more subtle contexts, for which the present invention can dynamically allocate media include, but are not limited to, particular Users and Divisions of Media.","While the preferred embodiment of this invention operates on an Internet advertising network, the invention is broadly applicable across any advertising system involving scarce media and customer feedback. Applicable advertising systems include, but are not limited to, direct mail, telemarketing, television, radio, print, and CATV, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","14","16","20","22","10","12","18"]},"The direct advertisement  that is selected is dynamically delivered through a medium  to the user for him or her to view through a web browser. The user may then interact with the direct advertisement by means of a feedback loop  to a commerce engine  (a commerce engine is hereby defined as any electronic or physical infrastructure that facilitates a transaction). For example, Internet forms, fax-back systems, toll-free numbers, direct mail postcards, interactive television buttons, etc. are all types of commerce engines  in that they each enable users to respond explicitly to a direct response advertisement. Transactions are hereby defined any form of explicit feedback which a user may convey by means of a commerce engine. For example, filling out a form, placing an order, supplying a credit card number, completing a survey, providing a survey or lead form, executing a software download, etc. are all forms of transactions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["25","24","20","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["34","38","36","40","44","42"]},"The preferred embodiment of the present invention is implemented on an Internet advertising network, in which the media providers are Internet Web sites and the direct advertisers employ banner advertisements appearing for example on web pages to promote their products and services.","Both the advertisement and predictive model servers are programmed database systems running on top of Windows NT. The advertisement servers contain a database of the information necessary to generate the various banner or other types of advertisements that may appear on a web page. Each advertisement is assigned a unique address and is selected based upon the various criteria for the predictive model.","Advertising management, accounting, and monitoring are also custom-programmed systems, which are accessed through the same NT-based computer network. Database information for the predictive model, users, and context is stored on an external programmed database, which is preferably accessed through an Oracle database or other SQL database.","The predictive model is programmed and currently makes use of the following context information that may be associated for example with the Internet: user id (TCP\/IP address for example), ad id (which may be arbitrarily assigned), page id (such as a World Wide Web page), site id (such as a World Wide Web site), time of day (either at the site of the computer running the predictive model or the time based on the TCP\/IP address), day of the week, and date. Techniques for identifying the user ID are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/738,634 filed on Oct. 29, 1996, pages 8, line 2 through page 9, line 10 of which are incorporated by reference. The predictive model has an extendible architecture to make use of additional context information as well.","Empirically measured data and\/or initial suppositions about each advertisement are used to initially establish the predictive model to assign weights for different advertisements. For example, the time of advertisements are more favorably run may depend upon seasonal factors such as advertisements for summer clothing being more heavily favored in late spring and early summer. Similarly, the predictive model may also assign different weights to different locations where the user is located. For example, advertisements for gardening tools may be more heavily weighted when the user is viewing a page connected to gardening or home improvement and less heavily weighted towards selection when the user is viewing a page regarding for example fashions. Similarly, the time of day, the frequency of display to either all users or a given user, or any other factor such as those discussed at page 13, line 15 through page 14, line 2 of the above reference application. The predictive model may also be modified by examining the results of the CPA to maximize revenue by, for example, searching for advertisements that seem to be outperforming other advertisements in the same category of goods or services.","The advertisement servers deliver stored, targeted direct advertisements to users based on the recommendation of the predictive model as well as additional advertisement selection information that is manually configured through the advertisement management system. The various servers for the prediction models, the advertisement servers, the commerce engines, may be in located in one physical location and connected over a LAN or they may be located in various locations and communicating over a WAN or the Internet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["54","56"]},"Each of the current offers is reviewed by calculating the expected return at step . Some of the decisions that the predictive model bases its advertisement selection include user characteristics, past exposure to the advertisement, historical statistical performance in the context of the user and the event; and\/or the payment rate for the offer. Considering all the factors known about the user, the offer, the probability of conversion and the cost per action, the expected return for the offer is calculated. If the expected return is higher than previously rated offers at step , the offer is marked as the best offer at step . The current offer counter is incremented at step , and the next offer is reviewed at steps ,  and . When all offers have been reviewed, at step , the best offer is sent and shown to the user at step .","The flow chart of  is also applicable for media content that the user requests (i.e. \u201cpulled\u201d content) as well as that which is broadcast to him or her (i.e. \u201cpushed\u201d content).","Users view Direct Advertisements as banner ads on Web Pages by using a browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer. Direct Transactions are initiated whenever users click on these banner ads. When users click on such ads, their browsers are automatically redirected to a Commerce Server where they can complete an Action. The Commerce Server may be located at the advertiser's web site or may be co-located at the location of the advertisement servers or the predictive model server. In response to a successful action such as a sale, an e-mail message is generated back from the advertiser's web site to the predictive model server.","Actions include, for example: completing a survey, supplying lead information, providing a credit card number, executing a software download, making a purchase, viewing a slide show, playing an online computer game, etc. The Commerce Server hosts these actions and is optionally located either on the same premises as the advertisement servers or off site at another location and\/or another Internet domain. In either case, Commerce Servers communicate back to the predictive model by means of an email API. A specification of the API may be as follows:","DoubleClick Direct Response Network","Marketer Interface Specification preliminary Overview This document specifies an interface for the feedback of transactions to DoubleClick for cost per action (CPA) advertising purchases.","When a transaction occurs that is the result of an advertisement with DoubleClick Direct, the advertiser notifies DoubleClick of the transaction via an automated email message procedure. On the ad click-through, the advertising server redirects the user to a URL specified by the advertiser such as a commerce server operated by the advertiser or a third party such as a virtual mall. The URL will end with an event string that contains information used by DoubleClick to account for transactions. For example:\n\n","The portion after the question mark is the event string. The marketer's commerce server should remember this string and keep it associated with the user (either via a session cookie or by embedding it in the URLs used during the session).","When a transaction occurs, the commerce server must send an email notification to the operator of the predictive model server using an e-mail address such as event@doubleclick.net.
