title: Power reduction for image sensor with raw image scaler
abstract: A system and method for scaling an image includes receiving raw image data comprising input pixel values which correspond to pixels of an image sensor, filtering pixels in a spatial domain, and filtering pixels in a frequency domain according to an oversampling ratio. The system and method may also include outputting scaled image data as output pixel values, which correspond to subgroups of the input pixel values. The filtering may be done according to a Bayer-consistent ruleset which includes a set of filter weights and a series of scaling rules. The oversampling ratio is set to minimize an error after the filtering in the spatial domain and the filtering in the frequency domain.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This application relates generally to digital image scaling. More specifically, this application relates to a raw domain image scaling system and method that maintains consistency while having reduced power consumption.","2. Description of Related Art","In a digital image capturing system, it is common that the resolution requirement for still image capture is higher than that of video output. In such a case, a high-resolution camera capable of supporting the resolution requirement of still image capture is often used. When the camera is used in video mode to produce a video output stream, the data is scaled down to suit the resolution of the video output. For example, a particular image sensor with 8 million pixels (megapixels or MP) can give 8 MP still images. For the same image sensor in video mode, a resolution of 1080\u00d71920 pixels, or approximately 2 MP, may suffice to produce 1080p high-definition (HD) video. Therefore, in 1080p video mode, the image data is scaled down 3\u00d7 both vertically and horizontally to provide the desired output resolution.","This scaling may be performed either in the raw domain or the RGB domain. An advantage of scaling the image data in the raw domain to the desired video resolution is that it reduces the number of pixels that must be processed through the system. As a result, a majority of processing blocks in an image pipeline or post-processing section can be operated at a lower clock rate than the clock rate required to support full-resolution processing. Operating the processing section at a lower clock rate has significant advantages in reducing electromagnetic interference and reducing power consumption of the system. These advantages are especially valuable in such applications as mobile imaging.","However, existing methods of scaling in the raw domain suffer from several disadvantages, including difficulty in maintaining a Bayer output pattern without resorting to increasingly complex, expensive, and resource-intensive logic circuitry. Additionally, such existing scaling methods suffer from inferior image quality when compared to scaling in the RGB domain. Moreover, to the extent that existing scaling methods rely on such complex, expensive, and resource-intensive logic circuitry, such methods consume prohibitive amounts of power.","Accordingly, there is a need for raw image scaling that can efficiently produce output images of high image quality (that is, with good resolution) which are free of the image artifacts produced by existing raw image scaling, and which are effective without consuming an undue amount of power.","Various aspects of the present disclosure relate to a system and method for scaling an image. The scaling includes receiving a raw image data comprising a plurality of input pixel values, respective ones of the input pixel values corresponding to a respective pixel of an image sensor; filtering the plurality of input pixel values in a spatial domain; and filtering the plurality of input pixel values in a frequency domain according to a predetermined oversampling ratio.","In one example, the predetermined oversampling ratio is set such that an error after the filtering in the spatial domain and the filtering in the frequency domain is less than a threshold value. In an additional or alternative example, the predetermined oversampling ratio is proportional to an error in an A\/D conversion.","In this manner, various aspects of the present disclosure provide for improvements in at least the underlying technical processes of image capturing and image processing.","This disclosure can be embodied in various forms, including business processes, computer-implemented methods, computer program products, computer systems and networks, user interfaces, application programming interfaces, hardware-implemented methods, signal processing circuits, image sensor circuits, application specific integrated circuits, field programmable gate arrays, and the like. The foregoing summary is intended solely to give a general idea of various aspects of the present disclosure, and does not limit the scope of the disclosure in any way.","In the following description, numerous details are set forth, such as flowcharts, data tables, and system configurations. It will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are merely exemplary and not intended to limit the scope of this application.","While the following description presents image scaling in the context of a Bayer-consistent scaling, the present disclosure is not so limited and may be similarly applied to any type of scaling as a particular application may require.","[Imaging System]",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-C","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1C"],"b":["1","1","100","200","1","200","1","200","1","100"],"i":["a","c ","a","c ","a","c ","a","c","a ","a","b ","b","c ","c"]},"In all three of , image pipeline -includes a raw domain processing section (for example, a raw domain processing circuit) -which comprises a series of raw domain processing blocks P, . . . , Pn. These raw domain processing blocks process raw image data (also called raw pixel data) in the same format as they are captured from the image sensor. Additionally, image pipeline -includes a demosaic section (for example, a demosaic circuit) -which converts raw image data into full color image data; that is, data wherein each pixel includes all RGB values. Furthermore, image pipeline -includes an RGB domain processing section (for example, an RGB domain processing circuit) -which comprises a series of RGB domain processing blocks Q, . . . , Qk. Examples of processing blocks or circuits in image pipeline -include lens artifact correction, bad pixel correction, color correction, noise filtering, sharpening, and the like.","In , RGB domain processing section includes an RGB scaling section (for example, a scaling circuit) . In , raw domain processing section includes a raw scaling section . In , image sensor includes scaling section . While the three exemplary views show only a single RGB or raw scaling section, exemplary image capturing systems may have the capability of supporting both raw domain image scaling and RGB domain image scaling. In such case, both a raw scaling section and an RGB scaling section would be present in the same image capturing system. Such an arrangement would provide the user or system designer with the capability of selecting either raw scaling, RGB scaling, or both, to suit specific operating conditions as desired.","The raw scaling techniques described herein improve the functioning of the image sensor and\/or the image pipeline by allowing it to produce output images of high quality with fewer artifacts and at a reduced power consumption.","Image pipeline -may be implemented either in hardware, software, or a mixture of both. Examples of hardware implementations include application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), field programming logic array (FPGA), other programmable logic circuits, discrete circuit elements, and the like. Examples of software implementations include firmware in an embedded chip, software in digital signal processors (DSP), software in a simulator, software in a graphics processing unit (GPU), software in a general purpose central processing unit (CPU), and the like. A mixture of hardware and software may also be used wherein some blocks in image pipeline -are implemented in hardware, with the remaining blocks implemented in software. In one example, one or more of image sensor -and image pipeline -, or subunits thereof, are implemented as a processing unit and a memory.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["100","100","100","100"],"i":["a","c","a ","a ","c "]},"In , image sensor includes a pixel array , including a plurality of pixels  arranged in rows and columns. Individual pixels  include pixel elements such as a photosensitive element (for example, a photodiode) and associated control circuits (for example, transistors). The pixel array  is connected to a readout circuit  so that analog data values from pixels  may be sent to a bank of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) , which convert the pixel data values into digital form. Pixel array , readout circuit , and ADCs  are controlled by a sequencer and timing control circuit  which controls the ordering of pixel reading operations and the timing of the circuit elements in pixel array . ADCs  may include single slope ADCs, cyclic ADCs, successive approximation ADCs, sigma-delta ADCs (also known as delta-sigma ADCs), and the like.","In , ADCs  are sigma-delta ADCs. A sigma-delta ADC requires oversampling and gives out a sequence of D bit samples, where D is typically a low number such as 1. In order to generate multi-bit output digital values (for example, V-bit samples where V>D), a decimation filter is required which removes high frequency content in the D-bit sample sequence. Specifically, as illustrated in , sigma-delta ADC  is operatively connected to an ADC filter block (ADCF)  to operate as a decimation filter. Also included in the sensor is a raw image scaling block (RISF)  which operates to scale the raw data to a different output size. As will be discussed in more detail below, the raw domain image scaling calculations in RISF  can be implemented with ADCF  as a single digital filter, which leads to a very efficient implementation that has several advantages.","In , ADCF  and RISF  are illustrated as being downstream from the ADC . In this manner, raw scaling in the digital domain may be performed. Alternatively or additionally, the RISF  may be placed upstream from ADC  so as to perform raw scaling in the analog domain. After scaling, the analog signal is converted by the ADC and then pass through ADCF to produce the output.","To provide for color images, a color filter array (CFA) is provided with image sensor , so that each pixel gives a data value corresponding to a single primary color.  illustrates a so-called \u201cBayer\u201d CFA  for use with image sensor . In this example, R represents the pixels coated or provided with optical red filters, which therefore give only red pixel values. Similarly, B represents the pixels coated or provided with optical blue filters, which therefore give only blue pixel values. Both G1 and G2 represent pixels coated or provided with green optical filters, which therefore give only green pixel values. Because the green pixels sharing a row with red pixels and the green pixels sharing a row with blue pixels may have different pixel characteristics due to cross-talk and other reasons, they are labeled with the different notations G1 and G2, respectively. While the Bayer CFA illustrated in  uses an RGB layout, the CFA is not particularly limited in this regard. For example, other color arrangements are possible such as red\/green\/blue\/white (RGBW); cyan\/magenta\/yellow (CMY); cyan\/magenta\/yellow\/green (CMYG); and the like.","In , RGB Bayer CFA  comprises a tiled or repeating arrangement of 2\u00d72 blocks  of pixels , comprising an R pixel in the upper left corner thereof, a G1 pixel in the upper right corner thereof, a G2 pixel in the lower left corner thereof, and a B pixel in the lower right corner thereof. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that other orderings are possible, such as B\/G2\/G1\/R, G1\/R\/B\/G2, G2\/B\/R\/G1, and the like, as well as other primary or complementary color combinations such as C\/M\/Y\/Y, or combinations of color and white such as R\/G\/B\/W.","[General Scaling]","In practical imaging system implementations, the raw domain scaling method can be implemented either in hardware or software, or a mixture of both. For software implementations, the calculations in the scaling method can be implemented using embedded processors, digital signal processors, general purpose processors, software simulation units, and the like. For hardware implementations, the calculations in the scaling method can be implemented using digital means or analog means. Digital implementation in hardware uses digital logic elements such as gates, latches, arithmetic units, and the like. The logic elements can be included into an ASIC, an FPGA, discrete elements, or other programmable circuits. Analog implementation in hardware can include capacitive or resistive circuit elements such as summing junctions, voltage or current dividers, operational amplifiers, and the like.","The raw scaling method can be considered a filtering process followed by decimation. Scaling occurs according to a scaling factor (1\/N)X, where a Bayer input region of 2N\u00d72N is processed to produce a 2\u00d72 Bayer output region.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["401","402","403"]},"In , raw input pixels in each tile of size 4\u00d74 are processed by four filters to give a 2\u00d72 block in the output raw image. In the particularly illustrated filtering procedure, the pixel values of each red pixel are considered to be in a red pixel array R defined as {r, r, r, r}. Red pixel array R is operated on by a red spatial filter coefficient array H defined as {h0, h1, h2, h3} to provide an output red pixel R\u2032. Specifically, each element of red pixel array R is multiplied by the corresponding element of red spatial filter coefficient array H. That is, the coefficients in the red filter array are weights to be applied to the corresponding pixel values in the red pixel array. The products are then added together and divided by the sum of all elements of red spatial filter coefficient array H to produce the output red pixel R\u2032.

filtering representation described above can be generalized to other scaling factors (1\/N)X for any integer N. For a scaling factor (1\/N)X, an input region of size 2N\u00d72N is used. In this manner, to produce an output pixel of a particular color, only input pixels of the same color are considered as an input to the filter. As a result, each filter array includes only Ncoefficients. Alternatively, it is possible to calculate a particular color output pixel value using the pixels of other colors. In that case, the number of spatial filter coefficients used for a scaling factor (1\/N)X will have more than Nterms. Additionally, the regions of support of the filters for a scaling factor (1\/N)X can be expanded beyond the 2N\u00d72N region, and in such a case the number of spatial filter coefficients used for a scaling factor (1\/N)X will also have more than Nterms.","[Pixel Skipping and Binning]","Conceptually, a pixel skipping method at a scaling factor (1\/N)X is one that tiles an original image with 2N\u00d72N cells, and for each cell retains only the four pixels in a 2\u00d72 configuration in the upper left corner of each cell. All other pixels in the cell are discarded or skipped.","Using the above filtering representation, raw pixel scaling using the pixel skipping method may be represented by the filters H={1, 0, 0, 0}; I={1, 0, 0, 0}; J={1, 0, 0, 0}; and K={1, 0, 0, 0}. For convenience of notation in the spatial filter coefficient arrays, only the coefficients corresponding to pixels of the same color are written.","The pixel skipping method may lead to a loss of information because many pixels are simply ignored. That is, for a scaling factor of (1\/N)X, only one out of every Npixels are retained and the rest are discarded.","Conceptually, a binning method at a scaling factor (1\/N)X is one that tiles an input raw image with 2N\u00d72N cells, and for each cell calculates the arithmetic averages of each color as the respective pixel values in a 2\u00d72 cell of the output raw image. For purposes of this calculation, G1 and G2 are treated as different colors, even though they both correspond to the color green, and the averages for G1 and G2 are calculated independently.","Again using the above filtering representation, raw pixel scaling using the binning method may be represented by the filters H={\u00bc, \u00bc, \u00bc, \u00bc}; I={\u00bc, \u00bc, \u00bc, \u00bc}; J={\u00bc, \u00bc, \u00bc, \u00bc}; and K={\u00bc, \u00bc, \u00bc, \u00bc}. Again, for convenience of notation, only the coefficients corresponding to pixels of the same color are written.","In contrast to pixel skipping, binning represents an opposite approach where all the Npixels are retained with equal weights in the output image. This may lead to a loss of resolution, create aliasing artifacts, result in uneven phase in pixels of different colors, and the like.","[Bayer-Consistent Scaling]","Pixel skipping and binning methods typically produce output images of sub-optimal quality; for example, having image artifacts, requiring expensive correction circuits, and the like. As a result, there is a need for a raw domain image scaling method which maintains Bayer consistency.","A raw domain image scaling method that maintains Bayer consistency is called \u201cBayer-consistent raw scaling\u201d (BCRS). An example of BCRS with a scaling factor of (\u2153)X (that is, N=3) is illustrated in . In this case, the input raw image is divided into tiles of size 6\u00d76, and from each 6\u00d76 input tile the scaling method calculates a 2\u00d72 block of the output image. As illustrated, each 6\u00d76 input tile  is divided into four 3\u00d73 sub-tiles - that respectively represent the physical area of virtual pixel - in a block  of a virtual image sensor having a lower resolution equal to the scaled resolution. That is, the virtual image sensor would have \u2153 the resolution both vertically and horizontally compared to the actual image sensor used for capturing the raw image data.","Sub-tiles - are identified by the color of the corresponding virtual pixel -, under the assumption that the virtual image sensor uses the same Bayer CFA as the actual image sensor. For example, sub-tile  is identified as an R sub-tile because it corresponds to virtual pixel , which is positioned where the R filter would be in a Bayer CFA on the virtual image sensor. Similarly, sub-tile  is identified as a G1 sub-tile, sub-tile  as a G2 sub-tile, and  as a B sub-tile.","A similar example of BCRS with a scaling factor of (\u00bc)X is illustrated in . That is, the input raw image is divided into tiles of 8\u00d78, and from each 8\u00d78 input tile the scaling method calculates a 2\u00d72 output block. Here, each 8\u00d78 tile  is divided into four 4\u00d74 sub-tiles - that respectively represent the physical area of a virtual pixel - in a block  of a virtual image sensor having a resolution equal to \u00bc the resolution both vertically and horizontally compared to the actual image sensor.","In both , the geometric pixel centers of the virtual pixels - and - are indicated by dashed lines.

This is illustrated by . Specifically,  shows an edge  in the scene appearing in the lower right portion of the pixel area. If an image including edge  were to be scaled down by the binning method, the effect of the edge would affect all four output pixels because pixels within the edge area are used in calculating the output raw pixels of all colors. In this case the output R, G1, and G2 pixels, even though located outside of the area containing edge , are affected by the presence of edge . This means that the edge  is spread out into the entire 2\u00d72 output area, which corresponds to the entire 6\u00d76 input area. On the other hand, by using BCRS (for example, using the filters of ), only the R pixels in the R sub-tile are used in the calculation of the output R pixel value. Therefore, the output R value is not affected by the presence of edge . Similarly, the output G1 and G2 values are not affected by edge . That is, because edge  is confined to the B sub-tile, only the output B value is affected by edge . In this manner, BCRS preserves the structure of the image more accurately and produces output images of high resolution.","Although, in optimized BCRS (for example, using the filters of ), pixels outside of the c sub-tile are used in the calculation of the output c-colored pixel, the structural limitation is similarly preserved because the filter weights of the pixels outside of the same color sub-tile are comparatively low.","Optimized BCRS filters may also be used to scale at scaling factors other than (\u2153)X; for example, any (1\/N)X for integer N. For example,  illustrates an exemplary optimized BCRS red spatial filter coefficient array for scaling factor (\u00bd)X; whereas  illustrates an exemplary optimized BCRS red spatial filter coefficient array for scaling factor (\u00bc)X. Using the above expressions at \u03bc=0.5, the BCRS filter arrays of  give a Bayer consistency coefficient C of 0.8279 and 0.8166, respectively. These are much higher than the Bayer consistency coefficients C for both pixel skipping and binning as described above.","[Oversampling]","Generally, the power consumption of an image sensor ADC is dependent on the level of data accuracy required for the converted output data. In the case of a sigma-delta ADC, data accuracy is equivalent to the RMS noise, and thus a function of the oversampling ratio (OSR). Here, the OSR is a predetermined ratio. While increasing the OSR leads to a higher level of data accuracy, this is accompanied by an increase in power consumption.","It is possible to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a single converted pixel without affecting the SNR of the scaled pixel. For example, in the case where a scaling factor of 2 is the x-direction is performed, the filter {\u00bd, \u00bd} may be used. The SNR of a pixel after A\/D conversion may be defined as SNR. With this filter, the SNR of the scaled data will be SNR\u00d7\u221a2. That is, the scaled pixel SNR is higher than the SNR of the single converted pixel SNR. This increased SNR is not strictly required and thus the single pixel conversion accuracy may be reduced without negatively affecting the end result of the scaling operation. In this example, the SNR may be reduced by a factor of \u221a2 such that the SNR of the scaled data is simply SNR.","This may be extended to situations where the SNR for each converted pixel is not necessarily equal; that is, the case where the scaling filter has different spatially distributed weights for each pixel. For example, the scaling filter {\u00bc, \u00bd, \u00bc)} results in the SNR of the scaled pixel of SNR\u00d7(8\/3), which is again higher than SNR. Here, then, the SNR may be reduced by this factor such that the SNR of the scaled data is SNR. This renormalization may be performed prior; for example, the central pixel (coefficient=\u00bd) may be treated as having SNR=SNR whereas the two border pixels (coefficient=\u00bc) may be treated as having SNR=SNR=SNR\/(\u221a6). In any event, after the scaling operation the SNR of the converted pixel will have the same value of SNR.","The desired SNR for each single converted pixel may be selected from a number of options to achieve the required scaled pixel SNR. This flexibility may be used to optimize ADC power consumption, as will be detailed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},"In one aspect of the present disclosure, a noise target for the output pixels (either single or after binning) is selected for single conversion with 160 ADCF coefficients (that is, OSR=160).

These approaches are:","(1) Binning base line filter that uses pixel binning in the horizontal direction and pixel skipping in the vertical direction, as illustrated in .
