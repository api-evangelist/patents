title: Ground potential rise monitor
abstract: A device and method for detecting ground potential rise (GPR) comprising positioning a first electrode and a second electrode at a distance from each other into the earth. The voltage of the first electrode and second electrode is attenuated by an attenuation factor creating an attenuated voltage. The true RMS voltage of the attenuated voltage is determined creating an attenuated true RMS voltage. The attenuated true RMS voltage is then multiplied by the attenuation factor creating a calculated true RMS voltage. If the calculated true RMS voltage is greater than a first predetermined voltage threshold, a first alarm is enabled at a local location. If user input is received at a remote location acknowledging the first alarm, a first alarm acknowledgment signal is transmitted. The first alarm acknowledgment signal is then received at which time the first alarm is disabled.

"],"p":["The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to the employer-employee relationship between the inventors and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).","A device and method for detecting ground potential rise, preferably for the detection and notification of a rise in ground potential.","As new demands are placed on the electric power system, more transmission lines are built and\/or upgraded in existing right-of-ways, and fewer maintenance outages are accommodated, maintenance personnel are encountering new challenges in their work. One of these challenges pertains to Ground Potential Rise (GPR).","During the repair of a transmission line, personal protective ground cables are installed to safely transfer electric current away from workers in the area into the earth through a work site ground system. This electric current may be generated by various means, such as, electromagnetic induction from a nearby current carrying line. Unfortunately, the earth is not an ideal conductor and as more current passes into the ground, the ground potential of the earth at and around the work site ground increases. As this ground potential changes, workers may be exposed to dangerous voltages.","Currently the only method of safely minimizing GPR is the use of a plurality of grounding cables carrying current into the earth at multiple points. Unfortunately, this does not solve the problem of GPR, but only lowers peak voltages at the cost of spreading the voltage across a larger area. This not only fails to eliminate GPR or notify users of a GPR issue, but may spread GPR to an area considered away from the worksite and therefore safe.","Therefore, there exists a need to safely detect the presence of GPR. Once GPR is detected, specialized equipment (e.g. highly insulated boots, gloves, etc. . . . ) may be used by workers to perform their work safely.","A device and method for detecting ground potential rise (GPR) comprising attenuating, by an attenuation factor, the voltage between a first electrode electrically connected to earth and a second electrode electrically connected to earth at a distance from the first electrode. The true RMS voltage of said attenuated voltage is determined producing an attenuated true RMS voltage. The attenuated true RMS voltage is then multiplied by the attenuation factor producing a calculated true RMS voltage. If the calculated true RMS voltage exceeds a first predetermined voltage threshold, a first alarm at a local location is enabled. If user input is received at a remote location acknowledging the first alarm, a first alarm acknowledgment signal is transmitted. The first alarm acknowledgment signal is then received at which time the first alarm is disabled.","One embodiment of a GPR monitor system comprises a first electrode, a second electrode, a voltage attenuator, a true RMS detector, a first control system, a first alarm, a first transmitter\/receiver, a second transmitter\/receiver, a second control system and a button.

The attenuation factor used by the voltage attenuator is preferably controlled by the selection port of the voltage attenuator. The true RMS voltage detector then produces an attenuated true RMS voltage from the attenuated voltage. The first control system then calculates the true RMS voltage from the attenuated RMS voltage and the attenuation factor by multiplying the attenuated true RMS voltage by the attenuation factor.
