The PBDs of the present invention are in a mixed dimer where one PBD moiety comprises an imine having a labile N10 group for linking to a cell binding agent and the other moiety comprises either an amine or amido group.","Pyrrolobenzodiazepines","Some pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA; the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al., 87, 5793-5795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al., 87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et al., 1994, 433-465 (1994)). Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, et al., 40, 145-148 (1987)), chicamycin (Konishi, et al., 37, 200-206 (1984)), DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et al., 26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et al., 48, 751-758 (1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, et al., 33, 665-667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et al., 29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, et al., 41, 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, et al, 29, 2492-2503 (1982); Langley and Thurston, 52, 91-97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102)(Hara, et al., 41, 702-704 (1988); Itoh, et al., 41, 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, et al., 110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, et al., 25, 437-444 (1972)).

In the B-ring there is either an imine (N\u2550C), a carbinolamine (NH\u2014CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH\u2014CH(OMe)) at the N10-C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In . Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-11 (1975); Hurley and Needham-VanDevanter, 19, 230-237 (1986)). Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove, enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents.","It has been previously disclosed that the biological activity of these molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD units together through their C8\/C\u2032-hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker (Bose, D. S., et al., 114, 4939-4941 (1992); Thurston, D. E., et al., 61, 8141-8147 (1996)). The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence-selective DNA lesions such as the palindromic 5\u2032-Pu-GATC-Py-3\u2032 interstrand cross-link (Smellie, M., et al., 42, 8232-8239 (2003); Martin, C., et al., 44, 4135-4147) which is thought to be mainly responsible for their biological activity.

The illustration shows the portions that correspond to R, A, Land Lin certain embodiments of the invention.","The present invention is suitable for use in providing a PBD compound to a preferred site in a subject. In the preferred embodiments, the conjugate allows the release of an active PBD compound that does not retain any part of the linker. There is no stub present that could affect the reactivity of the PBD compound.","In certain embodiments, the invention provides conjugates comprising a PBD dimer group having a linker connected to a cell binding agent. The present inventors describe herein methods of synthesis that enable such dimer conjugates to be prepared by the use of novel PBD desymmetrisation techniques.","This application is particularly concerned with those Rgroups which have a carbamate link to the N10 position.","The linker attaches the Cell Binding Agent (CBA\/L), e.g. antibody, to the PBD drug moiety D through covalent bond(s). The linker is a bifunctional or multifunctional moiety which can be used to link one or more drug moiety (D) and an antibody unit (Ab) to form antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). The linker (R) may be stable outside a cell, i.e. extracellular, or it may be cleavable by enzymatic activity, hydrolysis, or other metabolic conditions. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) can be conveniently prepared using a linker having reactive functionality for binding to the drug moiety and to the antibody. A cysteine thiol, or an amine, e.g. N-terminus or amino acid side chain such as lysine, of the antibody (Ab) can form a bond with a functional group of a linker or spacer reagent, PBD drug moiety (D) or drug-linker reagent (D-R).","Many functional groups on the linker attached to the N10 position of the PBD moiety may be useful to react with the cell binding agent. For example, ester, thioester, amide, thioamide, carbamate, thiocarbamate, urea, thiourea, ether, thioether, or disulfide linkages may be formed from reaction of the linker-PBD drug intermediates and the cell binding agent. The linkers of the ADC preferably prevent aggregation of ADC molecules and keep the ADC freely soluble in aqueous media and in a monomeric state.","The linkers of the ADC are preferably stable extracellularly. Before transport or delivery into a cell, the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is preferably stable and remains intact, i.e. the antibody remains linked to the drug moiety. The linkers are stable outside the target cell and may be cleaved at some efficacious rate inside the cell. An effective linker will: (i) maintain the specific binding properties of the antibody; (ii) allow intracellular delivery of the conjugate or drug moiety; (iii) remain stable and intact, i.e. not cleaved, until the conjugate has been delivered or transported to its targeted site; and (iv) maintain a cytotoxic, cell-killing effect or a cytostatic effect of the PBD drug moiety. Stability of the ADC may be measured by standard analytical techniques such as mass spectroscopy, HPLC, and the separation\/analysis technique LC\/MS.","Covalent attachment of the antibody and the drug moiety requires the linker to have two reactive functional groups, i.e. bivalency in a reactive sense. Bivalent linker reagents which are useful to attach two or more functional or biologically active moieties, such as peptides, nucleic acids, drugs, toxins, antibodies, haptens, and reporter groups are known, and methods have been described their resulting conjugates (Hermanson, G. T. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press: New York, p 234-242).","In another embodiment, the linker may be substituted with groups which modulate aggregation, solubility or reactivity. For example, a sulfonate substituent may increase water solubility of the reagent and facilitate the coupling reaction of the linker reagent with the antibody or the drug moiety, or facilitate the coupling reaction of Ab-L with D, or D-L with Ab, depending on the synthetic route employed to prepare the ADC.","In one embodiment, L-R is a group:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0167"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00022","num":"00022"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00022","he":"16.26mm","wi":"39.71mm","file":"US09562049-20170207-C00022.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":"where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the N10 position, CBA is a cell binding agent (L), Lis a linker, A is a connecting group connecting Lto the cell binding agent, Lis a covalent bond or together with \u2014OC(\u2550O)\u2014 forms a self-immolative linker, and Lor Lis a cleavable linker."}}}},"Lis preferably the cleavable linker, and may be referred to as a trigger for activation of the linker for cleavage.","The nature of Land L, where present, can vary widely.

Furthermore, the polypeptide may have the sequence NAVXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXRTC.","Antibodies","The term \u201cantibody\u201d herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, dimers, multimers, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (Miller et al (2003) 170:4854-4861). Antibodies may be murine, human, humanized, chimeric, or derived from other species. An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) 5th Ed., Garland Publishing, New York). A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also called epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a full-length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full-length immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof, such targets including but not limited to, cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin can be of any type (e.g. IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species, including human, murine, or rabbit origin.","\u201cAntibody fragments\u201d comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and scFv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, CDR (complementary determining region), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens or microbial antigens, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al (1975) 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al (1991) Nature, 352:624-628; Marks et al (1991) J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 or from transgenic mice carrying a fully human immunoglobulin system (Lonberg (2008) Curr. Opinion 20(4):450-459).","The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al (1984) 81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies include \u201cprimatized\u201d antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g. Old World Monkey or Ape) and human constant region sequences.","An \u201cintact antibody\u201d herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains, as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g. human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more \u201ceffector functions\u201d which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR.","Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different \u201cclasses.\u201d There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into \u201csubclasses\u201d (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3, and \u03bc, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.","Humanisation","Techniques to reduce the in vivo immunogenicity of a non-human antibody or antibody fragment include those termed \u201chumanisation\u201d.","A \u201chumanized antibody\u201d refers to a polypeptide comprising at least a portion of a modified variable region of a human antibody wherein a portion of the variable region, preferably a portion substantially less than the intact human variable domain, has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species and wherein the modified variable region is linked to at least another part of another protein, preferably the constant region of a human antibody. The expression \u201chumanized antibodies\u201d includes human antibodies in which one or more complementarity determining region (\u201cCDR\u201d) amino acid residues and\/or one or more framework region (\u201cFW\u201d or \u201cFR\u201d) amino acid residues are substituted by amino acid residues from analogous sites in rodent or other non-human antibodies. The expression \u201chumanized antibody\u201d also includes an immunoglobulin amino acid sequence variant or fragment thereof that comprises an FR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human immunoglobulin.","\u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Or, looked at another way, a humanized antibody is a human antibody that also contains selected sequences from non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies in place of the human sequences. A humanized antibody can include conservative amino acid substitutions or non-natural residues from the same or different species that do not significantly alter its binding and\/or biologic activity. Such antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulins.","There are a range of humanisation techniques, including \u2018CDR grafting\u2019, \u2018guided selection\u2019, \u2018deimmunization\u2019, \u2018resurfacing\u2019 (also known as \u2018veneering\u2019), \u2018composite antibodies\u2019, \u2018Human String Content Optimisation\u2019 and framework shuffling.","CDR Grafting","In this technique, the humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary-determining region (CDR) of the recipient antibody are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, camel, bovine, goat, or rabbit having the desired properties (in effect, the non-human CDRs are \u2018grafted\u2019 onto the human framework). In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues (this may happen when, for example, a particular FR residue has significant effect on antigen binding).","Furthermore, humanized antibodies can comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and maximize antibody performance. Thus, in general, a humanized antibody will comprise all of at least one, and in one aspect two, variable domains, in which all or all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), or that of a human immunoglobulin.","Guided Selection","The method consists of combining the Vor Vdomain of a given non-human antibody specific for a particular epitope with a human Vor Vlibrary and specific human V domains are selected against the antigen of interest. This selected human VH is then combined with a VL library to generate a completely human VH\u00d7VL combination. The method is described in Nature Biotechnology (N.Y.) 12, (1994) 899-903.","Composite Antibodies","In this method, two or more segments of amino acid sequence from a human antibody are combined within the final antibody molecule. They are constructed by combining multiple human VH and VL sequence segments in combinations which limit or avoid human T cell epitopes in the final composite antibody V regions. Where required, T cell epitopes are limited or avoided by, exchanging V region segments contributing to or encoding a T cell epitope with alternative segments which avoid T cell epitopes. This method is described in US 2008\/0206239 A1.","Deimmunization","This method involves the removal of human (or other second species) T-cell epitopes from the V regions of the therapeutic antibody (or other molecule). The therapeutic antibodies V-region sequence is analysed for the presence of MHC class II-binding motifs by, for example, comparison with databases of MHC-binding motifs (such as the \u201cmotifs\u201d database hosted at www.wehi.edu.au). Alternatively, MHC class II-binding motifs may be identified using computational threading methods such as those devised by Altuvia et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 249 244-250 (1995)); in these methods, consecutive overlapping peptides from the V-region sequences are testing for their binding energies to MHC class II proteins. This data can then be combined with information on other sequence features which relate to successfully presented peptides, such as amphipathicity, Rothbard motifs, and cleavage sites for cathepsin B and other processing enzymes.","Once potential second species (e.g. human) T-cell epitopes have been identified, they are eliminated by the alteration of one or more amino acids. The modified amino acids are usually within the T-cell epitope itself, but may also be adjacent to the epitope in terms of the primary or secondary structure of the protein (and therefore, may not be adjacent in the primary structure). Most typically, the alteration is by way of substitution but, in some circumstances amino acid addition or deletion will be more appropriate.","All alterations can be accomplished by recombinant DNA technology, so that the final molecule may be prepared by expression from a recombinant host using well established methods such as Site Directed Mutagenesis. However, the use of protein chemistry or any other means of molecular alteration is also possible.","Resurfacing","This method involves:\n\n","The method compares the non-human sequence with the functional human germline gene repertoire. Those human genes encoding canonical structures identical or closely related to the non-human sequences are selected. Those selected human genes with highest homology within the CDRs are chosen as FR donors. Finally, the non-human CDRs are grafted onto these human FRs. This method is described in patent WO 2005\/079479 A2.","Human String Content Optimization","This method compares the non-human (e.g. mouse) sequence with the repertoire of human germline genes and the differences are scored as Human String Content (HSC) that quantifies a sequence at the level of potential MHC\/T-cell epitopes. The target sequence is then humanized by maximizing its HSC rather than using a global identity measure to generate multiple diverse humanized variants (described in Molecular Immunology, 44, (2007) 1986-1998).","Framework Shuffling","The CDRs of the non-human antibody are fused in-frame to cDNA pools encompassing all known heavy and light chain human germline gene frameworks. Humanised antibodies are then selected by e.g. panning of the phage displayed antibody library. This is described in 36, 43-60 (2005).","Examples of cell binding agents include those agents described for use in WO 2007\/085930, which is incorporated herein.","Tumour-associate antigens and cognate antibodies for use in embodiments of the present invention are listed below.","Tumor-Associated Antigens and Cognate Antibodies","(1) BMPR1B (Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor-Type IB)","Nucleotide","Genbank accession no.

parent antibody may also be a fusion protein comprising an albumin-binding peptide (ABP) sequence (Dennis et al. (2002) \u201cAlbumin Binding As A General Strategy For Improving The Pharmacokinetics Of Proteins\u201d 277:35035-35043; WO 01\/45746).

The label may be a biotin label. In another embodiment, the cell binding agent may be labelled with a radioisotope.","The cell binding agent is connected to the linker. In one embodiment, the cell binding agent is connected to A, where present, of the linker.","In one embodiment, the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through a thioether bond.","In one embodiment, the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through a disulfide bond.","In one embodiment, the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through an amide bond.","In one embodiment, the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through an ester bond.","In one embodiment, the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is formed between a thiol group of a cysteine residue of the cell binding agent and a maleimide group of the linker.","The cysteine residues of the cell binding agent may be available for reaction with the functional group of Rto form a connection. In other embodiments, for example where the cell binding agent is an antibody, the thiol groups of the antibody may participate in interchain disulfide bonds. These interchain bonds may be converted to free thiol groups by e.g. treatment of the antibody with DTT prior to reaction with the functional group of R.","The cell binding agent may be labelled, for example to aid detection or purification of the agent either prior to incorporation as a conjugate, or as part of the conjugate. The label may be a biotin label. In another embodiment, the cell binding agent may be labelled with a radioisotope.","Drug Loading","The drug loading is the average number of PBD drugs per cell binding agent, e.g. antibody. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to cysteines, drug loading may range from 1 to 8 drugs (D) per cell binding agent, i.e. where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the cell binding agent. Compositions of conjgates include collections of cell binding agents, e.g. antibodies, conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 8. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to lysines, drug loading may range from 1 to 80 drugs (D) per cell binding agent, although an upper limit of 40, 20, 10 or 8 may be preferred. Compositions of conjgates include collections of cell binding agents, e.g. antibodies, conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 80, 1 to 40, 1 to 20, 1 to 10 or 1 to 8.","The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as UV, reverse phase HPLC, HIC, mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and electrophoresis. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. By ELISA, the averaged value of p in a particular preparation of ADC may be determined (Hamblett et al (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 10:7063-7070; Sanderson et al (2005) Clin. Cancer Res. 11:843-852). However, the distribution of p (drug) values is not discernible by the antibody-antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also, ELISA assay for detection of antibody-drug conjugates does not determine where the drug moieties are attached to the antibody, such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments, or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis. Such techniques are also applicable to other types of conjugates.","For some antibody-drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading, e.g. p>5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates.","Typically, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, many lysine residues that do not react with the drug-linker intermediate (D-L) or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine-reactive linker reagent. Also, only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol-reactive linker reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many, if any, free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or TCEP, under partial or total reducing conditions. The loading (drug\/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners, including: (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate (D-L) or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.","Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody (or fragment thereof) by engineering one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues). U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541 teaches engineering antibodies by introduction of reactive cysteine amino acids.","Cysteine amino acids may be engineered at reactive sites in an antibody and which do not form intrachain or intermolecular disulfide linkages (Junutula, et al., 2008b Nature Biotech., 26(8):925-932; Dornan et al (2009) Blood 114(13):2721-2729; U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541; U.S. Pat. No. 7,723,485; WO2009\/052249). The engineered cysteine thiols may react with linker reagents or the drug-linker reagents of the present invention which have thiol-reactive, electrophilic groups such as maleimide or alpha-halo amides to form ADC with cysteine engineered antibodies and the PBD drug moieties. The location of the drug moiety can thus be designed, controlled, and known. The drug loading can be controlled since the engineered cysteine thiol groups typically react with thiol-reactive linker reagents or drug-linker reagents in high yield. Engineering an IgG antibody to introduce a cysteine amino acid by substitution at a single site on the heavy or light chain gives two new cysteines on the symmetrical antibody. A drug loading near 2 can be achieved with near homogeneity of the conjugation product ADC.","Where more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a drug-linker intermediate, or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as polymeric reverse phase (PLRP) and hydrophobic interaction (HIC) may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of ADC with a single drug loading value (p) may be isolated, however, these single loading value ADCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached, via the linker, at different sites on the antibody.","Thus the antibody-drug conjugate compositions of the invention include mixtures of antibody-drug conjugate compounds where the antibody has one or more PBD drug moieties and where the drug moieties may be attached to the antibody at various amino acid residues.","In one embodiment, the average number of dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine groups per cell binding agent is in the range 1 to 20. In some embodiments the range is selected from 1 to 8, 2 to 8, 2 to 6, 2 to 4, and 4 to 8.","In some embodiments, there is one dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine group per cell binding agent.","Includes Other Forms","Unless otherwise specified, included in the above are the well known ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of these substituents. For example, a reference to carboxylic acid (\u2014COOH) also includes the anionic (carboxylate) form (\u2014COO), a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms. Similarly, a reference to an amino group includes the protonated form (\u2014NHRR), a salt or solvate of the amino group, for example, a hydrochloride salt, as well as conventional protected forms of an amino group.

The balance of these equilibria depend on the conditions in which the compounds are found, as well as the nature of the moiety itself.","These particular compounds may be isolated in solid form, for example, by lyophilisation.","Isomers","Certain compounds of the invention may exist in one or more particular geometric, optical, enantiomeric, diasteriomeric, epimeric, atropic, stereoisomeric, tautomeric, conformational, or anomeric forms, including but not limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and Z-forms; c-, t-, and r-forms; endo- and exo-forms; R-, S-, and meso-forms; D- and L-forms; d- and l-forms; (+) and (\u2212) forms; keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms; syn- and anti-forms; synclinal- and anticlinal-forms; \u03b1- and \u03b2-forms; axial and equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and halfchair-forms; and combinations thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cisomers\u201d (or \u201cisomeric forms\u201d).","The term \u201cchiral\u201d refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term \u201cachiral\u201d refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.","The term \u201cstereoisomers\u201d refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.","\u201cDiastereomer\u201d refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term \u201cisomers\u201d, as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space). For example, a reference to a methoxy group, \u2014OCH, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, \u2014CHOH. Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl. However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g. Calkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para-methoxyphenyl).","The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto\/enol (illustrated below), imine\/enamine, amide\/imino alcohol, amidine\/amidine, nitroso\/oxime, thioketone\/enethiol, N-nitroso\/hyroxyazo, and nitro\/aci-nitro.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1270","num":"1505"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00065","num":"00065"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00065","he":"16.51mm","wi":"65.53mm","file":"US09562049-20170207-C00065.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","Note that specifically included in the term \u201cisomer\u201d are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including H, H (D), and H (T); C may be in any isotopic form, including C, C, and C; O may be in any isotopic form, including O and O; and the like.","Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as, but not limited to H (deuterium, D), H (tritium), C, C, C, N, F, P, P, S, Cl, and I. Various isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H, 13C, and 14C are incorporated. Such isotopically labelled compounds may be useful in metabolic studies, reaction kinetic studies, detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. Deuterium labelled or substituted therapeutic compounds of the invention may have improved DMPK (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics) properties, relating to distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. An 18F labeled compound may be useful for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes, particularly deuterium (i.e., 2H or D) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent. The concentration of such a heavier isotope, specifically deuterium, may be defined by an isotopic enrichment factor. In the compounds of this invention any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom.","Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or partially) racemic and other mixtures thereof. Methods for the preparation (e.g. asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g. fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.","Biological Activity","In Vitro Cell Proliferation Assays","Generally, the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is measured by: exposing mammalian cells having receptor proteins, e.g. HER2, to the antibody of the ADC in a cell culture medium; culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring cell viability. Cell-based in vitro assays are used to measure viability (proliferation), cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation) of an ADC of the invention.","The in vitro potency of antibody-drug conjugates can be measured by a cell proliferation assay. The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.), homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of luciferase (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,583,024; 5,674,713 and 5,700,670). This cell proliferation assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) 160:81-88; U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,677). The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay is conducted in 96 well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS) (Cree et al (1995) 6:398-404). The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium. Cell washing, removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells\/well in a 384-well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing. The cells may be treated continuously with ADC, or they may be treated and separated from ADC. Generally, cells treated briefly, i.e. 3 hours, showed the same potency effects as continuously treated cells.","The homogeneous \u201cadd-mix-measure\u201d format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly proportional to the number of cells present in culture. The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay generates a \u201cglow-type\u201d luminescent signal, produced by the luciferase reaction, which has a half-life generally greater than five hours, depending on cell type and medium used. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units (RLU). The substrate, Beetle Luciferin, is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons.","In Vivo Efficacy","The in vivo efficacy of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention can be measured by tumor xenograft studies in mice. For example, the in vivo efficacy of an anti-HER2 ADC of the invention can be measured by a high expressing HER2 transgenic explant mouse model. An allograft is propagated from the Fo5 mmtv transgenic mouse which does not respond to, or responds poorly to, HERCEPTIN\u00ae therapy. Subjects were treated once with ADC at certain dose levels (mg\/kg) and PBD drug exposure (\u03bcg\/m); and placebo buffer control (Vehicle) and monitored over two weeks or more to measure the time to tumor doubling, log cell kill, and tumor shrinkage.","Use","The conjugates of the invention may be used to provide a PBD compound at a target location.","The target location is preferably a proliferative cell population. The antibody is an antibody for an antigen present in a proliferative cell population.","In one embodiment the antigen is absent or present at a reduced level in a non-proliferative cell population compared to the amount of antigen present in the proliferative cell population, for example a tumour cell population.","At the target location the linker may be cleaved so as to release a compound of formula (D). Thus, the conjugate may be used to selectively provide a compound of formula (D) to the target location.","The linker may be cleaved by an enzyme present at the target location.","The target location may be in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo.","The antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) compounds of the invention include those with utility for anticancer activity. In particular, the compounds include an antibody conjugated, i.e. covalently attached by a linker, to a PBD drug moiety, i.e. toxin. When the drug is not conjugated to an antibody, the PBD drug has a cytotoxic effect. The biological activity of the PBD drug moiety is thus modulated by conjugation to an antibody. The antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention selectively deliver an effective dose of a cytotoxic agent to tumor tissue whereby greater selectivity, i.e. a lower efficacious dose, may be achieved.","Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides a conjugate compound as described herein for use in therapy.","In a further aspect there is also provides a conjugate compound as described herein for use in the treatment of a proliferative disease. A second aspect of the present invention provides the use of a conjugate compound in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a proliferative disease.","One of ordinary skill in the art is readily able to determine whether or not a candidate conjugate treats a proliferative condition for any particular cell type. For example, assays which may conveniently be used to assess the activity offered by a particular compound are described in the examples below.","The term \u201cproliferative disease\u201d pertains to an unwanted or uncontrolled cellular proliferation of excessive or abnormal cells which is undesired, such as, neoplastic or hyperplastic growth, whether in vitro or in vivo.","Examples of proliferative conditions include, but are not limited to, benign, pre-malignant, and malignant cellular proliferation, including but not limited to, neoplasms and tumours (e.g. histocytoma, glioma, astrocyoma, osteoma), cancers (e.g. lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, bowel cancer, colon cancer, breast carinoma, ovarian carcinoma, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, pancreas cancer, brain cancer, sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, melanoma), leukemias, psoriasis, bone diseases, fibroproliferative disorders (e.g. of connective tissues), and atherosclerosis.

Exemplary conditions or hyperproliferative disorders include benign or malignant tumors; leukemia, haematological, and lymphoid malignancies. Others include neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic, glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal, blastocoelic, inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic, including autoimmune, disorders.","Generally, the disease or disorder to be treated is a hyperproliferative disease such as cancer.

Also provided is a method of treatment, comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of a conjugate compound of the invention. The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is an amount sufficient to show benefit to a patient. Such benefit may be at least amelioration of at least one symptom. The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the nature and severity of what is being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage, is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors.","A compound of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated. Examples of treatments and therapies include, but are not limited to, chemotherapy (the administration of active agents, including, e.g. drugs, such as chemotherapeutics); surgery; and radiation therapy.","A \u201cchemotherapeutic agent\u201d is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer, regardless of mechanism of action.

Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other material will depend on the route of administration, which may be oral, or by injection, e.g. cutaneous, subcutaneous, or intravenous.","Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in tablet, capsule, powder or liquid form. A tablet may comprise a solid carrier or an adjuvant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally comprise a liquid carrier such as water, petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol may be included. A capsule may comprise a solid carrier such a gelatin.","For intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, or injection at the site of affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity and stability. Those of relevant skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection. Preservatives, stabilisers, buffers, antioxidants and\/or other additives may be included, as required.","Formulations","While it is possible for the conjugate compound to be used (e.g., administered) alone, it is often preferable to present it as a composition or formulation.","In one embodiment, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., formulation, preparation, medicament) comprising a conjugate compound, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient.","In one embodiment, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one conjugate compound, as described herein, together with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art, including, but not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients, adjuvants, fillers, buffers, preservatives, anti-oxidants, lubricants, stabilisers, solubilisers, surfactants (e.g., wetting agents), masking agents, colouring agents, flavouring agents, and sweetening agents.","In one embodiment, the composition further comprises other active agents, for example, other therapeutic or prophylactic agents.","Suitable carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts. See, for example, 2nd Edition (eds. M. Ash and I. Ash), 2001 (Synapse Information Resources, Inc., Endicott, N.Y., USA), 20th edition, pub. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000; and 2nd edition, 1994.","Another aspect of the present invention pertains to methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one [C]-radiolabelled conjugate or conjugate-like compound, as defined herein, together with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art, e.g., carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. If formulated as discrete units (e.g., tablets, etc.), each unit contains a predetermined amount (dosage) of the active compound.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable,\u201d as used herein, pertains to compounds, ingredients, materials, compositions, dosage forms, etc., which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of the subject in question (e.g., human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio. Each carrier, diluent, excipient, etc. must also be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.","The formulations may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with carriers (e.g., liquid carriers, finely divided solid carrier, etc.), and then shaping the product, if necessary.","The formulation may be prepared to provide for rapid or slow release; immediate, delayed, timed, or sustained release; or a combination thereof.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection), include aqueous or non-aqueous, isotonic, pyrogen-free, sterile liquids (e.g., solutions, suspensions), in which the active ingredient is dissolved, suspended, or otherwise provided (e.g., in a liposome or other microparticulate). Such liquids may additional contain other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients, such as anti-oxidants, buffers, preservatives, stabilisers, bacteriostats, suspending agents, thickening agents, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood (or other relevant bodily fluid) of the intended recipient. Examples of excipients include, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils, and the like. Examples of suitable isotonic carriers for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Solution, or Lactated Ringer's Injection. Typically, the concentration of the active ingredient in the liquid is from about 1 ng\/ml to about 10 \u03bcg\/ml, for example from about 10 ng\/ml to about 1 \u03bcg\/ml. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets.","Dosage","It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that appropriate dosages of the conjugate compound, and compositions comprising the conjugate compound, can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and\/or materials used in combination, the severity of the condition, and the species, sex, age, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, veterinarian, or clinician, although generally the dosage will be selected to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.","Administration can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell(s) being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician, veterinarian, or clinician.","In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 ng to about 25 mg (more typically about 1 \u03bcg to about 10 mg) per kilogram body weight of the subject per day. Where the active compound is a salt, an ester, an amide, a prodrug, or the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately.","In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 100 mg, 3 times daily.","In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 150 mg, 2 times daily.","In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 200 mg, 2 times daily.","However in one embodiment, the conjugate compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 50 or about 75 mg, 3 or 4 times daily.","In one embodiment, the conjugate compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 100 or about 125 mg, 2 times daily.","The dosage amounts described above may apply to the conjugate (including the PBD moiety and the linker to the antibody) or to the effective amount of PBD compound provided, for example the amount of compound that is releasable after cleavage of the linker.","For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an ADC of the invention will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 15 mg\/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg\/kg) of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg\/kg of patient weight. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises a course of administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg\/kg, followed by additional doses every week, two weeks, or three weeks of an ADC. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.","Treatment","The term \u201ctreatment,\u201d as used herein in the context of treating a condition, pertains generally to treatment and therapy, whether of a human or an animal (e.g., in veterinary applications), in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example, the inhibition of the progress of the condition, and includes a reduction in the rate of progress, a halt in the rate of progress, regression of the condition, amelioration of the condition, and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure (i.e., prophylaxis, prevention) is also included.","The term \u201ctherapeutically-effective amount,\u201d as used herein, pertains to that amount of an active compound, or a material, composition or dosage from comprising an active compound, which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect, commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio, when administered in accordance with a desired treatment regimen.","Similarly, the term \u201cprophylactically-effective amount,\u201d as used herein, pertains to that amount of an active compound, or a material, composition or dosage from comprising an active compound, which is effective for producing some desired prophylactic effect, commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio, when administered in accordance with a desired treatment regimen.","Preparation of Antibody Drug Conjugates","Antibody drug conjugates may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent, to form antibody-linker intermediate Ab-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with an activated drug moiety reagent; and (2) reaction of a drug moiety reagent with a linker reagent, to form drug-linker reagent D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an antibody. Conjugation methods (1) and (2) may be employed with a variety of antibodies, and linkers to prepare the antibody-drug conjugates of the invention.","Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i)N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (Cleland's reagent, dithiothreitol) or TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Getz et al (1999) Anal. Biochem. Vol 273:73-80; Soltec Ventures, Beverly, Mass.). Each cysteine disulfide bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.","The Subject\/Patient","The subject\/patient may be an animal, mammal, a placental mammal, a marsupial (e.g., kangaroo, wombat), a monotreme (e.g., duckbilled platypus), a rodent (e.g., a guinea pig, a hamster, a rat, a mouse), murine (e.g., a mouse), a lagomorph (e.g., a rabbit), avian (e.g., a bird), canine (e.g., a dog), feline (e.g., a cat), equine (e.g., a horse), porcine (e.g., a pig), ovine (e.g., a sheep), bovine (e.g., a cow), a primate, simian (e.g., a monkey or ape), a monkey (e.g., marmoset, baboon), an ape (e.g., gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutang, gibbon), or a human.","Furthermore, the subject\/patient may be any of its forms of development, for example, a foetus. In one preferred embodiment, the subject\/patient is a human.","In one embodiment, the patient is a population where each patient has a tumour having \u03b1\u03b2integrin on the surface of the cell.","General Synthetic Routes","The synthesis of PBD compounds containing two imine moieties is extensively discussed in the following references, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference:","a) WO 00\/12508 (pages 14 to 30);","b) WO 2005\/023814 (pages 3 to 10);","c) WO 2004\/043963 (pages 28 to 29);","d) WO 2005\/085251 (pages 30 to 39); and","e) WO 2011\/130598 (pages 126 to 150).","Synthesis Route","The compounds of formula I may be synthesised from compounds of formula IP:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1338","num":"1573"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00066","num":"00066"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00066","he":"27.52mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US09562049-20170207-C00066.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["L-pre ","L"]},"For example, when Ris a group:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1340","num":"1575"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00067","num":"00067"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00067","he":"10.75mm","wi":"26.50mm","file":"US09562049-20170207-C00067.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["L-pre ","1","2"]},"Compounds of formula IP where Ris H, Rand Rare both H and Ris OH may be synthesised from compounds of formula 2:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1342","num":"1577"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00068","num":"00068"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00068","he":"27.52mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US09562049-20170207-C00068.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Alternatively, compounds of formula IP where Ris H and Rand Rare both H may be synthesised by coupling compounds of formulae 3 and 4:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1344","num":"1579"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00069","num":"00069"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00069","he":"73.58mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09562049-20170207-C00069.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["N ","O ","O "]},"The coupling can be achieved, for example, in refluxing acetone with a base, such as KCO.","Compounds of formula 3 can be synthesised from compounds of formula 5:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1347","num":"1582"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00070","num":"00070"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00070","he":"28.96mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09562049-20170207-C00070.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"By coupling a compound of Formula 6:\n\nHal-R\u2033-Q\u2003\u2003Formula 6\n\nwhere Q is selected from I, Cl, and Br, The reaction can be achieved, for example, in refluxing acetone with a base, such as KCO.
