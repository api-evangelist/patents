title: Classifying situations for system management
abstract: An information processing system comprises a system management tool, a managed system and a classifier. The system management tool receives a result of a situation classification operation from the classifier, and automatically takes a management action relating to the managed system based at least in part on the result of the situation classification operation. The situation classification result may be determined by monitoring operation of the managed system in a situational state space having dimensions that characterize operating conditions of the system, and identifying a current state of the system in the situational state space. The management action automatically taken by the system management tool may comprise, for example, setting at least one policy for the managed system by selecting and deploying a particular one of a plurality of policy sets responsive to the result of the situation classification operation.

No. 13\/166,128, filed Jun. 22, 2011 and entitled \u201cProviding System Management Services,\u201d all of which are commonly assigned herewith and incorporated by reference herein.","The present invention relates generally to the field of information processing, and more particularly to management of information processing systems.","Information processing systems comprising virtual data centers (VDCs) and other types of cloud infrastructure are coming into increasingly widespread use. For example, commercially available virtualization software may be used to build a wide variety of different types of cloud infrastructure, including private and public cloud computing and storage systems, distributed across hundreds of interconnected physical computers and storage devices. As the complexity of such cloud infrastructure increases, the need for accurate and efficient management of system resources has also grown.","This management of system resources is often implemented using system management tools such as quality of service (QoS) managers, data migration managers, resource managers, load balancers, workflow managers and event handlers.","An issue that arises when using conventional system management tools is that such tools often do not have a sufficiently broad view of all of the various situations that may impact the operating performance of their corresponding managed systems, particularly in the case of managed systems that comprise cloud infrastructure. For example, such management tools often base their policy decisions solely on local knowledge, or other types of limited knowledge that does not adequately reflect high-level situations that may have a significant impact on operating performance of the managed systems. Also, policy setting in conventional system management tools typically requires significant human intervention, for example, from an administrator or other employee of a corresponding enterprise.","Illustrative embodiments of the present invention overcome the above-described deficiencies of conventional practice by providing mechanisms for delivery of external situational classification results to a system management tool.","In one aspect, an information processing system comprises a system management tool, a managed system and a classifier. The system management tool receives a result of a situation classification operation from the classifier, and automatically takes a management action relating to the managed system based at least in part on the result of the situation classification operation. The situation classification result may be determined by monitoring operation of the managed system in a situational state space having dimensions that characterize operating conditions of the system, and identifying a current state of the system in the situational state space. The management action automatically taken by the system management tool may comprise, for example, setting at least one policy for the managed system by selecting and deploying a particular one of a plurality of policy sets responsive to the result of the situation classification operation. It is to be appreciated, however, that every situation classification result received from the classifier need not lead to a corresponding management action in the system management tool.","A given one of the illustrative embodiments advantageously provides a system management tool with a much broader view of situations that may impact the operating performance of its managed system. This allows the system management tool to make better decisions regarding operating policies or other parameters of the managed system, leading to improved performance in the managed system.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description.","The present invention will be described herein with reference to exemplary information processing systems and associated computers, servers, storage devices, virtual machines and other processing devices. It is to be appreciated, however, that the invention is not restricted to use with the particular illustrative system and device configurations shown. Moreover, the term \u201cinformation processing system\u201d as used herein is intended to be broadly construed, so as to encompass, for example, private or public cloud computing or storage systems, as well as other types of systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","100","102","104","106","102","107","106","104"]},"The situational analysis framework  may determine a given situation classification result by monitoring operation of the managed system  in a situational state space having dimensions that characterize operating conditions or other issues impacting operation of the managed system, including external issues such as external time and event status, and identifying a current state of the managed system in the situational state space. An example of one possible configuration of the situational analysis framework  of classifier  will be described in greater detail below in conjunction with .","The management actions automatically taken by the system management tool  may comprise, for example, setting at least one policy for the managed system  by selecting and deploying a particular one of a plurality of policy sets responsive to the result of the situation classification operation. Such policy selection and deployment may be carried out by a policy engine  of the system management tool . The policy engine  of the system management tool  may itself comprise an instance of a situational analysis framework , shown in dashed outline as an optional component.","The system management tool  may comprise, for example, at least one of a quality of service manager, a data migration manager, a resource manager, a load balancer, a workflow manager and an event handler, although a wide variety of other types of system management tools may be utilized in implementing the invention.","As noted above, the classifier  performs situation classification operations using situational analysis framework  and provides the corresponding situation classification results to the system management tool . One or more of these results may be provided to the system management tool  via an application programming interface (API). Performance of a given situational classification operation may involve, for example, monitoring operation of the managed system  in a situational state space having dimensions that characterize operating conditions of the system, and identifying a current state of the system in the situational state space. This current state of the system is an example of what is more generally referred to herein as a \u201csituation.\u201d","The situation classification operations performed by classifier  may be performed periodically, or responsive to occurrence of designated events, or using a combination of these or other operation timing controls.","The classifier  may utilize information obtained from the managed system  itself, as well as additional information obtained from multiple external information sources -, -, . . . -K, in determining the current state of the managed system  within the situational state space.","A given situation classification result provided by the classifier  may comprise additional related information, such as an urgency indicator, a completeness indicator, or other indicator reflecting a characteristic of the result. Alternatively, such indicators may be considered part of the situation classification result. A given situation classification result may comprise one or more elements of an associated classification scheme, such as \u201cheavily loaded\u201d or \u201clightly loaded\u201d in a two-level loading classification, or a vector of values indicating a particular position in a situational state space. The term \u201csituation classification result\u201d as used herein is therefore intended to be broadly construed, and may comprise, for example, a multidimensional vector of classification.","In determining appropriate management actions relating to managed system  responsive to situation classification results from the classifier , the system management tool  may also take into account additional information available to the system management tool. This additional information may comprise, for example, local information available internally to the system management tool  as well as a \u201cmash-up\u201d or other combination of information obtained from a plurality of information sources -, -, . . . -L that are located external to the system management tool.","Although the system elements ,  and  are shown as separate elements in , these elements or portions thereof may be implemented at least in part on a common processing platform. In other embodiments, one or more of the system elements ,  and  may each be implemented on a separate processing platform, such as the processing platform to be described below in conjunction with . For example, the classifier  comprising situational analysis framework  may be implemented on a first processing device of a first processing platform and the system management tool  may be implemented on a second processing device of a second processing platform. It is also to be understood that a given embodiment of the system  may include multiple instances of the elements ,  and , although only single instances of such elements are shown in the system diagram for clarity and simplicity of illustration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["104","104","120","120","130","1","130","2","130","150","1","150","2","150","104","120","120","104"]},"As shown in , the cloud infrastructure  comprises virtual machines (VMs) -, -, . . . -N implemented using a hypervisor . The hypervisor  is an example of what is more generally referred to herein as \u201cvirtualization infrastructure.\u201d The hypervisor  runs on physical infrastructure . The cloud infrastructure  further comprises sets of applications -, -, . . . -N running on respective ones of the virtual machines -, -, . . . -N under the control of the hypervisor .","Although only a single hypervisor  is shown in the example of , a given embodiment of cloud infrastructure configured in accordance with the invention may include multiple hypervisors, each running on its own physical infrastructure. Portions of that physical infrastructure might be virtualized.","An example of a commercially available hypervisor platform that may be used to implement portions of the cloud infrastructure  in one or more embodiments of the invention is the VMware\u00ae vSphere\u2122 which may have an associated virtual infrastructure management system such as the VMware\u00ae vCenter\u2122. The underlying physical infrastructure  may comprise one or more distributed processing platforms that include hardware products such as Celerra\u00ae or CLARiiON\u00ae, both commercially available from EMC Corporation of Hopkinton, Mass. A variety of other storage products, such as VNX and Symmetrix VMAX, both also from EMC Corporation, may be utilized to implement at least a portion of the cloud infrastructure .","The situational analysis framework  of classifier , the situational analysis framework  of system management tool , or one or more of the situational analysis frameworks  of the tenants  may each be configured in the manner shown in . In this example, situational analysis framework  of classifier  is more specifically shown as comprising a learning module  coupled to a production module . Other components of the situational analysis framework  include situational state space , policy sets , and objective functions . The learning module and the production module both have access to the situational state space , policy sets , and objective functions . The classifier  interfaces with the system management tool  and the managed system  via interfaces .","The classifier  in this embodiment further comprises a processor  coupled to a memory . The learning and production modules  and  of the situational analysis framework  may be implemented in whole or in part in the form of one or more software programs stored in memory  and executed by processor . Accordingly, the memory  may be viewed as an example of what is more generally referred to herein as a \u201ccomputer program product\u201d having executable computer program code embodied therein. The computer program code when executed in a processing device implementing the situational analysis framework  causes the device to perform situation classification operations as disclosed herein.","It is to be appreciated that the classifier  may comprise other modules or components in addition to those specifically shown in . For example, the classifier may provide various other service interfaces, as well as security or other types of functionality within the system .","Although  specifically illustrates the situational analysis framework , the situational analysis framework  of system management tool  and\/or the situational analysis frameworks  associated with respective tenants  of cloud infrastructure  may each be implemented in a similar manner.","In other embodiments, different types of situational analysis frameworks may be implemented in different system components. For example, the policy sets  of the situational analysis framework  may be eliminated as policy-based actions in the present embodiment are undertaken by policy engine  in system management tool  based on situation classification results provided by the classifier . The frameworks , however, may continue to include policy sets particular to the respective tenants .","Additional details regarding the operation of situational analysis frameworks that may be implemented in embodiments of the present invention can be found in the above-cited U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/639,668, Ser. No. 13\/071,926, Ser. No. 13\/077,376, and Ser. No. 13\/166,128.","Exemplary situational analysis frameworks disclosed in one or more of the above-cited patent applications may be configured to learn what policy settings are best, possibly by maximizing an objective function, for situations in a specified multidimensional situation space, and to apply these policies in production. Policies may set operating parameters of an associated system, and may also or alternatively suggest how management operations should be staged, split, deferred, or approved based on factors such as user experience levels, operation log mining, and situation recognition. Furthermore, policies may be set or recommended as a system management service.","In information processing system  of , situation classification is performed separately from policy determination and application. As noted above, situation classifications are performed by the classifier , and may be performed periodically or as triggered by events. Situation classifications results are then exported to the system management tool  for possible action which may also take into account a \u201cmash-up\u201d or other combination of information from the multiple external sources .","It should be noted that the system management tool  may itself include an instance of a situational analysis framework, possibly implemented within the policy engine . In such an arrangement, the situational analysis framework of the system management tool may, for example, receive the situation classification results from the classifier , and may make policy decisions or other management operation decisions based entirely or partially on a combination of the incoming situation classification results, its own internal knowledge, and inputs from other mashed up sources such as the external sources .","An arrangement of the type shown in  advantageously allows current situation classifications to be exported from the classifier  to the system management tool , which balances those results with its own knowledge about incoming hints on future activity to make policy and setting changes that affect operations of the managed system . This provides a much broader context in which to consider and make changes, and also gives more control to the system management tool, as compared to having its own situational analysis be solely responsible for setting policies in the managed system.","The present embodiment therefore substantially expands the range of dimensional metrics that may be used by the system management tool . This range may include local conditions or pertinent information known to a variety of other management tools. The disclosed techniques allow these multiple system management tools to cooperate with one another in a loosely-coupled manner through the situation classification results provided by the classifier . Thus, potentially suboptimal unilateral decisions based solely on situational analysis performed within the system management tool  are avoided.","It should therefore be apparent that the classifier  can provide its situation classification results to multiple system management tools, thereby improving the operation of all of the corresponding managed systems. A given management tool or associated managed system can subscribe to the situation classification results using, for example, a software as a service (SaaS) model. This turns the classifier  into a supplier of potentially valuable situation classifications for loosely-coupled system management tools that may be setting policies or taking other management actions. As indicated previously, these system management tools may each base policy decisions on their own local knowledge as well as the situation classification results from the classifier .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["120","300","305","1","305","2","305","3","162","1","162","2","162","3"]},"The virtual appliances and the virtual machines  are implemented using virtualization infrastructure  which illustratively comprises VMware\u00ae ESX clusters as well as associated servers, file systems and process management elements, and may also include additional virtualization products from other vendors.","The virtual appliances -, - and - comprise minimal operating systems -, - and - and run single applications -, - and -, respectively. The minimal operating systems  utilized for the licensing virtual appliances  more particularly comprise respective JeOS instances, where JeOS denotes \u201cJust enough Operating System.\u201d The virtual machines -, - and - each comprise sets of multiple applications and a corresponding full operating system -, - or -. The physical infrastructure  in this embodiment comprises banks of computers, servers or other processing devices generally denoted by reference numerals  and .","It is to be appreciated that the particular arrangements of cloud infrastructure elements shown in  are presented by way of illustrative example only, and in other embodiments different arrangements of additional or alternative elements may be used. At least a subset of the elements may be collectively implemented on a common processing platform, or using separate processing platforms each comprising one or more computers, servers, storage devices, or other processing devices.","An example of such a processing platform is processing platform  shown in .","The processing platform  in this embodiment comprises a portion of the system  and includes a plurality of servers, denoted -, -, -, . . . -P, which communicate with one another over a network . One or more of the processing modules of system  may therefore each run on a computer, server, or other processing platform element. A given such element may be viewed as an example of what is more generally referred to herein as a \u201cprocessing device.\u201d As illustrated in , such a device generally comprises at least one processor and an associated memory, and implements one or more functional modules or other components for controlling certain features of the information processing system . Again, multiple ones of the processing modules of system  may be implemented by a single processing device in a given embodiment. Also, it should be noted that a given processing device may comprise one or more virtual machines.","The server - in the processing platform  comprises a processor  coupled to a memory . The processor  may comprise a microprocessor, a microcontroller, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other type of processing circuitry, as well as portions or combinations of such circuitry elements. The memory  may be viewed as another example of what is more generally referred to herein as a \u201ccomputer program product\u201d having executable computer program code embodied therein. Such a memory may comprise electronic memory such as random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM) or other types of memory, in any combination.","The computer program code when executed by a processing device such as the server - causes the device to perform functions associated with one or more of the modules of system , such as the system management tool , managed system  or classifier . One skilled in the art would be readily able to implement such software given the teachings provided herein. Other examples of computer program products embodying aspects of the invention may include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, or other storage devices, or suitable portions or combinations of such devices. In addition to storing computer program code, such storage devices will also generally be used to store data within system .","Also included in the server - is network interface circuitry , which is used to interface the server with the network  and other system components. Such circuitry may comprise conventional transceivers of a type well known in the art.","The other servers  of the processing platform  are assumed to be configured in a manner similar to that shown for server - in the figure.","The processing platform  shown in  may comprise additional known components such as batch processing systems, parallel processing systems, physical machines, virtual machines, virtual switches, storage arrays, storage volumes, etc. Again, the particular processing platform shown in the figure is presented by way of example only, and system  may include additional or alternative processing platforms, as well as numerous distinct processing platforms in any combination.","Also, numerous other arrangements of computers, servers, storage devices, virtual machines or other processing devices are possible in the information processing system . Such devices can communicate with other elements of the information processing system  over any type of network, such as a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), a satellite network, a telephone or cable network, or various portions or combinations of these and other types of networks.","The operation of the system  will now be described in greater detail with reference to .","Referring initially to , a process of classifying situations for system management is shown. The process includes steps  through , and is implemented in the information processing system  of .","In step , the classifier  monitors trajectory in a situational state space having dimensions that characterize \u201cglobal\u201d operating conditions of the managed system . These global operating conditions may be high-level operating conditions that would not otherwise be apparent to the system management tool  based on its current scope of view, as will be described in conjunction with .","In step , the classifier  generates a situation classification result based on the current state of the monitored trajectory in the situational state space.","In step , the classifier  provides the situation classification result to the system management tool , possibly via an API as previously noted. The classifier may provide the situation classification result to the system management tool in response to an explicit request received from the system management tool.","In step , the system management tool  automatically takes one or more management actions for the managed system  based at least in part on the situation classification result. It is also possible that, based on the received situation classification result, the system management tool may take no action. The determination in the system management tool  as to whether or not to take an action in response to a particular situation classification result may be based on an aggressiveness parameter, a decision threshold, a policy suggestion or other information. Such information may be part of or otherwise associated with the situation classification result, or separately maintained by the system management tool.","The process then repeats as the situational analysis framework  of the classifier  continues to monitor trajectory in the situational state space and to generate associated situation classification results for the system management tool .","It should be noted that the particular process steps shown in the flow diagram of  are presented by way of illustrative example only, and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way. For example, although the steps are indicated in the diagram as being performed serially, one or more of the steps may be performed in parallel with one another. Also, the ordering of the steps may be varied, and additional or alternative steps may be included.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B"],"b":["107","102","107","106","600","602","604","102","600","107","102","107"]},"In these and other configurations, the scope of vision  of the situational analysis framework  serves to significantly enhance the view of the system management tool  into high-level situations that can impact the performance of the managed system . The enhanced scope may be due to the situational analysis framework having better learning, more current information, better reasoning abilities, etc. relative to the system management tool alone. Accordingly, by basing its management actions relating to the managed system  at least in part on situation classification results provided by the situational analysis framework , the system management tool  can make better decisions regarding the establishment of operating policies or other parameters for the managed system, leading to improved performance in the managed system.","Additional examples will now be described to further illustrate the operation of the information processing system  of  in particular implementations.","As one additional example, the system management tool  may be assumed to comprise a QoS manager implemented in a cloud service environment of cloud infrastructure . The QoS manager in this example may be configured to adjust virtual resource scheduling in the cloud service environment in order to meet one or more service level agreements (SLAs) for the tenants , based on the situation classification results provided by classifier , possibly in combination with information characterizing individual tenants  and their associated virtual resources. The SLAs may relate to respective lines of service, such as performance, availability, security, etc.","The situational analysis framework  of classifier  in this example may have a broader view of tenant workloads, both current and projected. For instance, one tenant may have a history of rapid ramping up of workload at the end of every month, while another tenant may quiesce most activity when a new application is being deployed. The situational analysis framework  can communicate the overall situation as a service to the QoS manager, thereby complementing the QoS manager's view of the current state of the managed system. The QoS manager is therefore able to consider a wider range of strategies, such as deferring workload, or ramping up resources in anticipation of near-term demand, through an enhanced and more nuanced view of the current situation obtained by interaction with the situational analysis framework  of the classifier .","As another example, the information characterizing individual tenants  and their associated virtual resources may be processed by a mash-up application before being combined with one or more of the situation classification results from the classifier . The management action taken by the system management tool  in such an arrangement may comprise delivering one or more situation classification results to the separate situational analysis frameworks  associated with respective ones of a subset of the tenants  as identified by the system management tool  based on the result of the situation classification operation in combination with the information characterizing individual tenants  and their associated virtual resources.","More particularly, in a multi-tenancy environment such as that illustrated in , a system event may be detected pertaining to a particular cloud infrastructure component such as a storage array. The event may pertain to a pending storage failure like a capacity utilization warning or a pending hardware failure. A mash-up application may be used to compare the resource identified with the event against a mapping of particular ones of the tenants  to particular resources in order to determine which tenant(s) may be impacted by the situation associated with the event. For each tenant that is so identified, the corresponding tenant-specific situational analysis framework  may be notified regarding the event. The tenant-specific situational analysis framework  then determines the appropriate policy to follow. This may involve determining a particular modality, such as SMS, email, page, etc. that will be used to notify a tenant-specific administrator.","As yet another example, the system management tool  may comprise a data migration manager implemented in a tiered storage environment of the cloud infrastructure . The data migration manager may be configured to control migration of data among tiers of the tiered storage environment based on the situation classification results provided by the classifier , possibly in combination with information relating to one or more searches previously performed in the tiered storage environment.","In an arrangement of this type, the situational classification could be monitoring a digital preservation system that includes a primary disk array backed by an archival object store. Ingested data is initially stored on the primary disk array along with metadata about what is getting preserved. Policies implemented in a policy engine of the data migration manager control migration of data between the fast disk array and the slower object store. Given a situational classification of this configuration, the data migration manager can combine the situation classification with hints emanating from recent metadata searches made by digital curators in order to more effectively move digital content between the primary disk array and the archival object store.","Thus, for instance, a digital curator may have been recently researching the Cuban Missile Crisis when the disk array capacity begins to fill up. This situation, and the meta-data search hints, can cause the policy engine to \u201cstage-out\u201d content that is unrelated to the Cuban Missile Crisis (e.g., content from the beginning of the Kennedy presidency) while pre-fetching images, videos and documents that were relevant to the crisis. Likewise, a situation in which the replication link of an object store is broken may cause the policy engine to enable disk array replication on incoming scanned content and then prevent the migration to the object store until the situation is fixed.","The techniques of the present invention may be implemented in numerous other types of system management tools, and in a wide variety of other processing applications.","As indicated previously, situation classification functionality such as that described in conjunction with the flow diagram of  and one or more of the other examples described herein can be implemented at least in part in the form of one or more software programs stored in memory and executed by a processor of a processing device such as a computer or server. A memory having such program code embodied therein is an example of what is more generally referred to herein as a \u201ccomputer program product.\u201d","It should again be emphasized that the above-described embodiments of the invention are presented for purposes of illustration only. Many variations may be made in the particular arrangements shown. For example, although described in the context of particular system and device configurations, the techniques are applicable to a wide variety of other types of information processing systems, processing devices and information technology infrastructure arrangements. Numerous other alternative embodiments within the scope of the appended claims will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIGS. 1B and 1C","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
