title: Ring-tone messaging service
abstract: An improved system and method to provide important information either, as voice, text, picture, holographic image or video from the calling party to a called party before the called party answers a telephone. The information may be a live or recorded voice, text, image or video message. The calling party may send a voice message, for example, and send it along with a call set-up message. The voice message may be recorded beforehand, recorded as part of the dialing process, or sent live before the call is answered. Instead of the called party's telephone ringing, the recorded voice message is played or the real-time data/bearer stream is heard. The called party hears the voice message instead of the ring tone normally heard when there is an incoming telephone call. If the telephone is not answered, the calling party is sent to voicemail or mms-storage system, where the calling party is given the option to record a voice message which may or may not include the original recorded or live voice message sent along with the call set-up message. Alternatively if the called party has a follow me service, the other contact numbers are attempted as directed in the user preferences before sending the calling party to voicemail. If the calling and called party have telephones, such as mobile phones, IP phones, IP softphones, PDA with telephony capabilities, etc., which allow for multimedia messages such as text, images and video messages, the calling party's recorded voice message may include text, images or video.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention is directed generally to telephony services and specifically to providing a message to a called party before the called party answers a call, where the message is used to initiate the call to the called party.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0003","num":"0002"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["1","1","30","20","10","50","60","50","30","20","10","40","40","10","30"]},"In , the calling party initiates a call over the PSTN  using either a wireline telephone  or wireless telephone . In this example, the call is routed solely through the PSTN  to the remote end where the called party may be using either a wireline  or wireless telephone . If the called party does not answer the call but pays for voice mail  service as part of their communications bill, the call is diverted to voice mail .","In , the calling party may initiate a call over the PSTN  using either a wireline telephone  or wireless telephone . Similarly, the calling party may initiate a call over the Internet  using a H.323 terminal or the session initiation protocol (SIP) telephone . H.323\/SIP terminals include IP telephones  or IP softphones . An IP telephone provides communications capability as analog or digital telephones provide except that communications are routed via the Internet or data network rather than via PSTN. An IP softphone  is a client-based telephony application for the desktop PC  or laptop  that has similar functionality as a desktop IP telephone .","At the remote end, the private branch exchange (PBX)  is a telephone system that supports enterprise users (college, government office, business, etc.) by answering and transferring inbound and outbound telephone calls to and from the PSTN  or Internet . All enterprise users share external telephone lines, i.e., trunk lines , which saves the cost of requiring a line for each user to the telephone company's central office (CO) (not shown but part of the PSTN ). PBXs  have evolved from being proprietary hardware\/software systems completely separate from the packet switched network or LAN  to systems running on off-the-shelf servers, interoperable with other servers through open standards and communicating via the LAN . Furthermore, the PBX  has evolved from strictly routing local and long distance telephone calls over the PSTN  to additionally providing the capability to route local and long distance telephone calls over the Internet  or over the LAN . The PBX  operating on packet switched networks allow the enterprise to reduce costs by maintaining one network instead of two (the data and telephone) and reducing charges from toll calls by routing some calls over the packet switched network  or Internet .","As shown generally in , B, C and  when a call is initiated using a wireless telephone  or a wireline telephone , ,  from outside or within an enterprise and sent via the PSTN , the calling party  dials the telephone number which is transmitted to the nearest central office (CO) (part of PSTN , ) along with a call set-up message (, ). The local exchange CO comprises one or more carrier class switches (not shown), which take calls and routes the calls to the proper destination based on the dialed number. If the call is a long distance call, the call goes from the local CO to a long distance carrier's class switch on route to the local CO nearest the called party. The call set-up message (, ; , ) for a call sent over the various switches is governed by standards, which are particular to the network in use.","As shown in , the local CO (which is part of the PSTN ) locates the remote end-point  using the dialed telephone number. Once the CO locates the remote end-point , the CO sends a call set-up message to the remote end-point  as shown in . If the remote endpoint  is on and not busy (, ), an alerting (ringing) signal is sent back to the CO and the CO forwards the alerting (ringing) signal  to the calling party . The alerting signal tells the calling party the remote endpoint  has not answered the call. As shown in , once the called party goes off-hook, i.e., answers the telephone, the telephone at the remote endpoint (, ) sends a call-connect message (, ) to the CO. The CO forwards the call-connect message  to the calling party (, ). Now the two endpoints will begin transmitting voice or data between them over the PSTN (, , ). A call termination message is sent by either the calling party or called party to disconnect, i.e., terminate the call (, , , , ; , ).","As shown in , the remote endpoint maybe unavailable to answer the call. That is, the telephone is turned off, not connected, or busy, or the called party simply does not answer the call (, ; , ). In this case, if the called party does not have a \u201cfollow-me\u201d service (, ), the call is diverted to a multi-media message storage system (e.g., voice mail system) and the call is answered by the multi-media message storage system (, , , ). Once the calling party records the voicemail message (, ), the calling party terminates the call (, , , , ).","If the called party has a \u201cfollow-me\u201d service (, ), the CO diverts the call to a pre-defined next location (, ) and tries to contact the called party at each \u201cfollow-me\u201d number administered for called party. If the called party is not available at any of the \u201cfollow-me\u201d numbers, the CO diverts the call to a multi-media storage system .","For IP desktop telephones (, ) or softphones (, ) sending calls via the Internet, using session initiation protocol (SIP) or H.323 protocol, the messages sent between the end-points to establish a call and set-up a communication channel are governed by the particular protocol in use. Regardless, the called party at the remote end-point is alerted to an incoming call by a standard ringing signal if the IP end-point is available (, ). Once the call is answered by the called party, the appropriate establishment and connection messages (, ) are sent via the Internet or over the data network. Otherwise the call is similarly diverted to a pre-defined next location (, ), such as a \u201cfollow-me\u201d number as administered in the service preferences, or a voice mail system (, ).","Unfortunately, neither wireline or wireless telephone systems or even paging services currently allow the calling party to send a recorded or real-time data\/bearer stream including voice, text, images or video attached to a call set-up message to initiate a telephone call and to provide information to the called party before the called party answers the telephone. For example, mobile phones enabled to send and receive SMS or MMS, the short message service (SMS) protocol allows mobile users to send short text messages and the multimedia message service (MMS) protocol allows mobile users to send multimedia messages. SMS also allows a mobile user to send short text messages to and receive text messages from email, paging services or informational services (such as receiving stock quotes). MMS adds images, text, audio clips and video to SMS messages. However, both SMS and MMS messages are not delivered in real time and hence cannot initiate a telephone call.","The mobile switch center (not shown) sends SMS messages to a mobile message service center (not shown). If the mobile phone user is available, the SMS message is immediately deliverable to the recipient and the mobile message center sends the message to the recipient. Otherwise, the message is stored in the mobile message service center until the mobile user is available.","The mobile switch center (not shown) sends MMS messages to a mobile message service center (not shown). The message service center sends the sender a message confirmation that the message was sent. The message service center then sends the recipient a message notification that a new message has arrived. The recipient can download the message immediately or later. Once the recipient has successfully downloaded the message, the sender gets a message delivered confirmation message.","For mobile phones that use polyphonic ring tone technology, the mobile telephone user can download various high quality tones and administer their user preferences to play a particular tone when a particular incoming call arrives. Alternatively, the mobile telephone user can record their voice and administer their user preferences to play the recording of their voice when a particular person is calling or for any incoming call. Note, these polyphonic ring tones are administered and recorded by the called party mobile telephone owner to play when a call is received from a calling party.","Current voice paging systems associated with telephones are typically used in a facility to broadcast messages to locate individuals or announce messages, such as emergencies or sales. When the paging system is used to locate individuals, the individual still needs to call back the person who initiated the page. The person initiating the page cannot use the paging system to initiate a telephone call to locate an individual. The person initiating the page cannot send a real-time data\/bearer stream attached to a call set-up message to initiate a call and alert a called party before the called party answers the call.","These and other needs are addressed by the various embodiments of present invention. The present invention generally forwards from a calling communication device to a called communication device a multi-media message from the first user of the calling communication device. The called communication device plays the message to the second user of the called communication device before the call is answered by the second user (or before a bi-directional communication path is established between the first and second users).","In a first embodiment of the present invention, a called party is alerted using a recorded or live voice, text, picture, holographic image or video multi-media message from the calling party. The calling party may send a voice message, for example, and attach it as a Multimedia Message Service or MMS message to a call set-up message or send it as a text-message, such as a Short Message Service or SMS message, and convert it into an audible message at the called communication device using text-to-speech conversion techniques. The message may be recorded beforehand, recorded as part of the dialing process, or sent \u2018live\u2019 instead of having the standard ring tone playing at the remote endpoint's telephone or communication device. The message may, for instance, be used to alert the called party to the caller's identity and provide additional, important information to the caller before the caller answers the call. The call maybe sent via the PSTN, an IP network such as the Internet or over a data network. Of course, if the calling and called party endpoints (i.e., telephones or other communication device) allow for text, images and video, the recorded or real-time data\/bearer stream sent with the call set-up message to initiate the call may include text, images or video in addition to voice.","Hence if a calling party has an important message and wants to grab the attention of the called party who may not otherwise answer the telephone, the present invention will provide the called party with the important message without the called party answering the call. For example, if a calling party knows that the called party is driving and cannot answer the call, the calling party may record a voice message or send a real-time data\/bearer stream, such as \u201cDear get some milk and bread on your way home tonight.\u201d Alternatively, the calling party wants to grab the attention of the called party, who may be near to the telephone to hear the ring, but is ignoring the standard ring tone. In this case, the calling party may record a voice message or send a real-time data\/bearer stream, such as \u201cDear I apologize for starting the fight last night.\u201d The remote endpoint replies with an alerting message and plays the recorded message before the call is answered. Hence, the called party will hear the message instead of the standard ring tone normally heard when there is an incoming telephone call. The called party may answer the call or allow the call to divert to voice mail. When the called party answers, the standard call connect messages are sent as defined by the particular network protocol.","When the message is sent \u201clive,\u201d a real-time data\/bearer stream attached to a call set-up message may be sent, for example, over the PSTN to the CO. When the calling party endpoint receives the alerting message from the CO, the calling party endpoint opens a bearer channel, i.e., a channel that carries voice communications. Now the calling party begins to speak and the remote endpoint plays this live voice on its speaker. The called party hears the live voice and answers the call. Once the call is answered, the normal call connect messages are sent as defined by the particular network protocol.","The remote endpoint may be unavailable, i.e., the endpoint is not connected, shut-off, currently on another call or not answering the incoming call. In this case, the calling party call is diverted to a pre-defined next location, such as a \u201cfollow-me\u201d number as administered in the called party service preferences, or the call is diverted to a voice mail system.","If the call is diverted to voicemail, the calling party is given the option to record a voicemail message. The voicemail message maybe an entirely new recording or include the recorded or real-time data\/bearer stream (buffered by the PSTN, Internet, or data network) sent along with the call set-up message to initiate the call.","In a second embodiment of the present invention, the called party may administer a special introductory ring tone on his telephone or communications device to play when the called party receives a recorded message or real-time data\/bearer stream from a calling party. After the special introductory ring tone plays, the recorded message or the real-time data\/bearer stream plays before the called party answers the call. This special introductory ring tone may be administered to play for any calling party or for a particular calling party.","In yet another embodiment, when the called party endpoint is not available because the endpoint is busy, the recorded message or real-time data\/bearer stream may be sent attached to a call-waiting signal. Where the called party hears the recorded or real-time data\/bearer stream instead of the standard call-waiting signal.","In a further embodiment, the calling party and called party endpoints may publish and exchange information regarding multimedia capabilities. Once the endpoint multimedia capabilities are known, the calling party endpoint allows the calling party to record or send a live voice, text, image, or video message attached to a call set-up message to the called party.","In another embodiment, the calling party may decide not to make a new recording each time the calling party calls a particular person. For example, the calling party may use a standard recording most times the calling party calls their spouse.","The embodiments of the present invention can offer advantages over the prior art. By way of example, the present invention can convey valuable information to a callee or increase the likelihood of the callee answering the pending call. Although ring-tones and polyphonic ring-tones are currently in use, the ring-tones are unable to convey a voice message from the caller to the callee. Assigning a specific ring to a user (or user group) does not contain dynamic information relevant to the pending call only. Paging and multimedia message services can provide voice messages to a user but the user must thereafter initiate a separate call to the messaging party, possibly incurring the costs of the call. Moreover, the receiving party, unlike the present invention, must actively press a button to view the multi-media message service message.","As discussed previously, , B and C are examples of three different network communication configurations. These network communication configurations are adaptable to enable the ring message service (RMS) agent, which includes a client and server software. The RMS agent is an application programming interface (API) that communicates with the underlying network through function calls to perform its function. The RMS agent enables the communication network to provide important information either, as voice, text, image or video from a calling party to a called party before the called party answers a telephone. The RMS agent (client or server) interfaces with the various components of the communications network, such as the communication device, to recognize two forms of message, the ring tone message (RTM), or live-RMS. The RMS agent allows the calling party to choose whether to record a RTM or send a live-RMS message attached to a call establishing message, such as, a call set-up message. To adapt these network communication configurations to enable the ring tone message service (RTMS) several changes are required to various components of the network communications configurations. The communication networks include the PSTN , IP network , mobile switch center (not shown), etc.","To RTMS enable the calling or called party endpoint communication devices, the RMS agent client (, ) is stored in the calling and\/or calling party communication device (, ). The communication devices include wireless , satellite phones (not shown) or personal digital assistant (PDA) with telephony capability (not shown), wireline , such as analog , digital , ISDN , IP telephones , IP softphones , etc. The communication devices may embed the RMS agent client  as software stored in a storage device such as memory, flash card or hard-disk drive. Alternatively, the RMS agent client  may be incorporated in firmware or hardware. To facilitate the recording and storage of the RTM message or buffering of the live RMS message, the communication device  may use memory, flash card, or a hard-disk storage device. In the called party communication device , the RMS agent client  receives the RMS packet interfaces with the called party communication device  to play the RMS message.","The RMS agent client  interfaces with the RMS agent server logic  embedded in software residing in the communication network, such as the CO  () to allow a calling party to send and a called party to receive RMS messages. Alternatively, the RMS agent server  may be incorporated in firmware or hardware. As shown in , communication device  communicates and interfaces with the RMS agent server  residing in CO  carrier class switch ,  memory  and in long distance carrier switch  memory . Alternatively, the RMS agent server  may reside, for example in other storage devices such as a flash card (not shown) or hard-disk storage device (not shown) on the CO  carrier switch ,  or long distance carrier switch .","The RMS agent client , for example, instructs the communication device  to store a RTM voice message in memory, i.e., a recording of a voice message beforehand or recording of a voice message as part of the dialing process. At the called party endpoint, the RMS agent client  plays the RTM voice message over the speaker before the called party answers the call instead of the called party endpoint playing the standard ring tone. If the called party endpoint  includes multimedia capability, the RMS agent client  interfaces with the communication device memory  to buffer and play any multimedia components of the RTM message.","Alternatively, the RMS agent client  may instruct the communication device  memory  to buffer a live RMS voice message as it is sent to the called party before the called party answers the call. The called party communication device , receives the live-RMS voice message. The called party communication device RMS agent client  buffers in memory  the received live voice message and plays the message over the speaker before the call is answered. If the calling party additionally sends text, images or video and the called party endpoint  includes multimedia capability, the called party endpoint RMS agent client  interfaces with the endpoint memory  to buffer the received live RMS multimedia components. The RMS agent client  also interfaces with the called party endpoint  to play the live RMS multimedia components.","The RMS agent client  may also create the RMS message, i.e., RTM message or the live-RMS message that is attached or associated with a call set-up message. RMS messages are subject to the same rules governing quality of service for the voice channel, such as conversion of an analog signal to a digital signal at the CO , PBX , or Gateway ; encryption; echo cancellation, etc. Otherwise, if the communication device  does not include the RMS agent client , the communication device  interfaces with the RMS agent server  logic to create the RMS message. Likewise, RMS messages created by the RMS agent server  are subject to the same rules governing quality of service for the voice channel.","Some mobile phones  are multimedia messaging service (MMS) capable which allows the mobile telephone user to send and receive images, text, audio and video in a message. In an alternate embodiment, the calling party and called party RMS agent client  may negotiate endpoint multimedia capabilities. If both endpoints are MMS capable but the network ,  is not capable of handling RMS messages with multimedia components, the RMS agent client  on both endpoints may agree to record a multimedia message as an MMS message rather than as a RMS message with multimedia components. In this case, the calling party endpoint will send the called party, a call establishment message, such as a RMS Call Set-up message (, ). The MMS data is recorded (, ) and sent (, ) after the endpoints exchange and negotiate multimedia capabilities (, ). Although the network  is identified as the Internet in , C, and B, it is to be understood that the network can be any data network and may employ protocols other than the Transfer Control or Internet Protocols.","Similarly, some mobile phones  are short message service (SMS) capable which allows the mobile telephone user to additionally send and receive alphanumeric messages from mobile subscribers, email, paging and voice mail systems. If the calling party and called party RMS agent client  negotiate endpoint capabilities, both endpoints are SMS capable but the network ,  or device  is not capable of handling a RMS text message, the RMS agent client  on both endpoints may agree to send the SMS message rather than convert the message to an RMS message with a text component. In this case, the calling party endpoint will send the called party, a call establishment message, such as a RMS Call Set-up message (not shown). The SMS message is sent after the endpoints exchange and negotiate multimedia capabilities. At the called party end, the SMS text message can be displayed on the mobile communication device  or a text-to-speech converter may be used to convert the text to speech for the mobile user.","In some cases, a communication device  may not be economically retrofitted to store the RMS agent client  or have sufficient memory to record or store an RTM message, or buffer a live RMS message. Additionally a calling or called party communication device may have the capability to receive and send voice but not the capability to receive one or More other multimedia components. In this case, a computer (not shown) that is integrated with the communication device  may be used to store the RMS agent client  in the computer's storage device, such as memory, flash card, or hard-disk storage. Similarly, the computer (not shown) associated with the communication device may be used to record and store the RTM message or buffer a live RMS message in the computer's storage device, such as memory, flash card, or hard-disk storage.","Alternatively, when the communication device  does not include the RMS agent client  or have sufficient memory to record or buffer an RMS message, the calling party  may purchase an RMS service plan from their local telephone company. This provides the calling party the same benefits a calling party has if they had a RMS enabled communication device  or at a minimum the capability to send a RTM voice message or live RMS voice message. The calling party may still administer the RMS service, at a minimum record and store a RTM voice message or buffer a live RMS voice message using the local network facilities .","To use this service plan, the calling party  may have an account requiring them to authenticate themselves with an account name and password. Once successfully authenticated, the calling party is presented menu options to allow the calling party to choose the RMS type of message they want to send that is, a RTM or live RMS message. For example, if the calling party chooses to send a RTM message, menu options will allow the calling party to record, delete a recorded message, or store an RTM message and dial the telephone number of the called party. If the calling party chooses to send a live RMS message, the calling party would choose the menu option that allows the calling party to dial the telephone number of the called party and to record and buffer a live RMS message. The calling party may respond to the menu options using dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) keys from the telephone keypad or voice recognition services.","In an alternative embodiment, the communication device  may be capable of receiving and sending voice, text, images, and video. However, the calling party or called party may not have the capability to retrofit the communication device  to record or store a multimedia RTM message, or buffer a live RMS multimedia message. In this case, the calling or called party  may purchase an RMS service plan from their local telephone company to administer the RMS service, record or store a RTM multimedia message or buffer a live RMS multimedia message using the local network facilities . The account may require the calling or called party to authenticate themselves with an account name and password. Once successfully authenticated, the calling party is presented menu options to allow the calling party to choose the RMS type of message they want to send that is, RTM or live RMS message. For example, if the calling party chooses to send a multimedia RTM message, menu options will allow the calling party to record, delete a recorded message, or store an RTM message and dial the telephone number of the called party. If the calling party chooses to send a live RMS multimedia message, the calling party would choose the menu option that allows the calling party to dial the telephone number of the called party and buffer a live RMS multimedia message. As previously mentioned, the calling party may respond to the menu options using dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) keys from the telephone keypad or voice recognition services.","The RMS agent client  has administrable features. For example, the called party may administer the RMS agent client  in the called party communication device . One administerable feature maybe whether to play the RTM once or even repeatedly before the called party answers the call. This administered parameter may be for an RTM received from any calling party or from a specific calling party. Hence, an RTM from a family member may be administered to play repeatedly whereas an RTM from the boss is played only once. Alternatively, the called party may administer this feature from his account on a RMS service plan provided by the local telephone company. Another administrable feature is to disable playing the RTM completely (e.g., repeatedly from family members, once from the boss, and never from the bank manager).","The called party may administer the RMS agent client  to record and store a special introductory ring tone on the communications device  to play when the called party receives a RTM or live RMS message. The RMS agent client  may play this special introductory ring tone before playing the RMS message from any calling party or from a specific calling party. Rather than the called party communication device  playing the standard ring tone for an incoming call. After the special introductory ring tone plays, the RTM or the live RMS message plays before the called party answers the call. Alternatively, the called party may administer this feature from his account on a RMS service plan provided by the local telephone company.","Some mobile telephones  play polyphonic ring tones. In this case, the RMS agent client  interfaces with the software, firmware or hardware that selects, records and plays the polyphonic ring tone. The called party may be allowed to administer the polyphonic ring tone to play as the special introductory ring tone on the communications device  prior to playing the RTM or live RMS message. Rather than the called party communication device  playing the standard ring tone for an incoming call.","In an alternative embodiment, the calling party may administer the RMS agent client  to use a previously recorded RTM stored in the communication device  memory  when calling a particular person. This allows the calling party to select a previously recorded RTM when the calling party dials a particular person. For example, the calling party may use a previously recorded RTM when calling their spouse to remind them to pick up the clothes from the dry cleaners.","Alternatively if the calling party has an RMS service plan, the previously recorded RTM may be stored on network facilities, such as in CO  carrier class switch ,  memory  or in long distance carrier switch  memory . This allows the calling party to select a previously recorded RTM when dialing a particular person. As the calling party may administer the communication device , the calling party may administer the RMS agent server  to associate the previously recorded RTM to a called party when dialing the called party.","In another alternative embodiment, the calling party may administer the RMS agent client  or RMS agent server , if the calling party has an RMS service plan, to determine whether the called party endpoint is not available because the endpoint is busy. If the called party endpoint is not available because the endpoint is busy and the called party uses a call waiting service, the RMS agent may attach the RMS message to a call-waiting signal. In this case, the called party hears the recorded or real-time data\/bearer stream instead of the standard call-waiting signal.","In another alternative embodiment, the calling party and called party endpoints may administer a feature that allows the RMS agent client  to exchange information regarding multimedia capabilities. The RMS agent server residing in the CO  memory  or long distance carrier switch  memory  is administered to assist in the exchange of information between endpoints. Once the calling party RMS agent client  knows the called party communication device  multimedia capabilities, the RMS agent client  may prevent the calling party from sending inappropriate multimedia components to the called party.","However, the called party communication device may have an associated resource, such as text-to-speech (TTS) or automatic speech recognition (ASR), residing, for example, on an associated computer. The associated computer may have an associated monitor. If the called party device is not capable to receive text or speech, the TTS or ASR resource may convert a multimedia component as administered by the called party. For example if the communication device is not text capable, the called party RMS agent client  will respond to the request for exchange of information and notify the calling party RMS agent client  that a text component in the RTM or live-RMS is receivable. The called party communication device  will not display the text. Instead, the called party RMS agent client  will interface with the TTS resource and convert the text-to-speech and play the speech to the called party before the called party answers the call. Alternatively, the called party communication device  may not display the text but the associated computer monitor will display the text.","Similarly if the communication device is not capable of playing speech, the called party RMS agent client  may respond to the request for exchange of information and notify the calling party RMS agent client  that a speech component in the RTM or live-RMS is receivable. The called party communication device  will not play the received speech. Instead, the called party RMS agent client  will interface with the ASR resource and convert the speech to a transcript of the speech and display the transcript to the called party before the called party answers the call.","To RMS enable communication networks, such as the PSTN , Internet , or mobile switch center (not shown), the RMS agent server  interfaces with the network specific protocols used in the PSTN , Internet  or mobile switch center (not shown) to establish a RMS call and ensure the components of the RMS message are recognized and associated with the RMS call. As shown in , the RMS agent server  is located in the CO  carrier class switch ,  memory  or in the long distance carrier switch  memory .  shows a communication network that routes a call from the PSTN  to the Internet  to save on long distance toll charges. At the remote end, the call is routed to the PSTN  to the called party. In this case, a RMS agent server  additionally resides on the near and remote end Gateway  memory . The RMS agent server  ensures the RMS message is routed with the call through the Internet to the appropriate Gateway  and PSTN  at the remote end. For a wireless communication network, the RMS agent server may reside in memory within the mobile switch center (not shown). To RMS enable the enterprise communication network as shown in , the RMS agent server (not shown) resides in PBX  storage device, such as memory, flash card, or hard disk-drive (not shown).","There is no requirement the RMS agent server ,  is stored in memory, hence the RMS agent server ,  may be stored in a storage device, such as flash card or a hard-disk drive. Alternatively, the RMS agent server ,  may be incorporated in firmware or hardware.","To facilitate the recording of the RTM message or buffering of the live RMS message until the called party answers the call, the PSTN , Internet , or data network  may include storage devices such as additional memory, flash card, or hard-disks. If the call is forwarded to the follow-me service, the RMS agent server ,  interfaces with the network specific protocols to ensure the RTM or live RMS message is temporarily stored on the network during the period the follow me service is dialing other contact numbers administered in the called party's preferences. If the call is diverted to voicemail, the RMS agent server ,  interfaces with the network specific protocols to ensure the RTM or live-RMS message is temporarily stored on the network until the calling party terminates the connection with the multi-media message storage system .","The RMS agent server ,  interfaces with the network specific protocols to allow the RTM or the live-RMS to be sent and received in-band, i.e., within the same channel (e.g., time slot or connection), as the signaling information. When required the RMS agent server ,  interfaces with the network specific protocols to allow the RMS message be sent out-of-band, i.e., a different channel (e.g., time slot or connection) is used for signaling and voice transmission. For those communication network protocols in the PSTN  that require out-of-band signaling, the RMS agent server ,  interfaces with the network specific protocol to open a short lived bearer (i.e., voice) channel between the calling party endpoint and PSTN . Additionally, the RMS agent server ,  interfaces with the network specific protocol to open a short lived bearer (i.e., voice) channel between the PSTN  and the called party endpoint to send the RTM or live-RMS to the called party. Otherwise, if the voice and signaling information are sent within the same channel, i.e., in-band, the RMS agent server ,  interfaces with the network specific protocol software to include the RTM or live-RMS message as part of the call set-up message.","For an Internet - or data network, such as a LAN (, ), call establishment messages are control messages and are not sent together with the voice transmission, i.e., this is out-of-band signaling. In this case, the RMS agent in the PBX (not shown) interfaces with the Internet Protocol (IP) call establishment messages to ensure the IP network recognizes the additional separate packets containing the RTM voice message or live-RMS voice data.","To RMS enable the multi-media message storage system (, B, ), the multi-media message storage system includes the RMS agent client logic  stored in memory . Of course, the RMS agent client  may be stored in other storage devices, such as a flash card or hard-disk space. The multi-media message storage system  includes the storage facility, such as hard-disk space to store RTM or live RMS voice messages along with RTM or live RMS multimedia messages.","The RMS agent client  assists the multi-media message storage system  operational software and hardware (not shown) to recognize RMS messages, such as voice or multimedia. Additionally, the RMS agent client  interfaces with the multi-media message storage system  operational software (not shown) to provide RMS menu options. These menu options provide the calling party the option to record a voicemail message without the RTM or live-RMS message, or record a voicemail message and include the RTM or live-RMS message as part of the voicemail message. If the voicemail message includes the RTM or live-RMS, the RMS agent client  interfaces with the multi-media message storage system  operational software (not shown) to receive and store the recorded RTM or live-RMS along with the voicemail message. Once the voicemail message is recorded, the called party is sent a notification that they have a new message in the multi-media message storage system .","When the called party retrieves the voicemail message, the RMS agent client  interfaces with the multi-media message storage system  operational software and provides the RMS retrieval menu options. One menu option may allow the called party to retrieve the RTM or live-RMS message separate from the voicemail message or as part of the voicemail message.","For consumers that use an telephone answering machine to record voicemail messages rather than pay for voicemail service from a communication service provider, the telephone answering machine may answer the call and simply record a voice message from the calling party. A RMS enabled telephone answering machine may buffer and store the RTM or live-RMS and record a new voice message from the calling party.","For mobile telephone users that have SMS or MMS enabled on their phones, the RMS agent server  on the mobile message service center (not shown) may convert the RTM or live-RMS message to an MMS message.
