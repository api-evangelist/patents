Goodman, Introduction to Fourier Optics, McGraw-Hill 1996.","In this invention a new method for optical security verification based upon phase encoded convolution of a primary image with a random phase code is proposed. The convolution of the primary image and the random code yields position-invariance to a possible shift of the primary image or the random code. In this method, a nonlinear joint transform correlator (JTC) verifies biometric information and the random code simultaneously to determine whether or not an object, such as an ID card, is authentic and thus whether the object is being used by an authorized person. The binarization of the phase information encoded on the input card is disclosed. A composite reference image, obtained from a set of rotated primary images and convolved with the random code, in order to obtain position and rotation-invariance, is used. The system tolerates rotational variations of the input images. The performance of the proposed method is investigated using a number of metrics. An optoelectronic architecture is proposed to perform the verification. The discrimination capability of the proposed method against unauthorized codes or unauthorized primary images is investigated in the presence of additive noise and distortions. The robustness of the proposed method in the presence of noise and distortions such as missing data is addressed.","The proposed method for security is based upon convolution of the primary image by a random code. The primary image f(x,y) is phase encoded, which can be mathematically represented by, exp[i\u03c0f(x,y)\/Max(f(x,y))]. The range of variation of the phase encoding is [0, \u03c0]. The phase-encoded primary image is convolved with a random code c(x,y). In this invention the random code c(x,y) is chosen to be the Fourier transform (FT) of a phase only uniform random distribution(M. Kowalczyk, \u201cSpectral and Imaging Properties of Uniform Diffusers\u201d, JOSA A, Vol. 1, No. 2, 192\u2013200, February 1984, which is incorporated herein by reference). With this choice of c(x,y) the invention is assured of having high light efficiency output. The resulting convolved image is a complex amplitude distribution:\n\n()=exp[()\/Max(())](),\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere  denotes convolution.\n","The convolved image r(x,y), will be placed on a card or the object to be verified. It will serve as the reference image to the optical processor. Therefore, the information encoded on the card is a combination of primary information f(x,y) and a machine code c(x,y). For additional security, the convolved pattern r(x,y), placed on the ID card or any personal document, can be made to be phase-only information by setting the amplitude of the complex distribution r(x,y) equal to one (S. Maze and Ph. Refregier, \u201cOptical Correlation: Influence of the Coding of the Input Image\u201d 33, 6788\u20136796 (1994); S. Maze and Ph.

A nonlinear JTC is more practical because of the limited dynamic range of optical devices. In addition, the nonlinear JTC offers many advantages in terms of correlation performances.

A nonlinear joint transform correlator is used to perform the correlation between the convolution of the phase encoded primary pattern and the random code mask and the phase distribution, recorded on the card given by Equation 2. In the Fourier plane of the nonlinear joint transform correlator, a threshold function, V(\u03b1, \u03b2) (), is used which is the sum of the self-product terms of the joint power spectrum. A k-th-power-law nonlinearity (0\u2266k\u22661) is applied to the modified joint power spectrum in the Fourier plane (B.

An inverse Fourier transform of the nonlinearly transformed joint power spectrum will generate the nonlinear joint transform correlator output plane.

The k-th law nonlinear JTC in the Fourier plane is defined by: |RS|exp[j\u03c6\u2212j\u03c6], where |R|exp[j\u03c6] and |S|e|exp[j\u03c6] are the Fourier transforms of the reference image and the input image, respectively.

The proposed system allows for the digital storage, transmittal, and decryption of the encrypted data. One benefit of the proposed system compared with electronic encryption techniques is that optical processing provides many degrees of freedom for securing information. Another benefit is that optical encryption is naturally suited to encrypting information, e.g., real images and information stored in holographic media, that exists in the optical domain. Either optical or computer decryption techniques can be used with the proposed system, depending on the specific application. Computer decryption is less secure because the phase key is stored electronically, but no manual focusing adjustment is required and the decryption system is more compact.","Let f(x,y), a(x,y), and H(\u03be,\u03b7) denote an image to be encrypted, an input random phase mask, and a Fourier random phase mask, respectively. The input random phase mask, a(x,y), is bonded with the image f(x,y). The resultant product of the two images is Fourier transformed and is multiplied by the Fourier phase mask H (\u03be,\u03b7).

The optical system  consists of two arms. In one arm, the convolution of a secondary image such as the phase encoded primary pattern exp {i#(x,y)\/Max[f(x,y)]} and the random code, c(x,y), is performed by use of a spatial filter matched to the random code c(x,y), and positioned in the Fourier, or (u,v) plane. Light  is projected by beam expander  and collimating lens  at a spatial light modulator (SLM) . The phase-encoded primary pattern is displayed by means of the spatial light modulator (SLM) . Fourier transform lens L, images the Fourier transform (FT) of the phase-encoded primary pattern, F(u,v), in the Fourier, or (u,v), plane. The processor  has an a-priori knowledge of the random code mask c(x,y). Thus, in the (u,v)-plane, a filter  with transmission C(u,v) is placed. C(u,v) is the Fourier transform of the random code c(x,y). Lenses Land L(, ), image the complex amplitude distribution, formed at the filter plane, onto the (\u03b1,\u03b2)-plane, where a detector  is placed. Thus the Fourier transform of the convolution between the two functions exp[i\u03c0f(x,y)\/Max(f(x,y)] and c(x,y) is obtained in (\u03b1,\u03b2)-plane. In the other arm, an object, whose authenticity is to be verified and including a reference image such as the phase only distribution, (x\u2032,y\u2032), is placed in the input plane (x\u2032,y\u2032) of the processor . Light  is projected by beam expander  and collimating lens  at  to a beam splitter . Coherent light  from the beam splitter  illuminates the reference image  from a card . Lens L images (at ) the Fourier transform of (x\u2032y\u2032) onto the (\u03b1,\u03b2)-plane of the detector . Thus, a joint power spectrum is obtained in (\u03b1,\u03b2)-plane. The joint transform interference intensity is recorded by the detector  and is nonlinearly transformed by a nonlinear threshold function generator  in the verification subsystem . The resulting modified joint transform spectrum  is inverse Fourier transformed  and the modulus thereof squared to obtain the correlation at  of the primary image and the reference image. The correlation signal  may be obtained at  either by performing optical Fourier transform by displaying the modified intensity distribution written on the SLM, or by using discrete Fourier transform.","It will be appreciated to one skilled in the art that the aforedescribed system  for verifying the authenticity of an object is not limited to an optical system but also encompasses electronic systems as well as combinations thereof.

The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.","Thus, a new method and system for security verification of objects such as a credit card or an ID card, using optical pattern recognition has been shown. This method is based on phase encoded convolution of the primary pattern with a random code placed on the card. An optical system to perform the verification has been described. The correlation is performed using a nonlinear joint transform correlator (JTC). For the images presented here, the proposed method can identify an authorized input by producing well defined output peaks, and it rejects the unauthorized input with a high discrimination ratio. The performance of the system in terms of input noise, biometric rotation, and missing data has been investigated. For the tests provided here, the proposed system is found to be robust to noise added to the input primary pattern and to the reference pattern encoded on the card. Nonlinear correlation allows a compromise between the noise tolerance and the discrimination ratio. The tests using missing data show that, for the fingerprint image used in the simulation, the system provides good tolerance up to 25% of missing data in the input primary pattern and that the security verification of the authorized input is highly discriminate against the unauthorized inputs. A rotation invariant composite reference primary pattern is designed to provide tolerance to rotation of the input primary image. Binarization of the phase information encoded on the card has been tested. The results indicate that the verification is obtained with high discrimination ratio of authorized inputs against unauthorized inputs.","An image security method and system that uses digital holography has also been presented. This method allows the encrypted data to be stored, transmitted, and decrypted digitally. Optical experiments have been shown to illustrate the proposed method. The system can be used for secure video storage and transmission."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 5C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 5D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 6C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 6D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 8C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 8D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 9B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 9C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 9D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 11A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 11B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 11C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 11D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 12A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 12B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 15A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 15B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 15A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 15A","FIG. 15B"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
