{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Today, more than ever, people are interested in monitoring and tracking their food intake and, in particular, trying to ensure that their dietary habits are in line with various general health recommendations. In addition, millions of people have one or more conditions, illnesses, or diseases, which require them to closely scrutinize and monitor all food they consume and minimize their intake of certain elements and types of food.","However, one of the more difficult challenges facing anyone trying to monitor and control their food and nutrient intake is the challenge of a trying to eat in a healthy, and\/or prescribed, manner when eating outside the home, i.e., when dining\/eating out. Given that many people are regularly forced to eat outside the home due to time constraints, travel, convenience, and social needs, the challenge of trying to eat \u201cright\u201d while dining out is very real and often encountered on an almost daily basis.","Recently, restaurants, fast food establishments, and other providers of food items, have begun printing the nutritional information associated with their menu, or other food offerings, on the menu, or food product itself, and\/or on handouts or displays provided at the food offering facilities. However, for the average person, deciphering and then keeping track of this printed\/visual nutritional information is often extremely time-consuming and difficult. This is particularly true when, as noted above, many people utilize restaurants and fast food establishments on a frequent basis so that a running or cumulative tracking of the printed\/visual nutritional information, often from multiple establishments\/sources, is required in order to obtain a realistic indication of how healthy the person is actually eating.","The situation is problematic enough for relatively \u201chealthy people\u201d who can often choose to ignore their food intake on occasion, or even for extended periods of time. However, for millions of people having various health conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, allergies, heart disease, etc., ignoring their food intake, even occasionally, is not an option and, in some cases, can be quite dangerous.","Despite the desire, and in many cases the very real need, for people to relatively closely monitor their food intake, and even though many establishments\/food providers do provide printed\/visual nutritional information for their food offerings, there is currently no simple and efficient way for a consumer to accurately, and in relative real time, obtain data indicating the nutritional information associated with food offerings and then determine, based on the nutritional information, if the food offerings are in line with the consumers desired, and\/or mandated\/prescribed, nutritional requirements and\/or limitations.","What is needed is a method and system that allows users to capture printed and\/or visual nutritional information associated with food offerings\/items and then automatically compare that nutritional information with the nutritional and\/or dietary requirements and\/or limitations of the particular user.","In accordance with one embodiment, a method and system for image based nutrition monitoring includes a process for image based nutrition monitoring whereby, in one embodiment, data indicating a user's desired, and\/or mandated\/prescribed, dietary guidelines and\/or restrictions is obtained from one or more sources. In one embodiment, when the user is frequenting a restaurant, fast food establishment, supermarket, or any other establishment for obtaining food, an optical image of printed or visual nutritional information associated with the food item the user is contemplating purchasing\/eating is obtained via one or more user computing systems. In one embodiment, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is used to transform the printed\/visual nutritional information contained in the optical image into discrete nutritional information data. The nutritional information data is then analyzed and compared with the data indicating the user's desired, and\/or mandated\/prescribed, dietary guidelines and\/or restrictions. In one embodiment, based, at least in part, on this analysis and comparison, and, in one embodiment, on data indicating the users recent nutritional\/food intake, a recommendation is made to the user as to whether the contemplated food item is a good\/acceptable purchase for the user, and\/or whether the user should eat\/purchase the food item. In one embodiment, the user is additionally provided with advice regarding limitations on future food purchases, and\/or intake, which should be considered if the contemplated food item is indeed consumed.","In one embodiment, the method and system for image based nutrition monitoring discussed herein utilizes readily and commonly available image capture technology, such as a camera function on a mobile phone, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, to capture printed nutritional information regarding contemplated food purchases and transform the printed nutritional information into usable nutritional information data that can be analyzed by one or more processors associated with one or more computing systems. The nutritional information data so obtained is then processed and compared with data representing the individual nutritional desires\/needs of the user by one or more processors so that the user can easily, efficiently, and semi-automatically, track their nutritional intake and obtain dietary advice that is consistent with the users specific nutritional and\/or dietary requirements, and\/or dietary limitations.","As a result, the method and system for image based nutrition monitoring discussed herein provides users the ability to easily and efficiently maintain healthy eating habits in virtually all circumstances, including in situations when the user dines out and\/or is in the store contemplating a food purchase.","As discussed in more detail below, using the below embodiments, with little or no modification, there is considerable flexibility, adaptability, and opportunity for customization to meet the specific needs of various healthcare consumers under numerous circumstances.","Common reference numerals are used throughout the FIG.s and the detailed description to indicate like elements. One skilled in the art will readily recognize that the above FIG.s are examples and that other architectures, modes of operation, orders of operation and elements\/functions can be provided and implemented without departing from the characteristics and features of the invention, as set forth in the claims below.","Embodiments will now be discussed with reference to the accompanying FIG.s, which depict one or more exemplary embodiments.
