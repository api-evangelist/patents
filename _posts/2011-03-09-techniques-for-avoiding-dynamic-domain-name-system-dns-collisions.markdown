In some instances, these Internet users may utilize the domain resolution services and content filtering services offered by the ISPs. In other instances, these Internet users may utilize the domain name resolution services and content filtering services offered by other third party providers. Accordingly, as the amount of Internet users associated with private networks increases, the amount of Internet users that utilize the domain name resolution services and content filtering services provided by the same ISP or third party provider also increases. As a result, an increased amount of domain name system (DNS) (e.g., dynamic DNS) collisions may occur.","In view of the foregoing, it may be understood that there may be significant problems and shortcomings associated with current dynamic DNS technologies.","Techniques for avoiding dynamic domain name system (DNS) collisions are disclosed. In one particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as a method for avoiding dynamic domain name system (DNS) collisions comprising: storing a first location associated with a first client device, a second location associated with a second client device, and a third location associated with a network, receiving, from the first client device, a first notification indicating an Internet Protocol (IP) address via the network, receiving, from the second client device, a second notification indicating the IP address via the network, determining a most likely owner of the network between the first client device and the second client device based on the first location, the second location, and the third location, and applying a content filtering policy associated with

exemplary embodiment, the second client device may be visiting an area associated with the third location.","The present disclosure will now be described in more detail with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof as shown in the accompanying drawings. While the present disclosure is described below with reference to exemplary embodiments, it should be understood that the present disclosure is not limited thereto. Those of ordinary skill in the art having access to the teachings herein will recognize additional implementations, modifications, and embodiments, as well as other fields of use, which are within the scope of the present disclosure as described herein, and with respect to which the present disclosure may be of significant utility.","An Internet user may establish a private network (e.g., a home network) at a primary location (e.g., a home) using one or more services provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). In addition, the Internet user may initiate the receipt of domain name resolution services, content filtering services, or a combination of both, from the ISP or a third party provider. As a result, a Domain Name System (DNS) agent (e.g., a dynamic DNS agent) may be installed on a primary client device located at the primary location to provide a backend server (e.g., a server associated with providing domain resolution services, a server associated with providing content filtering services) with the latest Internet Protocol (IP) address assigned to the primary client device (or private network).","In addition, the Internet user may establish a content filtering policy for the primary location. For example, a content filtering policy may allow all content to be accessed via the private network. In another example, a content filtering policy may restrict access to malicious content (e.g., websites containing malware) via the private network. In another example, a content filtering policy may restrict access to pornographic content (e.g., websites with pornographic content) via the private network. In yet another example, a content filtering policy may restrict access to all content via the private network. To ensure that the proper content filtering policy is enforced, the backend server may maintain an association between the content filtering policy and the latest IP address assigned to the primary client device (or private network).","In certain instances, however, a visiting client device (e.g., a client device that temporarily visits the primary location) with the same dynamic DNS agent may provide the same current IP address provided by the primary client device. As a result, the backend server may not know whether to attribute the current IP address provided to the primary client device or the visiting client device. If, for example, the backend server attributes the current IP address to the visiting client device, any content filtering policy associated with the visiting client device may be applied to the private network.","In one embodiment, certain techniques for avoiding such dynamic DNS collisions are provided. In such an embodiment, during a dynamic DNS account activation stage (e.g., a registration stage), the backend server may receive the current IP address associated with (e.g., assigned to) the primary client device of the Internet user. The backend server may then locate the IP address on the Internet using trace routes, triangulation, an IP address geolocation, or any other mechanism for identifying a location associated with an IP address. Once a location is determined, the backend server may verify that the location and the IP address are not associated with any other dynamic DNS account associated with (e.g., stored by) the backend server. If verified, the backend server may store the location in the Internet user's dynamic DNS account as the primary location. Accordingly, the primary location associated with a dynamic DNS account may be static, while the IP address associated with the dynamic DNS account may be dynamic.","As a result of applying such techniques, the dynamic DNS collision described above may be avoided as follows. When a visiting client device with the same dynamic DNS agent provides the same current IP address provided by the primary client device, the backend server may attribute the current IP address to the client device that is most likely to own the private network (e.g., the client device that most likely belongs to the primary location). Accordingly, once the same current IP address is received from the visiting client device and the primary client device, the backend server may access the primary location associated with the dynamic DNS account of the user of the visiting client device and the primary location associated with the dynamic DNS account of the user of the primary client device. The backend server may then determine whether the visiting client device or the primary client device is the most likely owner of the private network by comparing the primary locations accessed.","In one embodiment, the backend server may determine whether the visiting client device or the primary client device is the most likely owner of the private network by comparing primary locations accessed to the primary location of the private network. In such an embodiment, a client device associated with a primary location that is within a reasonable distance from the primary location (e.g., within the same area code, within 500 yards, within the same zip code) of the private network may be considered the most likely owner of the private network. As a result, the backend server may attribute the current IP address to the client device that is considered to be the most likely owner of the private network.","In another embodiment, the backend server may determine whether the visiting client device or the primary client device is the most likely owner of the private network by comparing a distance between the primary location of the visiting client device and the location associated with the current IP address to a distance between the primary location of the primary client device and the location associated with the current IP address. If, for example, the distance between the primary location of the primary client device and the location associated with the current IP address is shorter than the distance between the primary location of the visiting client device and the location associated with the current IP address, the backend server may consider the primary client device to be the most likely owner of the private network and attribute the current IP address to the primary client device. As a result, the backend server may apply the content filtering policy associated with the primary client device. Accordingly, enforcement of the content filtering policy of the private network may not be interrupted by the presence of a visiting client device at the primary location of the private network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","100","110","120","140","140","200","110","120","140","140","150","140","160","1","140","160","1","140","142","144","146","146","140","140","170","170","180","1","140","140","110","120","150","140","190","120","122","124","126"]},"With reference to computer system  of , modem , network interface , or some other method may be used to provide connectivity from one or more of client  and client  to network .

As a result of each storing the same type of dynamic DNS agent and the second client device roaming to the private network of the primary location, the first client device may provide a current IP address assigned to the private network of the primary location to server A and the second client device may also provide the current IP address assigned to the private network of the primary location to server A.","If, for example, server A associates the current IP address with the first client device, the proper content filtering policy defined by the user of the first client device may be enforced on the private network. If, however, server A associates the current IP address with the second client device, any content filtering policy associated with the second client device may be improperly enforced on the private network.","To resolve such a dynamic DNS collision, the priority determination module  may attribute the current IP address to the client device that most likely owns the private network (e.g., the client device that most likely belongs to the primary location, the client device that is associated with a user that most likely owns the private network). Accordingly, once the same current IP address is received from the first client device and the second client device, the priority determination module  may access a primary location associated with the dynamic DNS account of the user of the first client device and a primary location associated with the dynamic DNS account of the user of the second client device. The priority determination module  may then determine whether the first client device or the second client device is the most likely owner of the private network by comparing the primary locations accessed.","In one embodiment, the priority determination module  may determine whether the first client device or the second client device is the most likely owner of the private network by comparing the primary locations accessed to the primary location of the private network.
