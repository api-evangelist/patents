The invention also relates to synthetic methods for preparing the compounds.","Cancer is a class of diseases that affects people world-wide. Generally, cells in a benign tumor retain their differentiated features and do not divide in a completely uncontrolled manner. A benign tumor is usually localised and non-metastatic.","In a malignant tumor, cells become undifferentiated, do not respond to the body's growth control signals, and multiply in an uncontrolled manner. Malignant tumors are generally divided into two categories: primary and secondary. Primary tumors arise directly from the tissue in which they are found. Secondary tumors may be originated from the primary tumors or may be originated elsewhere in the body, and are capable of spreading to distant sites (metastasizing) or metastasis. The common routes for metastasis are direct growth into adjacent structures, spread through the vascular or lymphatic systems or blood streams.","Tumor metastases are the major cause of mortality in cancer patients. There is compelling evidence that angiogenesis is clinically relevant to the progression and metastasis of cancer. Angiogenesis consists of several steps: the basement membrane degradation, endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and capillary tubule formation. New capillary vessels recruited by tumors deliver nutrients and oxygen into a growing tumor, and remove catabolites and carbon dioxide. Diseases associated with abnormal angiogenesis require or induce vascular growth. For example, corneal angiogenesis involves three phases: a pre-vascular latent period, active neovascularization, and vascular maturation and regression. The identity and mechanism of various angiogenic factors, including elements of the inflammatory response, such as leukocytes, platelets, cytokines, and eicosanoids, or unidentified plasma constituents have yet to be revealed.","This activity is also required for metastasis. One of the important early events in the development of the metastatic phenotype is the induction of genes involved in angiogenesis such as VEGF and other proteins which are released from tumor cells and affect their microenvironment. Cancer cells produce the excess of proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor), There are seven members of the VEGF family including VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E, VEGF-F and placental growth factor. VEGF act specifically through tyrosine kinase receptors VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. The key molecule is VEGF-A (also referred to below as \u2018VEGF\u2019), induces angiogenesis by promoting proliferation, sprouting, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells. VEGF-A is one of the most potent facilitators of angiogenesis in cancers. VEGF binds to VEGFR-1 and activates the signalling through PI3K-Akt kinases and thus leads to increase in survival and migration. On the other hand, it induces the PLC activity by activation of c-src followed by interaction with VEGFR-2. It has been shown that VEGF expression is associated with metastatic capability in cancer. VEGF may induce disease progression by directly affecting the cell cycle components to accelerate cell proliferation. Metastasis is a very complex process, which occurs through a series of sequential steps including the invasion of adjacent tissue, intravasation, transport through the circulatory system, arrest and growth in a secondary site.","Clinical studies clearly show that tumor cells can undergo a period of dormancy followed by the rapid growth during the relapse. Homing of cancer cells to specific organs remains largely unknown. In carcinomas, the initial step of metastatic dissemination includes the detachment of epithelial cells from the extracellular matrix and disruption of actin cytoskeleton to achieve the round shape. The movement of migrating cells in tissue microenvironments requires proteolytic remodelling of the extracellular matrixes (ECM). The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) protein family members play an important role in ECM remodeling and cell invasion. The MMPs are zinc dependent endopeptidases that play multiple roles in biology of ECM, such as release of cryptic fragments and neo-epitopes from ECM macromolecules, release of growth factors and modification of the cell-ECM interface. Most MMPs are secreted proteins: however six of them are membrane proteins. The major function of MMPs is degradation of structural components of the ECM and directly or indirectly migration of cells. Degradation of extracellular matrix not only promotes migration, but also releases the essential growth factors from the matrix storage. Interestingly, MMPs contribute to the vessel remodeling by degradation of type I collagen, regulation of perivascular cells and VEGF processing. The changes of tissue architecture after release of MMPs are due to cleavage of E-cadherins and desmogleins. The expression and interaction of MMPs and TIMPs appear to be involved in invasion and metastases capacity of various cancers.","Several different types of cancer affect the world-wide population, for example those described hereinafter. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent cancers and a leading cause of cancer related-death worldwide. Incidence of prostate cancer has significantly increased world-wide (Jemal A, Siegel R, Ward E, at al., Cancer statistics, 2006. CA: a cancer journal for clinicians 56: 106-130, 2006; Yin M, Bastacky S, Chandran U, Becich M J and Dhir R: Prevalence of incidental prostate cancer in the general population: a study of healthy organ donors; The Journal of urology 179: 892-895, discussion 895, 2008). Despite recent advances in early diagnosis and treatment, PCa remains the second most lethal cancer in men in the Western World (Jemal et al., ibid, Yin et al., ibid).","Initially, the majority of prostate cancers are responsive to androgen ablation therapy, but most of the tumors eventually will progress to the androgen-refractory state (Gronberg H: Prostate cancer epidemiology. Lancet 361: 859-864, 2003). Once prostate cancer becomes hormone-refractory, cancer cells may rapidly gain the ability to invade and to metastasize to lymph nodes and distant organs (Kalluri R: Basement membranes: structure, assembly and role in tumour angiogenesis. Nature reviews 3: 422-433, 2003).","Tumor metastases are the major cause of mortality in cancer patients. Approximately one-third of treated patients will relapse and no curative treatment currently exists for metastatic disease (Yin et al., ibid; Gronberg H, ibid; Albertsen P C, Hanley J A and Fine J: 20-year outcomes following conservative management of clinically localized prostate cancer. Jama 293: 2095-2101, 2005; Society AC: Cancer Facts & Figures 2008. Atlanta, Ga., American Cancer Society, 2008). The progression from hormone-dependent to hormone-refractory and metastatic prostate cancer is poorly understood. Given the high prevalence of the disease, the aging of the population, and the lack of effective treatment for cancer metastasis, there is an urgent need to discover and develop novel therapeutic approaches.","Primary PCa is treated with hormonal therapy, which is aimed to suppress the androgen production and block androgen receptor (AR)-mediated proliferation and survival pathways. In advanced PCa, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay treatment. Surgical removal of the tumor and the use of hormone agonists or AR antagonists, such as flutamide, are the major types of ADT (DeMarzo A M, Nelson W G, Isaacs W B and Epstein J I: Pathological and molecular aspects of prostate cancer. Lancet 361: 955-964, 2003).","Docetaxel that targets the mitotic spindle and cell proliferation cycle is being used in advanced PCas. However, as a single agent, Docetaxel has modest activity. Current treatment of advanced metastatic cancer benefits from antiangiogenic drugs. Avastin\u2122, a VEGF inhibitor, targets angiogenic pathways for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer and has been tested in clinical trials (Di Lorenzo G, Figg W D, Fossa S D, et al: Combination of Bevacizumab and Docetaxel in Docetaxel-Pre-treated Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer: A Phase 2 Study. European Urology 54: 1089-1096, 2008). When Avastin\u2122 was used as a single agent or in combination with Docetaxel, the response rate was greatly improved. However, the side effects induced by Docetaxel and Avastin\u2122 may be severe, as the individual drug's toxicities are now combined to cause multiple adverse effects, in particular myelosuppression and heart failure (Friberg L E, Henningsson A, Maas H, Nguyen L and Karlsson M O: Model of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression with parameter consistency across drugs. J Clin Oncol 20: 4713-4721, 2002). In addition, the costs of these drugs are expensive.","Development of alternative treatments with minimal adverse effect and lower cost will therefore have great clinical and economical benefits.","The effective drug candidate for treatment of metastatic cancer should have the properties to target multiple cancer cell pathways including cell proliferation pathways, apoptosis pathways and angiogenesis signalling. High bioavailability for treatment of aggressive forms of cancer is also important.","The listing or discussion of an apparently prior-published document in this specification should not necessarily be taken as an acknowledgement that the document is part of the state of the art or is common general knowledge.","The compound etoposide is one that has been used in the treatment of various cancers. This compound contains a tetracyclic core, comprising a dioxolyl, tetrahydronaphthyl and tetrahydrofuranyl all fused in a series.","Heterocyclic compounds containing a pyrazinotetrahydro tetrahydroisoquinoline sub-unit, or variants thereof, are known for use as medicament, for example, as described in international patent application WO 98\/16526 and journal article Crescendi, Orlando, 1997247, 66-73.

Examples of such methods include substitutions, reductions, oxidations, alkylations, acylations, hydrolyses, esterifications, etherifications, halogenations or nitrations. Such reactions may result in the formation of a symmetric or asymmetric final compound of the invention or intermediate. The precursor groups can be changed to a different such group, or to the groups defined in formula I, at any time during the reaction sequence.

Standard deprotection reaction conditions include deprotection in the presence of acid (e.g. in the presence of HCl in a solvent, such as a polar aprotic solvent).","The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after a reaction in the above-mentioned schemes.","Protecting groups may be removed in accordance with techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art and as described hereinafter. For example, protected compounds\/intermediates described herein may be converted chemically to unprotected compounds using standard deprotection techniques.

According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of the invention, as hereinbefore (but without any provisos, where applicable), for use as a pharmaceutical. There is also provided a synthetic form of a compound of the invention (but without any provisos, where applicable), for use as a pharmaceutical.","For the avoidance of doubt, although compounds of the invention may possess pharmacological activity as such, certain pharmaceutically-acceptable (e.g. \u201cprotected\u201d) derivatives of compounds of the invention may exist or be prepared which may not possess such activity, but may be administered parenterally or orally and thereafter be metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention. Such compounds (which may possess some pharmacological activity, provided that such activity is appreciably lower than that of the \u201cactive\u201d compounds to which they are metabolised) may therefore be described as \u201cprodrugs\u201d of compounds of the invention.","By \u201cprodrug of a compound of the invention\u201d, we include compounds that form a compound of the invention, in an experimentally-detectable amount, within a predetermined time (e.g. about 1 hour), following oral or parenteral administration. All prodrugs of the compounds of the invention are included within the scope of the invention.","Furthermore, certain compounds of the invention may possess no or minimal pharmacological activity as such, but may be administered parenterally or orally, and thereafter be metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention that possess pharmacological activity as such. Such compounds (which also includes compounds that may possess some pharmacological activity, but that activity is appreciably lower than that of the \u201cactive\u201d compounds of the invention to which they are metabolised), may also be described as \u201cprodrugs\u201d.","Thus, the compounds of the invention are useful because they possess pharmacological activity, and\/or are metabolised in the body following oral or parenteral administration to form compounds which possess pharmacological activity.","Compounds of the invention (as hereinbefore defined but without the proviso(s)) may be useful in the treatment of a cancer. By \u201ccancer\u201d, we mean any disease that arises from an uncontrolled growth of cells (e.g. uncontrolled division), invasion (e.g. direct growth into adjacent tissue) or metastasis. By \u201cuncontrolled growth\u201d, we include an increase in the number and\/or size of cancer cells (also referred to herein as \u201cproliferation\u201d). By \u201cmetastasis\u201d we mean the movement or migration (e.g. invasiveness) of cancer cells from a primary tumor site in the body of a subject to one or more other areas within the subject's body (where the cells can then form secondary tumors). Thus, in one embodiment the invention provides compounds and methods for inhibiting, in whole or in part, the formation of secondary tumors in a subject with cancer.","Advantageously, the compounds of the invention may be capable of inhibiting the proliferation and\/or metastasis of cancer cells selectively.","By \u201cselectively\u201d we mean that the compounds of the invention may inhibit the proliferation and\/or metastasis of cancer cells to a greater extent than it modulates the function (e.g. proliferation) of non-cancer cells. Preferably, the compounds of the invention inhibit the proliferation and\/or metastasis of cancer cells only.","Compounds of the invention may be suitable for use in the treatment of any cancer type, including all tumors (non-solid and solid tumors). The cancer type may include (but is not limited to) benign tumors (such as hemangiomas, hepatocellular adenoma, cavernous haemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, acoustic neuromas, neurofibroma, bile duct adenoma, bile duct cystanoma, fibroma, lipomas, leiomyomas, mesotheliomas, teratomas, myxomas, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, trachomas and pyogenic granulomas) and malignant tumors (such as leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), prostate cancer, breast cancer, skin cancer, bone cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, cancer of the larynx, bladder, gall bladder, ovary, cervix, pancreas, rectum, parathyroid, thyroid, esophagus, adrenal, neural tissue, head and neck, colon, stomach, bronchi, kidneys, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of both ulcerating and papillary type, metastatic skin carcinoma, osteo sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, veticulum cell sarcoma, myeloma, giant cell tumor, small-cell lung tumor, non-small cell lung tumor, gallstones, islet cell tumor, primary brain tumor, acute and chronic lymphocytic and granulocytic tumors, hairy-cell tumor, adenoma, hyperplasia, medullary carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuronms, intestinal ganglioneuromas, hyperplastic corneal nerve tumor, marfanoid habitus tumor, Wilm's tumor, seminoma, ovarian tumor, leiomyomater tumor, cervical dysplasia and in situ carcinoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, malignant carcinoid, topical skin lesion, mycosis fungoide, rhabdomyosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, osteogenic and other sarcoma, malignant hypercalcemia, renal cell tumor, polycythermia vera, adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforma, leukemias, lymphomas, malignant melanomas, epidermoid carcinomas, and other carcinomas and sarcomas). Others that may be mentioned include cancers of the testis, genitourinary tract, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, keratoacanthoma, epidermoid carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, follicular carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, seminona, myeloid disorders, lymphoid disorders, hairy cells, buccal cavity and pharynx (oral), lip, tongue, mouth, small intestine, colon-rectum, large intestine, rectum, brain and central nervous system, Hodgkin's and leukaemia; hematopoietic tumors of lymphoid lineage, including leukemia, acute iymphocitic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell-lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma and Burkett's lymphoma; hematopoietic tumors of myeloid lineage, including acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome and promyelocytic leukemia; tumors of mesenchymal origin, including fibrosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma; tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system, including astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma and schwannomas; and other tumors, including melanoma, seminoma, teratocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, xeroderma pigmentosum, keratoxanthoma, thyroid follicular cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma.","In particular, compounds of the invention may possess potent inhibitory activity on the growth and invasion of hormone-refactory and aggressive human prostate tumors (for example, as may be shown in xenograft mouse models). It is particularly preferred therefore that the compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of aggressive cancers such as prostate cancer.","Compounds of the invention may reduce the rate of cell proliferation when tested in an assay using a PC-3 cancer cell line (e.g. obtained from ATCC). The compounds may thus possess a beneficial inhibitory effect on the ability of tumors of this type, and of cancers generally, to survive. The PC-3 cancer cell line has several properties that represent the hormone-independent and invasive prostate cancer. For instance, PC-3 cells lack functional androgen receptor (AR) signalling, grow rapidly in culture medium and can form large and very aggressive tumors when implanted into nude mice. Hence, the biological tests described hereinafter (e.g. PC-3 xenograft mouse models) provide a sound predication of the utility of the compounds tested by mimicking the gradual dissemination of prostate carcinoma cells in viva","Further, it has been reported that even the widely used cancer drugs such as Avastin\u2122 or Docetaxel alone or in combination had low inhibitory effect on PC-3 cells (Petrylak DP: Future directions in the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer. Urology 65: 8-12, 200538.2007; and Hung H: Bevacizumab plus 5-fluorouracil induce growth suppression in the CWR-22 and CWR-22R prostate cancer xenografts. Molecular cancer therapeutics 6: 2149-2157, 2007).","The compounds of the invention may target multiple cellular pathways that are associated with tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. The compounds of the invention may also affect other cancer pathways, such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.","The compounds of the invention may therefore be VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibitors, e.g. they may inhibit the expression of VEGF receptors including but not limited to VEGF and\/or VEGF receptor 2 (as may be shown in a test described herein). This may occur selectively, or, may be one of a plurality of the mechanisms by which the compounds of the invention act to treat cancer. The VEGF signalling pathway is known to be linked to tumor vascularisation and invasion, and hence compounds of the invention may possess anti-cancer effects by inhibiting angiogenesis (and may therefore be classed as anti-angiogenesis agents). In another embodiment of the invention therefore, the compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of a disease in which the inhibition of angiogenesis (and\/or VEGF) is desired and\/or required.","The term \u201cinhibition\u201d may refer to any measurable reduction and\/or prevention, which in the context of angiogenesis refers to the reduction and\/or prevention of angiogenesis (e.g. the expression of VEGF receptors including but not limited to VEGF and VEGF receptor 2). The inhibitory activity may be measured by comparing the angiogenesis inhibition in a sample containing a compound of the invention and (a) VEGF receptor(a), such as VEGF and\/or VEGF receptor 2, with an equivalent sample of in the absence of a compound of the invention. The measurable change may be objective (e.g. measurable by some test or marker, for example in an in vitro or in vivo assay or test, such as one described hereinafter, or otherwise another suitable assay or test known to those skilled in the art) or subjective (e.g. the subject gives an indication of or feels an effect).","Compounds of the invention are indicated both in the therapeutic and\/or prophylactic treatment of the above-mentioned conditions.","According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of treatment of a disease (e.g. cancer or another disease as mentioned herein) which may be associated with, or affected by, angiogenesis (and\/or VEGF; e.g. an inhibition of the expression of VEGF and\/or VEGF receptor 2) is desired and\/or required, which method comprises administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention but without the proviso(s), as hereinbefore defined, to a patient suffering from, or susceptible to, such a condition.","\u201cPatients\u201d include mammalian (including human) patients. Hence, the method of treatment discussed above may include the treatment of a human or animal body.","The term \u201ceffective amount\u201d refers to an amount of a compound, which confers a therapeutic effect on the treated patient. The effect may be objective (e.g. measurable by some test or marker) or subjective (e.g. the subject gives an indication of or feels an effect).","Compounds of the invention may be administered orally, intravenously, subcutaneously, buccally, rectally, dermally, nasally, tracheally, bronchially, sublingually, by any other parenteral route or via inhalation, in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form.","Compounds of the invention may be administered alone, but are preferably administered by way of known pharmaceutical formulations, including tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration, suppositories for rectal administration, sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral or intramuscular administration, and the like. The type of pharmaceutical formulation may be selected with due regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Such pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be chemically inert to the active compounds and may have no detrimental side effects or toxicity under the conditions of use.","Such formulations may be prepared in accordance with standard and\/or accepted pharmaceutical practice. Otherwise, the preparation of suitable formulations may be achieved non-inventively by the skilled person using routine techniques and\/or in accordance with standard and\/or accepted pharmaceutical practice.","According to a further aspect of the invention there is thus provided a pharmaceutical formulation including a compound of the invention, as hereinbefore defined but without the proviso(s), in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent and\/or carrier.","Depending on e.g. potency and physical characteristics of the compound of the invention (i.e. active ingredient), pharmaceutical formulations that may be mentioned include those in which the active ingredient is present in at least 1% (or at least 10%, at least 30% or at least 50%) by weight. That is, the ratio of active ingredient to the other components (i.e. the addition of adjuvant, diluent and carrier) of the pharmaceutical composition is at least 1:99 (or at least 10:90, at least 30:70 or at least 50:50) by weight.","The amount of compound of the invention in the formulation will depend on the severity of the condition, and on the patient, to be treated, as well as the compound(s) which is\/are employed, but may be determined non-inventively by the skilled person.","The invention further provides a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation, as hereinbefore defined, which process comprises bringing into association a compound of the invention, as hereinbefore defined, or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, amide, solvate or salt thereof with a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.","Compounds of the invention may also be combined with other therapeutic agents that may be useful in the treatment of a cancer and\/or a proliferative disease (e.g. another VEGF inhibitor as described herein). Compounds of the invention may also be combined with other therapies.","According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a combination product comprising:\n\n","Such combination products provide for the administration of a compound of the invention in conjunction with the other therapeutic agent, and may thus be presented either as separate formulations, wherein at least one of those formulations comprises a compound of the invention, and at least one comprises the other therapeutic agent, or may be presented (i.e. formulated) as a combined preparation (i.e. presented as a single formulation including a compound of the invention and the other therapeutic agent).","Thus, there is further provided:","(1) a pharmaceutical formulation including a compound of the invention, as hereinbefore defined but without the proviso(s), one or more therapeutic agent(s) that is useful in the treatment of cancer and\/or a proliferative disease, and a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier; and\n\n(2) a kit of parts comprising components:\n\n","The invention further provides a process for the preparation of a combination product as hereinbefore defined but without the proviso(s), which process comprises bringing into association a compound of the invention, as hereinbefore defined, or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, amide, solvate or salt thereof with the other therapeutic agent (or agents) that is (or are) useful in the treatment of cancer and\/or a proliferative disease, and at least one pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.","By \u201cbringing into association\u201d, we mean that the two components are rendered suitable for administration in conjunction with each other.","Thus, in relation to the process for the preparation of a kit of parts as hereinbefore defined, by bringing the two components \u201cinto association with\u201d each other, we include that the two components of the kit of parts may be:","(i) provided as separate formulations (i.e. independently of one another), which are subsequently brought together for use in conjunction with each other in combination therapy; or","(ii) packaged and presented together as separate components of a \u201ccombination pack\u201d for use in conjunction with each other in combination therapy.","Depending on the disorder, and the patient, to be treated, as well as the route of administration, compounds of the invention may be administered at varying therapeutically effective doses to a patient in need thereof. However, the dose administered to a mammal, particularly a human, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a therapeutic response in the mammal over a reasonable timeframe. One skilled in the art will recognize that the selection of the exact dose and composition and the most appropriate delivery regimen will also be influenced by inter alia the pharmacological properties of the formulation, the nature and severity of the condition being treated, and the physical condition and mental acuity of the recipient, as well as the potency of the specific compound, the age, condition, body weight, sex and response of the patient to be treated, and the stage\/severity of the disease.","Administration may be continuous or intermittent (e.g. by bolus injection). The dosage may also be determined by the timing and frequency of administration. In the case of oral or parenteral administration the dosage can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 10 g (e.g. 1000 mg) per day of a compound of the invention. For example, the dose range may be between 1 mg\/kg and 1000 mg\/kg (e.g. between 10 mg\/kg and 500 mg\/kg, preferably between about 20 mg\/kg and 200 mg\/kg) such as the does ranges employed in the mouse models described hereinafter.","In any event, the medical practitioner, or other skilled person, will be able to determine routinely the actual dosage, which will be most suitable for an individual patient. The above-mentioned dosages are exemplary of the average case; there can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.","Compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they target multiple pathways involving tumor growth, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastases. The compounds of the invention may also be effective angiogenesis inhibitors (and\/or VEGF inhibitors), i.e. they may (for example, selectively, or as one mode of action) inhibit angiogenesis (and\/or VEGF; e.g. they may inhibit the expression of VEGF and VEGF receptor 2).","Compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they may be more efficacious than, be less toxic than, be longer acting than, be more potent than, produce fewer side effects than, be more easily absorbed than, and\/or have a better pharmacokinetic profile (e.g. higher oral bioavailability and\/or lower clearance) than, and\/or have other useful pharmacological, physical, or chemical properties over, compounds known in the prior art, whether for use in the above-stated indications or otherwise.","For instance, compounds of the invention may be well tolerated by the patient, i.e. show less or no side effects (e.g. weight loss or other toxic side effects) for example as compared to other therapeutic agents. This may be the case even at high concentrations\/doses of the compounds of the invention. The compounds of the invention may also display good potency (e.g. better potency than other therapeutic agents) at a relatively or comparatively lower dose. Hence the compound of the invention may have a large therapeutic window.","The compounds of the invention may have advantages over other known chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. Avastin\u2122, Docetaxel and\/or Etoposide), which includes better potency and better safety profile (i.e. reduced side effects).

Prostate cancer xenograft mouse model was created by implanting hormone-independent PC3 tumor cells subcutaneously into athymic nude mice as previously described (Wegiel B, Bjartell A, Tuomela J, et al.: Multiple cellular mechanisms related to cyclin Al in prostate cancer invasion and metastasis. Journal of the National Cancer Institute 100: 10221036, 2008).","PC-3 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, V A) and cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum. PC-3 cells at 1\u00d710\/per mouse were used. The mice were divided into three groups (6 mice per group). The first group allowed tumors to grow between 170-400 mmin size before starting the treatment. The second group allowed tumors to grow between 550-650 mmin size before starting the treatment. The third group allowed tumors to grow between 700-800 mmin size before starting the treatment. The tumor diameters were measured twice weekly using calipers. The tumor volumes were calculated using an equation of a*(b2\/2) where a and b represent the length and width of the tumor, respectively.","The treatment of the compound of Example 1 (also referred to herein as \u201cSubstance X\u201d) or PBS containing 5% DMSO (vehicle) as Control was started when tumors reached the desired size as described above. In the first experimental setting, Substance X was administered intravenously once every other day. In the second experimental setting, Substance X was administrated orally once every other day. Tumor growth was assessed periodically as described in Results. The mice were sacrificed after treatment by euthanization via isofluorene inhalation. Lymph node, liver, lung, spleen and femurs were removed from each mouse. Half of the tumor tissues were used for histology and immunohistochemical analysis. For histology analysis, tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The sections were stained with hematoxylineosin (H&E) or imunohistochemical stained with antibodies and analyzed under an optical microscope. The other half of the tissues were used for protein analysis and thus were snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen. The body weights of the mice on the first and last day of the treatment were collected and compared. Tumor invasion and metastasis were examined in various tissues from the sacrificed mice.","For a comparison study, mice with tumors at 190-250 mmin size were treated with the cytotoxic drug Etoposide (Sigma) at a dose of 20 mg\/kg via IV injection once every other day. The tumor size was measured as described in the Results. Three mice were treated with Etoposide or the vehicle as Control. The mice were sacrificed and the tissues were collected as described above.","Basic Toxicity Study","For the assessment of toxicity of Substance X, healthy mice were treated with Substance X by intravenous injection at a dose of 100 mg\/kg or 200 mg\/kg once every other day for 13 days. Body weight of each mouse was measured periodically from Day 1 to Day 13 of the treatment. Cage-side observations including: mortality, moribundity, food consumption and activities were performed once every other day. Blood samples were taken on Day 1 and Day 13 for measurement of blood cell counts. To assess toxicity of Substance X on mice with tumors, mice bearing subcutaneous PC-3 tumors were treated with Substance X at a high dose of 200 mg\/kg once every other day for 19 days. Body weight was measured and cage-side observations were performed once every other day. Lymph node, liver, lung, spleen and femurs were removed from each mouse and were examined. Toxicity of Substance X was also assessed in tumor-bearing mice treated with 80 mg\/kg of Substance X daily as described above.","Immunohistochemistry and Quantification of Angiogenesis","Immunohistochemistry on tumor tissues was performed as previously described (Wegiel B, Bjartell A, Ekberg J, Gadaleanu V, Brunhoff C and Persson J L: A role for cyan AI in mediating the autocrine expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in prostate cancer. Oncogene 24: 6385-6393, 2005) by using antibodies to human CD-31 (Dako, Goistrup, Denmark A\/S). Antirabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied. Diaminobenzidine colorimetric reagent solution (Dako) was used. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). The specimens were viewed with an Olympus BX5I microscope at a magnification of 20\u00d7 or 40\u00d7. For analysis of tumor angiogenesis, tumor sections stained with antibody against CD3I were examined and quantified. Regions of high vascular density within the tumors were examined. The number of CD31-positive pixels per microscopic field was recorded. At least two sections per tumor and three views per section were determined.","Safety in Basic Toxicity Study","Basic safety study of Substance X was first performed on healthy mice without tumors to test if a high dose of 100 mg\/kg at once every other day regimen was safe. As shown in  A, there was no significant change in body weight throughout the 13 day treatment period with high dose of Substance X. The cage-side observations showed no abnormality on food consumption and daily activities, or any observable toxic effect for 13 days. Analysis of livers and kidney was conducted and no abnormality in histology in these organs could be detected (data not shown). These basic toxicity tests showed that Substance X is safe at a high dose in healthy mice.","The mice were treated with 200 mg\/kg of Substance X once every other day for a long period of time of 13 days. As shown in  B, the body weights of the tumor-bearing mice were steady throughout the study period. The cage-side observations showed no abnormality on food consumption and daily activities, or any observable toxic effect. Analysis of livers and kidney was conducted and no abnormality in histology in these organs could be detected (data not shown).","We then tested the high dose of Substance X in PC-3 xenograft mice, thereby mimicking its effect on prostate cancer patients. We generated mouse xenograft of human PC-3 tumors by subcutaneous implantation of tumor cells into nude mice. We further tested safety of the dose of 40 mg\/kg which generated significant anti-tumor activity in the xenograft mouse model. The daily treatment of tumor-bearing mice with this dose may suggest the safety of Substance X for cancer treatment. The body weights of tumor-bearing mice treated with Substance X daily for 30 days remained constant throughout the period of treatment (data not shown). The cage-side observations showed no abnormality on food consumption and\/or daily activities, or any other observable toxic effect. Analysis of livers and kidney was conducted and no abnormality in histology in these organs could be detected (data not shown).","Inhibition of Tumor Growth in Xenograft Animal Model","We created a prostate cancer xenograft mouse model to study the effect of Substance X on tumor growth and metastasis in viva Metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of each mouse to create a xenograft mouse model. When the tumors were grown to 190-240 mmin size, the mice were treated intravenously with Substance X at 20 mg\/kg or the vehicle as Control for 21 days. The tumors in the Control group treated with vehicle alone grew to exponentially large size after 21 days, while tumor shrank in the mice treated with Substance X. This suggests a significant inhibitory effect of Substance X on tumor growth in xenograft mice in viva","Inhibition of Tumor Growth and Invasion in Xenograft Mice with Large and Invasive Tumors","Next, we assessed the effect of Substance X on tumor growth and invasion in mice bearing larger tumors. We have previously found that PC-3 tumors grown into 400 mmin size could become metastatic and the tumor cells would invade into lymph node, liver or lung. To test if Substance X is able to control aggressive tumor growth, we allowed the tumor transplants to grow approximately 500-600 mmin size and then started to treat the mice with 40 mg\/kg Substance X or the solvent as Control by intravenous injection. While the large tumors in the Control group continued to grow rapidly, the tumors in the Substance X treated mice did not grow but showed a slight decrease in size on day 20 ().","We then tested the effect of Substance X on the large and invasive tumors for longer period of time. We divided the mice into two groups, one group was treated with 40 mg\/kg Substance X by intravenous injection for 30 days, while the other group was treated with Substance X by the same treatment regimen for 20 days. On day 21, the group 2 mice were treated with 40 mg\/kg Substance X by oral administration. The result showed that the tumor growth in Substance X treated mice was inhibited throughout the treatment period and the tumors shrank significantly at the end of the treatment. In contrast, the tumors in the Control group grew exponentially and became metastasized. In the second treatment group, the mice treated with Substance X by oral administration had slightly larger tumor size than the mice treated by continuous intravenous injection, suggesting that Substance X is orally bioavailable, yet the oral bioavailability is lower than intravenous injection. We performed histology and immunohistochemical analysis and no infiltration of tumor cells into secondary sites could be detected in any of these mice at the end of the study. In contrast, tumors in the Control mice were found to have metastasized into lymph nodes (data not shown).","We also treated the mice by oral administration of Substance X throughout the treatment period. As shown in , Substance X given to the mice via oral administration was able to inhibit the tumor growth, although the effect was not as strong as intravenous injection.","Comparison of Effect of Etoposide and Substance X on Tumor Growth in Xenograft Mice","To compare the effect of Substance X with a cytotoxic drug widely used to treat invasive tumors, we tested the effect of Etoposide at 20 mg\/kg by intravenous injection (IV) on PC-3 mice bearing tumors grown to approximately 250 mmin size. As shown in , the tumors in the Control group grew to exponentially large size after 14 days. In contrast, tumors in the Etoposide treatment group grew slowly. More importantly, Substance X showed stronger inhibitory effect on tumors as compared to Etoposide.","Effect of Substance X on VEGF and VEGF Receptor 2 Expression in Tumor Xenograft Mice","We examined the expression of VEGF and VEGFR2, the important angiogenic factors that can promote tumor vasculatures and are required for tumor invasion. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on tumors dissected from Control mice or mice treated with Substance X. As compared to the Control, the expression of VEGF and VEGFR2 was significantly down-regulated in tumors treated with Substance X (). This suggests that Substance X may be a VEGF inhibitor that targets VEGF signalling pathways.","Effect of Substance X on Tumor Histology and Vascularisation of Tumors in Xenograft Mice","We also characterized tumor histology by VEGF receptor 2 staining in mice treated with vehicle or Substance X. Side-by-side comparison of the sections containing the whole tumors from Control mice and Substance X treated mice clearly revealed differences in tumor size and morphology between the two groups (). The size of the tumors from mice treated with Substance X appeared to be smaller than that from the Control mice. Interestingly, there were large empty areas in tumors treated with Substance X, suggesting an ongoing tumor reduction may be associated with the clearance of dead tumor cells. These results further confirmed that Substance X is capable of inhibiting growth in large and invasive tumors.","We then measured the expression of CD31, a protein expressed in tumor vasculatures and important for tumor invasion, in tumors treated with Substance X by immunohistochemical analysis (). We determined the extent of tumor vascularisation by quantifying CD31 expression and CD31 positive vessels in the tumors including the edge and the centre areas of the tumors. There was a statistically significant decrease in CD31 expression and the number of CD31-expressing vessels in tumors treated with Substance X as compared with that of the Control tumors (). This result suggests that Substance X may inhibit tumor growth and invasion by preventing the vascularisation of aggressive PC-3 tumors.","Chemicals","All new synthesized compounds and Etoposide were first dissolved in 100% DMSO at initial concentration of 100 mM, and then diluted at final concentration of 200 uM in culture medium.
