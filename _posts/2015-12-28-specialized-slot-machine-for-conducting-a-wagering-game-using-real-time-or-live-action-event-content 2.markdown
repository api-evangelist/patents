Slot machines have proven to be very popular with players and profitable for the venue. Generally, the popularity of such machines with players is dependent on the possibility of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Players are usually attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines, which are constructed with features and enhancements to attract frequent play and increase profitability for the operator. Therefore, there is a continuing need for slot machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and improve gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play through enhanced entertainment value to the player. However, current gaming systems are based on the use of pre-defined sets of cards or displays (e.g., types of fruit, symbols, etc.) that form the content used in the wagering games implemented by the gaming systems. Casinos have been unable use these gaming systems to implement wagering games that are based on the use of variable content, real-time content, or live action content. Additionally, casinos have been unable to exploit an opportunity to enter the exploding fantasy sports market via traditional slot machines or other gaming systems that are designed to create games of intense, skill-based strategy.","As popular as fantasy sports has been over the last decade, there has been a huge void that nobody has been able to fill. Fantasy sports tournaments have never been able to create a process where an unlimited number of people can play without creating a lottery type of effect. A lottery effect is the very undesirable result of having so many fantasy players entered in a tournament that there is no longer enough room to have them play each other in head-to-head matchups. Unfortunately, the solution for tournaments with these types of spacing issues has always been to force the entire field to compete against each other simultaneously. This is never a good thing and is very discouraging for the competitors.","There are only two general formats available on the market for participating in fantasy tournaments. Within each tournament structure there are often different variables, but when they are stripped down to their bare essence, it comes down to two options. One of them creates the aforementioned lottery effect while the other does everything possible to avoid it. The one that avoids the lottery effect creates its own set of problems unique to itself. As far as tournament play is concerned, neither is a viable way for an unlimited number of players to enter without having to play the entire field at the same time. Some of the features of these two tournament paradigms along with some of their limitations are described below.","Format #1\u2014Head-to-Head","Fantasy players are matched up against a single opponent to compete against for a given round. The fantasy player whose athletes score more combined fantasy points are declared the winner and their opponent is declared the loser. The won\/lost records of these fantasy players are recorded. The better records receive special recognition. Duplication of athletes is not permitted in these tournaments. Often, leagues are actually built within the tournament structure. Fantasy players are allowed to remain in the tournament for quite some time even if they happen to be performing poorly. There is a selection process in place where fantasy players either bid on or draft athletes. Lineups are submitted from a very limited and well defined pool of athletes. They consist of athletes that a fantasy player has on their roster that they either drafted or bid on.","Head-to-Head Format Limitations","There are limits to the number of fantasy players that can play in these types of tournaments because of spacing issues. In other words, there are a finite number of slots available to allow people to consistently play head-to-head with each other over a relatively short season. When limits are placed on the number of people that can play, it triggers a very bad combination of events if the intent is to offer a monetary prize. The head-to-head format limits the amount of prize money that can be given out. This is because there aren't enough people paying an entry fee to support a large prize money pool. Compounding the problem is the high pricing strategy for entry fees which is often used to compensate for the limited number of fantasy players that are able to compete. This is done to create a larger pool for the prize money, but this strategy prices most fantasy sports enthusiasts out of participating.","Format #2\u2014Lottery Effect","Some tournament formats operate as a lottery style tournament because the format mirrors what a lottery does. For example, millions of people can select the number \u201c3\u201d in a lottery and share that number. But, the number is meaningless unless that number is selected as one of the winning numbers and the other five or six numbers that the lottery player has are also selected as winning numbers. The same thing happens with fantasy sports lottery tournaments. Three million people might have the highest scoring athlete for a given day, week or month, but how many of them have that in combination with the next five or six highest scoring athletes? This is a very unlikely combination to have and is why this style of play mimics a lottery. The lottery effect format requires hundreds, thousands or even an unlimited number of entries to play each other simultaneously. Duplication of athletes is permitted because there aren't enough athletes to go around. This is the only way millions can play each other simultaneously. Tournaments are usually structured so that running point totals of fantasy players are compared on an ongoing basis. The goal is to have the highest running point total possible in the event that hundreds to millions of fantasy players are all competing against each other. Tournament structure always forces fantasy players to compete against the entire field. Sometimes it is for one day and sometimes it is for the whole season and sometimes it is something in between. Cumulative running point total separates the fantasy players rather than a won\/lost record like with the head-to-head format. The top cumulative point scorers receive special recognition. Lineups are submitted from the entire pool of available athletes with little to no restrictions.","Lottery Effect Format Limitations","Fantasy players compete against the entire field simultaneously. Tournament format not conducive to charging an entry fee, although some do, because fantasy players are not optimistic they can beat out hundreds to millions of players at the same time for the high score. Generally considered an inferior format to the match play method because it is nothing more than an accumulated points system over a day, week, month or entire season and forces fantasy players to compete against the entire field at the same time.","Not all fantasy tournaments have every feature described in the two formats above. However, all of them though have enough of them in combination with one another to create insurmountable roadblocks for the type of tournament the applicant believes is needed to fill the hole in the industry. The only way around them is to seek non-traditional solutions. Ultimately, the goal is to create a vehicle so that an unlimited number of fantasy players can participate, without having to play the entire field simultaneously. Again, there isn't a single format currently in existence on the market that allows this to happen. The reason for this is that there are several non-obvious features that are required to make this happen.","The primary tournaments that have either been or are currently on the market are described below. In 2004, Payday Sports offered a million dollar prize to the winner of their fantasy football tournament. The entry fee was $3,600. Analysis\u2014The tournament failed because even though the prize money was appropriate and the competitors weren't forced to play the entire field simultaneously, the entry fee was not conducive to attracting the masses.","In 2004, the Million Dollar Fantasy League held a fantasy football tournament that offered a one million dollar grand prize. The entry fee was $2,600. Analysis\u2014This tournament failed for the same reason the Payday sports one did. The prize money was good, they also got it right by not forcing competitors to compete against the entire field, but once again, the entry fee was way too high.","In 2008, Fanball held a million dollar fantasy football tournament where the entry fee was $125. It failed in the second year because they were unable to pay the prize money. This tournament was a much better attempt at creating an entry fee that was conducive to attract the masses, but it still wasn't low enough. Consequently, it fared no better than the others because the price was still way too high for the average player and the tournament format was so structurally flawed they couldn't go any lower. Their primary issue was that they didn't have an understanding of how to create enough space for more fantasy players to enter. This became quite apparent by their use of a league format. Instead of eliminating poor performers to make room for more entries, they allowed them to remain in the tournament. The ramifications for doing it this way (along with some other strategic mistakes) resulted in the fact that they could not go any lower on the entry fee without making all the competitors compete against the entire field simultaneously. The bottom line is that even though Fanball tried entry fees that were significantly lower than previous attempts, their faulty methodology still forced them to keep them too high to attract the masses. More importantly, even if they had been able to attract the masses with their better pricing, they still didn't have a system in place to accommodate that many entries without offering a Lottery Effect format. The Fanball fiasco is one example of why the solutions to create an effective tournament format are not obvious.","FanDuel has been hosting a tournament for two years that they hope will eventually pay the winner one million dollars (in 2012 the winner received $150,000). Their entry fee is either $10 or $109. Analysis\u2014FanDuel is a good illustration of how big money fantasy sports tournaments struggle with trying to avoid the Lottery Effect while at the same time trying to offer a big money grand prize. What they have created is a paradigm that offers two types of qualifying tournaments for a chance to compete in a 24 person tournament that crowns the winner with $150,000. For the $109 qualifier, they limit it to 250 people each week that it is run. For the $10 qualifier they cap it at just over 2,000 entries. The intent is to minimize the Lottery Effect by capping the number of people who can participate, but it is still creates a Lottery Effect when you have to be the best score in a large field to qualify. Moreover, the prize money to the winner is compromised and can never be in the multi-millions of dollars because they are creating caps for the number of people that can enter. The FanDuel format is a good example to illustrate the problem that currently exists. Nobody has been able to determine how to offer the multi-million dollar grand prize without forcing contestants to simultaneously play millions of people. FanDuel clearly is trying to address the issue, but because of their flawed strategies in creating their format, they offer BOTH the Lottery Effect and a less than desirable grand prize in their offering.","The National Fantasy Football Championship Primetime (NFFCP) is offering a $150,000 grand prize for the 2012 NFL\u2122 season. Their entry fee is $1,500. Analysis\u2014The prize money is not in the millions and the entry fee is way too high to attract the masses. The format limits the number of entries, because they haven't developed a tournament format that allows a large number of fantasy players to compete.","The National Fantasy Football Championship Classic (NFFCC) is offering a $75,000 grand prize for the 2012 NFL\u2122 season. Their entry fee is $1,500. Analysis\u2014The prize money is not in the millions and the entry fee is way too high to attract the masses. The format limits the number of entries, because they haven't developed a tournament format that allows a large number of fantasy players to compete.","The Fantasy Football Players Championship (FFPC) is offering a $200,000 grand prize for the 2012 NFL\u2122 season. Their entry fee is $1,600. Analysis\u2014The prize money is not in the millions and the entry fee is way too high to attract the masses. The format limits the number of entries, because they haven't developed a tournament format that allows a large number of fantasy players to compete.","The World Championship of Fantasy Football (WCFF) is offering a $200,000 grand prize for the 2012 NFL\u2122 season. Their entry fee is $1,575. Analysis\u2014The prize money is not in the millions and the entry fee is way too high to attract the masses. The format limits the number of entries, because they haven't developed a tournament format that allows a large number of fantasy players to compete.","In various embodiments described herein, specialized slot machines for conducting wagering games using real time or live action event content via a computer system and\/or a data network are disclosed. In other embodiments described herein, specialized slot machines for conducting fantasy sports tournaments via a computer system and\/or a data network are disclosed.

While these typical components found in the slot machine  are described below, it should be understood that numerous other elements may exist and may be used in any number of combinations to create various forms of a slot machine .","The value input device  may be provided in many forms, individually or in combination, and is preferably located on the front of the housing . The value input device  receives currency and\/or credits that are inserted by a player. The value input device  may include a coin acceptor  for receiving coin currency (see ). Alternatively, or in addition, the value input device  may include a bill acceptor  for receiving paper currency. Furthermore, the value input device  may include a ticket reader, a barcode scanner, or a QR code scanner for reading information stored on a credit ticket, a card, or other tangible portable credit storage device. The credit ticket or card may also authorize access to a central account, which can transfer money to the slot machine .","The player input device  comprises a plurality of push buttons  on a button panel for operating the slot machine . In addition, or alternatively, the player input device  may comprise a touch screen  mounted by adhesive, tape, or the like over the primary display  and\/or secondary display . The touch screen  contains soft touch keys  denoted by graphics on the underlying primary display  and used to operate the slot machine . The touch screen  provides players with an alternative method of input. A player enables a desired function either by touching the touch screen  at an appropriate touch key  or by pressing an appropriate push button  on the button panel. The touch keys  may be used to implement the same functions as push buttons . Alternatively, the push buttons  may provide inputs for one aspect of the operating the game, while the touch keys  may allow for input needed for another aspect of the game. In another implementation, a lever or handle on the side of the slot machine can be used by a user to provide input to the slot machine .","The various components of the slot machine  may be connected directly to, or contained within, the housing , as seen in , or may be located outboard of the housing  and connected to the housing  via a variety of different wired or wireless connection methods. Thus, the slot machine  comprises these components whether housed in the housing , or outboard of the housing  and connected remotely.","The operation of the basic wagering game is displayed to the player on the primary display . The primary display  can also display the bonus game associated with the basic wagering game. The primary display  may take the form of a cathode ray tube (CRT) display, a high resolution liquid-crystal display (LCD), a plasma display, an LED (light emitting diode) display, or any other type of display suitable for use in the slot machine . As shown, the primary display  includes the touch screen  overlaying the entire display (or a portion thereof) to allow players to make game-related selections. Alternatively, the primary display  of the slot machine  may include a number of mechanical, electromechanical, or electronic reels to display the outcome in visual association with at least one payline . In the illustrated embodiment, the slot machine  is an \u201cupright\u201d version in which the primary display  is oriented vertically relative to the player. Alternatively, the slot machine may be a \u201cslant-top\u201d version in which the primary display  is slanted at about a thirty-degree angle toward the player of the slot machine .","A player begins play of the basic wagering game by making a wager via the value input device  of the slot machine . A player can select a type of play by using the player input device , via the buttons  or the touch screen keys . The basic game consists of a plurality of symbols arranged in an array, and includes at least one payline  that indicates one or more outcomes of the basic game. Such outcomes can be randomly selected in response to the wagering input by the player. As described in more detail below for various example embodiments, the outcomes can also be based on player input and real time or live action content retrieved by the slot machine  from a network information source. At least one of the plurality of outcomes determined by the slot machine  may be a start-bonus outcome, which can include any variations of symbols or symbol combinations triggering a bonus game.","In some embodiments, the slot machine  may also include a player information reader  that allows for identification (ID) of a player by reading a card with information indicating his or her true identity. The player information reader  is shown in  as a card reader, but may take on many forms including a ticket reader, barcode scanner, QR code scanner, RFID (radio-frequency identification) transceiver or computer readable storage medium interface. Currently, identification is generally used by casinos for rewarding certain players with complimentary services or special offers. For example, a player may be enrolled in the gaming establishment's loyalty club and may be awarded certain complimentary services as that player collects points in his or her player-tracking account. The player inserts his or her card into the player information reader , which allows the casino's computers to register that player's wagering at the slot machine . The slot machine  may use the secondary display  or other dedicated player-tracking display for providing the player with information about his or her account or other player-specific information. Also, in some embodiments, the information reader  may be used to restore game assets that the player achieved and saved during a previous game session.","Referring now to , a handheld or mobile slot machine  is illustrated. Like the free standing slot machine , the handheld slot machine  is preferably an electronic gaming machine configured to play a video casino game such as, but not limited to, blackjack, slots, keno, poker, blackjack, and roulette. The handheld slot machine  comprises a housing or casing  and includes input devices, including a value input device  and a player input device . For output the handheld slot machine  includes, but is not limited to, a primary display , a secondary display , one or more speakers , one or more player-accessible ports  (e.g., an audio output jack for headphones, a video headset jack, etc.), and other conventional input\/output (I\/O) devices and ports, which may or may not be player-accessible. In the embodiment depicted in , the handheld slot machine  comprises a secondary display  that is rotatable relative to the primary display . The optional secondary display  may be fixed, movable, and\/or detachable\/attachable relative to the primary display . Either the primary display  and\/or secondary display  may be configured to display any aspect of a non-wagering game, wagering game, secondary games, bonus games, progressive wagering games, group games, shared-experience games or events, game events, game outcomes, scrolling information, text messaging, emails, alerts or announcements, broadcast information, subscription information, and handheld slot machine status.","The player-accessible value input device  may comprise, for example, a slot located on the front, side, or top of the casing  configured to receive credit from a stored-value card (e.g., casino card, smart card, debit card, credit card, etc.) inserted by a player. In another aspect, the player-accessible value input device  may comprise a sensor (e.g., an RF, radio frequency sensor) configured to sense a signal (e.g., an RF signal) output by a transmitter (e.g., an RF transmitter) carried by a player. The player-accessible value input device  may also or alternatively include a ticket reader, barcode scanner, or QR code scanner for reading information stored on a credit ticket, a card, or other tangible portable credit or funds storage device. The credit ticket or card may also authorize access to a central account, which can transfer money to the handheld slot machine .","Still other player-accessible value input devices  may require the use of touch keys  on the touch-screen display (e.g., primary display  and\/or secondary display ) or player input devices . Upon entry of player identification information and, preferably, secondary authorization information (e.g., a password, personal identification number (PIN), stored value card number, predefined key sequences, etc.), the player may be permitted to access a player's account. As one potential optional security feature, the handheld slot machine  may be configured to permit a player to only access an account the player has specifically set up for the handheld slot machine . Other conventional security features may also be utilized to, for example, prevent unauthorized access to a player's account, to minimize an impact of any unauthorized access to a player's account, or to prevent unauthorized access to any personal information or funds temporarily stored on the handheld slot machine .","The player-accessible value input device  may itself comprise or utilize a biometric player information reader, which permits the player to access available funds on a player's account, either alone or in combination with another of the aforementioned player-accessible value input devices . In an embodiment wherein the player-accessible value input device  comprises a biometric player information reader, transactions such as an input of value to the handheld device, a transfer of value from one player account or source to an account associated with the handheld slot machine , or the execution of another transaction, for example, could all be authorized by a biometric reading, which could comprise a plurality of biometric readings, from the biometric device.","Alternatively, to enhance security, a transaction may be optionally enabled only by a two-step process in which a secondary source confirms the identity indicated by a primary source. For example, a player-accessible value input device  comprising a biometric player information reader may require a confirmatory entry from another biometric player information reader , or from another source, such as a credit card, debit card, player ID (identification) card, fob key, PIN (personal identification number), password, hotel room key, etc. Thus, a transaction may be enabled by, for example, a combination of the personal identification input (e.g., biometric input) with a secret PIN, or a combination of a biometric input with a fob input, or a combination of a fob input with a PIN, or a combination of a credit card input with a biometric input. Essentially, any two independent sources of identity, one of which is secure or personal to the player (e.g., biometric readings, PIN, password, etc.) could be utilized to provide enhanced security prior to the electronic transfer of any funds. In another aspect, the value input device  may be provided remotely from the handheld slot machine .","The player input device  comprises a plurality of push buttons on a button panel for operating the handheld slot machine . In addition, or alternatively, the player input device  may comprise a touch screen  mounted to a primary display  and\/or secondary display . In one aspect, the touch screen  is matched to a display screen having one or more selectable touch keys  selectable by a user's touching of the associated area of the screen using a finger or a tool, such as a stylus pointer. A player enables a desired function either by touching the touch screen  at an appropriate touch key  or by pressing an appropriate push button  on the button panel. The touch keys  may be used to implement the same functions as push buttons . Alternatively, the push buttons may provide inputs for one aspect of the operating the game, while the touch keys  may allow for input needed for another aspect of the game. The various components of the handheld slot machine  may be connected directly to, or contained within, the casing , as seen in , or may be located outboard of the casing  and connected to the casing  via a variety of hardwired (tethered) or wireless connection methods. Thus, the handheld slot machine  may comprise a single unit or a plurality of interconnected parts (e.g., wireless connections) which may be arranged to suit a player's preferences.","The operation of the basic wagering game on the handheld slot machine  is displayed to the player on the primary display . The primary display  can also display the bonus game associated with the basic wagering game. The primary display  preferably takes the form of a high resolution LCD, a plasma display, an LED, or any other type of display suitable for use in the handheld slot machine . The size of the primary display  may vary from, for example, about a 2-3\u2033 display to a 15\u2033 or 17\u2033 display. In at least some aspects, the primary display  is a 7\u2033-10\u2033 display. As the weight of and\/or power requirements of such displays decreases with improvements in technology, it is envisaged that the size of the primary display may be increased. Optionally, coatings or removable films or sheets may be applied to the display to provide desired characteristics (e.g., anti-scratch, anti-glare, bacterially-resistant and anti-microbial films, etc.). In at least some embodiments, the primary display  and\/or secondary display  may have a 16:9 aspect ratio or other aspect ratio (e.g., 4:3). The primary display  and\/or secondary display  may also each have different resolutions, different color schemes, and different aspect ratios.","As with the free standing slot machine , a player begins play of the basic wagering game on the handheld slot machine  by making a wager (e.g., via the value input device  or an assignment of credits stored on the handheld slot machine via the touch screen keys , player input device , or buttons ) on the handheld slot machine . In at least some aspects, the basic game may comprise a plurality of symbols arranged in an array, and includes at least one payline  that indicates one or more outcomes of the basic game. Such outcomes can be randomly selected in response to the wagering input by the player. As described in more detail below for various example embodiments, the outcomes can also be based on player input and real time or live action content retrieved by the slot machine  from a network information source. At least one of the plurality of outcomes determined by the slot machine  may be a start-bonus outcome, which can include any variations of symbols or symbol combinations triggering a bonus game.","In some embodiments, the player-accessible value input device  of the handheld slot machine  may double as a player information reader  that allows for identification of a player by reading a card with information indicating the player's identity (e.g., reading a player's credit card, player ID card, smart card, etc.). The player information reader  may alternatively or also comprise a bar code scanner, RFID transceiver or computer readable storage medium interface. In one presently preferred aspect, the player information reader , shown by way of example in , comprises a biometric sensing device.","Turning now to , the various components of the slot machine  are controlled by a central processing unit (CPU) , also referred to herein as a controller or processor (such as a microcontroller or microprocessor). To provide gaming functions, the controller  executes one or more game programs stored in a computer readable storage medium, in the form of memory . The controller  can perform the random selection (using a random number generator (RNG)) of an outcome from the plurality of possible outcomes of the wagering game. Alternatively, the random event may be determined at a remote controller. The remote controller may use either an RNG or pooling scheme for its central determination of a game outcome. It should be appreciated that the controller  may include one or more microprocessors, including but not limited to a master processor, a slave processor, and a secondary or parallel processor.","The controller  is also coupled to the system memory  and a money\/credit detector . The system memory  may comprise a volatile memory (e.g., a random-access memory (RAM)) and a non-volatile memory (e.g., an EEPROM). The system memory  may include multiple RAM and multiple program memories. The money\/credit detector  signals the processor that money and\/or credits have been input via the value input device . Preferably, these components are located within the housing  of the slot machine . However, as explained above, these components may be located outboard of the housing  and connected to the remainder of the components of the slot machine  via a variety of different wired or wireless connection methods.","As seen in , the controller  is also connected to, and controls, the primary display , the player input device , and a payoff mechanism .

In other words, if a person sits down in the MGM\u2122 in Las Vegas, they don't have to sit and wait until their group of six people is filled by people sitting in that particular MGM\u2122 casino. The other five players competing against them can be sitting in casinos\/venues anywhere in the world.","Contestants sit at their own individual fantasy sports specialized slot machine\/terminal as described herein. They are given the choice to enter for $1, $5, $20, $50 and $100 contests (or any other entry amount that casinos\/venues find attractive for a slot machine).","When a contestant looks at the display screen of the fantasy sports specialized slot machine\/terminal, they will see an image on the display screen, as presented by the user interface logic of an example embodiment described herein, showing a virtual card table with six places (e.g., see ). The contestant at the fantasy sports specialized slot machine\/terminal will be one of the players occupying one of these six places at the virtual card table presented by the specialized slot machine\/terminal.","The contestant puts an amount of money into the specialized slot machine\/terminal corresponding to the level of play at which they want to participate. For example, the contestant might put $1 in for the dollar game, $10 in for the ten dollar game, or $20 in for the twenty dollar game, to enter the game.","The contestant then pulls down the handle (or activates a lever or pushes a button on the user interface of the specialized slot machine\/terminal) and the specialized slot machine\/terminal starts generating a variety of enticing and entertaining graphics that flash around until the contestant has a full group of six other players to play against (who are also playing for the same entry amount). Because the game will fill quickly with players, the graphic display generations, which take about five seconds, will take longer than the time needed to fill a live group of players, which will happen immediately, because the game and the players are linked to casinos\/venues throughout the country\/world (e.g., geographically distributed).","Groups are always comprised of six contestants in an example embodiment.","The other five contestants, who will fill the remaining five places at the virtual card table presented by the specialized slot machine\/terminal, will be anonymous on the display screen in front of a given contestant.

If these athletes are competing in a sport not in season, their fantasy point game average from the previous season will be used.","For every group of six competing contestants, the top scoring two contestants in each of these groups are considered winners. There is no distinction between finishing first and second. The top scoring two contestants are both winners and are eligible for the same prize if they choose to cash out.","These two top scoring winners for each group have one of two options. The two top scoring winners can either: 1) cash out by pressing a button (or activating a virtual object on the user interface of the specialized slot machine\/terminal) that cashes them out and automatically doubles their money, or 2) they can choose to \u201clet it ride\u201d by pulling the handle (or activating a lever or pushing a button on the user interface of the specialized slot machine\/terminal) to form a new group with five other new contestants and try to re-double their money by playing in a new round.","The bottom scoring four contestants of a group are eliminated and lose their money. The bottom scoring four contestants can either leave the specialized slot machine or put more money into the specialized slot machine to play again by playing in a new group of six contestants.","The casino\/venue provides powerful motivation in two directions for winning contestants to stay in for another round instead of cashing out. First, winning contestants can \u201clet it ride\u201d and attempt to redouble their money each time they stay in instead of cashing out. Secondly, the specialized slot machine experience of the example embodiment offers another huge incentive for people to stay in. Any contestant who advances ten consecutive times will play in a Tournament of Champions (TOC) sponsored by the casino\/venue in which they are playing.","The TOC usually occurs during the playoffs during a given sports real live action playoffs. The TOC's format can use traditional live action fantasy sports or can be conducted the same way that the specialized slot machines operate by using fantasy point per game averages.","The rationale for offering TOC is to provide a huge incentive for contestants to not cash out and to continue playing on the specialized slot machines. The TOC pays out millions of dollars to the winner and other top finishers and is a very attractive incentive for people to try and qualify for (and therefore not cash out).","For clarification purposes, even though contestants might be playing people assigned by a managing entity from other casinos\/venues, this doesn't mean that this is a coordinated multi-casino TOC. Each casino\/venue hosts their own TOC, which can be run directly from their website, off their own slot machines, or could even be live action in their casino\/venue.","The reason casinos are motivated to have contestants NOT cash out is because each time the contestant lets it ride into another round, the percentage of the money the casino\/venue takes in goes up significantly. For example, if the two winners from every group always cashed out, the casino would receive a standard 33% of the revenue. If, however, players never cashed out and always let it ride, by round ten the casinos\/venues would always receive a staggering 98.3% of the revenue.","The following table shows an example of the casino vs. contestant revenue split depending on the round from which contestants decide to cash out:"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0106"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Round","Casino Take","Player Take"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1",{"sup":"\u2003"},"\u200967%"]},{"entry":["2","55.6%","44.4%\u2002"]},{"entry":["3","70.4%","29.6%\u2002"]},{"entry":["4","80.2%","19.8%\u2002"]},{"entry":["5","86.8%","13.2%\u2002"]},{"entry":["6","91.2%","8.8%"]},{"entry":["7","94.1%","5.9%"]},{"entry":["8","96.1%","3.9%"]},{"entry":["9","97.4%","2.6%"]},{"entry":["10","98.3%","1.7%"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Note:"},{"entry":"It does not matter at what dollar amount a contestant enters the competition.

If the lowest bid wins, this seems like a no-brainer strategy that will automatically secure the athletes that they desire by submitting the lowest percentage which is 1%. However, this strategy would be counter-productive and would virtually guarantee that the contestant would come in last place. The reason for this is because the percentage bid serves two purposes. The bid not only secures athletes by having the lowest bid, but the bid also severely penalizes contestants for making unreasonably low bids. For example, a 1% bid will undoubtedly win a contestant the athletes that they desire, but this bid also represents the percentage of each athlete's fantasy points that they are eligible for in the game itself. For example, if someone bids 1% to win a fantasy football group they desire such as Peyton Manning, Calvin Johnson and Marshawn Lynch, they will be terribly disappointed to learn that they also only get 1% of the fantasy points that each of these three athletes scored in their respective games. As a result, a value of the contestant's bid, as represented by the percentage bid, is used to discount or reduce the contestant's score or quantity of points received by a corresponding amount. In this manner, a contestant bidding at a minimal level will also only receive a score or quantity of points at a correspondingly minimal level.","In the example embodiment, the setup may not seem fair in one critical way. For example, a bloc of three athletes could potentially have three duds like all kickers for a football contest while another bloc of three athletes has all high value athletes like quarterbacks for the same competition. Isn't this absurd since quarterbacks are much more valuable than kickers? In the example embodiment, the described format actually turns the selection process into a riveting high wire exercise where skill becomes a major factor. Think of these groups of athletes as stocks. The more valuable the stock, the more aggressive the bidding will be. The correct price will be set by the bids. Three kickers at 95% of their fantasy points might be more valuable than three quarterbacks at 12% of their fantasy points. This bidding process creates a tremendous amount of strategy for participants to consider.","In the example embodiment, two additional rules heighten the drama of the tournament format implemented on the specialized slot machine.

However, this feature of an example embodiment makes the game even more strategic. Now, contestants will have to factor into the calculus the fact that a bloc of strong athletes might be diminished in value because they have a smaller multiplier and a more mediocre group might be increased in value because they are more valued by a higher multiplier. Even if a strong group of athletes has a 10\u00d7 multiplier, this won't be a problem. The appropriate percentage bid for this bloc will be significantly lower than the norm. Conversely, a mediocre bloc of athletes with a small multiplier should be able to be secured with a bid considerable higher than the norm.","In the example embodiment as described, somebody is going to eventually get a bloc; because, there is exactly one bloc every contestant\u2014everybody is going to eventually need a lineup. All blocs not bid on are called \u201cmulligans\u201d and will be reintroduced after all the blocs have been revealed. If there is more than one bloc for which a bid is not received, the blocs are reintroduced in the order that they first appeared. Also, the maximum bid for a new round does not go down 8% if the previous bloc was a mulligan. When the blocs not bid on are reintroduced and all six blocs have been shown and either bid on or passed on, the maximum bid for the reintroduced blocs go down 8% each time a new one is reintroduced and bid on. If there is a tie for a final position, amongst tied players, the person who secured their bloc in the lowest or latest round advances.","Once the bids are received from the contestants in a group for a particular round, the six contestants in the group are scored for final positions. The specialized slot machine of an example embodiment can gather the data for all athletes in the contest and then compute the final positions. This computation will take no more than five seconds after all contestants have secured their blocs. The specialized slot machine can tabulate the scores for all of the athletes and then add the three scores together for each bloc of athletes. Each contestant will then be ranked 1-6 (one through six) on the specialized slot machine user interface screen (e.g., see  through ). For example, to tabulate the score of a single athlete, three components of information are required. First, the athlete's average fantasy game score has to be a part of the database linked to the managing entity website for easy retrieval. The second component of information needed is the bid with which the athlete was secured. Finally, the multiplier on the athlete has to be included in the computation. Using football as an example, let's assume Tom Brady has a running fantasy game point total of 10. Then assume he is secured at 68% of his fantasy points and the multiplier on him is 3\u00d7. Since 68% of 10 is 6.8 and when 6.8 is multiplied by 3, the result is 20.4. This means that Brady's score would be added to the other two athletes in his bloc for a final score to be posted for that contestant. Finally, tied positions always are broken by awarding the person who secured their bloc in the later round the higher spot.","The Specialized Slot Machine Tournament Structure in an Alternative Example Embodiment","The following description provides a general overview of the specialized slot machine tournament structure in an alternative example embodiment.

In order to make the fantasy sports slot machine embodiments possible, there are four key elements that are new to the fantasy sports genre that these embodiments introduce and that support the implementation. These four key elements include the following:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0157"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 9"]},"A Fantasy Music Legends Tournament is a tournament format for any genre of music. A given tournament can be designed for a specific genre like Rock & Roll, Pop, Rhythm & Blues, Country, Rap, etc. There can also be an \u201cOpen\u201d tournament that allows all genres to be incorporated into one tournament. This concept can be a marketing tool for a company or it can be a standalone tournament that charges an entry fee and offers cash prizes for the top finishers of the Tournament of Champions (TOC). If it is used as a marketing tool, the tournament can offer interesting music perks for the top finishers. For a Rap tournament, the overall winner might win an all-expenses paid trip somewhere to see Jay Z perform and also hang out with him before and after the show. A top overall winner might have a different kind of top prize, such as winning a rare guitar for their efforts. The key components as a marketing tool are to allow contestants special perks. These perks will allow them to compete in a smaller group size than is normally required or skip a round(s) entirely. Contestants can take advantage of these perks by purchasing something off a particular website. When they do so, they are allowed to skip a round (or two) or play in a smaller group for the next round. For example, someone might be able to play the next round against only 9 people instead of the standard 12 if they purchase a song. They might be able to skip 2 rounds if they buy concert tickets. Legendary musicians eligible to be picked for a Fantasy Music Legends Tournament are any people who have played in a group with two or more people who had at least 1 hit in the top 40 in the United States in their genre of expertise. For example, Adam Ridgeley would be eligible because he was a member of Wham and has had at least one hit song that made the Billboard Hot 100 chart for his genre in the U.S. In the example embodiment, the tournament does not disqualify someone if their \u201cband\u201d is missing a piece (like a drummer) that is usually associated as a key component of a typical band. For example, the Carpenters are considered a \u201cband\u201d by the definitions of this game. Some legendary musicians have played in more than one band. For example, Paul McCartney played with The Beatles and with Paul McCartney and Wings. For this reason, Legendary Musicians score fantasy points for all bands in which they participated.","The Fantasy Music Legends Tournament Structure in an Example Embodiment","The following description provides a general overview of the Fantasy Music Legends Tournament structure in an example embodiment.\n\n","Fantasy players that tie for a top three position will use the following tiebreaker process in an example embodiment:\n\n","Below is a grid that shows what percentage of Legendary Musician's points a given contestant receives depending on how many other competitors selected that Legendary Musician.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0174"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"308pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Percentage of Fantasy Points a Legendary Musician is Worth"},{"entry":"Based on Duplication of Legendary Musicians Selected"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"13"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Rock Legend",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"selected"]},{"entry":[{},"1X*","2X","3X","4X","5X","6X","7X","8X","9X","10X","11X","12X"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"12","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"13"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"13","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["12 player","100%","91%","82%","73%","64%","55%","46%","37%","28%","19%","10%","1%"]},{"entry":"Group"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"13","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*Note:"},{"entry":"1X is read as \u201cone time\u201d which means a given Legendary Musician was selected by exactly 1 of the 12 competitors"}]}}]}}},"The table below shows the starting Legendary Musicians in the Pop\/Rock category that a 12 person group selected.

The second component of information needed is the bid with which the athlete was secured. Finally, the multiplier on the athlete has to be included in the computation. Using football as an example, let's assume Tom Brady has a running fantasy game point total of 10. Then assume he is secured at 68% of his fantasy points and the multiplier on him is 3\u00d7. Since 68% of 10 is 6.8 and when 6.8 is multiplied by 3, the result is 20.4. This means that Brady's score would be added to the other two athletes in his bloc for a final score to be posted for that contestant. Finally, tied positions always are broken by awarding the person who secured their bloc in the later round the higher spot.","The Specialized Slot Machine Tournament Structure in an Alternative Example Embodiment","The following description provides a general overview of the specialized slot machine tournament structure in an alternative example embodiment. In an alternative embodiment of the specialized fantasy sports slot machine as described above, the alternative slot machine embodiment includes everything described above, but adds one more variable. This alternative embodiment calls for contestants to create the groups upon which the contestants bid. The process for this alternative embodiment is described below.\n\n","The fantasy sports slot machine embodiments based on real time\/live action events as described herein provide a unique idea that has never been seen in the market. In these example embodiments, the contestants themselves do not constitute the real time\/live action event(s), rather it is the game itself that uses real time\/live action events as the competition unfolds. These example embodiments fundamentally change the way slot machines are currently used. Slot machine players are suddenly playing with the outcomes that are based on events that are unfolding as they are playing. This adds a dimension to slot machines that has never been provided before.","In order to make these fantasy sports slot machine embodiments possible, there are three key elements that are new to the fantasy sports genre that these embodiments introduce and that support the implementation. These three key elements include the following:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0302"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 9"]},"In various example embodiments described below, real time\/live events and related tournament formats are implemented on a specialized slot machine. These example embodiments use real life events to transform the specialized slot machine from a static entity, that is currently based solely on canned information, into a real time\/live event gaming apparatus.","As described above, the real time\/live action events of the example embodiments constitute the gaming material itself. This specialized slot machine and the particular tournament formats of the various example embodiments described herein are based on real time\/live event data. In other words, the decisions the players are making with the game itself are based on events that are happening at the time the game is being played.","This real time\/live event slot idea can be used for all types of real life events. For the purposes of this example embodiment, the described example embodiment uses the specialized slot machine with real time\/live current events (e.g., non-sporting events) to create a new type of specialized slot machine.\n\n","The following description provides a general overview of the specialized slot machine tournament structure for current events in an example embodiment:\n\n","Why doesn't a contestant just bid 1% on the first bloc of current events news categories that they really like? If the lowest bid wins, this seems like a no-brainer strategy that will automatically secure the current events news categories that they desire by submitting the lowest percentage which is 1%. However, this strategy would be counter-productive and would virtually guarantee that the contestant would come in last place. The reason for this is because the percentage bid serves two purposes. The bid not only secures the bloc of current events news categories by having the lowest bid, but the bid also severely penalizes contestants for making unreasonably low bids. For example, a 1% bid will undoubtedly win a contestant the current events news categories that they desire, but this bid also represents the percentage of raw points from each current events category that they are eligible for in the game itself. For example, if a contestant bids 1% to win the current event categories that they desire, which consists of Sports, Medicine and Congressional Politics, the contestant will be terribly disappointed to learn that they also only get 1% of the raw points that each of these categories tallied. As a result, a value of the contestant's bid, as represented by the percentage bid, is used to discount or reduce the contestant's score or quantity of points received by a corresponding amount. In this manner, a contestant bidding at a minimal level will also only receive a score or quantity of points at a correspondingly minimal level.","In the example embodiment, two additional rules heighten the drama of the tournament format implemented on the specialized slot machine. These additional rules are described below:\n\n","Given the description of the example embodiment as provided above, one might think that the game is unfair if some current events categories might have as low as a 6\u00d7 multiplier while others might be as high as a 10\u00d7 multiplier? However, this feature of an example embodiment makes the game even more strategic. Now, contestants will have to factor into the calculus the fact that a current events category might be diminished in value because it has a smaller multiplier and a less desirable current events category is now more valued because of a higher multiplier. Even if a highly sought after current events category has a 10\u00d7 multiplier, this won't be a problem; because, it will drive the percentage bid lower to even things out. Conversely, a less desirable current events category, with a small multiplier, should be able to be secured with a bid considerably higher than the norm.","In the example embodiment as described, somebody is going to eventually get a bloc; because, there are no backup current events blocs available\u2014and everybody is going to eventually need a bloc. All blocs not bid on are called \u201cmulligans\u201d and will be reintroduced after all the blocs have been revealed. If there is more than one bloc for which a bid is not received, the blocs are reintroduced in the order that they first appeared. Also, the maximum bid for a new round does not go down 8% if the previous bloc was a mulligan. When the blocs not bid on are reintroduced and all six blocs have been shown and either bid on or passed on, the maximum bid for the reintroduced blocs go down 8% each time a new one is reintroduced and bid on. If there is a tie for a final position, amongst tied players, the person who secured their bloc in the lowest or latest round advances.","Once the bids are received from the contestants for a particular round, the contestants in the group are scored for final positions. The specialized slot machine of an example embodiment can gather the data for all current events categories in the contest and then compute the final positions. This computation will take no more than five seconds after all contestants have secured their blocs. The specialized slot machine will tabulate the scores for all of the current events categories. Once the specialized slot machine tabulates final scores for individual current events categories, the specialized slot machine can add the scores together for blocs of current events categories belonging to the same contestant. The contestants will then be ranked 1-6 (one through six) on the specialized slot machine display screen. For example, to tabulate the score of a single current events news category, three components of information are required. First, the news category's raw score is calculated. The second component of information needed is the bid with which that the news category was secured. Finally, the multiplier on the news category is factored in. Let's assume a Religion news category has a 4.7% of the airtime raw score when the bidding process ends. This gives the category a raw score of 4.7 points. Then, assume this category is secured with a 68% bid and the multiplier on it is 3\u00d7. Because 68% of 4.7 is 3.2 and when 3.2 is multiplied by 3, the result is 9.6. This means that Religion's overall score is 9.6 points and would be added to the scores of their other two current event news categories from their bloc. Finally, tied positions always are broken by awarding the person who secured their bloc during the later round the higher finishing spot in the final standings.",">An Example Embodiment Providing a Specialized Slot Machine for Implementing:","A Slot Machine for Real Time Live Action Events\u2014Debate Events",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0354"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 9"]},"In various example embodiments described below, real time\/live events and related tournament formats are implemented on a specialized slot machine.

embodiment guarantees a minimum of 23% to the lottery for each group of 12 players. In this group format of an example embodiment, the ratios work the same for any entry fee. For all group play, the returns immediately jump to 45.6% to the lottery if a given player lets their winnings ride one time by playing in a round two group. Each time a player decides to let it ride into another round, the lottery makes significantly more money\u2014see the \u201cLottery Gets\u201d column in Tables #1 and #2. It is essential to create incentives to continue playing. In the group gaming format described herein in an example embodiment, there are at least two incentives created to encourage contestant's to keep playing. Firstly, players keep doubling their money each time they advance. Secondly, players who advance ten consecutive rounds receive automatic berths in a big money TOC.","The Operation of the Group Format of an Example Embodiment at a Lottery Terminal",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0172","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0065","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0065-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0066","list-style":"none"},"li":["Contestants use a value input device at a lottery terminal to put value (e.g., cash or credit) into the lottery terminal in an amount of the contestant's choosing.","Contestants are prompted to enter or select the quantity of consecutive rounds they wish to play.

If they fail to do so, their entry has expired and they win no money.","Once a contestant selects the quantity of consecutive rounds they desire to play, they are bound to this particular selection.","Contestants are invited to go on-line, to the state lottery website they are playing from, to look at the payouts for the game implemented with the example embodiment described herein. There are two variables that increase the potential winnings for contestants. Firstly, the dollar amount with which the contestant initially enters the game is one factor for determining the maximum amount for which the contestant is playing. Another factor is the quantity of consecutive rounds the contestant agrees to play during a given entry. See table #3 below for an example of the payout amounts.","The goal of the example embodiment is to encourage contestants to play as many consecutive rounds as possible (up to 10). This is because the lottery retains larger and larger percentages of the entry fee pool the longer people are willing to stay in the game (see tables #1 and #2 above). If every contestant always played only one round each time they entered, the lottery would receive 23% of the entry fees from all of these players. Conversely, if every contestant always played 10 consecutive rounds at a time, the lottery would make 88.3% of all entry fee revenue.","To entice people to play as many consecutive rounds as possible, there are two huge incentives to keep them going. Firstly, for every consecutive round a contestant enters, they have a chance to double their previous rounds' winnings. Also, all contestants who advance ten consecutive rounds receive an automatic berth in a 2chance multi-million dollar tournament at the end of the season."]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0173","num":"0488"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE #3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"State Lottery Entry Fee and Payout Table"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Cash Out","$1","$5","$10","$20","$50"]},{"entry":["$$$","Entry","Entry","Entry","Entry","Entry"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Rd 1","$2","$10","$20","$40","$100"]},{"entry":["Winners","payout","payout","payout","payout","payout"]},{"entry":["Rd 2","$4","$20","$40","$80","$200"]},{"entry":["Winners","payout","payout","payout","payout","payout"]},{"entry":["Rd 3","$8","$40","$80","$160","$400"]},{"entry":["Winners","payout","payout","payout","payout","payout"]},{"entry":["Rd 4","$16","$80","$160","$320","$800"]},{"entry":["Winners","payout","payout","payout","payout","payout"]},{"entry":["Rd 5","$32","$160","$320","$640","$1,600"]},{"entry":["Winners","payout","payout","payout","payout","payout"]},{"entry":["Rd 6","$64","$320","$640","$1,280","$3,200"]},{"entry":["Winners","payout","payout","payout","payout","payout"]},{"entry":["Rd 7","$128","$640","$1,280","$2,560","$6,400"]},{"entry":["Winners","payout","payout","payout","payout","payout"]},{"entry":["Rd 8","$256","$1,280","$2,560","$5,120","$12,800"]},{"entry":["Winners","payout","payout","payout","payout","payout"]},{"entry":["Rd 9","$512","$2,560","$5,120","$10,240","$25,600"]},{"entry":["Winners","payout","payout","payout","payout","payout"]},{"entry":["Rd 10","$1,024","$5,120","$10,240","$20,480","$51,200"]},{"entry":["Winners","payout","payout","payout","payout","payout"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Contestants at their local lottery terminal can select six athletes for their lineup. For purposes of the example embodiment described herein, we will use fantasy football as an example. However, the group gaming format of the described embodiments can work for all sports. The required positions to fill out for a fantasy football lineup are one QB, two RBs, two WRs and one TE. If a contestant only wants to play one round, their lineup will be printed on a lottery ticket with \u201cRd 1\u201d on it as well as a game number so the contestant can go to the lottery's website to identify their group of 12 players against whom they are playing. The contestants are also able to check their lineup against the other eleven people they are playing in their group. If a contestant wants to play more than one consecutive round, there is an exact process for lineup submissions for these situations. Firstly, they can't submit the same lineup for more than one round. The reason for this is because if a contestant hits with six athletes that have fantastic games, then the contestant has a chance to quickly advance ten consecutive rounds with one hot lineup, which is not desirable for the lottery holding the contest. At the same time, contestants are not allowed to sit at the lottery terminal and select entire new lineups for each new round of consecutive play. This would keep contestants at the lottery terminal for too long of a time period.","The 33% Solution\u2014In an example embodiment, the lottery game format allows contestants to print lineups for several consecutive rounds (up to 10) in a very quick and timely manner. The format requires contestants to always change one third of their lineup for every new round while also requiring them to keep the other two thirds of their lineup exactly the same as it was for the previous round. To save even more time, contestants are not allowed to decide what two lineup positions they want to swap athletes out for. The lottery will determine these positions that are to be changed to keep the contestant focused on only two positions instead of a possible six for swap outs. Contestants who opt to play multiple consecutive rounds will see the following lineup submission process on their lottery terminal beginning with Round 2:\n\n","For the football format, the lineup parameters that a contestant follows in an example embodiment are set forth below. The contestant follows through a progression that is based on the quantity of consecutive rounds for which the contestant originally signed up to play.\n\n","It is important to note that in an example embodiment, once an athlete completes their cycle for a contestant, the athlete cannot be used again for rounds later on. Athletes can only be used one time per entry.","In an example embodiment, the lottery game can close on a Sunday morning, right before kickoff of the first Sunday morning game. The final results are tabulated and dispersed on each participating lottery's website at the conclusion of the Sunday night game. Monday night games (as well as all other non-Sunday games) are ineligible for athlete selection purposes. The rationale for this is to have everything finalized by Sunday night so contestants are buying new lottery tickets on Monday instead of what might happen in their Monday night game.","It is important to understand that, once the Sunday night game has finished, all of the statistics are done. There are no more games to play. The way a contestant who signed up for three consecutive rounds finds out how they did is that the contestant can go to their Round 1 game on the website of the state lottery page where they purchased their ticket. The number on the ticket identifies their game number. They will then check the final standings for their group of twelve contestants. If they finished in the top four, they will be given another game number to check their Round 2 results. If they, again, finish in the top four, they receive a third game number that directs them to their 3round game. If they finished in the top four for this 3round match, they cash out at this point, because they signed up for three consecutive rounds. If they entered for $20, they would leave with $160 (because $20 doubled is $40 for Rd 1; and $40 doubled again is $80 for Rd 2; and $80 doubled a third time is $160 for Rd 3).","The Sunday night statistics are final\u2014no matter what happens later in the week. Occasionally the NFL\u2122 changes statistics during the following week after looking at film. For example, a pass completion might be changed to a run because the film showed what initially looked like a pass was changed to a lateral. These types of changes will not be considered relevant. It is not in the lottery's best interest to have entire scenarios recalibrated and have people who thought they won on Sunday night find out they lost on Tuesday morning.","Finally, most fantasy sports enthusiasts prefer to have multiple entries in tournaments. The idea is to get them off of the terminal as quickly as possible so the next contestant can get on it. Instead of requiring someone to start all over again to create another entry, the lottery terminal will ask the contestant how many entries they wish to have their submission count for. For example, someone might choose to play a $5 per entry competition and designate they will play for seven consecutive rounds. Once they have created their seven lineups outlined by the process above, they can then designate how many entries they want from this product they created. If they choose six entries, for example, then they would pay $30 ($5 per entry multiplied by the six times they want to enter) and this progression of seven lineups is then entered in six unique first round groups with each one having a separate entry number to track. All of this information is printed on their ticket.","The Operation of Progressive Lottery Format in an Example Embodiment at a Lottery Terminal","In an example embodiment, a multi-state lottery system can offer the following to contestants:\n\n","The following description provides a general overview of the scoring process for a twelve person group play tournament structure in an example embodiment.

If the lowest bid wins, this seems like a no-brainer strategy that will automatically secure the team of athletes that they desire by submitting the lowest percentage which is 1%. However, this strategy would be counter-productive and would virtually guarantee them coming in last place. The reason for this is because the percentage bid serves two purposes. It not only secures the team of athletes by having the lowest bid, but it also severely penalizes contestants for making unreasonably low bids. For example, a 1% bid will undoubtedly win a contestant the team of athletes that they desire, but this bid also represents the percentage of each athlete's fantasy points that they are eligible for in the game itself. For example, if someone bids 1% to win a fantasy football group they desire such as Peyton Manning, Calvin Johnson, Larry Fitzgerald, Marshawn Lynch, Frank Gore and Vernon Wells, they will be terribly disappointed to learn that they also only get 1% of the fantasy points that each of these six athletes scored in their respective games. As a result, a value of the contestant's bid, as represented by the percentage bid, is used to discount or reduce the contestant's score or quantity of points received by a corresponding amount. In this manner, a contestant bidding at a minimal level will also only receive a score or quantity of points at a correspondingly minimal level.","Given the description of the example embodiment as provided above, one might think that the game is unfair if a team could potentially have six mediocre athletes on one side and six great athletes on another team? However, this feature of an example embodiment makes the game even more strategic. This feature actually turns the selection process into a riveting high wire exercise where skill becomes a major factor. Think of these teams of athletes as stocks. The more valuable the stock, the more aggressive the bidding will be. The correct price will be set by the bids. A weak team at 95% of their fantasy points might be more valuable than a strong team at 12% of their fantasy points. This bidding process creates a tremendous amount of strategy for participants to consider.","In the example embodiment, two additional rules heighten the drama of the tournament format implemented on the specialized slot machine. These additional rules are described below:\n\n","Some teams will have athlete statistics on live data from games that are almost over and some might be just starting. In other words, contestants might show up at the specialized slot machine when all of the games are beginning and some when the games are ending. However, this feature of the various adds another exciting element into the equation. It is important to remember that all contestants in a given group will bid on athletes that are at the same juncture in their real time\/live action games. The prepared contestant is going to have an idea how the action in various games is unfolding to make a more educated bid during the bidding process. Again, how athletes are valued at any given time is no different than the fluctuations of the stock market. This feature is exactly why real time\/live action play redefines what slot play is all about.","The fantasy sports slot machine embodiments based on real time\/live action events as described herein provide a unique idea that has never been seen in the market. In these example embodiments, the contestants themselves do not constitute the real time\/live action event(s), rather it is the game itself that uses real time\/live action events as the competition unfolds. These example embodiments fundamentally change the way slot machines are currently used. Slot machine players are suddenly playing with the outcomes that are based on events that are unfolding as they are playing. This adds a dimension to slot machines that has never been provided before.","In order to make these fantasy sports slot machine embodiments possible, there are four key elements that are new to the fantasy sports genre that these embodiments introduce and that support the implementation. These four key elements include the following:\n\n","This betting line can also create betting situations other than for the winner and loser of a hypothetical sporting contest. An example embodiment can establish a betting line over or under the total fantasy points scored between the two teams in a hypothetical fantasy match, one team in the contest or individual athletes (or groups of athletes) in that contest\u2014much like they do in real live sports betting. The big difference, though, is that all of the betting is based on fantasy points and hypothetical teams competing in fantasy sports contests.",">An Example Embodiment Providing a Specialized Slot Machine for Implementing:","Fantasy Sports Books",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0207","num":"0617"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 9"]},"Fantasy sports games have become a cultural phenomenon. People select their teams and then compete against other individuals. These hypothetical teams have become so real to people that, in some cases, they pull harder for their fantasy teams than their local hometown team.","If people are creating hypothetical or imaginary teams to play against other hypothetical teams, why not have a betting line for these games too? In other words, one application of fantasy sports that hasn't emerged is a sports books format that mimics the sports betting on real life games. For example, people might make a $200 bet that the San Francisco 49ers beat the N.Y. Jets in a football game as long as they get seven points. If the 49ers lose by 7 points or less (or win outright), the person who made the bet wins. If the 49ers lose by 8 or more points, then the person who made the bet loses.","This betting format can apply directly to imaginary fantasy sports teams as well. A gaming institution, using the fantasy sports book format as described herein, could make up their own fantasy sports \u201cgames\u201d that mimic real life games and support bets made on the fantasy sports games.

For example, the betting line can fluctuate based on: 1) the individual matchups the athletes have in their real life games, and 2) the real life betting action that is happening on these matchups. In cases where an athlete is scratched at the last moment and doesn't play, the scratched athlete could potentially create chaos. In these situations, the athlete can be given their current seasonal average (rounded to the nearest whole number) as their fantasy point total for the match. If it is the first set up games for a season, their average fantasy game score from the previous season can be used.","Finally, betting lines for other elements of the imaginary fantasy sports game can also be offered. For example, an over\/under for the total fantasy points these two teams combine for can be bet on. The over\/under for fantasy points for each team can be bet on. The over\/under for each athlete or group of athletes can be bet on.

The specialized fantasy sports slot machine can also allow contestants to submit multiple entries simultaneously\u2014by both methods described above.","The number of athletes the fantasy sports lottery format will require can be five, six, or another number depending on the sport. The fantasy sports lottery format can also select a power ball athlete. For some sports, the athletes can be required to fit specific positions on the field. Football, for example, would require a selection process of exactly one QB, two RB's, two WR's, one TE and one Flex (e.g., the flex athlete can be any RB, WR, or TE who wasn't already selected) for each entry. For other sports, like baseball, the contestant can be asked for each entry to pick six position ballplayers and one power ball without concern for position (as long as the position is not a pitcher for the slugger's game and not a slugger for the pitcher's game).","Once contestants can no longer submit entries, all lineups are then locked and the fantasy sports lottery system of an example embodiment can calibrate and determine the percentage of fantasy points each athlete will be worth in their game (or series of games) that encompasses the lottery timeframe. For example, for the football lottery, let's assume that one hour before kickoff in the first Sunday NFL\u2122 football game, no more entries can be submitted by contestants in the fantasy sports lottery. At that point, contestants can go to a fantasy sports lottery website to see what percentage each athlete is worth. Moreover, during this one hour time period before the first kickoff, the bonus athletes can be drawn and their new percentages can be displayed too.","Lottery players often like to play different types of games. A fun variation in an alternative embodiment is a Fantasy Eliminator game. This is a game where contestants have to stay in the top 50% tier or they are eliminated as the real life fantasy contests are progressing. To illustrate the operation of this game format, an example embodiment is described below with football as the example fantasy sports game.","Assume there are separate Fantasy Eliminator games for both the AM (early) and PM (late) Sunday NFL\u2122 games. Let's choose the AM (early) games for the purposes of this example. The selection process would follow all of the rules already described above for the general game format. That is, contestants would select their athletes, the duplication penalties would be calculated by the fantasy sports lottery system of an example embodiment, and then the bonus athletes would be announced and their updated percentages added to the mix.","The Fantasy Eliminator game would begin with a timing mechanism that starts with the kickoff of the last morning (early) NFL\u2122 football game. Once this happens, every ten minutes (or other pre-determined time period) that goes by, the bottom 50% of the field is eliminated. This process continues with the clock running and 50% of the field eliminated every ten minutes (or other pre-determined time period). The only time this clock stops is when every single game is on a halftime break\u2014at the same time\u2014and there is no NFL\u2122 action from any of the morning (early) games. If this never happens, the clock will never stop until the last morning (early) game is complete. The clock resumes during situations when all games are in halftime the moment one of the contests resumes its third quarter action.","A typical NFL\u2122 football contest runs for about three hours. Assuming there will be a ten minute interval where no games are going on during the approximate halftime time slot; this leaves approximately 17 ten minute intervals during the course of the morning (early) games. Let's assume 5 million people signed up to play the Fantasy Eliminator game.

The contestant will be guaranteed that each athlete will play in their game. If an athlete on a scratcher does not play in their game, the athlete's fantasy point per game average can be used for their score.","Scoring systems can vary depending on the sport. In general, the five athletes on a scratcher must score about 10% higher across the board on their fantasy points per game average to enable the contestant to get their money back. The object of the game is for the athletes on the scratcher to score a combined number of fantasy points that puts them in the winner's circle. The better the combined score of the athletes on the scratcher, the more money the contestant can win. For example, the sum of the athletes' fantasy points for a particular game might warrant that the fantasy score for the five athletes is ten points higher than their seasonal average.

This happens when multipliers are introduced for prioritizing a given athlete over others.","Caps\u2014The process of creating an upper bound (it can be extremely high) for the number of fantasy players that can participate in a given qualifying tournament. It is essential to coordinate the upper bounds of all the qualifying tournaments with each other so that the fixed number of seats in the Main Event tournament is not exceeded.","Contingency Lineup\u2014When a fantasy player is required to submit a second lineup (or possibly more) from games later in the day. This second lineup is contingent upon them advancing from proceedings that happened using the first lineup (or prior lineup). The reason a contingency lineup is needed is because there is not enough time to submit a new lineup after the fantasy player advanced to the next round.","Draft Room\u2014Place where fantasy players get together to draft athletes.

A lottery effect is the very undesirable result of having so many fantasy players entered in a tournament that there is no longer enough room to have them play each other in head-to-head matchups. There are several reasons why the lottery effect continues to occur for tournaments that don't limit the number of entries. Primarily, it is because of the strong sentiment for keeping with tradition. Fantasy tournament organizers are reluctant to alter the format of the way the game has traditionally been played. This mindset has definitely helped preserve tradition, but it has come at a price. It has stifled creativity.","Tournament organizers have not been able to identify at least four key characteristics required for a Holy Grail type of fantasy sports tournament.

First, it is necessary to minimally identify what these four features are and then, just as importantly, provide solutions so that these features can all appear together in the same tournament\u2014solutions that must incorporate outside-the-box thinking or the task becomes unwieldy. The various embodiments as described herein provide these features and solutions.","There are at least four key features that should be in the same tournament structure to produce an effective tournament. These features include the following: 1) entry fees must be a nominal (e.g., low cost, low risk for the consumer) cost to the consumer so the masses can afford to play; 2) the grand prize must be a multi-million dollar grand prize (it has to be life-changing money where the winner minimally becomes a millionaire after taxes) so the masses will enthusiastically desire to play; 3) participants must not be subjected to playing the entire field or large numbers of contestants at the same time to discourage the masses\u2014skill must always be a factor in the tournament; and 4) there must be a re-entry component that allows fantasy players an option to continue getting back into the tournament for as long as possible.","Low entry fee\u2014A tournament with a large prize pool must attract the masses or it is doomed. Tournament organizers would much rather have 5 million people pay $1 and generate 5 million dollars as opposed to 50,000 people paying $100 and generating 5 million dollars. There is a much higher probability that more people will pay a lower cost buy-in. The key concept here is that a low risk entry point for the consumer, especially for a chance at a high reward like a multi-million dollar prize, is always more successful than a high risk entry point even if the reward is something much higher like 10 million dollars. In an example embodiment, the low risk entry point for the consumer can be considered to be a buy-in of less than or equal to $50 per fantasy player or per entry. In another example embodiment, the low risk entry point for the consumer can be considered to be a buy-in of less than or equal to $5 per fantasy player or per entry.","A Multi-Million dollar Grand Prize\u2014A multi-million dollar grand prize guarantees that the winner will have tremendous incentive to play\u2014especially since the buy-in cost is so low. This type of opportunity creates a frenzied climate where people start believing they have to get into the tournament, especially if the risk is low as provided by the low cost buy-in of the first element of the tournament format described herein.","Group Play\u2014Tournaments that enable fantasy players of a fantasy sports tournament to be partitioned into a plurality of player groups thereby enabling competition in small groups where fantasy players are allowed to advance to the next round create more entries and more value, because contestants have the belief they have a chance to advance to the next round. Conversely, forcing fantasy players to simultaneously beat the entire field (which could be millions of people) is suffocating, because people won't believe they can advance so they won't enter. This is deadly for a tournament that has to cover a multi-million dollar prize pool with low cost (e.g., $5) entries.","Re-Entry Component\u2014The only way that a tournament that charges low cost (e.g., $5) entry fees for a chance to win a multi-million dollar grand prize can be successful is if people continue to circulate back into the tournament if they get knocked out. People are much more willing to spend $200 on tournament entry fees if the fees are paid in increments of $5 and $10 dollars over a two or three month time span as opposed to a one time up-front payment. If there is no re-entry component, a potential $200 customer only gets one chance to spend $5. This is a recipe to render a high stakes fantasy sports tournament insolvent very quickly.","In the various embodiments described herein, a re-entry component only has meaning when a tournament has a progression of rounds so that players can either immediately advance to the next round as if they weren't eliminated, return back to the round that they were eliminated, start over again in the same position they originally entered or completely re-enter under a different round structure. The FanDuel tournament is a good example to illustrate what is NOT a re-entry format. FanDuel has 24 different one round qualifying tournaments that they use for people to get into their Main Event. This would not be considered a re-entry type of tournament because it doesn't have a progression of rounds.","Creating a Spacing Mechanism\u2014The inability to create a spacing mechanism that allows millions of people to play in a fantasy sports tournament while not subjecting them to a Lottery Effect has been a significant roadblock to holding an effective tournament for the fantasy sports industry. The embodiments described herein create a spacing mechanism that now makes it possible to hold fantasy sports tournaments where people can enter for a low cost entry fee (e.g., under $100 or even less than $5) and win a high value (e.g., multi-million dollar) grand prize. There are two important features that the embodiments described herein provide to allow this spacing to happen in a sports fantasy tournament. These features are: 1) group play within a tournament, and 2) advancing instead of winning. These features are described below.","The feature of group play within a tournament\u2014No other fantasy sports tournament in existence uses group play (as a matter of fact, group play doesn't exist for any fantasy sports contests\u2014tournament or no tournament). Yet, group play is the only way to create the spacing that allows a low entry fee while at the same time not forcing fantasy players to compete against the entire field simultaneously. The reason for this is that group play allows tournament organizers to create ratios other than the standard 2:1 ratio where one person advances per two people playing. Nobody has ever introduced a group play format for fantasy tournaments.","The feature of advancing instead of winning\u2014Meeting a minimum threshold to advance (as opposed to having to win to advance) is an important feature that no other tournament format uses to create the right ratios for spacing. Group play allows participants the opportunity to advance without necessarily having to win to move on in a tournament. For example, a group of 12 can permit the top 3 players to advance.","A high stakes fantasy sports tournament involving millions of players cannot operate using a traditional draft. It simply takes too long which is lethal for what is needed to make the tournament successful. Long drawn out drafts means fantasy players won't have the time to purchase multiple entries. Multiple entries are an important element to support this type of tournament format. There is no way a tournament that charges a nominal entry fee and awards a multi-million dollar grand prize can survive unless a large number of players are buying multiple entries. This makes it important to eliminate traditional drafts. The high stakes fantasy sports tournament format described herein can eliminate the need for a traditional draft. There are five features listed below that are employed in various embodiments described herein to eliminate traditional drafts. Each of these features involve a blind submission process where the participants in a group or match play event don't know what their opponents have submitted","Duplication Penalties Feature\u2014In an example embodiment, fantasy players are penalized points (e.g., the players' point totals are reduced) from their athletes' actual fantasy points earned based on how many other fantasy players in their group selected that athlete. For example, if a fantasy player is the only one to select a particular athlete, that fantasy player gets the particular athlete at 100% of the athlete's fantasy point value. However, if three other fantasy players in the group also submit\/select that particular athlete, the three other fantasy players in the group would all get that particular athlete for their lineup, but each of the three fantasy players may only get 75% (or some other percentage less than 100%) of the actual fantasy points earned by the particular athlete.","Multipliers Feature\u2014Athletes are selected based on desirability. The higher a fantasy player values the athlete, the higher the multiplier is for their fantasy points. If there are five athletes selected, the first slotted athlete might get five times their fantasy points, the second slotted athlete might get four times their fantasy points, etc.","Feature for Slotting Athletes on a Percentage Continuum\u2014Athletes can be selected and slotted on a scale ranging from any percentages that a tournament organizer decides. For example, the first slot can be for 100%, the second slot can be for 85%, the third slot for 70%, etc. This allows fantasy players to select the same athletes, but the fantasy players might have their athletes valued at different percentages.","Feature for Disqualifying Athletes that are Duplicated\u2014Disqualifying athletes that are duplicated is an especially effective feature in head-to-head matches. If both fantasy players in a match submit the same athlete, that athlete is disqualified and cannot be resubmitted.","Blind Percentage Bid Feature\u2014Fantasy players are required to not only submit an athlete, but also a bid specifying a percentage of their fantasy points they will get for the match. For cases when both fantasy players select the same athlete, the bid is used by the example embodiment to decide who gets the athlete. The fantasy player who bids the lower percentage of fantasy points gets the athlete. For example, if fantasy player A is willing to take a given athlete at 73% of their fantasy points and fantasy player B is only willing to take the given athlete at 98% of their fantasy points, then fantasy player A would receive this athlete, but would only receive 73% percent of the fantasy points that athlete scored in the match. If both fantasy players bid the same percentage, nobody would get that athlete.","Specific Re-entry Strategies of an Example Embodiment\u2014The only way that a high stakes fantasy sports tournament can charge a nominal buy-in fee and offer a high value grand prize is if there is a re-entry component that allows fantasy players an option to continue getting back into the tournament for as long as possible. The various embodiments described herein provide at least two re-entry features that have never been used before. These re-entry features are described below.","Re-entry Feature for Paying More Money to Play Fewer Rounds\u2014When a fantasy player is eliminated and their opponent moves on, it would be inherently unfair to let the loser back in unless a fair accommodation was made. One method for letting somebody back in is to create another qualifying option that has fewer rounds (because there isn't as much time left until the tournament concludes), but charges the person a re-entry fee that is at a higher cost level than their opponent had to pay for their entry. For example, a fantasy player might only pay $5 to play in a 10 round qualifier and another fantasy player might pay $500 to play in a three round qualifier.","Re-entry Feature for Creating New Qualifiers with the Same Number of Rounds\u2014This feature allows a fantasy player to continue playing in a new qualifier, but creates new paths to duplicate the same number of rounds that fantasy players who are still playing are required to play. This process is not as simple as it may sound; but, the capability is highly desirable, because it allows people to re-enter at very low prices and retains the fairness of the tournament. To create the new paths, an example embodiment can hold multiple rounds in the same day or even multiple rounds in the same game. This is because the qualifying tournament sometimes has only one day to duplicate the many rounds that another player took many weeks to complete. The various embodiments create new qualifiers to duplicate the same number of rounds by manipulating a smaller time period to create the same number of rounds thereby enabling the re-entry price to remain fixed.","Creating a Format for Condensed Seasons and Events\u2014Many real life sporting seasons and events are so condensed that the only way to hold a viable high stakes fantasy tournament is to hold two or more rounds on the same day. For example, it is difficult to hold a high stakes fantasy tournament for the Olympics, World Cup of Soccer, or even the NFL\u2122 playoffs where millions of fantasy players can play for a low entry fee, win a high value prize, and still play in groups. The various embodiments described herein provide a format that supports these condensed seasons and events. At least two features provided by an example embodiment enable these types of tournaments to be feasible. These features are described below.","Feature for Contingency Lineups\u2014Fantasy players must submit two or more lineups during the same day for events that are happening throughout the day. Any lineup other than the initial one is a contingency lineup and only goes into effect if that fantasy player has advanced to the round where the contingency lineup becomes relevant.","Feature for Group Play throughout the tournament\u2014In most cases, it is desirable to hold qualifying tournaments that involve group play to qualify fantasy players for the main tournament. During the main tournament, because there will be a fewer number of players, the tournament format can revert to the more traditional match play where fantasy players compete against a single opponent. Sometimes, it is simply not possibly to have any match play (e.g., head-to-head play), because the time frame is so short (like the Olympic Games). In cases like these, the feature for group play between fantasy players as described herein is used exclusively for these condensed tournaments so that the tournaments still can have the four essential ingredients that a thriving fantasy sports tournament must have as described herein.","The various embodiments as described herein provide the systems and methods (solutions) required for a fantasy sports machine or program that allows an unlimited number of fantasy players to enter a fantasy sports tournament without requiring them to play the entire field at the same time. The various embodiments as described herein are not tied to a particular fantasy sports game. Rather, the various embodiments provide a how-to guide for the features required to create a tournament format that is not currently available on the market. Before going into detail, some background information is helpful to understand some key practices that have created barriers for this new type of format.","Fantasy sports has become a multi-billion dollar industry that continues to grow exponentially. Emerging from this incredible growth has been a culture that has created certain expectations for how a fantasy tournament should look. Unfortunately, these expectations have not always been conducive for progress and have actually hindered the development of new types of formats. Factors that have contributed to this mindset and impeded progress include the common practices, beliefs and expectations that are described below.","Once such common practice is the practice of fantasy players competing against each other in a head-to-head format whenever possible. This is a by-product of how real life sports teams compete. The reasoning seems to be that you don't see three football teams competing against each other in the same game; therefore, you shouldn't have three fantasy players competing against each other in the same fantasy match. The only exception to this rule occurs when lottery type of tournaments are played. During lottery tournaments fantasy players are strictly vying for the high point total often against millions of others over the course of a given time period, which means they are all playing each other at the same time\u2014a very discouraging method of competing.","Other factors impeding progress include the tendency of fantasy tournament organizers to preserve the tradition of league play within the tournament structure. League play is where anywhere from eight to twenty fantasy players form a league to compete head-to-head in order to determine which person has the best overall record. This is an extremely entertaining format; but, it is a disaster for fantasy tournaments that seek to crown an overall champion. The problem is that once leagues are formed, inferior fantasy players are kept in the tournament far too long which creates spacing problems.","Another factor is the reluctance to eliminate fantasy competitors early on in the tournament\u2014even when they are doing poorly. As a general rule, fantasy players consider fantasy sports to be an entertainment outlet for the entire season. Early elimination from a tournament runs counter to this fundamental expectation.","Another factor is the practice of fantasy players exclusively owning their athletes. Once again, this mirrors how the real world of sports works. You don't see more than one team in real life sports share ownership of the same athlete, so the reasoning is that it shouldn't happen in fantasy games either. The only exception in the fantasy arena, once again, is with lottery style tournaments where the sharing of athletes is permitted out of necessity. This is due to the fact that there are not enough athletes to go around when the entire field of competitors are simultaneously playing one another. However, even though lottery tournaments allow sharing, they still don't have a system in place that penalizes fantasy players for duplicating athletes.","Another factor is the limited strategy inherent in submitting lineups in conventional tournament formats. In standard formats, what one fantasy player submits has no bearing on what their opponent submits in terms of potential bonuses or penalties. This creates a relatively stress free process, but may also create inefficiencies.","Another factor is the inability of many fantasy enthusiasts to differentiate between the actual fantasy games that have created a cultural phenomenon (and frankly don't need to be changed) and separate them from the flawed tournament structures that need an overhaul.","The solutions to address these barriers are not obvious. Some of them run counter to deeply entrenched beliefs on how fantasy sports games should be played. If they were obvious, people would be holding Holy Grail tournaments using the format described herein. There would be scores of tournaments where competitors could enter for a $5 entry fee, win a multi-million dollar grand prize, not be subjected to the daunting parameters of having to compete against the entire field at the same time, and also have an opportunity to re-enter the tournament without creating a competitive disadvantage for any of the players. However, in currently used tournament formats, the opposite of this is true. There isn't a single tournament on the market that has all of these features.","It is difficult to quantify how big this void is in the fantasy sports industry by not having a Holy Grail tournament structure. In many respects, the lack of an effective tournament format has been devastating for the industry. There has been so much interest in fantasy sports events, but current structures have not been an effective vehicle for delivering an all-comers tournament.","In the various embodiments described herein, there are at least four features that when combined together create a fantasy sports tournament that can attract the masses. These features include the following: 1) a low entry fee (buy-in); 2) a multi-million dollar grand prize; 3) participants must not be subjected to playing the entire field or large numbers of contestants at the same time to discourage the masses; and 4) a re-entry component.","In the previous section, six common practices were discussed that have impeded the progress for a Holy Grail tournament as described herein. Each of these common practices along with their non-obvious solution(s) is described in more detail below. It is important to note that these solutions don't have to appear in a particular order. Not all of them even need to be present to operate a successful Holy Grail tournament; although, the more solutions that are incorporated into the tournament structure, the more effective the tournament will be.","A first common practice in traditional tournament structures is the practice of fantasy players exclusively competing against each other in either head-to-head or lottery type formats. The various embodiments described herein provide a non-obvious solution or feature to address this common practice. In an example embodiment, fantasy players compete in small player groups of three or more in the same match. This feature of the example embodiment runs counter to what fantasy players think should happen. Fantasy players are used to their sports teams competing head-to-head so they expect the same from their fantasy matchups. As implemented in the example embodiment, a group is not the same as a league. A player group is defined as a small cluster of fantasy players who are put together to compete against one another in a single match. Leagues have groups of fantasy players competing against one another in head-to-head matches. This format only allows two fantasy players to compete against each another at the same time. For the purposes of this patent disclosure, a group is defined as three or more fantasy players who compete against each another at the same time. This format of the example embodiment with groups of three or more creates much needed spacing that allows more fantasy players to enter without subjecting them to the Lottery Effect.","A second common practice in traditional tournament structures is the tendency of fantasy tournament organizers to preserve the tradition of \u201cleague play\u201d within the tournament structure. The various embodiments described herein provide a non-obvious solution or feature to address this common practice. In an example embodiment, a solution is implemented to eliminate the under-performing participants in a consistent and timely manner. In an effective tournament structure, it is simply not possible to keep low performing fantasy players in a tournament that looks to crown an overall champion, especially when there are millions of entries in the tournament. It creates a spacing nightmare, because nobody goes away until it is too late. There is no way to whittle millions of fantasy players down to one overall champion if the tournament format doesn't eliminate the participants in a consistent and timely manner. Current formats tend to start their elimination process way too late in the tournament. In one embodiment, a solution paradigm is to create single elimination fantasy sports tournaments. This format requires fantasy players to meet a minimum expectation for every round in which they play or they are immediately eliminated. It doesn't matter if it is the first round, the last round or any round in between. The expectation might be that they have to beat a single opponent in a head-to-head format or the expectation might be that they have to finish in the top four of their player group to advance. Whatever it is, there has to be a minimum expectation to remain in for every round. A single elimination type of format is common in sports and can be found in tennis, the NFL\u2122 playoffs and the NCAA college basketball playoffs.","A third common practice in traditional tournament structures is the reluctance to eliminate fantasy competitors early on in the tournament, even when they are doing poorly. As a general rule, fantasy players consider fantasy sports to be an entertainment outlet for the entire season. Early elimination from a tournament runs counter to this fundamental expectation. The various embodiments described herein provide a non-obvious solution or feature to address this common practice\/problem. As described above, a single elimination tournament structure helps to address the problem of slow elimination of under-performing players. However, this solution does not address the finality of getting eliminated quickly in the tournament. In an example embodiment, a solution is implemented to offset this problem by creating non-lottery effect qualifying tournaments that are staggered throughout the beginning of a given sports season and that provide a re-entry component. This allows the tournament to immediately eliminate or disqualify fantasy players that lose during a given round, but also provides an opportunity for them to opt back into the tournament by paying a new entry fee. The end result of this paradigm is that fantasy players can play in the tournament for quite some time like they traditionally have, but it also creates a format to hold a single round elimination tournament where fantasy players are eliminated if they lose a particular match. Some fantasy tournaments may appear to offer a re-entry component, but they really aren't. Each week they are holding a new lottery with the winner gaining a seat into the main tournament. In contrast, the embodiments described herein provide a system and method enabling fantasy players to have the opportunity to buy their way back into a tournament and still compete in small player groups without penalizing the players who advanced from the previous round(s). There are two ways to do this. First, fantasy players can pay higher fees to replace the rounds that they skipped to buy back into the tournament. Secondly, a method as disclosed herein is provided to allow fantasy players back into the tournament for the same price, yet replicating the same number of rounds that contestants who signed up earlier, and have already advanced at least one round, are required to play. In this manner, re-entry players do not gain an advantage over players who advanced from the previous round(s).","A fourth common practice in traditional tournament structures is the practice of fantasy players exclusively owning their athletes. This is a universal practice in traditional tournaments with the exception of lottery effect tournaments. The various embodiments described herein provide a non-obvious solution or feature to address this common practice. For tournament play, it is not practical to have a draft before every round. Moreover, if group play is a feature of the tournament, there has to be a system in place where athletes are selected quickly. The best way to do this is to permit duplication of athletes similar to what is done in lottery tournaments; but only if duplication of athletes comes at a price. There must be penalties for duplication of athletes. The way to accomplish this is to have a blind submission process where the more a given athlete is duplicated, the fewer fantasy points everyone in the player group that selected that athlete receives.","A fifth common practice in traditional tournament structures is the limited strategy that currently exists with submitting lineups. With current formats, what one fantasy player submits has almost no bearing at all on what their opponent submits in terms of potential bonuses and penalties. The various embodiments described herein provide a non-obvious solution or feature to address this common practice. As mentioned in the previous point, the example embodiment penalizes fantasy players for duplication of athletes. This is not the only way to penalize them though. The example embodiment is also configured to penalize fantasy players for not valuing a given athlete highly enough. This will force fantasy players to evaluate athletes not only on merit, but also on the likelihood that several other competitors in their player group might potentially select the same athletes. Also, the example embodiment is configured to offer bonuses by weighting the athletes. This can be done by requiring fantasy players to submit lineups with a listing of athletes in order of preference. The higher the athlete is ranked or \u201cslotted\u201d, the more potential bonus points the player will receive. This will create strategy where fantasy players really have to think about where their athletes should be placed on the lineup and create a climate where competing fantasy players try to out-think each other.","A sixth common practice in traditional tournament structures is the inability of many fantasy enthusiasts to differentiate between the actual fantasy games that have created a cultural phenomenon (and frankly don't need to be changed) and separate this from the flawed tournament structures that need to be fixed. Fantasy sports games are so compelling that it makes it less likely that people will look to find out-of-the-box solutions for fixing flawed tournaments formats for fear of incurring the wrath of fantasy players. As a result, the status quo remains in place. In contrast, the various embodiments described herein provide a non-obvious set of solutions or features to address the failures of the traditional tournament structures.","The various embodiments of systems and methods for creating a Holy Grail tournament are described herein. The tournament format in an example embodiment utilizes a two tiered structure. First, qualifying tournaments are used to qualify fantasy players that feed directly into a main event tournament. Secondly, a main tournament is used to determine an overall winner as well as other top finishers. It is important to note that individual features within each of these two tournament formats don't necessarily have to be in the order described. Some are not even required to hold a Holy Grail tournament, but are listed to enhance the quality of the tournament. Finally, the idea of having qualifying tournaments to get into a main event isn't unprecedented. The problem with what is currently available is that all variations fall into the trap of either offering one of the two variations (Head-to-Head or Lottery Effect) that was described earlier. For example, FanDuel offers a Main Event where hundreds or even thousands of people are forced to compete against one another simultaneously to try and qualify for the Main Event. It is extremely discouraging for fantasy players to enter a tournament knowing that the only way to gain entry into the Main Event is if they post the highest score out of several hundred or thousand people.","Qualifying Tournaments","The goal is to create a predetermined number of qualifying tournaments that feed into a Main Event tournament. In an example embodiment, these qualifying tournaments have the following features. Matches are played in small groups of three or more fantasy players. A predetermined number of \u201cwinning\u201d fantasy players advance to the next qualifying round (or qualify directly into the Main Event tournament). For example, if groups are set at 12 members each, it might be determined that the top three scores in each group will advance. The particular scoring system for determining fantasy points for an athlete can be any that is commonly used or one that is completely new to the industry. Fantasy players submit their lineups via a blind submission process. The more duplication that occurs for a given athlete during this blind submission process, the less they will be worth. There is a re-entry component that allows contestants to opt back in either by 1) by allowing them to pay more money for playing less rounds or 2) allowing them to re-enter at the same price by duplicating the number of rounds that advancing contestants have been required to play. If they re-enter by paying more money for less rounds there might be a qualifying tournament where it only takes advancing four rounds to qualify directly into the Main Event tournament and there might be a qualifying tournament that takes nine rounds to advance to the Main Event Tournament. The qualifying tournament that takes more rounds to qualify would be less expensive to enter. There is also an alternative version that can be used instead of the version previously described. If they re-enter by paying the same amount of money, that particular qualifying tournament would have to have the same number of rounds. This format requires creating options to include more and more rounds in a shorter period of time. What ends up happening is that individual rounds are contested in different ways than the earlier rounds (see Explanation #4 below). Portions of some qualifying tournaments can run concurrently with other qualifying tournaments while other portions don't have to run concurrently. Fantasy players can purchase multiple entries for the same qualifying tournament. Fantasy players can enter more than one qualifying tournament at the same time. The Main Event tournament has a predetermined number of seats; therefore, it is critical that the satellite rounds are capped at an appropriate number so that there aren't more fantasy players qualifying for the Main Event tournament than there are seats available. Qualifying rounds can have several different types of formats for weighting athletes depending on where they are slotted (see Explanation #1).","Main Event tournament","Main Event consists of fantasy players who advanced via qualifying tournaments or directly buying in. The number of seats available for fantasy players in the Main Event is predetermined before the tournament even started. Main Event can either be a head-to-head format or a continuation of group play. If the Main Event is head-to-head, fantasy players are randomly assigned an opponent. If there is nobody to whom they can be assigned, they receive a bye to the next round. If the Main Event is group play, then a predetermined number of fantasy players advance from each group for a given round. For the final group, during the last round, fantasy players play for final positions. In an example embodiment, the scoring system for the Main Event should be a simple scoring system that fantasy players are familiar with from whatever sport the tournament is featuring. The Main Event should have a predetermined number of seats to ensure that it is possible to crown an overall champion as well as recognize top finishers.","The following description illustrates one example of a step-by-step explanation of how a Holy Grail tournament works in an example embodiment. Again, these steps are interchangeable in many places and some of them aren't even required.","Step #1\u2014Fantasy players are presented with different options for entering a qualifying tournament. They will find that the more rounds a qualifying tournament offers, the less expensive they are to play in (see Explanation #3 and Table 1 in the Appendix below). Table 1 shows a satellite tournament structure for a fantasy sports tournament.","Step #2\u2014Caps are established by the computer program to ensure that there are not more seats allocated for the Main Event Tournament than it can support (see Table 2 in the Appendix below). Table 2 shows how caps are established for qualifying tournaments.","Step #3\u2014Once a fantasy player has entered a qualifier, they will be assigned a group. Group play is a technique that helps create the proper spacing a tournament needs to accommodate millions of fantasy players (see Explanation #2 below for different group formats). There are two ways groups can be filled. They can either be filled one group at a time (see ) to ensure that each group has the maximum number of fantasy players established by the tournament rules or, instead, a predetermined number of groups can be established and fantasy players are placed into the groups in a manner where each group receives their first fantasy player before a second is added in and so on (see ).","Step #4\u2014Fantasy players are required to turn in their lineups via a blind submission process (see  and ). Fantasy players will have to take into consideration how athletes are weighted and also the likelihood of being duplicated (see Explanation #1 below).","Step #5\u2014The scoring system can be a commonly used and accepted format.","Step #6\u2014The computer program of an example embodiment calculates the fantasy point value each athlete is worth based on duplication of athletes (see Table 3 and Table 4 in the Appendix below). Table 3 shows how a given athlete loses a percentage of their fantasy points based on two or more fantasy players selecting that same athlete for their lineups. Table 4 shows the calculations of several athletes' recalibrated fantasy points based on how much duplication occurred.","Step #7\u2014If a player fails to get their lineup in for a match, their previous lineup will be submitted as a default lineup for the match by the computer program of an example embodiment.","Step #8\u2014Live athletic competition in the corresponding sport takes place. The computer program of an example embodiment has ongoing scoring updates and shows each fantasy player, their running score, and where they rank overall in their group.","Step #9\u2014Once all of the real life sporting events are completed that are relevant to the group fantasy match, the computer program of an example embodiment tabulates final scores based on the given weighting and duplication systems used for the match (see Table 5 in the Appendix below). Table 5 shows a final tally of a fantasy match that incorporates both weighting bonuses and duplication penalties.","Step #10\u2014The computer program of an example embodiment determines a cutoff for each group. The number of fantasy players that are qualified to advance for a given round of the qualifying process move onto the next qualifying round (or move onto the Main Event Tournament if they advance during the last qualifying round) and the remaining members of the group are eliminated (see ).","Step #11\u2014The process begins anew for qualifying rounds and the first ten steps are repeated over and over until a fantasy player is either eliminated or qualifies for the Main Event Tournament. Fantasy players can either re-enter by buying into a new qualifying tournament or they have advanced from a previous round of a qualifying tournament and are placed in a group for the new round.","Step #12\u2014For Main Event Tournament rounds, the same format is in place if group play is in effect. The only exception is for the last round of the tournament where fantasy players compete for final positions instead of trying to advance. If the Main Event Tournament is structured in a head-to-head format, fantasy players are randomly assigned to play in a particular match. Each single match (keep in mind that the number of matches is predetermined) must have one fantasy player assigned to it before assignments for an opponent are made (see ).","Step #13\u2014Any match that has only one fantasy player assigned to it results in that fantasy player receiving a bye for the round and automatically advancing to the next round (see ).","Step #14\u2014If for some reason there isn't a fantasy player assigned to a match, a double bye is declared and a \u201cbye\u201d will be entered into the mix for the next round. The fantasy player that is assigned this bye will be awarded a bye during that new round and will move on to the next round (see ).","Step #15\u2014The format for the match will be determined (see Explanation #2 for different match formats).","Step #16\u2014The scoring system can be a commonly used and accepted format.","Step #17\u2014The fantasy player with the better score moves on to the next round, the loser is eliminated from the tournament.","Step #18\u2014The last two standing will play for the championship with the fantasy player with the higher fantasy point total earning the tournament championship and their opponent earning the runner-up position.","Explanation #1\u2014Weighting the point values of fantasy players based on a) the slotted position in which an athlete was selected, and\/or b) how many fantasy players selected them. Weighting athletes based on how they were prioritized and\/or how often they were duplicated is a process that forces fantasy players to think very carefully about which athletes they submit and where they place them in their lineup hierarchy. This is especially true for formats that require fantasy players competing against each other to turn in their lineups via a blind submission process. A blind submission method is where all the fantasy players in a group competing against one another are required to turn in their lineups before they find out what the others in the group submitted.","The following are examples of some techniques used in an example embodiment to weight the players. Fantasy players are awarded multiples of the fantasy points their athletes scored depending on where their athletes were selected. For example, assume each fantasy player selects five athletes. For each fantasy player's first slotted athlete, the athlete could be worth five times the fantasy points they scored in their match. For each fantasy player's second slotted athlete, the athlete could be worth four times the fantasy points they scored in their match. For each fantasy player's third slotted athlete, the athlete could be worth three times the fantasy points they scored in their match. For each fantasy player's fourth slotted athlete, the athlete could be worth two times the fantasy points they scored in their match. For each fantasy player's fifth slotted athlete, the athlete could be worth face value of the fantasy points they scored in their match.

#2\u2014Structuring some or all of a tournament in groups of three or more players. Because sporting events are almost universally structured where either one team competes against another team (such as in football, basketball, baseball, etc.) or one individual competes against another individual (such as in boxing, wrestling, tennis, etc.) or individuals compete against the entire field simultaneously (such as in golf, motor sports, cycling, etc.), the fantasy sports industry has been a victim of these formats when it comes to creating tournaments for fantasy sports enthusiasts. For that reason, there has never been a fantasy tournament where an unlimited number of people can play without being subjected to playing the entire field at the same time. The various embodiments described herein provide a solution to this problem with existing fantasy tournaments.","Even though real life sporting events don't usually have seven teams compete against each other at the same time, there is no reason why this can't happen for a fantasy sports match. Instead of structuring fantasy tournaments as if they were real sporting events, there is no reason why the format can't look more like a card game with several players competing against one another simultaneously. This format allows more fantasy players to compete in the tournament without subjecting them to having to face the entire field at once.","There is little doubt that having fantasy players compete in small groups runs counter to how people think fantasy tournaments should be held. But, it is the only way to allow an unlimited number of players the opportunity to enter without subjecting them to competing against the entire field at the same time.","In the various example embodiments described herein, there are several specific formats that use a group play format (some are more effective than others because of the time it takes to create a full lineup to submit). These formats in an example embodiment include the following sample formats.","Group Tournament Type #1\u2014Using a Fantasy Draft\u2014Leagues of 10 to 12 people have been getting together and drafting for fantasy leagues since the origins of fantasy sports. However, the purpose of a draft in traditional leagues has always been to form a league where members of the group play each other in one-on-one matches throughout the season to see which fantasy owners emerge with the best records to playoff for the championship.","In the various embodiments described herein, an important distinction is made between traditional leagues and the small player groups used in the various embodiments. Instead of drafting to compete in a league as is traditionally done, small groupings of players come together (typically online) to draft for a single match where everyone in the group is playing everyone else in the group simultaneously. This simultaneous play between all members of the group does not occur in traditional leagues. In the various embodiments described herein, a predetermined number of top scores from this fantasy player group earn the right to advance to the next round. For example, a group of 12 entries (fantasy players) playing in a fantasy cricket tournament might end up drafting athletes with the understanding that the top 3 scores are to advance to the next round. The number of scores necessary to advance can be predetermined.","To conduct a Holy Grail tournament online using this particular format in accordance with an example embodiment described herein, fantasy players would pay a fee, which would automatically put them in an online draft room that is capped at a certain number of entries for a given group. The online draft room can be implemented as an online collection of users\/fantasy players in a manner similar to the way collections of online users can gather in a chat room. For example, the fantasy game might be rugby that allows ten entries (fantasy players) per group with the top two scores advancing to the next round. This doesn't necessarily mean that the group will ultimately end up with ten people; because, this is determined by when the first person of a given group enters the online draft room. Once the first person enters, a time limit is set (for example 20 minutes) for the group to fill up with ten people. Once it does, the draft starts immediately with the drafting order determined by when the players show up in the draft room. The earlier a person appears, the higher they draft. The draft can follow a serpentine format as defined above.","If not enough fantasy players fill the ten spaces, the draft begins when the allotted time has passed with however many people are in the draft room. If the number of people in the draft room is less than or equal to the number of fantasy players that are supposed to advance from a group determined by the tournament rules, the fantasy players automatically receive byes to the next round and do not compete in a match against each other for that round.","Group Tournament Type #2\u2014Holding a Fantasy Draft with a Bidding Twist\u2014Once again, the example embodiment provides a draft amongst a small group of fantasy players who compete against each other in a single match. Parts of the draft protocol are the same as the first tournament format described above. For instance, the mechanics of how the first person in the draft room starts the clock to determine the number of people that will be in the group is the same.","The draft rules are completely different though from a traditional draft. In this format, fantasy players don't necessarily get the athlete they draft. In this format of an example embodiment, every fantasy player is given a set amount of credits to spend in order to secure athletes. All members of the group can bid on an athlete who was drafted. For example, let's assume it is a fantasy football draft and every fantasy player is given 50 credits to secure one quarterback (QB), two running backs (RB's) and two wide receivers (WR's). The fantasy player who initially drafts a given football player automatically has a 1 credit bid for that player to kick off the bidding process. The draft bidding process then goes to the next fantasy player in the draft. The next fantasy player can either bid 2 or more credits (must bid in increments of 1\u2014can't use fractions) or \u201cpass\u201d to the next fantasy player in the draft.","Only when the draft bidding process goes through the entire group of fantasy players back to the person who has the highest bid on record, does the bidding end for this football player (athlete). The fantasy player who made the winning bid has the number of credits they bid deducted from their credit account. They are the only fantasy player in the group who is allowed to start that football player for their lineup. The draft then goes back to the original order where the second fantasy player drafting introduces a new football player on whom the fantasy players in the group can bid.","An example of the process for an 8 player group is set forth below:\n\n","If a fantasy player runs out of credits without filling up all of their positions, they no longer can bid and must wait for the free agent draft which comes immediately after the main draft. This free agent draft happens once everyone has either filled out an entire lineup or run out of credits. The free agent draft is then held only for the fantasy players who still have places to fill. This draft goes in reverse order from the original draft order. A fantasy player drafting can only take one football player when it is their turn. If they have more than one place to fill, they must wait until the drafting process comes back to them again. Once a fantasy player fills their entire roster, they are automatically dropped from the free agent draft.","Group Tournament Type #3\u2014Blind Submission Format\u2014Sharing Fantasy Points of Duplicated Athletes\u2014In an example embodiment, a blind submission format is utilized when lineup submissions happen exactly one time. Small groups competing against one another submit lineups for all required positions using a blind submission format (e.g., where fantasy players have to turn in their lineups without knowing what other fantasy players involved in the match selected). Duplication of athletes is permitted, but when this happens there is a penalty. All fantasy players who submitted a duplicated athlete will evenly split that athlete's point total for the match. For example, if eleven fantasy players competing in a fantasy soccer group have six of the fantasy players submit athlete, Lionel Messi for their lineup (i.e., a duplicated athlete), then those six fantasy players will evenly split however many fantasy points Messi scored in his game. In the case of multiple games, the six fantasy players would either split the average or split the total points. If Messi scored 14 fantasy points for his game, each fantasy player would receive 2.33 (rounded to nearest hundredth) fantasy points, because 14 divided by 6 equals 2.33.","This type of penalty creates a tremendous amount of strategy and elevates second tier players to the forefront. Fantasy players might opt to pass on superstars because lesser players have less of a chance of being duplicated. Sometimes these types of tournaments only have three to five starting positions to fill.","Group Tournament Type #4\u2014Blind Submission Format\u2014Lowering the Value of Duplicated Athletes\u2014This is a variation of the previous format. This format variation is also an effective way to hold a tournament where lineups can only be submitted one time. This format is also played where all members competing in a group submit lineups using a blind submission format. Once again, duplication of athletes is permitted, but the penalty is different from the previous format described above. The penalty for duplication is the reduction of the fantasy points an athlete scores. The more duplication that occurs, the less they are worth. For example, in fantasy baseball, if a 12 person group has only one member (fantasy player) who submits athlete, Albert Pujols, the member might get 100% of the fantasy points corresponding to the submitted athlete. If two members of that group selected athlete, Pujols, each selecting member might get only 90% of the selected athlete's fantasy points. If three people selected the same athlete, each selecting member might get only 80% of the selected athlete's fantasy points, and so on. The point reductions can range from a completely arbitrary system of penalties all the way to a very well-calibrated method.","The table set forth below is an example of an embodiment that determines what percentage of an athlete's points a given fantasy participant receives based completely on how many other competitors also selected that athlete. It is important to note that the percentages listed are arbitrary. Any percentages can be used that penalize fantasy players the more duplication of athlete selection that occurs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0400","num":"0900"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00024","num":"00024"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"294pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Percentage of Fantasy Points an Athlete is worth"},{"entry":"Based on Duplication of a Given Athlete Selected"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"13"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"13","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Athlete",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"selected",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"1X*","2X","3X","4X","5X","6X","7X","8X","9X","10X","11X","12X"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"13","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["3 player","100%","50%","\u20020%","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"]},{"entry":["fantasy",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["match",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["4 player","100%","67%","33%","\u20020%","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"]},{"entry":["fantasy",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["match",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["5 player","100%","75%","50%","25%","\u20020%","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"]},{"entry":["fantasy",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["match",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["6 player","100%","80%","60%","40%","20%","\u20020%","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"]},{"entry":["fantasy",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["match",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["7 player","100%","83%","67%","50%",{"u":{"@attributes":{"style":"single"},"b":"33"}},"17%","\u20020%","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA"]},{"entry":["fantasy",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["match",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["8 player","100%","86%","72%","58%","43%","28%","14%","\u20020%","NA","NA","NA","NA"]},{"entry":["fantasy",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["match",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["9 player","100%","87%","75%","62%","50%","38%","25%","13%","\u20020%","NA","NA","NA"]},{"entry":["fantasy",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["match",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["10 player","100%","89%","78%","67%","56%","45%","34%","23%","12%","\u20020%","NA","NA"]},{"entry":["fantasy",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["match",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["11 player","100%","90%","80%","70%","60%","50%","40%","30%","20%","10%","\u20020%","NA"]},{"entry":["fantasy",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["match",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["12 player","100%","91%","82%","73%","64%","55%","46%","37%","28%","19%","10%","0%"]},{"entry":["fantasy",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":"match"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"13","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*Note:"},{"entry":"1X is read as \u201cone time\u201d which means a given athlete was selected by exactly 1 of the 12 fantasy players."}]}}]}}},"The highlighted (bolded and underlined) percentage shown in the table above represents a seven player fantasy group where five of the fantasy players selected the same athlete.

Fantasy players in a group submit lineups along with a percentage next to the name of each athlete they submit. The percentage represents how small of a portion of an athlete's fantasy points they are willing to accept in order to secure that athlete for their lineup. In other words, a fantasy player is willing to give up some of the fantasy points a given athlete scores because they covet them so much. The fantasy player with the lowest bid wins that athlete. For example, if three fantasy players select athlete, Adrian Peterson to be their running back for a football tournament and the bids are 100%, 93% and 87%, then the fantasy player who bid 87% wins Peterson for their lineup. The catch is that the fantasy player who bid 87% would only get 87% of whatever Peterson's fantasy points are for a given game. The other two fantasy players not winning the athlete would have to submit a new athlete's name for this position during the next round of bidding. If two or more fantasy players submit the same winning bid for an athlete, each of the fantasy players would get that athlete in their lineup for the bid amount they presented. Once an athlete has been placed in at least one person's lineup in the group, the athlete cannot be bid on again by anyone for the match.","After the final round, a free agent draft is conducted using a computer generated drafting order. Only the fantasy players who don't have a complete lineup are eligible for the free agent draft. Fantasy players can only select one athlete when it is their turn in the free agent draft. If a fantasy player has multiple holes to fill in their lineup, the fantasy player must wait for their turn to select an athlete in the free agent draft process. Once a fantasy player has filled out their lineup from the free agent draft, they are automatically dropped from the draft.

The fantasy players in the free agent fantasy draft can select any baseball athlete (non-pitcher) that has not been selected by someone in the group. These free agents will each be worth 100% of their fantasy points.","Group Tournament Type #6\u2014Blind Submission Format\u2014Using a Cap This type of tournament can be done on a one shot basis, but is best used over multiple rounds of submissions. Fantasy players are allocated a certain number of credits for a blind submission process to fill in their lineups. The fantasy player that bids the highest for a given athlete earns the right to have the athlete in their lineup, while all the other members of the group lose the opportunity to play this athlete. Once the last round of submissions has passed, a free agent draft will be conducted for any fantasy player who still has lineup slots to fill. The free agent draft is for athletes who haven't been selected by anyone in the group.","A fantasy player may use all of their credits before the selection process has finished. If they happen to do this and they still have positions to fill, the fantasy player must wait until the free agent draft, which begins at the end of the last round of submissions. Also, if two or more fantasy players submit an identical bid and it turns out to be the highest one for a given athlete, each of them will enter this athlete into their lineups at the fantasy value they each submitted.","The tables below illustrate an example of a progression of an NBA fantasy basketball tournament. In this example, there are 12 fantasy players participating in the group. Each of them starts with 50 credits to fill 5 lineup positions. In this hypothetical tournament, the actual positions the NBA athletes play are irrelevant. A fantasy player can fill all the positions with forwards if they wish. Also, there is no requirement forcing a fantasy player to bid on all slots. If s\/he chooses, a fantasy player can strategically bid high for a couple of superstars and then rely on the free agent draft to fill their remaining roster slots.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0418","num":"0918"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00030","num":"00030"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"301pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Round 1 - NBA Athletes Submitted"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Athlete","Athlete","Athlete","Athlete","Athlete"]},{"entry":[{},"#1","#2","#3","#4","#5"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Fantasy","James","Bryant",{"b":"Howard"},{"b":"Paul"},{"b":"Griffin"}]},{"entry":["Player 1","Miami","LAL",{"b":"Orlando"},{"b":"LAC"},{"b":"LAC"}]},{"entry":["50 Credits Avail","7 Credits bid","10 Credits bid",{"b":"17 "},{"b":"6 "},{"b":"10 "}]},{"entry":["Fantasy","Wade",{"b":"Duncan"},{"b":"Stoudemire"},"Anthony","James"]},{"entry":["Player 2","Miami",{"b":"S.A."},{"b":"NY"},"NY","Miami"]},{"entry":["50 Credits Avail","13 Credits bid",{"b":"3 "},{"b":"8 "},"5 Credits bid","21 Credits bid"]},{"entry":["Fantasy","Rose","James",{"b":"Johnson"},"Ellis","Bryant"]},{"entry":["Player 3","Chi","Mia",{"b":"Atl"},"GS","LAL"]},{"entry":["50 Credits Avail","16 Credits bid","22 Credits bid",{"b":"1 "},"2 Credits bid","9 Credits bid"]},{"entry":["Fantasy","James",{"b":"Bryant"},"No Bid","No Bid","No Bid"]},{"entry":["Player 4","Mia",{"b":"LAL"},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["50 Credits Avail","25 Credits bid",{"b":"25 "},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Fantasy",{"b":"Griffin"},"Howard","Durant",{"b":"Anthony"},{"b":"Williams"}]},{"entry":["Player 5",{"b":"LAC"},"Orlando","OKC",{"b":"NY"},{"b":"NJ"}]},{"entry":["50 Credits Avail",{"b":"10 "},"10 Credits bid","10 Credits bid",{"b":"10 "},{"b":"10 "}]},{"entry":["Fantasy","Durant","Nowitski",{"b":"Aldridge"},{"b":"Love"},"Wade"]},{"entry":["Player 6","OKC","Dallas",{"b":"Port"},{"b":"Min"},"Mia"]},{"entry":["50 Credits Avail","15 Credits bid","10 Credits bid",{"b":"7 "},{"b":"8 "},"10 Credits bid"]},{"entry":["Fantasy","Durant","James",{"b":"Nowitski"},"No Bid","No Bid"]},{"entry":["Player 7","OKC","Mia",{"b":"Dallas"},{},{}]},{"entry":["50 Credits Avail","17 Credits bid","17 Credits bid",{"b":"16 "},{},{}]},{"entry":["Fantasy",{"b":"James"},{"b":"Ellis"},{"b":"Parker"},{"b":"Gasol"},{"b":"Randolph"}]},{"entry":["Player 8",{"b":"Mia"},{"b":"GS"},{"b":"SA"},{"b":"LAL"},{"b":"Memphis"}]},{"entry":["50 Credits Avail",{"b":"40 "},{"b":"3 "},{"b":"3 "},{"b":"2 "},{"b":"2 "}]},{"entry":["Fantasy","Wade","Howard","Bryant",{"b":"Nash"},{"b":"Curry"}]},{"entry":["Player 9","Mia","Orl","LAL",{"b":"Phoenix"},{"b":"GS"}]},{"entry":["50 Credits Avail","15 Credits bid","15 Credits bid","15 Credits bid",{"b":"3 "},{"b":"2 "}]},{"entry":["Fantasy","Bryant","Rose",{"b":"Wade"},"No Bid","No Bid"]},{"entry":["Player 10","LAL","Chi",{"b":"Mia"},{},{}]},{"entry":["50 Credits Avail","15 Credits bid","18 Credits bid",{"b":"17 "},{},{}]},{"entry":["Fantasy",{"b":"Rose"},{"b":"Durant"},"No Bid","No Bid","No Bid"]},{"entry":["Player 11",{"b":"Chi"},{"b":"OKC"},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["50 Credits Avail",{"b":"23 "},{"b":"27 "},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Fantasy","Durant","James","No Bid","No Bid","No Bid"]},{"entry":["Player 12","OKC","Miami",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["50 Credits Avail","25 Credits bid","25 Credits bid"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In the example above, Bold text denotes a winning bid.

A fantasy player gets one selection per round. Once a given fantasy player has all their slots filled, they are automatically dropped from the free agent draft.","Group Tournament Type #7\u2014Blind Submission Format\u2014Meeting a Minimum Threshold\u2014In an example embodiment, this format might appear to be a Lottery Effect format, but it is not. This type of group tournament acts the same way that small group Holy Grail tournaments do even though everyone competes against each other simultaneously. This is a bona fide Holy Grail tournament even though it does not have fantasy players competing in small groups. This can be accomplished by setting up a minimum threshold tournament.","A minimum threshold tournament recognizes that more than 50% of the contestants need to be eliminated at each round. This is because the one-on-one match play format eliminates half the contestants each week. But this has already proven to be ineffective for a tournament that attracts the masses. On the other hand, a minimum threshold tournament must be more forgiving than having everyone compete at the same time with one person left standing. This format is virtually a 100% certainty that a random player loses. The way to fix this problem is to hone in on a percentage somewhere between the 50% and 100% extremes that are incompatible with holding a successful Holy Grail tournament. This type of strategy generates the same small group dynamic that is so conducive to creating a dynamic Holy Grail tournament.","The format for the tournament is relatively simple. Fantasy players have to meet a minimum performance threshold between 50% and 100% each round. Let's arbitrarily pick 70%. What this means is that all fantasy players have to beat 70% of the field for a given week to advance to the next round. Fantasy players have to submit a lineup each round and there is no penalty for duplication, because millions of people can be playing each other simultaneously. Once the field narrows, duplication penalties can be utilized.","A key difference between this format and the flawed models that are currently available is that this format gives fantasy players hope. Instead of having to emerge as the top person out of a group of millions of people, one only has to finish in the top thirty or forty percent to advance. Fantasy players will gravitate towards this because it is a tournament of skill and most players believe they have what it takes to finish in the top 30% or whatever the pre-determined number is. Once this is method is used for 8 to 12 rounds, it becomes possible to whittle millions of entries down to a manageable level so that it is possible to conduct one-on-one match play events for the remaining rounds to determine an overall winner.","This type of tournament, like all the tournament formats described above, can be used for any fantasy sport. To illustrate how this type of tournament works, consider a particular sample tournament where there are 50 million entries and the pre-determined tournament rules specify the use of a 30% rule for the first 12 weeks of an NFL\u2122 football season. For weeks 13 through 17 of the NFL\u2122 season, the tournament concludes with one-on-one match play. An example of the numbers of fantasy players advancing at the end of each week in the sample tournament are shown below.","30% Rule Format\u2014Weeks 1 through 12\n\n","One-on-One Match Play Format\u2014Weeks 13 through 17\n\n","The submission process for the one-on-one match play format is different than the first 12 weeks where lineups are simply turned in and fantasy players have to finish in the top 30%. For the one-on-one match play phase, which begins week 13, there could be a three round (it could be a different number of rounds) submission process. An example of this submission process is set forth below.","Round 1\u2014Lineups are compared. If a given position has a different athlete submitted, the two competitors (fantasy players) lock in this athlete into their starting lineups. If a given position has the same athlete submitted, this athlete is disqualified from the match and cannot be resubmitted by either fantasy player. All open slots will be resubmitted the next round.","Round 2\u2014Same rules and processes as Round 1 as described above.","Round 3\u2014All open slots require two submissions by each fantasy player. One submission is the intended starting athlete and the other is a backup athlete. The intended starter athlete must also have a percentage value associated with the starter athlete. This percentage represents the percentage of fantasy points a fantasy player is willing to deduct from a given athlete's fantasy score to get the athlete in their lineup. This only comes into play if both fantasy players submit the same athlete for an open position. If the submitted athletes are different, then each fantasy player will lock them in at 100%. If, however, the submitted athletes are the same, the bids will be compared. The fantasy player with the lower percentage bid gets that athlete at the percentage they bid. That fantasy player secures that athlete for their lineup, but it comes with a penalty. The fantasy player only receives the percentage of fantasy points they bid for the match while their opponent gets their backup athlete they submitted for this position at 100% of their fantasy point total. If the percentage bid is the same, both fantasy players will lock in their backup athletes in at 100%. If their backups are the same athlete, they will each get the backup athlete at 100%, which effectively cancels each other out for this position.","One-on-One Match Play Tournament Type #8\u2014Blind Submission Format\u2014Valuing slots at different percentages\u2014There are some techniques that are also quite effective for matches that involve two players. The following example allows for duplication and is especially effective when there are a limited number of athletes from which to choose.","In the example presented below, assume that it is one of the Main Event rounds of a soccer fantasy tournament and fantasy players are competing head-to-head. Fantasy players have been paired off in these matches with each slot having a different value.

the example above, underlined values are Adjusted Fantasy Point values. In the example above, fantasy Player #1 would move on in the tournament based on a 47.77 to 44.39 victory over Fantasy Player #2.","One-on-one Match Play Tournament Type #9\u2014Blind Submission Format Disqualifying athletes that are duplicated\u2014This format of an example embodiment can be used over two or more rounds of fantasy players submitting athletes. An example of this type of tournament is illustrated in the hypothetical presented below. This example is from a football tournament.","In this example, fantasy players submit six starter athletes for various positions on the fantasy football team\u2014one quarterback (QB), two running backs (RB's), two wide receivers (WR's), and 1 Flex position (e.g., a RB or WR). Fantasy players also submit four tiebreakers, which are used only to break ties. In this example, these four tiebreakers include: 1) one tight end (TE) that represents the 1tiebreaker; 2) one defensive position that represents the 2tiebreaker; 3) one kicker that represents the 3tiebreaker; and 4) the 4tiebreaker can be represented as one tiebreaker NFL\u2122 football team playing that week. Point differentials in the score of the game played by the tiebreaker NFL\u2122 football team that week determine the fantasy value for the 4tiebreaker (e.g., a 27-21 victory is a +6, conversely, a 28-3 loss is a \u221225). A 5tiebreaker can be represented as a computer generated coin flip produced by a random number generator.","Lineups are submitted over a three day period (e.g., Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday by 8:00 PM EST for each day\u2014could be a greater or lesser number of days, the number is arbitrary). All NFL\u2122 athletes are eligible as long as they haven't been disqualified or already played in their game for the week.","On the first day of the lineup submission period (e.g., Wednesday), both fantasy players must have their lineups submitted. If both fail to do so, a new deadline is set for the next day at, for example, 5:00 PM EST. If only one fantasy player has their lineup submitted, the one fantasy player locks in all six of their starters in their starting lineup and all four tiebreakers into their tiebreaker lineup. Their opponent has until the last day of the lineup submission period (e.g., Friday night at 5:00 PM EST) to enter a lineup of six starting athletes and four tiebreaker athletes or the opponent forfeits the match. Once a starting athlete or tiebreaker position has been filled, the opposing fantasy player cannot select the same NFL\u2122 athlete or team that has already been locked in.","If both fantasy players submit their lineups within the lineup submission period, the lineups are compared athlete-by-athlete. If any athlete or team is duplicated, the athlete or team is immediately disqualified from the match and cannot be resubmitted again by either fantasy player. This disqualification includes a scenario wherein, for example, an NFL\u2122 athlete is submitted by one fantasy player as a running back and their opponent submitted the same athlete as a flex player, or other different position. All other starting athletes and tiebreaker athletes who aren't duplications are locked into the starting and tiebreaker slots for the respective fantasy players. The defense category and team category are not considered a duplication if the same NFL\u2122 team is submitted in these two different categories. Duplicated athletes will leave open slots that will be resubmitted the next day.","On the second day of the lineup submission period (e.g., Thursday), if there are still open positions, both fantasy players will be expected to turn in a lineup for the slots in their lineups that haven't been filled. If only one fantasy player turns in their lineup, the athletes submitted by the one fantasy player are immediately locked in and their opponent has until the next day to fill in these open slots. Once a starting athlete or tiebreaker position has been filled, the opponent cannot select the same NFL\u2122 athlete or team that has already been locked in. In other respects, the same rules apply as the previous day. Duplicated athletes and tiebreakers are disqualified and can't be resubmitted again. Non-duplicated athletes\/teams are locked in. If there are any remaining openings, there is one final day for submissions.","On the third day of the lineup submission period (e.g., Friday), if both fantasy players fail to submit a lineup during the entire three day period, a double forfeit is declared and both fantasy players are eliminated from the tournament. If one player never submitted a lineup during any of the days and their opponent did, then the fantasy player who turned in a lineup wins by forfeit and moves on to the next round. If one or both fantasy players submitted lineups at some point, but one or both don't have complete lineups, the fantasy players will compete against one another with \u201copen\u201d slots that receive zero points for every slot in their respective starting and tiebreaker lineups where this happens. If both fantasy players submit athletes for open slots on this final day of the lineup submission period, both fantasy players will submit two options for each open slot. There will be a primary and a backup option. If the primary options are different athletes for a given position, the athletes submitted as primary options will be locked into their respective lineups. If the athletes submitted as primary options are the same athlete or team, then a bidding number that was submitted ahead of time will be checked. Fantasy players can submit a bidding number or bid from 1% to 100%. A bid of 93% means that a fantasy player covets that NFL\u2122 athlete enough that they are willing to receive only 93% of the fantasy points this NFL\u2122 athlete scores. At the same time, their opponent will automatically get 100% of their backup options fantasy value to lose this athlete that they also coveted. Because both fantasy players are submitting a bid, the fantasy player that makes the lowest percentage bid gets that NFL\u2122 athlete for the week (round). Once again, the losing bidder gets their backup athlete for 100% of their fantasy point value. If however, the bids happen to be the same, then the equality of the bids disqualifies this NFL\u2122 athlete from the match. The backup athlete names are then compared. If the backup athlete names are different, they are locked in. If the backup athlete names are the same, both fantasy players will play the match with an open slot for this position that will be scored as a zero.","Explanation #3\u2014Creating staggered qualifying tournaments of the same or different lengths that feed into a Main Tournament\u2014A single elimination tournament can be very discouraging for people who get eliminated in the first round. The \u201cstaggered qualifying\u201d feature allows rabid fantasy players multiple avenues to remain in and possibly win the tournament. This type of format can be used for virtually any type of sporting event that lasts at least five days. The important features of the staggered qualifying tournaments are described below.","In an example embodiment, there are two stages to the tournament structure. There are several qualifying tournaments and there is a main tournament. Fantasy players can submit multiple entries for any qualifying tournament. Fantasy players can sign up for different qualifying tournaments at the same time. The main tournament has a predetermined number of seats available that fantasy players can either try to qualify for or directly buy their way into. The qualifying tournaments may or may not have different amounts of rounds in them. New qualifying tournaments can start at any time. There is no set time period that must elapse. The more rounds a qualifying tournament has, the less expensive the rounds are to play in. Fantasy players who are eliminated can re-enter because a new qualifying tournament will be starting soon.","These qualifying tournaments have the following features in an example embodiment. The qualifying tournaments are separate and distinct tournaments from one another. The qualifying tournaments don't always have the same number of rounds (although there is no reason why they can't). Some qualifying tournaments are often running at the same time as other qualifying tournaments. The qualifying tournaments are staggered over a portion of the season in a way where the qualifying tournaments sometimes overlap each other completely, sometimes partially, and sometimes not at all.","In an example of the qualifying tournament structure used in an embodiment using the 2012 NFL\u2122 season as an illustration, we can randomly set up nine qualifying tournaments that each have a different number of rounds. The nine qualifying tournaments can be set up such that they are staggered in time. Fantasy players are placed in groups of 12 for each round with the top three fantasy players advancing. In the example illustrated below, the nine qualifying tournaments are staggered in a way where the tournaments become increasingly shorter. Alternatively, the qualifying tournaments can be staggered by making them increasingly longer. The data for each of the nine qualifying tournaments in the example are set forth below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0455","num":"0972"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00037","num":"00037"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Qualifier

In order to do this, the number of rounds must remain constant so there isn't an unfair advantage that any one group of contestants has depending on their entry point. What this means is that creative strategies must be developed to hold this set number of rounds as the tournament gets closer and closer to the Main Event. A Wildcard Format is used when more than one round is needed during an interval of the tournament where fantasy players who entered earlier might only be playing one round. This technique is used as a \u201ccatch up\u201d mechanism so that all fantasy players end up playing the same number of rounds. Using NFL\u2122 football as an example, the regular season schedule always has morning and afternoon games. The morning games could be used as one round while the afternoon games serve as an additional round. When a Wildcard Format is needed, it is necessary for fantasy players to give a Contingency Lineup for the PM games in advance, because there is not enough time to submit lineups between the AM and PM games.","Sometimes there is so little time left that a Super Wildcard Format is needed. This happens when several rounds are needed in the same game as a way to catch up. A Super Wildcard Format breaks individual games (or games happening simultaneously) into two or more rounds. For example, using an NFL\u2122 fantasy football tournament again, if there are 10 weeks for qualifying that cover the first 10 weeks of the regular season, it is straightforward to hold a 10 round qualifying tournament. Each of those 10 weeks would constitute a round. There is no need for either a Wildcard or Super Wildcard Format. It gets more difficult to create 10 rounds though once there are no longer 10 weeks of NFL\u2122 games to contest them. For example, if during the 17th week of the NFL\u2122 season, a fantasy football tournament organizer wants to still charge the same $5 entry fee that they did in NFL\u2122 week 1, they would have to create 10 rounds in order to make it fair. The only way to do so is by implementing a Super Wildcard Format where each game (or group of simultaneously running games) is broken down into two or more rounds. Below are two potential options to accomplish this result as illustrated by example.","During the 17week, fantasy players can sign up for a one week version where the AM games count as four rounds (e.g., one round for each quarter of the AM game) and the PM games count as four rounds (e.g., one round for each quarter of the PM game) and the Sunday Night Game is a round and the Monday Night Game is a round (e.g., Sunday night is Round 9 and Monday night is Round 10). Because this structure involves four sets of lineups (AM games, PM games, Sunday night game and Monday night game), fantasy players will have to submit four lineups in order to play this format before any of the games begin. An example of this tournament structure is set forth below.","Option #1",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0469","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0114","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0114-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0115","list-style":"none"},"li":["Round 1\u20141quarter of AM games","Round 2\u20142quarter of AM games","Round 3\u20143rd quarter of AM games","Round 4\u20144quarter of AM games","Round 5\u20141quarter of PM games","Round 6\u20142quarter of PM games","Round 7\u20143rd quarter of PM games","Round 8\u20144quarter of PM games","Round 9\u2014Sunday Night Game","Round 10\u2014Monday Night Game\n\nOption #2\n"]}}}},"AM games begin at 10 AM PST for Rounds 1 through 4.

The top 3 survivors automatically qualify for the Main Event.","The process described above is one of the most important features developed as part of the various embodiments. The process includes the following important characteristic\u2014the process defines a set number of qualifying rounds that are needed to qualify for a Main Event and then offers these qualifying options during any point of the qualifying process. Additionally, the described embodiments offer a variety of others features and benefits. An example embodiment described herein allows a qualifying process for a fantasy tournament Main Event to be compressed in terms of time. For some competitors the qualifying process might be two months or more. For other competitors, the qualifying process might be a few weeks. For some competitors, the qualifying process might be a week and for some the process might even be a day. Even though the time duration of the qualifying process can fluctuate dramatically, the number of rounds a fantasy contestant must play during this qualifying process remains constant. If it is predetermined that a qualifying process is for 10 rounds, then all qualifying tournaments must be 10 rounds regardless of whether the qualifying tournament is ten weeks or one day. This format allows people to re-enter the qualifying process at the same low price point at any stage of the qualifying process without being subjected to a Lottery Effect type of parameters. Fantasy players are still able to compete in small groups. As seen from the above two examples, this means that various embodiments as described herein can generate 10 (or an arbitrary number of) rounds for qualifying tournaments that have a very limited time period.","Explanation #5\u2014Using Contingency Lineups to create exciting tournaments that have a limited number of days\u2014This is an extremely powerful embodiment that makes fantasy tournaments possible for situations where there are a very small number of days that the real life tournament is being conducted. Without using the Contingency Lineup technique, there would be no possible way to hold these types of fantasy tournaments.","The Contingency Lineup Format of an example embodiment requires fantasy players to submit multiple lineups (two or more) before any of the games take place for a given day. If a given fantasy player advances to the next round, then their next contingency lineup becomes their actual lineup. The reason that this format becomes necessary is because there may not be enough time to select new lineups for the next round. This is because a new set of games starts immediately after the games that just finished. An example demonstrating the power of this embodiment is set forth below.","During the NFL\u2122 playoffs, there are always 11 games. These 11 games are distributed over six unique days. Five days have two games each and then the Super Bowl is a standalone game during the sixth day. If there was no Contingency Lineup Format, we could only have six rounds of play (each day is one round); because, the way the games are scheduled is not conducive to submitting a new lineup once a fantasy player advances (e.g., there is not enough time in between games to submit a new lineup). If a fantasy tournament organizer wanted to play the tournament in groups of 12 for each round with the top two scorers in each group advancing, this creates a 6 to 1 ratio (one person advancing for every six players). A 6:1 ratio over six rounds creates 93,312 potential openings. Let's assume that a tournament organizer wanted to offer a fantasy tournament for just the NFL\u2122 playoffs and used the above technique without employing contingency lineups. This tournament organizer might set the asking price at $5 per entry and the grand prize at five million dollars. The tournament organizer might believe they have created an ideal high stakes fantasy sports tournament with a low entry fee, a multi-million dollar grand prize, and small group play during individual rounds.","However, the problem with this tournament organizer's tournament is that because only 93,312 people can play, the tournament can only generate $466,560 if all of the seats are filled. Clearly, it isn't financially possible to offer a five million dollar grand prize for a tournament that only has the capacity to generate less than half a million dollars in revenue.","The Contingency Lineups of the example embodiment described herein can change this result. If each of the 11 games became an individual round by using Contingency Lineups for games where one comes immediately after another, a whole new landscape can be created. This new arrangement allows for over 750,000,000 (three quarters of a billion) entries. This type of format would easily support a five million dollar grand prize for $5 entry fees.","In an alternative embodiment, a tournament can be implemented that uses RINGS. RINGS or rings, as denoted herein, is an acronym for Rounds Involving Narrow Group Size. In an example embodiment, a tournament using rings provides a more robust and fair way to handle group play. In an example embodiment, a tournament supporting rings includes the following novel characteristics not seen before in any prior fantasy sports tournaments that have a large number of entries (e.g., entries of 100,000 or more people). The characteristics of a tournament with rings can include the following:","Avoiding Trap Rounds\u2014All previous attempts of large scale fantasy sports tournaments of 100,000 or more entries have at LEAST one \u201ctrap\u201d round in the tournament. A trap round is a given round (or multiple rounds) of a tournament where participants are placed together in such large numbers that a random participant has less than a 1% mathematical chance to advance. In essence a lottery is created which negates the skill level of the players competing. This is because a portion of the tournament is based on pure luck; which makes the tournament less than desirable to play in for players. A tournament with RINGS NEVER has a trap round.","Small Group Play\u2014In an example embodiment, a tournament supporting rings provides an opportunity for small skill-based group play.","Skill Based\u2014The 10% Rule\u2014In a tournament supporting rings, fantasy players always, mathematically, have at least a 10% chance to advance to the next round. This is true for every contested part of the tournament. This defines a skill based tournament.","RINGS\u2014RINGS (Rounds Involving Narrow Group Size) are the combination of small group play contested over multiple rounds (two rounds or more). RINGS are the answer to the problem with which current high stakes fantasy sports models are struggling. There has never been a version of a tournament created that offers the two money-maker components of an effective tournament (e.g., low entry fees and a multi-million dollar grand prize) that also is skill based (at least a 10% chance to advance in every round). Moreover, every high stakes fantasy sports tournament example ever attempted in the conventional art has had a least one portion where there is a trap round with a less than 1% chance to advance.","Combining Regular and Post Seasons\u2014Prior examples of fantasy tournaments have included only the regular season of a given sport while others have included only the post-season. An example embodiment of the tournament described herein provides both the regular season and the post-season together in a single tournament. Conventional implementations do not provide a fantasy sports tournament that includes both the regular season and the post-season together. The example embodiment of the tournament described herein works in conjunction with RINGS to provide both the regular season and the post-season together. The importance of this dynamic should not be underestimated. There are many gaming barriers that had to be addressed to offer this format, which is why nobody has ever thought of putting both together in the same tournament.","Scrambles\u2014An example embodiment of the tournament described herein provides a scrambles process where players enter RINGS competitions and compete in group play for an increasingly higher prize every time they advance in consecutive rounds. For example, if a fantasy player is competing in a Scramble, they might receive $5 for finishing in the top 3 of a group of 12 and an automatic berth in a second round Scramble. If they finish in the top 3 of 12 for this second Scramble, they might win $10 and an automatic bid to a third round Scramble. This process continues on until a pre-determined number of rounds is reached for a chance to win a grand prize.","An example embodiment of the tournament structure described herein that supports rings can enable various related methods, such as the method described below.","A method comprising: prompting, by execution of a data processor, a large number (defined as 100,000 or more) of users at a corresponding large number of user platforms to each submit a nominal buy-in for entry into a fantasy sports tournament, the users submitting the nominal buy-in becoming fantasy players of the fantasy sports tournament; partitioning, by execution of the data processor, the fantasy players of the fantasy sports tournament into player groups called \u201crings\u201d that compete to advance through a pre-determined number of rounds to a main tournament (RINGS is an acronym for Rounds Involving Narrow Group Size), at least one player ring having at least three fantasy players as ring members, the fantasy players in each player ring only playing against other members of the same player ring during a given round; receiving from each member of each player ring a selection of athletes corresponding to each member and scoring each member of each player ring based on the performance of selected athletes, members of each player ring who do not score within a predetermined number of advancing players for their given ring relative to the other members of the same player ring are disqualified from the fantasy sports tournament; enabling a disqualified fantasy player to re-enter the fantasy sports tournament after submittal of an additional fee by either a) paying the same fee again which requires playing one or more additional rounds to catch up to the number of rounds other players have played or b) paying an additional fee to bypass rounds that have already been played; enabling an advancing player to move on to the next round of the tournament, without having to pay an additional charge, as the advancing player is placed in a new ring of players who also have successfully advanced to the same stage of the tournament; and configuring the fantasy sports tournament to include rings.","An example embodiment of the tournament structure described herein that supports rings can be part of a larger high stakes fantasy sports tournament format. In the example embodiment, there are seven essential features that distinguish this new tournament format from existing tournament formats. These seven essential features are described in more detail below.","Seven Essential Gaming Features for a High Stakes Fantasy Sports Tournament","In the example embodiment described herein, there are seven key features or characteristics that a high stakes fantasy sports tournament requires to be successful. These seven key features can be broken into two categories. These categories include:\n\n","The best any conventional fantasy sports company in the industry has done in the past is to offer a few of these seven features in the same tournament. However, no conventional tournament format has included all seven features or key combinations of these seven features. RINGS (Rounds Involving Narrow Group Size), as described above, are a key component that has been left out of all conventional high stakes fantasy tournaments. Even more importantly, no conventional fantasy sports tournament has ever offered both of the \u201cMoney Category\u201d features described above, which include a \u201clow entry fee\u201d and a \u201cmulti-million dollar grand prize\u201d, in combination with the \u201cGaming Structure Category\u201d feature of \u201cskill as a factor\u201d.","In the example embodiment described herein, the seven key features or characteristics listed above are important for a high stakes fantasy sports tournament to be successful. The reasons why each of these seven ingredients are so important are described next.","The Money Category","Low entry fee (ideally $5 or less per entry)","People like to play when the risk level is minimal. Tournaments that offer a low entry fee are always going to have the potential to draw many more people than ones with pricey entry fees.","A Multi-Million Dollar Grand Prize\u2014","When tournaments have a low entry fee paired with a multi-million dollar grand prize, the potential is extraordinary\u2014especially if there is skill involved in the tournament format. No conventional multi-million dollar tournament in the fantasy sports genre has ever had a skill component; because, every single one of them has always had at least one trap component in the tournament (e.g., at least one occasion in the tournament when fantasy players face less than a 1% chance to advance to a next round in the tournament).","The Gaming Structure Category","Two Tiered Format\u2014","The example embodiment described herein uses both the regular season and the playoffs of a given sport in the same tournament. No conventional fantasy sports tournament provider has ever implemented a combination of the regular season and the playoffs of a given sport in the same tournament. This combination allows for much greater flexibility in the number of entries the tournament can accommodate.","Allows Unlimited Entries\u2014or Pretty Close to it\u2014","This is where conventional fantasy sports companies have gotten it consistently wrong. Conventional fantasy tournaments weed out fantasy participants by placing them simultaneously in large quantities of players. Conventional fantasy tournament providers have consistently struggled with the quantity of players that should simultaneously compete against one another. The traditional solution has always been to allow players to compete against fewer players at once if they are willing to pay a higher entry fee. For example, it might cost $100 to be able to compete in a pool of as little as 500 players simultaneously as opposed to going against 5,000 people all at once for $5. These pools of people in traditional fantasy tournaments create two competing realities that make these tournaments problematic; because, these tournaments involve gaming features that are diametrically opposed to one another. The first reality is that to offer a huge prize, the traditional tournament must have lots of people entering the tournament or the tournament cannot generate the necessary revenue to offer a large cash prize. Thus, the first reality of traditional fantasy tournaments is to entice lots of people to enter the tournament. On the other hand, the second reality of traditional fantasy tournaments creates a different dynamic. Because the strategy to weed players out has always been to place them in large pools of participants, the players themselves are concerned about playing too many people at one time. To address this reality, tournament organizers have taken the path of capping pools of players by offering guaranteed player pools of fewer people if players are willing to pay more money, which also happens to violate the low entry fee requirement that makes the ideal format flourish. In other words, the second reality of traditional fantasy tournaments is to put limits on the numbers of people who can enter the tournament as a strategy to appease the players. These conflicting realities have created significant problems in conventional tournament formats. The reality is that these traditional tournaments are always capped and usually no more than 300,000 to 400,000 people can enter. This is a disaster if the goal is to have an entry fee of $5 or less, because the most a tournament can collect in entry fees is $2 million dollars. In contrast, the fantasy tournament format as disclosed herein allows for over 2.1 billion entries.","Skill is a Major Factor","Player skill has never been a factor in any past or current examples of low entry fee and high dollar reward fantasy sports tournaments. The reason is that every single example ever offered has had at least one \u201ctrap\u201d round where the chance of a player advancing to a next round is less than 1%. A trap round is where participants are placed together in such large numbers that a random participant has less than a 1% mathematical chance to advance. In essence, a trap round creates a lottery, which negates the skill level of the players competing. A tournament based on pure luck is less desirable for players who are seeking a skill based tournament. The tournament format as disclosed herein avoids this problem by using the RINGS feature as described herein. The RINGS feature as disclosed herein combines small group play over multiple rounds. No traditional fantasy sports tournament has ever used this process.","The various example embodiments described herein are skill based tournament formats. The tournament formats described herein avoid \u201ctrap\u201d rounds where the chance of a player advancing to a next round is less than 1%. The tournament formats described herein provide a high stakes tournament that provides players a reasonable chance to advance (at least 10% at any given time) so that skill actually is a factor in the competition. All previous attempts of large scale fantasy sports tournaments of 100,000 or more entries had at least one trap round in the tournament where a player had less than a 1% chance to advance.","The various embodiments described herein allow simultaneous entries from the same fantasy player in Tier 1 (i.e., the qualifying portion of the tournament). The only way a tournament can generate the kind of revenue necessary to offer a high dollar prize for a low entry fee is to allow multiple entries by the same person to be played simultaneously. The only way that this can be done effectively is to create a submission process that doesn't take a lot of time like drafting players or studying salary caps. In an example embodiment, a process is used that penalizes competitors for duplication through a blind submission process. This is the most effective way to avoid a draft and salary caps.","The various embodiments described herein also allow re-entry at any point in Tier 1. This feature is an important part of a particular embodiment. In order for a low entry fee tournament to flourish, there must be processes provided that allow contestants to enter the tournament at any time in Tier 1 for the same low entry fee. This is a necessary component to continue generating the revenue required to support a low entry fee and a high dollar grand prize tournament. The difficulty lies in providing ways for contestants entering late in Tier 1 to still have a chance to get in, but also cover the same amount of ground that contestants in earlier stages of Tier 1 had to cover. The only way to accomplish this is to employ the RINGS feature as described herein. In particular, a tournament can offer multiple RINGS within the same day. An example embodiment of the tournament structure that supports rings to enable various related methods is described herein.","Daily fantasy sports games are extremely popular. In a particular embodiment, the Scrambles and RINGS concepts as disclosed herein can be integrated into a daily fantasy sports game format. For example, a particular embodiment can offer a pre-determined 10 round Scramble where each new round occurs the next day of a given sports season. Winning players could either cash out after a given round or let their winnings ride until the next round. Fantasy players who finish in the top predetermined positions would be considered \u201cwinners\u201d and then could either cash out or decide to go to the next round where their money could be doubled (as an example) for finishing in a top position again.","In another example embodiment, a National Fantasy Sports Certification System can be implemented. Conventional fantasy sports tournaments have never provided a system for fantasy sports certification where people who play fantasy sports are ranked and certified like they can be in other activities, such as martial arts. A detailed description of an example embodiment of a fantasy sports certification system is provided next.","An Example Embodiment for Creating a National Fantasy Certification System","What is a GOAT and what does this have to do with fantasy sports certification?\u2014","GOAT is an acronym for the \u201cGreatest of All Time\u201d. Every sport has its own version of who the GOAT is. Baseball has Babe Ruth. Hockey has Wayne Gretzky. Basketball has Michael Jordan. Soccer has Pele. Sometimes there is fierce debate. Is it Tiger Woods or Jack Nicklaus in golf? Is it Jim Brown, Joe Montana, Jerry Rice or someone else in football? In any event, the GOAT for any sport is the pinnacle of what anyone could ever hope to be. It is what men and women in sports dream about. They idolize these great athletes because they would like to be them. This fantasy to be the GOAT can be used as a powerful trigger for players with respect to fantasy sports. Just like with GOAT athletes, the ultimate goal for fantasy sports participants is to be recognized as great competitors maybe even the GOAT. Creating a structure in this manner allows participants to take on all kinds of roles that will fuel this concept to dizzying heights. Some players will be embarrassingly bad, most will be mediocre, some will be good, even less will be great and just a handful will become elite. This is the type of system that can generate huge money if a fantasy sports implementation can be created around it. Such a fantasy sports implementation in an example embodiment is described herein.","In conventional fantasy sports formats, there is no standardized way to evaluate whether someone who plays fantasy sports is really any good or not. When some player brags that s\/he has won his\/her fantasy league three straight years, is this really an accomplishment that should be respected or did the bragging player merely beat a bunch of low-performing league players. Conventional fantasy sports formats create a culture where nobody really knows how good anybody else is. In an example embodiment described herein, a fantasy sports system levels the playing field and provides a way to properly evaluate everyone who plays against a true standardized measuring system. Because fantasy football is the biggest fantasy sport on the market today, the following example embodiment describes the levels of a fantasy football GOAT measuring system.","GOAT Fantasy Football\u2014","In the example embodiment disclosed herein, GOAT Fantasy Football is a national certification process where fantasy football enthusiasts can accurately assess their skill level by comparing themselves to a uniform national standard. The GOAT system requires players to compete in national competitions so that they can be properly evaluated. For a low certification fee, fantasy enthusiasts can have their GOAT level calculated. In a particular embodiment, the process can be similar to the way martial artists use a progression of belts to distinguish the skill level of a given individual. However, unlike the martial art belt method, the GOAT system of a particular embodiment does not guarantee that players will advance if they just put in the time. In the GOAT system of a particular embodiment, if players do not perform well, they will not progress. If they perform well, they will be rewarded with advancement. If they are great, they might one day be recognized as the GOAT of fantasy football. Fantasy football players in the example embodiment who don't like their GOAT level can always re-apply as often as they like.","The Importance of the GOAT Certification Process\u2014","The fantasy football GOAT measuring system of an example embodiment can generate a GOAT Certification for anyone who plays fantasy football (or any other fantasy sport). At every fantasy football draft in the country, it will become a requirement for any serious player to publicly reveal their GOAT Certification level to their group. Poorly rated players will be unlikely to receive priority in the draft. Excellent players will be revered as they should be and will be likely to receive priority in the draft. An individual player's GOAT level will always be present on their certification profile over the Internet for anyone to quickly access at any time. People who aren't enrolled and don't have a profile because they have never attempted to be certified with a ranking will be unlikely to receive the opportunities in a fantasy sports event that GOAT certified players will receive.","The fantasy football GOAT measuring system of an example embodiment is the first process ever created that allows tens of millions of people to be evaluated at one time that can also accurately gauge skill level. That is because the ranking process is done in small groups or head-to-head. Small group competitions can involve, for example, 12 people competing against one another with only the top 3 advancing to a new GOAT level.","The GOAT Levels\u2014","In an example embodiment, there are 9 different GOAT levels with the 9th level being the highest or \u201cGOAT\u201d level, which is comparable to a black belt in martial arts. Once a player makes a level, the player retains the level for life. It is possible that a player might try to re-certify for a higher level and do worse than the player's current level. However, in the example embodiment, the player will not be penalized and will retain the highest level achieved. The various GOAT measuring levels in an example embodiment are described in more detail below.","The various GOAT measuring levels in an example embodiment are as follows:\n\n","In the fantasy football GOAT measuring system of an example embodiment, the goal is to create an extremely difficult challenge to become a GOAT, but at the same time, make it achievable in a way that many people will become GOATS. This will fuel the masses to do whatever it takes to make it; because, they will see many who have done it. The truth is, though, that over 99% of the people who play fantasy football will never achieve the level of GOAT; because, it is a 65,536 to 1 shot\u2014assuming we don't account for the talent level of individual players. Nevertheless, the fantasy football GOAT measuring system of an example embodiment creates a plurality of levels based on the skill of the players and not merely on random luck. As such, the players are more motivated to try to move up the GOAT levels and willing to pay fees to take the chance. The odds of a typical player achieving a ranking at each of the GOAT levels described above are set forth below.\n\n","In an example embodiment, national tournaments are held for only GOAT certified players. The national tournaments occur after the NFL\u2122 regular season is over and are held during the NFL\u2122 playoffs. GOAT certified players can compete against one another using a one-on-one single elimination format (like the NCAA basketball tournament). GOAT players can compete to achieve any of a plurality of degrees of GOAT. In the example embodiment, there are ten degrees of GOAT. The higher the GOAT degree, the more revered the GOAT player will be in the pantheon of fantasy football players.","Once a person earns the title of GOAT as described above, the GOAT player will continually be invited back to GOAT only tournaments to improve on their GOAT degree. Also, winners of GOAT tournaments will not only be recognized as a 10th degree GOAT, but they will also be recognized with a goat horn. This goat horn will be treasured the same way bracelets get treasured for wins on the World Poker Tour or rings get valued for winning championships in team sports or belts for boxing and MMA. The elite GOAT players will battle it out to see who can accumulate the most GOAT horns so that they can be recognized as the true GOAT in the history of fantasy football. This whole special GOAT \u201cclub\u201d that only plays each other will motivate the non-GOAT players to attempt to join this exclusive club.","In an example embodiment, the ten degrees of GOAT are as follows:\n\n","Example embodiments of the tournament structure described herein can also support additional features and formats including: 1) Multiple rounds in one day, and 2) a Let It Ride format. These features of an example embodiment are described below.","Multiple Rounds in One Day\u2014The following process is a way to allow fantasy contestants to play several rounds in one day without breaking games up into separate rounds. This example is for a situation where 10 rounds are needed to be played in a single day for a tournament that is played in groups of 12 with the top 3 advancing. The format can be modified to accommodate a set number of rounds, group size and advancing contestants needed for a given day of play.\n\n","Let it Ride\u2014This is a daily fantasy sports concept where contestants can play in a group format structure for as many rounds that they desire (unless the tournament organizer establishes a maximum number of rounds). At the end of each round, the contestant can decide whether they want to collect their money or let it carry over to another round where they will get an even bigger prize if they finish in \u201cwinning\u201d positions (for example finishing in the top 3 out of their group of 12 for a structure that declares the first three positions as winning spots).","Bid well or take a Scrub\u2014Athletes are split into two groups for each position. Each position group contains half of all available athletes. The top 50% of athletes (based on weekly fantasy point average) will be in a pool to be bid on. Contestants will select an athlete for each position and submit a percentage bid (1% to 100%) of fantasy points they are willing to settle for each athlete they select. If they have the lowest bid, they receive that athlete in their starting lineup (if ties happen, all tied people get that athlete for what they bid). Contestants who did not win a bid for a given position will be assigned a random \u201cfield\u201d athlete at 100% of their fantasy value. This athlete can only come from the lower ranked athletes in bottom 50% who are not allowed to be bid on.","Example embodiments of the tournament structure described herein can be further illustrated by various particular examples of the various formats described herein. These examples of various embodiments are described below.","I. Tournament #1\u2014Bidding Gauntlet","This fantasy football tournament is specifically designed for all four weeks of the NFL\u2122 playoffs. The intent is to have a large chain of casinos host a tournament on several of their sites during the first weekend of the NFL\u2122 playoffs and then shift to one location for the remainder of the postseason. This chain of casinos can invite up to 6,250 of their highest rollers to partake in this six round tournament that spans four weeks. The number of contestants involved at any given time is as follows:\n\n","II. Style of Play for the first 5 Rounds\n\n","III. Selection Rules for First 5 Rounds\n\n","The following are the highest possible bids allowed for each round in the bidding process in an example embodiment:\n\n","The last fantasy player without a bloc of three gets this group automatically at a highest possible bid of 55%.\n\n","IV. Selection Rules for Round 6\u2014Super Bowl Sunday","The final match is played between the last two standing during the Super Bowl. It is the only round not contested using group play. The match should implement the same fantasy scoring format that was used during the first five rounds. The number of athletes each contestant has in their lineup and the manner in which they are selected will change though. The Super Bowl selection format is as follows:\n\n","II. Tournament #2\u2014Fantasy Eliminator","The third weekend of the NFL\u2122 playoffs consists of the two conference championship games. By this point, the \u201cBidding Gauntlet\u201d tournament has only ten contestants remaining. Since so few contestants remain, it creates the perfect opportunity to invite eliminated high rollers (as well as new invitees) back to play some more fantasy football. This new offering will occur at six different locations and will consist of a fast paced \u201cFantasy Eliminator\u201d competition. This tournament can accommodate up to 7,776 contestants.","The tournament is broken into five rounds. For each of the five rounds, contestants are placed in groups of 6. The object is for contestants to win their group of 6 to advance to the next round. During the final round, which is played on Super Bowl Sunday, the six remaining players compete for cash prizes during the Big Game.","The five rounds can be scheduled in the following manner:\n\n","I. Game Rules\u2014Creating Lineups\u2014all 5 Rounds\n\n","II. Game Rules\u2014Playing Out Rounds 1-4\n\n","III. Tournament #3\u2014Super Bowl Scramble\n\n","As described herein for various example embodiments, an embodiment can support the concept of playing multiple rounds in one day by submitting one lineup that will be used for two or more groups. Each group this lineup is submitted for will be considered a separate and distinct round. The rounds will be numerically sequenced and the lowest numbered round for which the contestant does not meet the criteria to advance will be considered the round in which they were eliminated.","As described herein for various example embodiments, an embodiment can support the concept of bidding on fantasy athletes in blocs of two or more by bidding for a percentage of their fantasy points that they score. For example, if three athletes are bid on at 94%, this means that if the bid is a winning bid, these three athletes are all secured for the contestant and the contestant will receive 94% of the fantasy points that each athlete scores for the round.","As described herein for various example embodiments, an embodiment can support the concept of decreasing (or increasing) the maximum allowable bid for an athlete's fantasy points for a given round of bidding. For example, for a seven round bidding format, the highest allowable bid might decrease in increments of 7% for each passing round.","As described herein for various example embodiments, an embodiment can support the concept of eliminating one or more contestants during a round for not having met a certain point threshold or for being ranked at or near the bottom of a grouping of contestants when the time period is up. This is called \u201cFantasy Eliminator\u201d.","As described herein for various example embodiments, an embodiment can support the concept where contestants can play in a daily fantasy sports group format structure for as many rounds as they desire (unless the tournament organizer establishes a maximum number of rounds). At the end of each round, the contestant can decide whether they want to collect their money or let it carry over to another round where they will get an even bigger prize if they finish in \u201cwinning\u201d positions (for example finishing in the top 3 out of their group of 12 for a structure that declares the first three positions as winning spots).","As described herein for various example embodiments, an embodiment can support the concept of \u201cMinimum Threshold\u201d for a group of contestants. This means that contestants must meet a minimum threshold to advance to the next round and that the remaining contestants in the group or field are eliminated. The eliminated contestants must always exceed the number of advancing contestants. In other words, the eliminated participants must always represent more than 50% of the field of contestants at any given time. This implies that a group of contestants must finish in a predetermined position compared to the rest of the field to advance. For example, it could be determined that the top 30% of the scores advance (meaning that the bottom 70% do not advance). This method can involve a small group of less than 10 contestants all the way up to a large group totaling in the thousands or millions.","As described herein for various example embodiments, an embodiment can support the concept of \u201cSlotting Positions with a Percentage Value\u201d. This is where a contestant submits a lineup and ranks the athletes in order of preference; because, the order in which they are ranked determines the fantasy point value for a given athlete. For example, the top slated athlete a contestant submits might be worth 100% of the fantasy points that they score, the second slotted athlete might receive 95% of their fantasy points that they score, the third slotted athlete 90% etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0547","num":"1318"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 19","FIG. 16","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0548","num":"1319"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},"Referring now to , in the example embodiment, the fantasy player selections for contestant \u201cVicktorious Secret\u201d are shown. In this example, each fantasy player's value is denoted by a percentage score shown in the \u201cPercent\u201d column illustrated in . The lower the percentage, the more duplication has occurred for the corresponding fantasy player and the less their fantasy points are worth. This is because the percentage shown literally represents the percentage of the fantasy points a contestant receives based on the actual fantasy points their athlete scores. For example, this percentage of points that the owner of the \u201cVicktorious Secret\u201d team gets to keep for each one of their athletes in this example is denoted in the \u201cFantasy Points\u201d display area under the heading of \u201cPercent\u201d as shown in . In that same \u201cFantasy Points\u201d display area, the number of fantasy points allocated before an adjustment is made is denoted under the \u201cBase\u201d column. This column represents the number of points that a given athlete scored in their real life fantasy sports contest. The adjusted fantasy point total is denoted under the \u201cActual\u201d column. These values are determined by multiplying the points a given athlete scored by the percentage that the fantasy player is worth for a given contestant.","Referring now to  and , sample user interface screenshots depict how an example embodiment of the fantasy sports tournament as described herein can enable a plurality of contestants to compete in the same contest at the same time. In particular, the example embodiment can enable two or more contestants, three or more contestants, or many contestants to compete among each other in the same contest or round at the same time. The fantasy sports tournament contestants in an example embodiment can be placed together in a small group and allowed to compete in the same group among all members of the group at the same time. The gaming system of the example embodiment can run a plurality of small groups at the same time. Thus, the tournament can be partitioned into a plurality of small groups, wherein each small group can comprise a plurality (e.g., two or more or three or more, etc.) of contestants in each group where the contestants in each group play among all members of the same group at the same time. Conventional tournament systems do not provide this capability. As shown in  and , the sample screenshots illustrate an example round in the fantasy sports tournament of an example embodiment where more than two teams\/contestants can compete among each other in the same contest at the same time.  and  illustrate an example where there are twelve contestants competing against one another in the current round of the tournament at the same time. The final scores for each contestant are tabulated to the nearest hundredth and shown to the right of the name of the corresponding contestant. In this sample case, the top three contestants advance to the next round of the tournament while the bottom nine contestants are eliminated. This sample competition shows that the top three finishers in this example contest were: \u201cVicktorious Secret\u201d, \u201cODB\u201d and \u201cJust Beat Roger.\u201d Thus, the gaming system of an example embodiment enables small group competitions among multiple contestants at the same time. These examples illustrate how the various embodiments disclosed herein run counter to the traditional thinking that contestants must be paired in one-on-one matches like they are in real life sports where one team plays against another team as they do in baseball, basketball, hockey, football, soccer, etc. This novel approach provided by the example embodiments disclosed herein enables multiple contestants to compete against each other in the same round at the same time and enables the top finishers in the round to advance to the next round.
