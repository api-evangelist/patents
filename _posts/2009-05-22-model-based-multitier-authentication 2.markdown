title: Model based multi-tier authentication
abstract: Authentication is widely used to protect consumer data and computing services, such as email, document storage, and online banking. Current authentication models, such as those employed by online identity providers, may have limited options and configurations for authentication schemes. Accordingly, as provided herein, a model based authentication scheme may be configured based upon a policy and/or an authentication mechanism list. The policy may define the target resource, a user, a group the user belongs to, devices used to connect to the target resource, a service owning the target resource, etc. The authentication mechanism list may comprise predefined authentication mechanisms and/or user plug-in authentication mechanisms (e.g., user created authentication mechanism). Once the authentication scheme is configured, it may be enforced upon authentication requests from a user. Feedback may be provided to the user based upon patterns of usage of the target resource.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Many computing services (e.g., email, document storage, social networking, online banking, company network access, blogging services, etc.) utilize authentication mechanisms for security. Online identity providers may provide authentication schemes consumed by computing services and users with diverse security needs. Unfortunately, users may not have the ability to configure the type of authentication mechanisms within an authentication scheme that is used to access these computing resources. For example, a social networking service may provide users with an authentication scheme comprising a username and password along with a challenge-response question. If, for example, an online identity provider has a set authentication scheme for the social networking service, then a user may not have the ability to customize the authentication scheme, such as adding and\/or removing the authentication mechanisms (e.g., adding a device ID) used within the authentication scheme, which may provide a less satisfactory user experience, which may be exacerbated based upon the type of provider. That is, substantial disparity may exist between different types of providers regarding how authentication is accomplished. For example, a large scale online identification service provider may provide identity services that are consumed by services and consumers with diverse security needs, whereas a bank, for example, may have relatively fixed security requirements and a more homogeneous user base. Accordingly, a relatively static, inflexible authentication scheme may prove less than satisfactory given the diversity of authentication needs and\/or applications.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","As provided herein, an online identity provider may, for example, be able to offer a variety of authentication mechanisms through a configurable authentication scheme in a consumer friendly way to a large and diverse consumer base (e.g., individual user, a group of users, a large corporation, a computer service provider, etc.), thus affording flexibility to different online identity provides who have different needs. Accordingly, among other things, a technique for configuring a model based authentication scheme is disclosed. A policy and\/or an authentication mechanism list comprising at least one authentication mechanism to associate with an authentication scheme may be received. An authentication mechanism, for example, may comprise one or more predefined authentication mechanisms (e.g., authentication mechanisms already available from an online identity provider) and\/or one or more user plug-in authentication mechanism (e.g., authentication mechanism created and registered by a user that may not be already available from an online identity provider). It may be appreciated that an authentication mechanism may be interpreted as, for example, an authentication technique (e.g., a username and password authentication, a device ID authentication, etc.) that may be represented as a private\/public key pair. In another example, the actual technique for authentication (e.g., source code) may reside remotely (e.g., on a remote user's desktop), whereby the authentication mechanism provides a way to access and execute the actual technique.","The policy, for example may comprise a user policy (e.g., authentication for accessing user resources), a group policy (e.g., authentication for accessing group resources), a mode of connection policy (e.g., authentication based upon the type of device used for authenticating), a service policy (e.g., authentication for users accessing a service's resources), etc. It may be appreciated that a policy may be interpreted, for example, as an authentication configuration defining how the one or more authentication mechanisms may be enforced (e.g., whom may be authenticated, which authentication mechanisms may be used, what resources may be accessed, etc.). The authentication scheme may be configured according to the policy and\/or the authentication mechanism list.","The authentication scheme may be enforced upon receiving an authentication request from a user. For example, one or more authentication mechanisms defined within the authentication scheme may be executed upon the authentication request to authenticate the user based upon the policy configured within the authentication scheme. It may be appreciated that the authentication scheme may be configured such that an alternative authentication mechanism may be executed upon failure of an authentication mechanism (e.g., if the user does not have a device ID, then the user may alternatively authenticate using a one time password).","It may be appreciated that an authentication scheme may be interpreted, for example, as a security configuration (e.g., defining whom is to be authenticated, how they are authenticated, and what resources may be access as specified by a policy), which may be utilized by an online service provider to provide a configurable security solution to particular computing services and\/or users. For example, a social networking web service may configure an authentication scheme that defines how users of the social networking web service may be authenticated through an online identity provider. The online identity provider may authenticate users by enforcing the authentication scheme. That is, when a user attempts to authenticate through the online identity provider, one or more authentication mechanisms configured within the authentication scheme may be executed based upon a policy configured by the social networking website.","A user access model may be created based upon enforcement of the authentication scheme. For example, the user access model may be created and\/or updated based upon patterns of usage (e.g., how often a user accesses a resource, activities performed through the resource, etc.) The user access model may be compared with a recommended usage (e.g., typical security for a particular resource) to present a suggested authentication. In one example, it may be determined that a user may have a low security authentication scheme for frequently accessed banking data in comparison to typical security for frequently accessed banking data. The user may be presented with a suggested authentication scheme comprising a high security authentication scheme. In another example, the user may have a high security authentication scheme for personal email, wherein a recommended security may be a low security authentication scheme.","It may be appreciated that a user access model may be defined by, for example, a collection of services associated with a user and their respective usage patterns. For example, a user access model may be labeled as a high identity tier because the corresponding user actively uses email and instant messaging services as compare to a low identity tier without communication services provisioned or exhibiting a low usage of these services. It may be advantageous for a user corresponding to a high identity tier to secure these high identities with strong authentication policies within the authentication scheme.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","Currently, many computing services (e.g., document storage, email, work files, etc.) are provided with set authentication schemes with little available configuration (e.g., predefined authentication mechanisms) by online identity providers. In one example, an online banking website may use an online identity provider that provides users with a username and password mechanism for authentication. Unfortunately, users and the online banking website may be unable to configure the set authentication scheme (e.g., the user may not be able to change the authentication mechanism from the username and password to a smart card). It may be advantageous for online identity providers to provide a flexible authentication scheme, where users and\/or computing services may define the security mechanism through an open model approach. In this way, particular clients (e.g., small business, personal users, large corporations, etc.) may customize their own authentication scheme for accessing resources.","Among other things, a technique for configuring a model based authentication scheme is provided herein. The authentication scheme may be based upon predefined authentication mechanisms and\/or user plug-in authentication mechanisms. That is, the user may configure the authentication scheme with user plug-in authentication mechanisms that may not already be available as predefined authentication mechanisms, thus expanding a list of available authentication mechanisms.","The authentication scheme may also be configured based upon a policy. The policy allows further configuration of the authentication scheme based upon particular criteria. For example, a particular criteria may take into account the type of device used to access particular resources (e.g., a work computer as compared to a public computer), what resources are being accessed (e.g., email compared to sensitive work files), what group a user may belong to (e.g., group resources), and\/or the type of user being authenticated (e.g., a sales person being authenticated remotely compared to an employee logging in through a work computer). Once configured, the authentication scheme may be enforced upon authentication requests.","Enforcement of the authentication scheme and\/or patterns of resource usage may be utilized to model the user's access. The user's access may be compared with recommended usage to provide feedback to the user. For example, a suggestion to raise or lower the security of the authentication scheme may be provided to a user (e.g. the user's security is lower than the recommended security based upon the high frequency of usage).","One embodiment of configuring a model based authentication scheme is illustrated by an exemplary method  in . At , the method begins. At , a policy and\/or an authentication mechanism list comprising at least one authentication mechanism to associate with an authentication scheme may be received. The at least one authentication mechanism may comprise one or more predefined authentication mechanisms and\/or one or more user plug-in authentication mechanisms.","The authentication scheme may correspond to a multi-tiered authentication model. The authentication mechanism list may comprise multiple authentication mechanisms associated with multiple security tiers. For example, the authentication mechanism list may comprise a first authentication mechanism corresponding to a first security tier (e.g., a username and password) and a second authentication mechanism corresponding to a second security tier (e.g., device ID, smart card, one time password, challenge-response, IP spoofing authentication, etc.). It may be appreciated that one or more authentication mechanisms may be associated with a security tier and that one or more security tiers may be configured within the authentication scheme.","The policy may comprise a user policy defining access to user resources, a group policy defining access to group resources, a mode of connection policy defining access to resources based upon a mode (e.g., cell phone, work computer, public computer, etc.) used for connecting to the resources, and\/or a service policy defining access to resources of a service (e.g., a bank defining authentication for employees and bank clients).","In one example, the policy and\/or authentication mechanism list may be received through an interface (e.g., an online service) within which a user may be engaged. The user may be initially presented with one or more predefined authentication mechanisms. The user may expand the available authentication mechanisms by registering one or more user plug-in authentication mechanisms (e.g., a particular biological authentication mechanism created by the user, an authentication mechanism installed on the client's machine, etc.). When the authentication scheme is enforced, the user plug-in authentication mechanism may be called, for example, on the client machine for authentication. This allows a user to provide their own authentication mechanism that may be incorporated into the authentication scheme.","At , the authentication scheme may be configured according to the policy and\/or the authentication mechanism list. In one example, the authentication scheme may be configured with a user policy defining a particular user plug-in authentication mechanism to be enforced upon authentication requests to access the user's personal resources (e.g., personal email, home computer files, etc.). In another example, a service (e.g., a bank) may define a service policy defining authentication mechanisms for employees (e.g., device ID and\/or smart card) and authentication mechanisms for bank clients (e.g., username and password and\/or challenge-response). In yet another example, a business may define a mode of connection policy, wherein a device ID is used for authentication of employees at work computers and a one time password is used for authentication of employees at public computers.","The authentication scheme may be enforced upon authentication requests from a user. That is, one or more authentication mechanisms (e.g., a first authentication mechanism, a second authentication mechanism, a third authentication mechanism, etc.) defined within the authentication scheme may be executed upon the authentication request. It may be appreciated that alternative authentication mechanisms may be specified. For example, a second security tier within the authentication scheme may allow a user to authenticate through one or more different authentication mechanisms.","A user access model may be created based upon the enforcement of the authentication scheme. For example, the user access model may comprise information relating to the type of resource, the frequency of access, the type of authentication used, and\/or other information relating to the enforcement of the authentication scheme. The user access model may be updated based upon patterns of resource usage. The user access model may be compared with a recommended usage to present a user with a suggested authentication scheme. For example, the suggested authentication scheme may indicate that the user has a lower than ordinary authentication scheme.

The authentication mechanism list may comprise predefined authentication mechanisms and\/or user plug-in authentication mechanisms to associate with an authentication scheme . For example, the authentication mechanism list may comprise device ID, smart card, one time password, challenge-response, IP spoofing, biological authentication, etc. It may be appreciated that one or more of the authentication mechanisms may be associated with one or more security tiers (e.g., tiers within a multi-tier authentication model).","The authentication configuration component  may be configured to receive the policy and authentication mechanism list , with which the authentication configuration component  may configure the authentication scheme .

For example, a user may invoke the register user plug-in authentication mechanism button   to register the challenge-response  (e.g., a user plug-in authentication mechanism) with the authentication scheme configuration interface . Once registered, the challenge-response  may be available to select for configuring the authentication scheme.","In one example, within the one or more configurable policies , a user policy  associated with a personal email resource  may be specified, for example, by a user. That is, the authentication scheme that is to be configured based upon the user policy  may be associated with the personal email resource , such that the authentication scheme may be enforced upon authentication requests to access the personal email resource . Within the available authentication mechanism , the user name and password  has been specified as a tier (1)  security tier and the challenge-response  has been specified as a tier (2)  security tier. It may be appreciated that one or more available authentication mechanisms may not be selected for configuration within the authentication scheme; therefore the security tier  may comprise a N\/A (e.g., N\/A  and N\/A ) designating that a security tier is not applicable to the particular available authentication mechanism.","The user policy  and an authentication mechanism list comprising one or more selected available authentication mechanisms may be received.
