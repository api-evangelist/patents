title: Real time visualization of shear wave propagation in soft materials with sonoelastography
abstract: An ultrasound system visualizes shear wave propagation in real time by slowing down the propagation of the shear wave as seen by the ultrasound probe. The shear wave source propagates shear waves into the medium at a frequency ω. The ultrasound probe is vibrated by a vibrator at the frequency ω−Δω, where Δω is much smaller than ω. The wave propagation as seen by the ultrasound probe is slowed down by a factor Δω/ω. An appropriate value of Δω allows real-time visualization of the wave propagation. Variations include electronically producing a virtual vibration and the use of multiple shear wave sources.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/653,987, filed Feb. 18, 2005, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure.","The work leading to the present invention was supported by the National Institutes of Health under Grant No. 2R01 AG16317-01A1. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention is directed to a technique for sonoelastography and more particularly to such a technique in which shear waves are caused to interfere to produce a stationary or slowly moving wave from which the shear wave velocity can be determined.","It is widely accepted that the changes in elasticity of tissues are possible markers of certain diseases. In modern medicine, digital palpation is a routine screening method in physical examinations. One approach to examine the tissues' local elasticity is to visualize the local behavior of shear waves excited by internal or external sources.","A common approach to doing so is through an ultrasonic imaging modality called sonoelastography. Sonoelastography estimates the peak displacements of particle motion under audio frequency excitations by analyzing the power spectrum variance of the ultrasound echoes, which is proportional to the local vibration amplitude. Vibration fields are then mapped to a commercial ultrasound scanner's screen.","However, since the shear wave speed in soft tissues is on the order of a few meters per second, few imaging modalities are able to follow the propagation on a scale of a centimeter or less. The existing techniques to follow the shear wave propagation, either have a very high temporal sampling rate (high frame rate) or carefully subsample the propagation progressively (also known as the strobe effect). Such available systems either require off-line computing or prolonged data acquisition. Therefore, those techniques are not real-time.","It is therefore an object of the invention to develop such a technique which works in real time.","It is another object of the invention to develop such a technique which is non-invasive.","It is still another object of the invention to develop such a technique which does not require a high frame rate or \u201cstrobing.\u201d","It is yet another object of the invention to develop such a technique in which the ultrasound scanner can run asynchronously from the vibration, as a normal Doppler imaging sequence.","It is yet another object of the invention to develop such a technique which can be implemented with a single shear wave source.","It is yet another object of the invention to develop such a technique which does not assume any particular type of propagation of the shear wave in the medium.","To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention is directed to a technique for visualizing the shear waves in soft tissues in real time in which wave propagations are virtually \u201cslowed down\u201d for observations. The spatial distribution of the shear wave speed can be reconstructed from the wave propagation video and therefore indicates the size and location of the stiff region in the tissue. The present invention provides many of the advantages of magnetic resonate elastography (MRE), but with the additional advantages of real time visualization of the vibration fields.","One shear wave source propagates shear waves into the medium at the frequency \u03c9. An ultrasound (US) probe is held above the surface of the medium. The ultrasound probe is vibrated by a vibrator at the frequency \u03c9\u2212\u0394\u03c9, where \u0394\u03c9 is much smaller than \u03c9.","The total field estimated by the ultrasound scanner is the shear wave propagation relative to the probe vibration, which is called the modulated field. The modulated field is a representation of the propagating shear wave field, only at a different frequency and thus different velocity. By carefully selecting \u03c9 and \u0394\u03c9, the shear wave propagation can be virtually slowed down so that it can be visualized by sonoelastography.","The present invention is validated in both a homogeneous phantom experiment and an inhomogeneous phantom experiment. The present invention provides many of the advantages of magnetic resonate elastography (MRE), but with the additional advantages of real time visualization of the vibration fields.","Since the present invention can use the existing Doppler hardware on most modern US scanners, the frame rate of sonoelastography is as high as other Doppler modalities. In one example, regions where the vibration amplitude is low are displayed as dark green, while regions with high vibration are displayed as bright green.","The present invention offers a further advantage in that it does not assume any particular type of wave propagation; for example, it does not assume a plane wave. The vibration of the probe is completely temporally dependent and does not interfere with the spatial variation of the propagation of the shear wave. The present invention offers yet another advantage in that only one shear wave source is needed.","Variations include electronically producing a virtual vibration of the probe and the use of multiple shear wave sources.","The following disclosures disclose aspects of the invention and are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties into the present disclosure:","Zhe Wu et al, \u201cSonoelastographic imaging of interference patterns for estimation of the shear velocity of homogeneous biomaterials,\u201d 49 (2004) 911-922; and","Zhe Wu, \u201cShear Wave Interferometry and Holography, an Application of Sonoelastography,\u201d submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, N.Y., 2005.","A preferred embodiment of the invention will be set forth in detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like elements or steps throughout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104"],"br":{},"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["U","x,t","x","i","t\u2212s","x"]},"where s(x) is an arbitrary function subject to the wave equation and boundary conditions.","A wavefront is determined by assigning (\u03c9t\u2212s(x)) to a constant value:\n\n\u03c9()=\u03c6\n","where \u03c6 is a constant phase.","Taking derivatives on both sides:\n\n\u03c9\u2032()*\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["v","s"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"x"},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}]},{"mi":"\u03c9","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":["s","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}}}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"where vis the shear wave phase velocity and s\u2032(x) is the first derivative of s(x) with respect to x. s\u2032(x) is the local wave number or the local spatial frequency.

Since \u0394\u03c9\/\u03c9 is an arbitrary and controllable factor, the shear wave can thus be slowed by the mechanical modulation to be studied by ordinary ultrasound scanners with the sonoelastography modifications.","Experimental validation will now be described.","In the validating experiments, a double channel signal generator (Tektronix AFG320) produces two monochrome low frequency signals at slightly different frequencies. One channel of the signals (199.9 Hz) drives a bending piezo elements known as Thunder (Face International Corporation, Norfolk, Va.) which is applied to vibrate the US transducer. The other channel of the signal (200 Hz) drives a shear wave actuator (Piezo System, Massachusetts), which propagates shear waves into a Zerdine (CIRS, Virginia) ultrasound phantom. The phantom has a hard inclusion and is otherwise uniform. A GE Logiq 700, which has been specially modified to implement the sonoelastography functions, is applied to visualize the \u201cmodulation wave\u201d propagation. With the realtime visualization, the shear waves are virtually \u201cslowed down\u201d so that the local and subtle behaviors of the waves can be examined closely. The different wave speeds within and outside of the lesion can be perceived by the human eye. One frame of the \u201cmodulation wave\u201d propagation is shown in . The shear wave wavefronts are visibly distorted by the hard inclusion and thus the size and the location of the lesion is estimated.","There are a number of existing techniques from MRE and other methods for calculating vfrom s(x, t). Those can be optionally applied to the present invention as post-processing to create images of local v. As an example, the local frequency estimator (LFE) filter bank estimates the local spatial frequency which is inversely proportional to the local shear wave speed. Because of the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) nature of ultrasonic image acquisition, a series of procedures are proposed to reduce the noise and to increase the SNR.
