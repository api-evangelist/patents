{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to phase interpolators.","A phase interpolator outputs periodical signals based on a set of reference signals and a control signal. The control signal controls the phases of the output signals, and is typically a digital signal. A phase interpolator with a digital control signal produces output signals having discrete phases. Phase interpolators may be used in a variety of systems, such as radio frequency (RF) receivers, and Plesiochronous or Mesochronous communications systems.","Injection-lock refers to a phenomena when a first signal is coupled to a second signal while the two signals having similar but different frequencies (or phases), the coupling may cause the frequency (or phase) of the second signal to be essentially identical to the frequency (or phase) of the first signal.","A phase interpolator outputs periodical signals based on a set of reference signals and a control signal. Each reference signal has an amplitude and a phase. Hereafter, let \u03c6 denote the phase (in degrees (\u00b0)) of a signal. The control signal controls the phases of the output signals. The functionality of the phase interpolator is to set the phase of an output signal to track the digital control code provided by the control signal at its input.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["111","112","113","114","111","112","113","114","111","112","113","114","111","112","113","114","121","122","123","124","121","122","123","124","121","122","123","124"]},"The digital control signal may have a value represented using a binary number. The number of bits used to represent the digital control signal determines how may different phases may be produced by a phase interpolator (i.e., how many different phases an output signal can be set to). The larger number of bits used to represent the digital control signal, the larger number of different phases can be produced by the phase interpolator, and vise versa. As one example, suppose that the digital control signal is represented using seven (7) bits. Applying this 7-bit control signal to the phase interpolator illustrated in , the higher two (2) bits may be used to represent the sections within the phase range, while the lower five (5) bits may be used to represent the phases within each section. More specifically, for the higher two bits that represent the sections, \u201c00\u201d may indicate section  (between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0); \u201c01\u201d may indicate section  (between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0); \u201c10\u201d may indicate section  (between 180\u00b0 and 270\u00b0); and \u201c11\u201d may indicate section  (between 270\u00b0 and 360\u00b0). The lower five bits are used to represent the phases within each section, and five bits can represent up to 32 (2=32) distinct input values. Thus, with a 7-bit control signal, the phase interpolator can produce up to 128 (4\u00d732=128 or 2=128) different output phases. In other words, a specific output signal can be set to 128 different phases.","Phase interpolators are usually among the most critical components in high speed communication systems. High-speed phase interpolators often require use of multiple phases of high frequency reference clock input with low mutual phase error and low noise. However, distributing such high frequency and high quality reference clock signals can have negative impact on power and implementation cost. Particular embodiments herein describe a high-performance and low-power phase interpolator using a single reference clock phase.","Particular embodiments may utilize a ring voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) to generate a set of output signals of a phase interpolator, each having a specific and discrete phase within the phase range of the phase interpolator. Particular embodiments may contemplate any suitable multistage VCO to generate a set of output signals of a phase interpolator. For example and without limitation, particular embodiments may utilize rotary wave traveling oscillators or a multistage inductance-capacitance (LC) VCO to generate a set of output signals of a phase interpolator, each having a specific and discrete phase within the phase range of the phase interpolator.  illustrates an example ring VCO.
