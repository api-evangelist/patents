No. 14\/138,446, filed on Dec. 23, 2013 which claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/916,862 filed on Dec. 17, 2013, the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference.","The instant application contains a Sequence Listing which has been submitted electronically in ASCII format and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Said ASCII copy, created on Dec. 13, 2013, is named Sequencelisting.txt and is 179,086 bytes in size.","The technology described herein relates to ligands, e.g., antibodies for the treatment of disease.","It is recognized that individual humans differ in their sequence and recently several individuals have had their genomes sequenced, for instance James Watson and Craig Venter. Comparison of the genome sequence of individuals has revealed differences in their sequences in both coding and non-coding parts of the genome. Some of these variations in humans are significant and contribute to phenotypic differences between individuals. In extreme cases these will result in genetic disease. The 1000 Genomes Project has the objective of cataloguing sequences in the human genome, involving sequencing the genomes of a very large sampling of individuals from diverse art-recognized human ethnic populations.","Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein (Horton et al., 2007; Seidah and Prat, 2007). In vitro experiments have shown that adding PCSK9 to HepG2 cells lowers the levels of cell surface LDLR (Benjannet et al., 2004; Lagace et al., 2006; Maxwell et al., 2005; Park et al., 2004). Experiments with mice have shown that increasing PCSK9 protein levels decreases levels of LDLR protein in the liver (Benjannet et al., 2004; Lagace et al., 2006; Maxwell et al., 2005; Park et al., 2004), while PCSK9 knockout mice have increased levels of LDLR in the liver (Rashid et al., 2005). Additionally, various human PCSK9 mutations that result in either increased or decreased levels of plasma LDL have been identified (Kotowski et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2006). PCSK9 has been shown to directly interact with the LDLR protein, be endocytosed along with the LDLR, and co-immunofluoresce with the LDLR throughout the endosomal pathway (Lagace et al., 2006).","PCSK9 is a prohormone-proprotein convertase in the subtilisin (S8) family of serine proteases (Seidah et al., 2003). Humans have nine prohormone-proprotein convertases that can be divided between the S8A and S8B subfamilies (Rawlings et al., 2006). Furin, PC1\/PC3, PC2, PACE4, PC4, PC5\/PC6 and PC7\/PC8\/LPC\/SPC7 are classified in subfamily S8B. Crystal and NMR structures of different domains from mouse furin and PC1 reveal subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic domains, and a P domain directly C-terminal to the catalytic domain (Henrich et al., 2003; Tangrea et al., 2002). Based on the amino acid sequence similarity within this subfamily, all seven members are predicted to have similar structures (Henrich et al., 2005). SKI-1\/S1P and PCSK9 are classified in subfamily S8A. Sequence comparisons with these proteins also suggest the presence of subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic domains (Sakai et al., 1998; Seidah et al., 2003; Seidah et al., 1999). In these proteins the amino acid sequence C-terminal to the catalytic domain is more variable and does not suggest the presence of a P domain.","Prohormone-proprotein convertases are expressed as zymogens and they mature through a multi step process. The function of the pro-domain in this process is two-fold. The pro-domain first acts as a chaperone and is required for proper folding of the catalytic domain (Ikemura et al., 1987). Once the catalytic domain is folded, autocatalysis occurs between the pro-domain and catalytic domain. Following this initial cleavage reaction, the pro-domain remains bound to the catalytic domain where it then acts as an inhibitor of catalytic activity (Fu et al., 2000). When conditions are correct, maturation proceeds with a second autocatalytic event at a site within the pro-domain (Anderson et al., 1997). After this second cleavage event occurs the pro-domain and catalytic domain dissociate, giving rise to an active protease.","Autocatalysis of the PCSK9 zymogen occurs between Gln152 and Ser153 (VFAQ|S1P) (Naureckiene et al., 2003), and has been shown to be required for its secretion from cells (Seidah et al., 2003). A second autocatalytic event at a site within PCSK9's pro-domain has not been observed. Purified PCSK9 is made up of two species that can be separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE; the pro-domain at 17 Kd, and the catalytic plus C-terminal domains at 65 Kd. PCSK9 has not been isolated without its inhibitory pro-domain, and measurements of PCSK9's catalytic activity have been variable (Naureckiene et al., 2003; Seidah et al., 2003).","In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 polypeptide includes terminal residues, such as, but not limited to, leader sequence residues, targeting residues, amino terminal methionine residues, lysine residues, tag residues and\/or fusion protein residues. \u201cPCSK9\u201d has also been referred to as FH3, NARC1, HCHOLA3, proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9, and neural apoptosis regulated convertase 1. The PCSK9 gene encodes a proprotein convertase protein that belongs to the proteinase K subfamily of the secretory subtilase family. The term \u201cPCSK9\u201d denotes both the proprotein and the product generated following autocatalysis of the proprotein. When only the autocatalyzed product is being referred to (such as for an antigen binding protein or ligand that binds to the cleaved PCSK9), the protein can be referred to as the \u201cmature,\u201d \u201ccleaved\u201d, \u201cprocessed\u201d or \u201cactive\u201d PCSK9. When only the inactive form is being referred to, the protein can be referred to as the \u201cinactive\u201d, \u201cpro-form\u201d, or \u201cunprocessed\u201d form of PCSK9. The term PCSK9 also encompasses PCSK9 molecules incorporating post-translational modifications of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence, such as PCSK9 sequences that have been glycosylated, PCSK9 sequences from which its signal sequence has been cleaved, PCSK9 sequence from which its pro domain has been cleaved from the catalytic domain but not separated from the catalytic domain (see, e.g., FIGS. 1A and 1B of US20120093818A1).","Through the application of human genetic variation analysis and rationally-designed sequence selection the present invention provides for improved human patient diagnosis and therapy based on human PCSK9 variation. Importantly, the invention enables tailored medicines that address individual human patient genotypes or phenotypes.","The inventor's analysis of large numbers of naturally-occurring genomic human PCSK9 sequences reveals that there is significant variation across diverse human populations and provides for the ability for correlation between individual human patients and tailored medical and diagnostic approaches addressing the target. The technical applications of these findings, as per the present invention, thus contribute to better treatment, prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans and provides for patient benefit by enabling personalized medicines and therapies. This provides advantages of better prescribing, less wastage of medications and improved chances of drug efficacy and better diagnosis in patients.","Furthermore, the inventor surprisingly realised that some rarer natural forms, although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form, nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically-diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus, the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations, thereby extending the utility of the present invention and better serving patients in those populations.","With this, the inventor realised that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of an anti-PCSK9 ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and\/or prophylaxis of PCSK9-mediated or associated diseases and conditions. In this way, the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs\u2014as determined by the patient's genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand-in-hand with this, the invention provides for the genotyping and\/or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment, thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy, reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient (eg, poor efficacy and\/or side-effects) and avoids pharmaceutical mis-prescription and waste.","To this end, the invention provides:\u2014","In a First Configuration","An anti-human PCSK9 ligand for use in a method of treating and\/or preventing a PCSK9-mediated disease or condition in a human whose genome comprises a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 29-37, wherein the method comprises administering the ligand to the human.","In a Second Configuration","A ligand that binds a human PCSK9 comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 4-27 for use in a method comprising the step of using the ligand to target said PCSK9 in a human to treat and\/or prevent a disease or condition mediated by PCSK9, the method comprising administering the ligand to the human.","In a Third Configuration","A pharmaceutical composition or kit for treating and\/or preventing a PCSK9-mediated condition or disease.","In a Fourth Configuration","A method of producing an anti-human PCSK9 antibody binding site, the method comprising obtaining a plurality of anti-PCSK9 antibody binding sites, screening the antibody binding sites for binding to a human PCSK9 selected from the group consisting of forms f, c, r, p, m, e, h, aj and q or a catalytic or C-terminal domain or a peptide thereof that comprises amino acid variation from the corresponding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 2 or 3 and isolating an antibody binding site that binds in the screening step, and optionally producing a form f, c, r, p, m, e, h, aj or q PCSK9-binding fragment or derivative of the isolated antibody.","In a Fifth Configuration","A method of producing an anti-human PCSK9 antibody, the method comprising immunising a non-human vertebrate (eg, a mouse or a rat) with a human PCSK9 comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the amino acid sequences of forms f, c, r, p, m, e, h, aj and q or a catalytic or C-terminal domain or a peptide thereof that comprises amino acid variation from the corresponding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 2 or 3 and isolating an antibody that binds a human PCSK9 comprising selected from the group consisting of forms f, c, r, p, m, e, h, aj and q or a catalytic or C-terminal domain or a peptide thereof that comprises amino acid variation from the corresponding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 2 or 3, and optionally producing a form f, c, r, p, m, e, h, aj or q PCSK9-binding fragment or derivative of the isolated antibody.","In a Sixth Configuration","A kit for PCSK9 genotyping a human, wherein the kit comprises a nucleic acid (i) comprising a sequence of contiguous nucleotides that specifically hybridises to a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 29-37 or at least the catalytic domain- or C-terminal domain-encoding sequence thereof, or specifically hybridises to an antisense sequence or an RNA transcript of said sequence, wherein said sequence of contiguous nucleotides hybridises to at least one nucleotide present in said selected sequence which is not present in SEQ ID NO: 28 or hybridises to an antisense sequence or an RNA transcript thereof;

optionally also reducing or stopping statin treatment.","The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in conformation or activity of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients more effectively. The present invention provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer variant forms of a human target of interest (TOI), that target being human PCSK9.","The present invention harnesses the power of human genetic variation analysis and rationally-designed sequence selection. The technical applications of these approaches, as per the present invention, contribute to better treatment, prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans and provides for patient benefit by providing choice and enabling personalized medicines and therapies. This provides advantages of better prescribing, less wastage of medications and improved chances of drug efficacy and better diagnosis in patients.","As sources of genomic sequence variation data, the skilled person will be aware of the available databases and resources (including updates thereof) provided by the following:\u2014\n\n","The present invention involves the identification and cataloguing of naturally-occurring human genomic target sequence variants, including those found to be relatively low-frequency or rare variants that segregate with specific human ethnic populations and in many individual humans.","An aspect of the invention is based on rational design of sequence selection addressing the desirability to tailor medicaments and diagnostics to rarer, but yet still significant groups of human individuals that suffer from, or have the potential to suffer from (ie, who are at risk of), a disease or condition mediated or associated with the target of interest. In devising this rational design of the present aspect of the invention, the inventor included considerations of the spread of prevalence of naturally-occurring target variant sequences across multiple, diverse human ethnic populations, as well as the importance of addressing such populations where many individuals are likely to display a genotype and\/or phenotype of one or more of the variants being analysed. As part of this design, the inventor saw the importance of adopting the art-recognised classifications of human ethnic populations, and in this respect the inventor based the analysis and design on the recognised human ethnic populations adopted by the 1000 Genomes Project, since this is a resource that is, and will continue to be, widely adopted by the scientific and medical community.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Thus, in this aspect of the invention, the inventor designed the following variant sequence selection criteria, these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population.","Selection Criteria","Three or four of the following:\u2014\n\n","The inventor's selection included, as a consideration, selection for nucleotide variation that produced amino acid variation in corresponding PCSK9 forms (ie, non-synonymous variations), as opposed to silent variations that do not alter amino acid residues in the target protein.","Optionally, further sequence analysis and 3D in silico modelling (eg, see ) can also be used as an additional selection criterion: variants whose variant amino acid residues (versus the most common form of human PCSK9) are surface-exposed on the target are desirable for selection, since the inventor saw these as contributing to determining the topography of the target and potentially contributing to how and where ligand binding on the target occurs.","In an embodiment, the cumulative human allele frequency is 30, 25, 20, 15, 10 or 5% or less, eg, in the range from 1 to 20% or 1 to 15% or 1 to 10%.","In an embodiment, the total human genotype frequency is 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10 or 5% or less, eg, in the range from 1 to 25%, 1 to 20%, 1 to 15%, 1 to about 15%, 1 to 10%, 1 to about 10% or 1 to 5% or 1 to about 5%.","In an embodiment, the naturally-occurring human target variant sequences are found in at least 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 different human ethnic populations (using the standard categorisation of the 1000 Genomes Project).","In an embodiment, the naturally-occurring human target variant sequences are found in at least 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 130, 140 or 150 individuals distributed across such many different ethnic populations.","In an example, the following criteria are applied:\u2014\n\n","In any aspect, configuration, example, embodiment, clause or concept herein, frequencies may be determined using bioinformatics.","In any aspect, configuration, example, embodiment, clause or concept herein, frequencies may be determined by reference to a database comprising at least 1000 or 2000 human sequences.","In any aspect, configuration, example, embodiment, clause or concept herein \u201cheterozygous human genotype frequency\u201d means the cumulative frequency of all genotypes in the sample or database or in humans having one occurrence of the rare variant allele and one occurrence of another allele (heterozygous state), eg, genotype in 1000 Genomes database.","In any aspect, configuration, example, embodiment, clause or concept herein \u201chomozygous human genotype frequency means the cumulative frequency of two occurrences of the variant allele (homozygous state), eg, genotype in 1000 Genomes Project database.","In any aspect, configuration, example, embodiment, clause or concept herein \u201ctotal human genotype frequency\u201d means the total of heterozygous plus homozygous human genotype frequencies.","In any aspect, configuration, example, embodiment, clause or concept herein \u201ccumulative human allele frequency\u201d refers to the total of all occurrences of the variant allele in the sample or database or in humans, eg, in the 1000 Genomes Project database.","In an example, the criteria are applied with reference to one or more human genomic sequence databases as described herein.

In total, 52 populations were sampled, these being populations with:","African Ancestry","(Mbuti Pygmies, Biaka Pygmies, San peoples, and speakers of Niger-Kordofanian languages (Bantu, Yoruba or Mandenka populations),","Eurasian Ancestry","(European ancestry (Orcadian, Adygel, Basque, French, Russians, Italians, Sardinian, Tuscan),","Middle Eastern ancestry (Mozabite, Bedouin, Druze, Palestinians),","Central\/South Asian ancestry (Balochl, Brahul, Makrani, Sindhi, Pathan, Burusho, Hazara, Uygur, Kalash)),","East Asian Ancestry","(Han, Dal, Daur, Hezhen, Lahu, Miao, Orogen, She, Tujia, Tu, Xibo, Yi, Mongola, Naxi, Cambodian, Japanese, Yakut), Oceanic ancestry (Melanesian, Papuan); or","Americas Ancestry","(Karitiana, Surui, Colombian, Maya, Pima).","The International HapMap Project, Nature, 2003 Dec. 18; 426(6968):789-96, discloses that goal of the HapMap Project: to determine the common patterns of DNA sequence variation in the human genome by determining the genotypes of one million or more sequence variants, their frequencies and the degree of association between them in DNA samples from populations with ancestry from parts of Africa, Asia and Europe. The relevant human populations of differing geographical ancestry include Yoruba, Japanese, Chinese, Northern European and Western European populations. More specifically:\u2014","Utah population with Northern or Western European ancestry (samples collected in 1980 by the Centre d\u2032Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH));","population with ancestry of Yoruba people from Ibadan, Nigeria;","population with Japanese ancestry; and","population with ancestry of Han Chinese from China.","The authors, citing earlier publications, suggest that ancestral geography is a reasonable basis for sampling human populations.","A suitable sample of human populations used in the present invention is as follows:\u2014\n\n","In any configuration of the invention, in one embodiment, each human population is selected from a population marked \u201c(a)\u201d above.","In any configuration of the invention, in another embodiment, each human population is selected from a population marked \u201c(b)\u201d above.","In any configuration of the invention, in another embodiment, each human population is selected from a population marked \u201c(c)\u201d above.","In one embodiment the ethnic populations are selected from the group consisting of an ethnic population with European ancestry, an ethnic population with East Asian, an ethnic population with West African ancestry, an ethnic population with Americas ancestry and an ethnic population with South Asian ancestry.","In one embodiment the ethnic populations are selected from the group consisting of an ethnic population with Northern European ancestry; or an ethnic population with Western European ancestry; or an ethnic population with Toscani ancestry; or an ethnic population with British ancestry; or an ethnic population with Icelandic ancestry; or an ethnic population with Finnish ancestry; or an ethnic population with Iberian ancestry; or an ethnic population with Japanese ancestry; or an ethnic population with Chinese ancestry; or an ethnic population Vietnamese ancestry; or an ethnic population with Yoruba ancestry; or an ethnic population with Luhya ancestry; or an ethnic population with Gambian ancestry; or an ethnic population with Malawian ancestry; or an ethnic population with Native American ancestry; or an ethnic population with Afro-Caribbean ancestry; or an ethnic population with Mexican ancestry; or an ethnic population with Puerto Rican ancestry; or an ethnic population with Columbian ancestry; or an ethnic population with Peruvian ancestry; or an ethnic population with Ahom ancestry; or an ethnic population with Kayadtha ancestry; or an ethnic population with Reddy ancestry; or an ethnic population with Maratha; or an ethnic population with Punjabi ancestry.","Anti-Target Ligands","The invention provides useful anti-target ligands for addressing humans suffering from or likely to suffer from a disease or condition mediated or associated with PCSK9. For example, the ligand specifically binds to a PCSK9 variant as per the invention. The ligand may inhibit or antagonise the activity of the PCSK9 target, eg, the ligand neutralises the target. The skilled person will be familiar with neutralising ligands in general, such as antibodies or antibody fragments, and can readily test suitable ligands for specific binding and\/or neutralisation of a target in vitro or in an in vivo assay.","In an example, the ligand is (or has been determined as) a neutraliser of the PCSK9. In an example, determination is carried out in a human (eg, in a clinical trial). In an example, determination is carried out in a non-human, eg, in a mouse, rat, rabbit, pig, dog, sheep or non-human primate (eg, Cynomolgous monkey, rhesus monkey or baboon).","An antibody \u201cfragment\u201d comprises a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding and\/or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include dAb, Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","In an embodiment, the ligand of the invention is or comprises an antibody or antibody fragment, for example an antibody or fragment comprising human variable regions (and optionally also human constant regions). Anti-PCSK9 or PCSK9-binding or targeting antibodies and fragments can be prepared according to any known method, eg, using transgenic mice (eg, the Kymouse\u2122 or Velocimouse\u2122, or Omnimouse\u2122, Xenomouse\u2122, HuMab Mouse\u2122 or MeMo Mouse\u2122), rats (eg, the Omnirat\u2122), camelids, sharks, rabbits, chickens or other non-human animals immunised with the PCSK9 followed optionally by humanisation of the constant regions and\/or variable regions to produce human or humanised antibodies. In an example, display technologies can be used, such as yeast, phage or ribosome display, as will be apparent to the skilled person. Standard affinity maturation, eg, using a display technology, can be performed in a further step after isolation of an antibody lead from a transgenic animal, phage display library or other library. Representative examples of suitable technologies are described in US20120093818 (Amgen, Inc), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, eg, the methods set out in paragraphs [0309] to [0346].","Generally, a VELOCIMMUNE\u2122 or other mouse or rat can be challenged with the antigen of interest, and lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) are recovered from the mice that express antibodies. The lymphatic cells may be fused with a myeloma cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines, and such hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. DNA encoding the variable regions of the heavy chain and light chain may be isolated and linked to desirable isotypic constant regions of the heavy chain and light chain. Such an antibody protein may be produced in a cell, such as a CHO cell. Alternatively, DNA encoding the antigen-specific chimaeric antibodies or the variable domains of the light and heavy chains may be isolated directly from antigen-specific lymphocytes.","Initially, high affinity chimaeric antibodies are isolated having a human variable region and a mouse constant region. As described below, the antibodies are characterized and selected for desirable characteristics, including affinity, selectivity, epitope, etc. The mouse constant regions are replaced with a desired human constant region to generate the fully human antibody of the invention, for example wild-type or modified IgG1 or IgG4 (for example, SEQ ID NO: 751, 752,753 in US2011\/0065902 (which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety), which sequences are incorporated herein by reference for use in the ligands of the present invention). While the constant region selected may vary according to specific use, high affinity antigen-binding and target specificity characteristics reside in the variable region.","In an example, the ligand of the invention is or comprises a nucleic acid, eg, RNA, eg, siRNA that hybridises under stringent condition to the PCSK9 variant sequence, eg, hybridises a nucleotide sequence comprising one or more nucleotides that are variant (versus the most common PCSK9 sequence, eg, with reference to the 1000 Genomes Project database).","For example, the nucleic acid hybridises to a region immediately flanking a nucleotide that is variant compared to the corresponding nucleotide of the PCSK9 nucleotide sequence having the highest cumulative human allele frequency and\/or the highest total human genotype frequency. In an example, the nucleic acid hybridises to at two or more such variant nucleotides.","Specific hybridisation is under stringent conditions, as will be apparent to the skilled person, eg, conditions of 5\u00d7SSC, 5\u00d7Denhardt's reagent, and 0.5% SDS at 65\u00b0 C.","Target binding ability, specificity and affinity (Kd, Kand\/or K) can be determined by any routine method in the art, eg, by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The term \u201cKd\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.","In one embodiment, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is carried out at 25\u00b0 C. In another embodiment, the SPR is carried out at 37\u00b0 C.","In one embodiment, the SPR is carried out at physiological pH, such as about pH7 or at pH7.6 (eg, using Hepes buffered saline at pH7.6 (also referred to as HBS-EP)).","In one embodiment, the SPR is carried out at a physiological salt level, eg, 150 mM NaCl.","In one embodiment, the SPR is carried out at a detergent level of no greater than 0.05% by volume, eg, in the presence of P20 (polysorbate 20; eg, Tween-20\u2122) at 0.05% and EDTA at 3 mM.","In one example, the SPR is carried out at 25\u00b0 C. or 37\u00b0 C. in a buffer at pH7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% detergent (eg, P20) and 3 mM EDTA. The buffer can contain 10 mM Hepes. In one example, the SPR is carried out at 25\u00b0 C. or 37\u00b0 C. in HBS-EP.

In one embodiment, the invention features a composition which is a combination of a ligand of the invention (eg, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody), and a second therapeutic agent. The second therapeutic agent may be any agent that is advantageously combined with the ligand of the invention, for example, an agent capable of inducing a cellular depletion of cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase, such as, for example, cerovastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pitavastin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, etc; capable of inhibiting cholesterol uptake and or bile acid re-absorption; capable of increasing lipoprotein catabolism (such as niacin); and\/or activators of the LXR transcription factor that plays a role in cholesterol elimination such as 22-hydroxycholesterol.","In an example, the invention provides a method for inhibiting hPCSK9 activity using the anti-PCSK9 ligand of the invention (eg, an antibody or antigen-binding portion of the antibody of the invention), wherein the therapeutic methods comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the invention. The disorder treated is any disease or condition which is improved, ameliorated, inhibited or prevented by removal, inhibition or reduction of PCSK9 activity. Specific populations treatable by the therapeutic methods of the invention include subjects indicated for LDL apheresis, subjects with PCSK9-activating mutations (gain of function mutations, \u201cGOF\u201d), subjects with heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (heFH); subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia who are statin intolerant or statin uncontrolled; and subjects at risk for developing hypercholesterolemia who may be preventably treated. Other indications include dyslipidemia associated with secondary causes such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus, cholestatic liver diseases (primary biliary cirrhosis), nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, obesity; and the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases.","In specific embodiments of the method of the invention, the ligand of the invention (eg, anti-hPCSK9 antibody or antibody fragment of the invention) is useful to reduce elevated total cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and\/or apolipoprotein B (apolipoprotein B100).","The ligand (eg, antibody or antigen-binding fragment) of the invention may be used alone or in combination with a second agent, for example, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and\/or another lipid lowering drug.","The term \u201cisolated\u201d with reference to a ligand, antibody or protein, for example in any aspect, configuration, example or embodiment, means that a subject ligand, antibody, protein etc (1) is free of at least some other proteins with which it would normally be found, (2) is essentially free of other proteins from the same source, e.g., from the same species, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, (4) has been separated from at least about 50 percent of polynucleotides, lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is associated in nature, (5) is operably associated (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) with a polypeptide with which it is not associated in nature, or (6) does not occur in nature. Typically, an \u201cisolated\u201d ligand, antibody, protein etc constitutes at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 25%, or at least about 50% of a given sample. Genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA or other RNA, of synthetic origin, or any combination thereof can encode such an isolated ligand, antibody protein etc. Preferably, the isolated ligand, antibody protein etc is substantially free from proteins or polypeptides or other contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic, research or other use.","For example, an \u201cisolated\u201d antibody is one that has been identified, separated and\/or recovered from a component of its production environment (eg, naturally or recombinantly). Preferably, the isolated polypeptide is free of association with all other components from its production environment, eg, so that the antibody has been isolated to an FDA-approvable or approved standard. Contaminant components of its production environment, such as that resulting from recombinant transfected cells, are materials that would typically interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified: (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, an isolated polypeptide or antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.","Immunoconjugates","The invention encompasses the ligand (eg, antibody) conjugated to a therapeutic moiety (\u201cimmunoconjugate\u201d), such as a cytotoxin, a chemotherapeutic drug, an immunosuppressant or a radioisotope. Cytotoxin agents include any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples of suitable cytotoxin agents and chemotherapeutic agents for forming immunoconjugates are known in the art, see for example, WO 05\/103081, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Bispecifics","The antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific, bispecific, or multispecific. Multispecific mAbs may be specific for different epitopes of one target polypeptide or may contain antigen-binding domains specific for more than one target polypeptide. See, e.g., Tutt et al. (1991) J. Immunol. 147:60-69. The human anti-PCSK9 (eg, anti-PCSK9) mAbs can be linked to or co-expressed with another functional molecule, e.g., another peptide or protein. For example, an antibody or fragment thereof can be functionally linked (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other molecular entities, such as another antibody or antibody fragment, to produce a bispecific or a multispecific antibody with a second binding specificity.","An exemplary bi-specific antibody format that can be used in the context of the present invention involves the use of a first immunoglobulin (Ig) CH3 domain and a second Ig CH3 domain, wherein the first and second Ig CH3 domains differ from one another by at least one amino acid, and wherein at least one amino acid difference reduces binding of the bispecific antibody to Protein A as compared to a bi-specific antibody lacking the amino acid difference. In one embodiment, the first Ig CH3 domain binds Protein A and the second Ig CH3 domain contains a mutation that reduces or abolishes Protein A binding such as an H95R modification (by IMGT exon numbering; H435R by EU numbering). The second CH3 may further comprise a Y96F modification (by IMGT; Y436F by EU). Further modifications that may be found within the second CH3 include: D16E, L18M, N44S, K52N, V57M, and V821 (by IMGT; D356E, L358M, N384S, K392N, V397M, and V422I by EU) in the case of IgG1 antibodies; N44S, K52N, and V82I (IMGT; N384S, K392N, and V422I by EU) in the case of IgG2 antibodies; and Q15R, N44S, K52N, V57M, R69K, E79Q, and V82I (by IMGT; Q355R, N3845, K392N, V397M, R409K, E419Q, and V422I by EU) in the case of IgG4 antibodies. Variations on the bi-specific antibody format described above are contemplated within the scope of the present invention.","Treatment Population","The invention provides therapeutic methods for treating a human patient in need of a composition or ligand of the invention. While modifications in lifestyle and conventional drug treatment are often successful in reducing cholesterol levels, not all patients are able to achieve the recommended target cholesterol levels with such approaches. Various conditions, such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), appear to be resistant to lowering of LDL-C levels in spite of aggressive use of conventional therapy. Homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (hoFH, heFH) is a condition associated with premature atherosclerotic vascular disease. However, patients diagnosed with hoFH are largely unresponsive to conventional drug therapy and have limited treatment options. Specifically, treatment with statins, which reduce LDL-C by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and upregulating the hepatic LDL receptor, may have little effect in patients whose LDL receptors are non-existent or defective. A mean LDL-C reduction of only less than about 20% has been recently reported in patients with genotype-confirmed hoFH treated with the maximal dose of statins. The addition of ezetimibe 10 mg\/day to this regimen resulted in a total reduction of LDL-C levels of 27%, which is still far from optimal. Likewise, many patients are statin non-responsive, poorly controlled with statin therapy, or cannot tolerate statin therapy; in general, these patients are unable to achieve cholesterol control with alternative treatments. There is a large unmet medical need for new treatments that can address the short-comings of current treatment options.","Specific populations treatable by the therapeutic methods of the invention include patients indicated for LDL apheresis, subjects with PCSK9-activating (GOF) mutations, heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (heFH); subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia who are statin intolerant or statin uncontrolled; and subjects at risk for developing hypercholesterolemia who may be preventably treated.","Therapeutic Administration and Formulations","The invention provides therapeutic compositions comprising the anti-PCSK9 ligands, antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of the present invention. The administration of therapeutic compositions in accordance with the invention will be administered with suitable carriers, excipients, and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like. A multitude of appropriate formulations can be found in the formulary known to all pharmaceutical chemists: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. These formulations include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as LIPOFECTINT\u2122), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. See also Powell et al. \u201cCompendium of excipients for parenteral formulations\u201d PDA (1998) J Pharm Sci Technol 52:238-311.","The dose may vary depending upon the age and the size of a subject to be administered, target disease, conditions, route of administration, and the like. When the ligand, eg, antibody, of the present invention is used for treating various conditions and diseases associated with PCSK9, including hypercholesterolemia, disorders associated with LDL and apolipoprotein B, and lipid metabolism disorders, and the like, in an adult patient, it is advantageous to intravenously administer the ligand or antibody of the present invention normally at a single dose of about 0.01 to about 20 mg\/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.02 to about 7, about 0.03 to about 5, or about 0.05 to about 3 mg\/kg body weight. Depending on the severity of the condition, the frequency and the duration of the treatment can be adjusted.","Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, thus the composition invention provides the ligand by e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the mutant viruses, receptor mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432). Methods of introduction include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The composition may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local.","The pharmaceutical composition can be also delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer (1990) Science 249:1527-1533; Treat et al. (1989) in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365; Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid.).","In certain situations, the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton (1987) CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used; see, Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the composition's target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138, 1984).","The injectable preparations may include dosage forms for intravenous, subcutaneous, intracutaneous and intramuscular injections, drip infusions, etc. These injectable preparations may be prepared by methods publicly known. For example, the injectable preparations may be prepared, e.g., by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying the antibody or its salt described above in a sterile aqueous medium or an oily medium conventionally used for injections. As the aqueous medium for injections, there are, for example, physiological saline, an isotonic solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents, etc., which may be used in combination with an appropriate solubilizing agent such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol), a polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol), a nonionic surfactant [e.g., polysorbate 80, HCO-50 (polyoxyethylene (50 mol) adduct of hydrogenated castor oil)], etc. As the oily medium, there are employed, e.g., sesame oil, soybean oil, etc., which may be used in combination with a solubilizing agent such as benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, etc. The injection thus prepared is preferably filled in an appropriate ampoule. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered subcutaneously or intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition, with respect to subcutaneous delivery, a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be reusable or disposable. A reusable pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical composition. Once all of the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty, the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device, there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather, the disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the device. Once the reservoir is emptied of the pharmaceutical composition, the entire device is discarded.","Numerous reusable pen and autoinjector delivery devices have applications in the subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Examples include, but certainly are not limited to AUTOPEN\u2122 (Owen Mumford, Inc., Woodstock, UK), DISETRONIC\u2122 pen (Disetronic Medical Systems, Burghdorf, Switzerland), HUMALOG MIX 75\/25\u2122 pen, HUMALOG\u2122 pen, HUMALIN 70\/30\u2122 pen (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Ind.), NOVOPENTMI, II and III (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), NOVOPEN JUNIOR\u2122 (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), BD\u2122 pen (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.), OPTIPENT\u2122, OPTIPEN PRO\u2122, OPTIPEN STARLET\u2122, and OPTICLIKT\u2122 (sanofi-aventis, Frankfurt, Germany), to name only a few. Examples of disposable pen delivery devices having applications in subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention include, but certainly are not limited to the SOLOSTAR\u2122 pen (sanofi-aventis), the FLEXPEN\u2122 (Novo Nordisk), and the KWIKPEN\u2122 (Eli Lilly).","Advantageously, the pharmaceutical compositions for oral or parenteral use described above are prepared into dosage forms in a unit dose suited to fit a dose of the active ingredients. Such dosage forms in a unit dose include, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, injections (ampoules), suppositories, etc. The amount of the aforesaid antibody contained is generally about 5 to about 500 mg per dosage form in a unit dose; especially in the form of injection, it is preferred that the aforesaid antibody is contained in about 5 to about 100 mg and in about 10 to about 250 mg for the other dosage forms.","The invention provides therapeutic methods in which the ligand, eg, antibody or antibody fragment, of the invention is useful to treat hypercholesterolemia associated with a variety of conditions involving hPCSK9. The anti-PCSK9 ligands, eg, antibodies or antibody fragments, of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and the like. Combination therapies may include the anti-PCSK9 ligand of the invention with, for example, one or more of any agent that (1) induces a cellular depletion of cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase, such as cerivastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin; (2) inhibits cholesterol uptake and or bile acid re-absorption; (3) increase lipoprotein catabolism (such as niacin); and activators of the LXR transcription factor that plays a role in cholesterol elimination such as 22-hydroxycholesterol or fixed combinations such as ezetimibe plus simvastatin; a statin with a bile resin (e.g., cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam), a fixed combination of niacin plus a statin (e.g., niacin with lovastatin); or with other lipid lowering agents such as omega-3-fatty acid ethyl esters (for example, omacor).","Ligands of the invention are useful, for instance, in specific binding assays, for genotyping or phenotyping humans, affinity purification of the PCSK9 and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of PCSK9 activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting binding of PCSK9 to a congnate human receptor or protein, or inhibiting PCSK9-mediated activities.","The invention encompasses anti-PCSK9 (eg, PCSK9) antibody ligands having a modified glycosylation pattern. In some applications, modification to remove undesirable glycosylation sites may be useful, or e.g., removal of a fucose moiety to increase antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) function (see Shield et al. (2002) JBC 277:26733). In other applications, modification of galactosylation can be made in order to modify complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).","In an example, the invention features a pharmaceutical composition comprising a ligand of the invention, wherein the ligand is or comprises a recombinant human antibody or fragment thereof which specifically binds the PCSK9 (eg, a rare variant as described herein) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, the invention features a composition which is a combination of an antibody ligand or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the invention, and a second therapeutic agent. The second therapeutic agent may be any of an anti-inflammatory agent, an anti-angiogenesis agent, a painkiller, a diuretic, a chemotherapeutic agent, an anti-neoplastic agent, a vasodilator, a vasoconstrictor, a statin, a beta blocker, a nutrient, an adjuvant, an anti-obesity agent and an anti-diabetes agent.","\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable\u201d refers to approved or approvable by a regulatory agency of the USA Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, including humans. A \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, or adjuvant\u201d refers to an carrier, excipient, or adjuvant that can be administered to a subject, together with an agent, e.g., any antibody or antibody chain described herein, and which does not destroy the pharmacological activity thereof and is nontoxic when administered in doses sufficient to deliver a therapeutic amount of the agent.","In an example, the invention features a method for inhibiting PCSK9 activity using the anti-PCSK9 ligand of the invention (eg, an antibody or antigen-binding portion of the antibody of the invention), wherein the therapeutic method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the ligand. The disorder treated is any disease or condition which is improved, ameliorated, inhibited or prevented by removal, inhibition or reduction of PCSK9 activity.","By the phrase \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is meant an amount that produces the desired effect for which it is administered. The exact amount will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques (see, for example, Lloyd (1999) The Art, Science and Technology of Pharmaceutical Compounding).","Genotyping & Phenotyping","The skilled person will be familiar with techniques that can be used for accurate genotyping and application to the invention.

Cleavage separates a 5\u2032-fluorophore from a 3\u2032-quencher leading to detectable fluorescent signal. The use of two allele-specific probes carrying different fluorophores permits SNP determination in the same tube without any post-PCR processing. Genotype is determined from the ratio of intensities of the two fluorescent probes at the end of amplification. Thus, rather than taking advantage of the full set of real-time PCR data as in quantitative studies, only end-point data are used.","TaqMan SNP genotyping in a high-throughput, automated manner is facilitated by the use of validated Pre-made TaqMan\u00ae Genotyping assays, but Custom TaqMan\u00ae Assays may also be used (High-throughput genotyping with single nucleotide polymorphisms, Ranade K, Chang M S, Ting C T, Pei D, Hsiao C F, Olivier M, Pesich R, Hebert J, Chen Y D, Dzau V J, Curb D, Olshen R, Risch N, Cox D R, Botstein D, Genome Res. 2001 July; 11(7):1262-8; Assessment of two flexible and compatible SNP genotyping platforms: TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays and the SNPlex Genotyping System, De la Vega F M, Lazaruk K D, Rhodes M D, Wenz M H, Mutat Res. 2005 Jun. 3; 573(1-2):111-35). The results of the assay can be automatically determined by genotyping software provided with real-time thermal cyclers (e.g. IQ software of Bio-Rad, Sequence Detection Software of Applied Biosystems).","Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be determined using TaqMan\u2122 real-time PCR assays (Applied Biosystems) and commercial software that assigns genotypes based on reporter probe signals at the end of amplification. An algorithm for automatic genotype calling of SNPs using the full course of TaqMan real-time data is available for use (A. Callegaro et al, Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34(7): e56, Published online 2006 April 14. doi: 10.1093\/nar\/gk1185, PMCID: PMC1440877). The algorithm is unique in that it classifies samples according to the behavior of blanks (no DNA samples), which cluster with heterozygous samples. This method of classification eliminates the need for positive controls and permits accurate genotyping even in the absence of a genotype class, for example when one allele is rare.","The skilled person will be familiar with techniques that can be used for accurate phenotyping and application to the invention. These include the use of amino acid sequencing of isolated target protein and comparison of sequences from different variants (eg, with the most common variant). An antibody that specifically and selectively binds in the area of a SNP under stringent conditions can also be used to identify a particular variant. In another method, the genotype is determined and a corresponding amino acid sequence (phenotype) determined, eg, by in silico translation.","For convenience, the meaning of some terms and phrases used in the specification, examples, and appended claims, are provided below. Unless stated otherwise, or implicit from context, the following terms and phrases include the meanings provided below. The definitions are provided to aid in describing particular embodiments, and are not intended to limit the claimed invention, because the scope of the invention is limited only by the claims. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

In the context of a marker or symptom, an \u201cincrease\u201d is a statistically significant increase in such level.","As used herein, the term \u201csubstantially\u201d refers to the qualitative condition of exhibiting total or near-total extent or degree of a characteristic or property of interest. One of ordinary skill in the biological arts will understand that biological and chemical phenomena rarely, if ever, go to completion and\/or proceed to completeness or achieve or avoid an absolute result. The term \u201csubstantially\u201d is therefore used herein to capture the potential lack of completeness inherent in many biological and chemical phenomena. For the removal of doubt, \u201csubstantially\u201d can refer to at least a 90% extent or degree of a characteristic or property of interest, e.g. at least 90%, at least 92%, at least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99% or greater.","As used herein, a \u201csubject\u201d means a human or animal. Usually the animal is a vertebrate such as a primate, rodent, domestic animal or game animal. Primates include chimpanzees, cynomologous monkeys, spider monkeys, and macaques, e.g., Rhesus.

The terms, \u201cindividual,\u201d \u201cpatient\u201d and \u201csubject\u201d are used interchangeably herein. In some embodiments, the subject can be a non-human vertebrate, e.g. a primate, a rodent, a mouse, a rat, a pig, a sheep, a zebrafish, a frog, etc.","Preferably, the subject is a mammal. The mammal can be a human, non-human primate, mouse, rat, dog, cat, horse, or cow, but is not limited to these examples. Mammals other than humans can be advantageously used as subjects that represent animal models of a disease or condition, e.g., a cardiovascular condition. A subject can be male or female.","A subject can be one who has been previously diagnosed with or identified as suffering from or having a condition in need of treatment or one or more complications related to such a condition, and optionally, have already undergone treatment for the condition or the one or more complications related to the condition. Alternatively, a subject can also be one who has not been previously diagnosed as having the condition or one or more complications related to the condition. For example, a subject can be one who exhibits one or more risk factors for the condition or one or more complications related to the condition or a subject who does not exhibit risk factors.","A \u201csubject in need\u201d or \u201chuman in need\u201d of treatment for a particular condition can be a subject having that condition, such as increased cholesterol levels, diagnosed as having that condition, or at risk of developing that condition.","As used herein, the terms \u201cprotein\u201d and \u201cpolypeptide\u201d are used interchangeably herein to designate a series of amino acid residues, connected to each other by peptide bonds between the alpha-amino and carboxy groups of adjacent residues. The terms \u201cprotein\u201d, and \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refer to a polymer of amino acids with natural amino acids. When referring to \u201cmodified polypeptides\u201d one refers to polypeptides that include modified amino acids (e.g., phosphorylated, glycated, glycosylated, etc.) and amino acid analogs, regardless of its size or function. \u201cProtein\u201d and \u201cpolypeptide\u201d are often used in reference to relatively large polypeptides, whereas the term \u201cpeptide\u201d is often used in reference to small polypeptides, but usage of these terms in the art overlaps. The terms \u201cprotein\u201d and \u201cpolypeptide\u201d are used interchangeably herein when referring to a gene product and fragments thereof. Thus, exemplary polypeptides or proteins include gene products, naturally occurring proteins with the specified sequence. One can also use peptide homologs, peptide orthologs, peptide paralogs, peptide fragments and other equivalents, variants, fragments, and analogs of the peptides as these terms are understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.","As used herein, the term \u201cnucleic acid\u201d or \u201cnucleic acid sequence\u201d refers to any molecule, preferably a polymeric molecule, incorporating units of ribonucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid. The nucleic acid can be either single-stranded or double-stranded. A single-stranded nucleic acid can be one nucleic acid strand of a denatured double-stranded DNA. Alternatively, it can be a single-stranded nucleic acid not derived from any double-stranded DNA. In one aspect, the nucleic acid can be DNA. In another aspect, the nucleic acid can be RNA. Suitable nucleic acid molecules are DNA, including genomic DNA or cDNA. Other suitable nucleic acid molecules are RNA, including mRNA.

Typically, the siRNA is at least about 15-40 nucleotides in length (e.g., each complementary sequence of the double stranded siRNA is about 15-40 nucleotides in length, and the double stranded siRNA is about 15-40 base pairs in length, preferably about 19-25 base nucleotides, e.g., 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 nucleotides in length). In some embodiments, a siRNA can be blunt-ended. In some embodiments, a siRNA can comprise a 3\u2032 and\/or 5\u2032 overhang on each strand having a length of about 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 nucleotides. The length of the overhang is independent between the two strands, i.e., the length of the overhang on one strand is not dependent on the length of the overhang on the second strand. The siRNA molecules can also comprise a 3\u2032 hydroxyl group. In some embodiments, the siRNA can comprise a 5\u2032 phosphate group. A siRNA has the ability to reduce or inhibit expression of a gene or target RNA when the siRNA is present or expressed in the same cell as the target gene, e.g. the target RNA. siRNA-dependent post-transcriptional silencing of gene expression involves cutting the target RNA molecule at a site guided by the siRNA.","As used herein, \u201cPCSK9\u201d or \u201cproprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9\u201d refers to a serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein (Horton et al., 2007; Seidah and Prat, 2007). PCSK9 has been shown to directly interact with the LDLR protein, be endocytosed along with the LDLR, and co-immunofluoresce with the LDLR throughout the endosomal pathway (Lagace et al., 2006). PCSK9 is a prohormone-proprotein convertase in the subtilisin (S8) family of serine proteases (Seidah et al., 2003). The sequence of PCSK9 for a variety of species is known, e.g., human PCSK9 (NCBI Gene ID No: 255738). Nucleotide and polypeptide sequences for a number of PCSK9 isoforms are provided herein, e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 1-37.","PCSK9 exists as both a pro-form and a mature form. Autocatalysis of the PCSK9 proform occurs between Gln152 and Ser153 (VFAQ1S1P) (Naureckiene et al., 2003), and has been shown to be required for its secretion from cells (Seidah et al., 2003). The inactive form prior to this cleavage can be referred to herein as the \u201cinactive\u201d, \u201cpro-form\u201d, or \u201cunprocessed\u201d form of PCSK9. The C-terminal fragment generated by the autocatalysis event can be referred to herein as the \u201cmature,\u201d \u201ccleaved\u201d, \u201cprocessed\u201d or \u201cactive\u201d PCSK9. Examples of pro-form and mature PCSK9 isoforms are provided herein, see, e.g. SEQ ID NOs: 1-27.","As used herein, the \u201ccatalytic domain\u201d of PCSK9 refers to the portion of a PCSK9 polypeptide corresponding to positions 153 to 449 of PCSK9, e.g. of SEQ ID NO: 1. As used herein, the \u201cC-terminal domain\u201d of PCSK9 refers to the portion of a PCSK9 polypeptide corresponding to positions 450-692 of PCSK9, e.g., of SEQ ID NO: 1.","As used herein, a disease or condition \u201cmediated by PCSK9\u201d refers to a disease or condition which is caused by or characterized by a change in PCSK9, e.g. a change in expression level, a change in activity, and\/or the presence of a variant or mutation of PCSK9. Non-limiting examples of such diseases or conditions can include, for example, a lipid disorder, hyperlipoproteinemia, hyperlipidemia; dyslipidemia; hypercholesterolemia, a heart attack, a stroke, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, claudication, type II diabetes, high blood pressure, and a cardiovascular disease or condition. In an example, the disease or condition is an inflammatory or autoimmune disease or condition. Methods of identifying and\/or diagnosing such diseases and conditions are well known to medical practitioners of ordinary skill.","A subject at risk of having or developing a disease or condition mediated by PCSK9 can be a subject exhibiting one or more signs or symptoms of such a disease or condition or having one or more risk factors for such a disease or condition, e.g. being overweight, having elevated cholesterol level, comprising one or more genetic polymorphisms known to predispose to the disease or condition, e.g., elevated cholesterol level, such as having a mutation in the LDLR (encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor) or APOB (encoding apolipoprotein B) or in the PCSK9 gene and\/or having a family history of such a disease or condition.","As used herein, \u201cligand\u201d refers to a molecule which can bind, e.g., specifically bind, to a second molecule or receptor. In some embodiments, a ligand can be, e.g., an antibody, antibody fragment, antibody portion, and\/or affibody.","The term \u201cvariant\u201d as used herein refers to a peptide or nucleic acid that differs from the polypeptide or nucleic acid (eg, the most common one in humans, eg, most frequent in a database as disclosed herein, such as the 1000 Genomes Project database) by one or more amino acid or nucleic acid deletions, additions, yet retains one or more specific functions or biological activities of the naturally occurring molecule. Amino acid substitutions include alterations in which an amino acid is replaced with a different naturally-occurring amino acid residue. Such substitutions may be classified as \u201cconservative\u201d, in which case an amino acid residue contained in a polypeptide is replaced with another naturally occurring amino acid of similar character either in relation to polarity, side chain functionality or size. Such conservative substitutions are well known in the art. Substitutions encompassed by the present invention may also be \u201cnon-conservative\u201d, in which an amino acid residue which is present in a peptide is substituted with an amino acid having different properties, such as naturally-occurring amino acid from a different group (e.g., substituting a charged or hydrophobic amino; acid with alanine), or alternatively, in which a naturally-occurring amino acid is substituted with a non-conventional amino acid. In some embodiments amino acid substitutions are conservative. Also encompassed within the term variant when used with reference to a polynucleotide or polypeptide, refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide that can vary in primary, secondary, or tertiary structure, as compared to a reference polynucleotide or polypeptide, respectively (e.g., as compared to a wild-type polynucleotide or polypeptide).","Variants of PCSK9 are provided elsewhere herein. Variants of PCSK9 can include the forms described herein as a, f, c, r, p, m, e h, aj, and q. Sequences of these variants are provided herein, see, e.g, SEQ ID NOs:1-27 and in Table 1.","In some aspects, one can use \u201csynthetic variants\u201d, \u201crecombinant variants\u201d, or \u201cchemically modified\u201d polynucleotide variants or polypeptide variants isolated or generated using methods well known in the art. \u201cModified variants\u201d can include conservative or non-conservative amino acid changes, as described below. Polynucleotide changes can result in amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions, fusions and truncations in the polypeptide encoded by the reference sequence. Some aspects use include insertion variants, deletion variants or substituted variants with substitutions of amino acids, including insertions and substitutions of amino acids and other molecules) that do not normally occur in the peptide sequence that is the basis of the variant, for example but not limited to insertion of ornithine which do not normally occur in human proteins. The term \u201cconservative substitution,\u201d when describing a polypeptide, refers to a change in the amino acid composition of the polypeptide that does not substantially alter the polypeptide's activity. For example, a conservative substitution refers to substituting an amino acid residue for a different amino acid residue that has similar chemical properties. Conservative amino acid substitutions include replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, or a threonine with a serine.","\u201cConservative amino acid substitutions\u201d result from replacing one amino acid with another having similar structural and\/or chemical properties, such as the replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, or a threonine with a serine. Thus, a \u201cconservative substitution\u201d of a particular amino acid sequence refers to substitution of those amino acids that are not critical for polypeptide activity or substitution of amino acids with other amino acids having similar properties (e.g., acidic, basic, positively or negatively charged, polar or non-polar, etc.) such that the substitution of even critical amino acids does not reduce the activity of the peptide, (i.e. the ability of the peptide to penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB)). Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. For example, the following six groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Serine (S), Threonine (T); 2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); 3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K); 5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); and 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W). (See also Creighton, Proteins, W. H. Freeman and Company (1984), incorporated by reference in its entirety.) In some embodiments, individual substitutions, deletions or additions that alter, add or delete a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids can also be considered \u201cconservative substitutions\u201d if the change does not reduce the activity of the peptide. Insertions or deletions are typically in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids. The choice of conservative amino acids may be selected based on the location of the amino acid to be substituted in the peptide, for example if the amino acid is on the exterior of the peptide and expose to solvents, or on the interior and not exposed to solvents.","In alternative embodiments, one can select the amino acid which will substitute an existing amino acid based on the location of the existing amino acid, i.e. its exposure to solvents (i.e. if the amino acid is exposed to solvents or is present on the outer surface of the peptide or polypeptide as compared to internally localized amino acids not exposed to solvents). Selection of such conservative amino acid substitutions are well known in the art, for example as disclosed in Dordo et al, J. MoI Biol, 1999, 217, 721-739 and Taylor et al, J. Theor. Biol. 119(1986); 205-218 and S. French and B. Robson, J. MoI. Evol. 19(1983)171. Accordingly, one can select conservative amino acid substitutions suitable for amino acids on the exterior of a protein or peptide (i.e. amino acids exposed to a solvent), for example, but not limited to, the following substitutions can be used: substitution of Y with F, T with S or K, P with A, E with D or Q, N with D or G, R with K, G with N or A, T with S or K, D with N or E, I with L or V, F with Y, S with T or A, R with K, G with N or A, K with R, A with S, K or P.","In alternative embodiments, one can also select conservative amino acid substitutions encompassed suitable for amino acids on the interior of a protein or peptide, for example one can use suitable conservative substitutions for amino acids is on the interior of a protein or peptide (i.e. the amino acids are not exposed to a solvent), for example but not limited to, one can use the following conservative substitutions: where Y is substituted with F, T with A or S, I with L or V, W with Y, M with L, N with D, G with A, T with A or S, D with N, I with L or V, F with Y or L, S with A or T and A with S, G, T or V. In some embodiments, non-conservative amino acid substitutions are also encompassed within the term of variants.","As used herein an \u201cantibody\u201d refers to IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD or IgE molecules or antigen-specific antibody fragments thereof (including, but not limited to, a Fab, F(ab\u2032), Fv, disulphide linked Fv, scFv, single domain antibody, closed conformation multispecific antibody, disulphide-linked scfv, diabody), whether derived from any species that naturally produces an antibody, or created by recombinant DNA technology; whether isolated from serum, B-cells, hybridomas, transfectomas, yeast or bacteria. Antibodies can be humanized using routine technology.","As described herein, an \u201cantigen\u201d is a molecule that is bound by a binding site on an antibody agent. Typically, antigens are bound by antibody ligands and are capable of raising an antibody response in vivo. An antigen can be a polypeptide, protein, nucleic acid or other molecule or portion thereof. The term \u201cantigenic determinant\u201d refers to an epitope on the antigen recognized by an antigen-binding molecule, and more particularly, by the antigen-binding site of said molecule.","As used herein, the term \u201cantibody fragment\u201d refers to a polypeptide that includes at least one immunoglobulin variable domain or immunoglobulin variable domain sequence and which specifically binds a given antigen. An antibody fragment can comprise an antibody or a polypeptide comprising an antigen-binding domain of an antibody. In some embodiments, an antibody fragment can comprise a monoclonal antibody or a polypeptide comprising an antigen-binding domain of a monoclonal antibody. For example, an antibody can include a heavy (H) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH), and a light (L) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL). In another example, an antibody includes two heavy (H) chain variable regions and two light (L) chain variable regions. The term \u201cantibody fragment\u201d encompasses antigen-binding fragments of antibodies (e.g., single chain antibodies, Fab and sFab fragments, F(ab\u2032)2, Fd fragments, Fv fragments, scFv, and domain antibodies (dAb) fragments (see, e.g. de Wildt et al., Eur J. Immunol. 1996; 26(3):629-39; which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety)) as well as complete antibodies. An antibody can have the structural features of IgA, IgG, IgE, IgD, IgM (as well as subtypes and combinations thereof).

VH refers to the variable domain of the heavy chain. VL refers to the variable domain of the light chain. According to the methods used in this invention, the amino acid positions assigned to CDRs and FRs may be defined according to Kabat (Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1987 and 1991)) or according to IMGT nomenclature.","D domain or region refers to the diversity domain or region of an antibody chain. J domain or region refers to the joining domain or region of an antibody chain.","An antibody \u201cgene segment\u201d, e.g. a VH gene segment, D gene segment, or JH gene segment refers to oligonucleotide having a nucleic acid sequence that encodes that portion of an antibody, e.g. a VH gene segment is an oligonucleotide comprising a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a polypeptide VH domain.","The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed \u201ccomplementarity determining regions\u201d (\u201cCDR\u201d), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed \u201cframework regions\u201d (\u201cFR\u201d). The extent of the framework region and CDRs has been precisely defined (see, IMGT or Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242, and Chothia, C. et al. (1987) J. Mol.

Each VH and VL is typically composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.","The terms \u201cantigen-binding fragment\u201d or \u201cantigen-binding domain\u201d, which are used interchangeably herein are used to refer to one or more fragments of a full length antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to a target of interest. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term \u201cantigen-binding fragment\u201d of a full length antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab\u2032)2 fragment, a bivalent fragment including two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) an Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) an Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546; which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety), which consists of a VH or VL domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) that retains specific antigen-binding functionality.","As used herein, the term \u201cantibody binding site\u201d refers to a polypeptide or domain that comprises one or more CDRs of an antibody and is capable of binding an antigen.

In this respect, the invention provides the following aspects.","In a First Aspect:","A method of reducing cholesterol level or maintaining previously reduced cholesterol level in a human in need thereof comprising\n\n","In an example, step (a) comprises selecting a human comprising a PCSK9 protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of (i) or (ii).","In an example, the antibody or antibody fragment specifically binds said PCSK9 amino acid sequence. In an example, the antibody or antibody fragment binds a second PCSK9 protein comprising an amino acid sequence encoded by (i) a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 29-37; and\/or (ii) a nucleotide sequence thereof encoding the catalytic domain or C-terminal domain of a PCSK9 protein. In an example, the antibody comprises a VH domain derived from the recombination of a human VH gene segment, human D gene segments and a human JH segment, the VH gene segment comprising a nucleotide sequence that comprises a single nucleotide polymorphism with nucleotide C as indicated in rs56069819 (CTGTACCAAGCCTCCCCCAGACTCCA[A\/C]CAGCTGCACCTCACACTGGACACCT) 0. In an example, the VH gene segment is VH3-23*04 (SEQ ID NO: 38) encoded by a sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 39. In an example, the antibody comprises a VH domain, wherein the VH domain comprises the framework 1 sequence of SEQ ID No. 40.","In an example, the human has been determined to comprise the nucleotide sequence of (i) and\/or (ii). In an example, the human has been determined to comprise a proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) variant protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of (i) and\/or (ii). In an example, the method further comprises the step of determining that the human comprises the nucleotide sequence of (i) and\/or (ii).","In an example, the determining step is performed before administration of the antibody to the human. In an example, the method further comprises the step of determining that the human comprises a proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) variant protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of (i) and\/or (ii). In an example, the determining step is performed before administration of the antibody to the human. In an example, the step of determining comprises assaying a biological sample from the human for (i) a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 29-37; and\/or (ii) a nucleotide sequence encoding the catalytic domain or C-terminal domain of the PCSK9 variant protein. In an example, the assaying comprises contacting the biological sample with\n\n","In an example, the assaying comprises nucleic acid amplification and optionally one or more methods selected from sequencing, next generation sequencing, nucleic acid hybridization, and allele-specific amplification. In an example, the assaying is performed in a multiplex format. In an example the method further comprises obtaining the biological sample from the human. In an example, said biological sample comprises serum, blood, feces, tissue, a cell, urine and\/or saliva of said human.","In an example, said human is or has been further determined to be substantially resistant to statin treatment. In an example, the human is receiving or has received statin treatment or has reduced responsiveness to statin treatment.","In an example, the human is further administered a statin. In an example, said antibody or antibody fragment and said statin are administered separately or simultaneously.","In an example, said human is indicated as heterozygous for a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 29-37 and\/or the nucleotide sequence thereof encoding the catalytic domain- or C-terminal domain-encoding sequence of a PCSK9 protein. In an example, said human is further indicated as comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 28 and\/or the catalytic domain- or C-terminal domain-encoding sequence thereof.","In an example, said human is indicated as homozygous for a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 29-37 and\/or the catalytic domain- or C-terminal domain-encoding sequence thereof.","In an example, said human has been diagnosed with at least one condition selected from a lipid disorder, hyperlipoproteinemia, hyperlipidemia; dyslipidemia; hypercholesterolemia, a heart attack, a stroke, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, claudication, type II diabetes, high blood pressure, and a cardiovascular disease or condition.","In an example, said method treats or prevents in said human at least one condition selected from a lipid disorder, hyperlipoproteinemia, hyperlipidemia; dyslipidemia; hypercholesterolemia, a heart attack, a stroke, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, claudication, type II diabetes, high blood pressure, and a cardiovascular disease or condition.","Some embodiments of the technology described herein can be defined according to any of the following numbered paragraphs:\n\n","The present invention provides anti-PCSK9 ligands; and PCSK9-binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands, for instance, are useful in specific binding assays, for genotyping or phenotyping humans, affinity purification of PCSK9, in particular human PCSK9 or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of PCSK9 activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, or inhibiting PCSK9-mediated activities.","Anti-PCSK9 ligands (eg, antibodies and anti-sense RNA) have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so-called \u201cwild-type\u201d human PCSK9, which is a commonly-occurring form (see, eg, US20120093818A1 and US20110065902A1). While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human PCSK9, the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting much rarer\u2014but still naturally-occurring\u2014forms of PCSK9 amongst human populations. In this way, the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human PCSK9 forms that can serve as useful targets (at the protein or nucleic acid level) for human treatment, prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with PCSK9 activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies, prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common PCSK9 gene or protein (ie, the form a or a\u2032 as used in US20120093818A1 and US20110065902A1 to generate antibodies).","The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and\/or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention, therefore, provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer PCSK9 polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or \u201calleles\u201d (at the nucleotide level), in many of the examples determined by the inventor, comprise multiple changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences, ie, there are multiple non-synonymous changes at the nucleotide level that translate into multiple corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.","Furthermore, the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms, although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form, nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically-diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus, the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations, thereby extending the utility of the present invention.","With this realisation, the inventor realised that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti-PCSK9 ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and\/or prophylaxis of PCSK9-mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way, the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs\u2014as determined by the patient's genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand-in-hand with this, the invention provides for the genotyping and\/or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment, thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy, reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient (eg, poor efficacy and\/or side-effects) and avoids pharmaceutical mis-prescription and waste.","In developing this thinking, in this non-limiting example the present inventor decided to determine a set of human PCSK9 variants on the basis of the following criteria, these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population. The inventor selected variants having at least 3 of the 4 following criteria:\u2014\n\n","On the basis of these criteria, the inventor identified the variants listed in Table 1 below (excluding form a).","The inventor's selection included, as a consideration, selection for nucleotide variation that produced amino acid variation in corresponding PCSK9 forms (ie, non-synonymous variations), as opposed to silent variations that do not alter amino acid residues in the target protein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0700","num":"0894"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","orient":"land"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"602pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

An example is provided below for ligands comprising antibody VH domains derived from recombination of human VH3-23.","The inventor analysed the frequencies and distribution of various human VH3-23 alleles and realised the desirability of using ligands based on human VH3-23 alleles comprising SNP rs56069819. This SNP corresponds to a change from leucine at position 24 in the encoded protein sequence to a valine at that position (L24V change) and the SNP is at coordinate 106268889 on human chromosome 14.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0716","num":"0912"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Notably, human VH3-23 alleles comprising SNP rs56069819 were found in the CEU population at a frequency that is almost double the frequency of 11% for all populations. For the ASW and YRI populations the frequency was over a quarter of the population. Thus, the invention advantageously enables one to select a ligand comprising an antibody or antibody fragment, wherein the antibody or fragment comprises a VH domain derived from the recombination of a human VH gene segment, a human D gene segment and a human JH gene segment, the VH gene segment comprising a nucleotide sequence that comprises SNP rs56069819 (dbSNP numbering, build number as recited above).","In an example, one can tailor the treatment further by selecting such a ligand that specifically binds to a human PCSK9 selected from forms: f c, m, e, h, p, q and aj, such forms being those appearing in human populations ASW, LWK, YRI, CEU and GBR.","In an example, the VH gene segment is VH3-23*04, which is a commonly found variant that comprises SNP rs56069819 in human populations ASW, LWK, YRI, CEU and GBR.","In an example, the ligand is for treating and\/or preventing a PCSK9-mediated disease or condition in a human that expresses a human PCSK9 selected from forms: f c, m, e, h, p, q and aj.","In an example, the ligand is for treating and\/or preventing a PCSK9-mediated disease or condition in a human of ASW, LWK, YRI, CEU or GBR ancestry.","In an embodiment, the ligand is for treating and\/or preventing a PCSK9-mediated disease or condition in a human of ASW ancestry, wherein the human expresses a PCSK9 selected from f, c, m, e, h, p and q or the human comprises a corresponding nucleotide or amino acid sequence as set out in Table 5. Optionally this ligand comprises a VH domain derived from recombination of human VH3-23*04.","In an embodiment, the ligand is for treating and\/or preventing a PCSK9-mediated disease or condition in a human of LWK ancestry, wherein the human expresses a PCSK9 selected from f, c, m, e and h or the human comprises a corresponding nucleotide or amino acid sequence as set out in Table 5. Optionally this ligand comprises a VH domain derived from recombination of human VH3-23*04.","In an embodiment, the ligand is for treating and\/or preventing a PCSK9-mediated disease or condition in a human of YRI ancestry, wherein the human expresses a PCSK9 selected from f, c, m, e and h or the human comprises a corresponding nucleotide or amino acid sequence as set out in Table 5. Optionally this ligand comprises a VH domain derived from recombination of human VH3-23*04.","In an embodiment, the ligand is for treating and\/or preventing a PCSK9-mediated disease or condition in a human of CEU ancestry, wherein the human expresses a PCSK9 selected from f, c, p and aj or the human comprises a corresponding nucleotide or amino acid sequence as set out in Table 5. Optionally this ligand comprises a VH domain derived from recombination of human VH3-23*04.","In an embodiment, the ligand is for treating and\/or preventing a PCSK9-mediated disease or condition in a human of GBR ancestry, wherein the human expresses a PCSK9 selected fromf c andp or the human comprises a corresponding nucleotide or amino acid sequence as set out in Table 5.
