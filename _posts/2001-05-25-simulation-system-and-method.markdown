{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. HQ0006-01-C-0001 awarded by the Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates generally to computer-implemented simulation systems and methods, and more particularly, concerns an XML-based simulation system and method.","Simulation is a process that attempts to predict aspects of the behavior of some system by creating an approximate, typically mathematical, model of the system. Computers provide an ideal environment for building simulations. Generic simulators have many uses. For example, businesses use simulations to develop optimized processes such as staffing decisions or inventory management. Simulations also lower the risks associated with critical decisions by enabling analysis of influences to a system output. Engineers also use simulations to prototype and test designs.","Simulations, however, require an investment in tools, time, and people. Simulation tools can include spreadsheets, programming languages, and full-featured commercial simulation packages. Each of the currently available simulation tools has associated tradeoffs. Spreadsheets, for example, offer low purchase cost, but limited built-in functionality. Similarly, traditional programming languages provide maximum flexibility, but can require more time and skill to maintain and operate. Both spreadsheets and programming languages can require extensive programming, and spreadsheets can be too slow for complex situation modeling where thousands of items are required to be simulated. General-purpose commercial simulation tools provide sophisticated built-in capabilities combined with graphical development environments, which may save time, but can be very expensive. The initial price of general-purpose commercial simulation tools and\/or licenses for such tools can run into the tens of thousands of dollars per year. Such commercial tools exist for specific applications such as supply chain management, resource management, manufacturing, and science.","All of these simulation tools have additional drawbacks. For instance, tool vendors can go out of business or be purchased by larger firms who significantly modify or discontinue a product line. The simulation tools may also not scale to handle highly sophisticated business processes. As well, the programming languages underlying the tools can be obscure such that the learning curve becomes high, and only a few people within a given organization become skilled in their use. Another drawback to currently available simulation tools is that there are no widely adopted standards for interchanging simulations developed in different tools, making it difficult to reuse simulation models. Conventional simulation tools that support parallel processing or distribution are often not general-purpose, are very expensive, or require extremely advance programming in order to realize their potential. Additionally, without simulation support software, simulations developed in programming languages can lead to awkward programming. Even with a simulation engine, however, programming language solutions usually do not provide a natural way of describing hundreds or thousands of inter-connected objects of various types. Using traditional database management systems to store objects typically leads to simulations that run too slowly for practical use.","Simulations themselves also pose computing challenges. For example, simulations typically need to represent large numbers of inter-related objects in relationship to each other, and need to manipulate these objects at high speeds. Thus, unlike a traditional business program, a simulation may require a large amount of computing speed and memory. Due to the iterative process of simulation, modelers and other users need a way to easily repeat a simulation run with varying random number seeds and must be able to combine the results. Likewise, modelers need the ability to repeat simulation runs while systematically varying one or more parameters. Users of simulations also desire the ability to watch, freeze, reverse, and snapshot a simulation.","Thus, there exists a need for a low cost, easy to program, platform-independent, reusable, standards-based, and graphics-based simulation system and method.","Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an improved simulation system and method.","According to the present invention, the foregoing and other objects and advantages are obtained by a simulation system and method, which is enabled through the use of an XML-based Simulation Reference Markup Language (SRML) and a corresponding system runtime environment.","The present invention provides a simulation system comprising a simulation reference simulator adapted to receive an SRML simulation model including a simulation item. The simulation reference simulator comprises an item manager for loading properties of each item of the simulation model, and an event manager for processing the simulation model.","The present invention also discloses a method of conducting simulations comprising the steps of defining a simulation model with Simulation Reference Markup Language, communicating the model to a simulation reference simulator, executing the model with the simulation reference simulator, and providing an output of the modeled events.","An advantage of the present invention is that it provides a low cost, easy to program simulation scheme. Another advantage is that the present simulation scheme is platform-independent, reusable, and standards-based.","Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description and appended claims, and upon reference to the accompanying drawings.","The simulation system and method described herein is enabled through the provision of an XML-based development program referred to as the Simulation Reference Markup Language (SRML) and its corresponding runtime environment including a Simulation Reference (SR) Simulator.","Referring to , there is shown a schematic diagram of a general simulation process . In general, simulation follows a three-step process that follows the sequence of developing a desired model , running the simulation , and evaluating the simulation outcome . Each step in the process can involve several different types of personnel who can be classified as modelers, domain experts, and recipients\/decision makers. Modelers and domain experts build models using a tool known as a simulation development environment. The tool generates and stores a representation of the model that is fed into a simulation engine. The simulation engine manages objects, events, mathematical and statistical calculations, and random number generation to actually run the simulation. The simulation engine also typically provides feedback to a user about the simulation progress, as running a simulation may take more than a few seconds. Once the simulation is completed, modelers, domain experts and decision makers can evaluate the results, and often will use the results in the construction of a new model. In this regard, the general simulation process usually follows an ongoing iterative methodology.","The drawbacks associated with spreadsheets, programming languages, and commercially available simulation packages outlined above, are overcome through the provision of the SRML described herein. SRML is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) application that provides a way of describing a simulation. The SR Simulator described herein is a tool that reads the XML input that conforms to the SRML schema, builds script-based items corresponding to each of the elements, and executes events scheduled by those items. The SRML modeling tool is therefore a programming method that allows a modeler to create and edit SRML simulations.","The SRML and SR Simulator are based upon XML because XML technologies are well-suited to both represent and execute simulations. XML has enough expressiveness to describe data objects at various levels of complexity. Through the use of schemas, XML also provides structural document validation and data typing. XML can also be easily transported in a human readable form and can easily describe hierarchical structures and linked networks. Once loaded, XML data can also be queried in a fashion similar to a database. XML editors and tools that read and write XML are also inexpensive or free.","XML is a metalanguage\u2014it is a language for describing other languages. It is designed to enable the use of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) defined in ISO Standard 8879:1986 that is designed to make ift easy to define descriptions of the structure and content of different types of electronic documents over the Internet. SGML and XML are markup specification languages with which a user can design ways of describing information, usually for storage, transmission, or processing by a program. XML is based on the concept of documents composed of a series of objects (entities). Each object can contain one or more logical elements. Each of these elements can have certain attributes (properties) that describe the way in which the element is to be processed. XML provides a formal syntax for describing the relationship between the objects, elements and attributes that makeup an XML document which an be used to tell a computer how it can recognize the component parts of each document. To allow a computer to validate the structure of a document, a user must provide the computer with a Document Typed Definition (DTD), or an XML Schema Definition (XSD) schema, or an XML Data Reduced schema that declares each of the permitted objects, elements and attributes and the relationships between them.","XML's declaration syntax requires that elements and their attributes be entered between matched pairs of angle brackets (< . . . >), while object references start with an ampersand and end with a semi-colon (& . . . ;). Similarly, the start and end of each logical element of a file must be clearly identified by a start tag (e.g. < to >) and an end tag (e.g. <\/ to >). Text or additional markup can exist between the start tag and the end tag for a given element. Thus, elements can have both attributes (described by name-value pairs), and can contain embedded elements.","XML is not a programming language, so XML files do not \u201crun\u201d or \u201cexecute.\u201d Rather XML is a markup specification language and XML files are data: a program must be run which displays the files (like a browser) or does some work with them (like a converter which writes the data in another format, or a database which reads the data), or even creates them (like an editor).","These XML constructs form a structure for describing any kind of hierarchically related discrete data. An XML schema permits a modeler to specify rules about element relationships and attributes that can be validated with software. The XML Document Object Model (DOM) is an Application Programming Interface (API) that enables programming languages and scripts to load, validate, navigate, modify, and save XML structures with code. DOM software implements elements and attributes with linked node objects.","The SRML described herein enables a modeler to describe information in a class of documents specifically designed for simulations. SRML organizes XML in a way that makes it practical to represent large numbers of interconnected numbers both hierarchically and networked, as well as individual item behavior by way of scripts. SRML also permits item classes, polymorphism, and multiple-inheritance. SRML also enables synchronous, asynchronous, and scheduled communications as well as random events.","Referring now to  there is shown a schematic diagram of a simulation runtime environment including an item within a simulation according to an embodiment of the present invention. The things described when modeling in SRML are referred to as \u201citems.\u201d An item  can represent a physical thing, such as a piece of equipment, or a person or an entire system of other items. An item may also represent a process or a step in a process. Items can have properties . For example, a piece of equipment may have a \u201cserial number\u201d property, or a process may have a \u201cduration\u201d property. SRML provides a way to express items, their properties and complex item relationships, using the grammar of XML with a small set of predefined elements and attributes that have specific meanings and rules. An example of a general structure of a simulation in SRML appears as

and properties in SRML correspond to elements and attributes in XML. Thus, items are derived from the elements, and properties are derived from the attributes. With the exception of a few predefined element names such as ItemClass, SRML uses the elements and attribute names defined by the modeler. This makes it possible to create a domain-specific XML schema to validate a system's structure and to provide data types for the attributes. A domain-specific schema works in conjunction with the SRML schema when using XML namespaces.","Referring again to , internally each item  has a unique system-generated ItemID  and an associated Script. Each item  has an association with a DOM node  from the element. The item  can both serve as a location , and belong at a location along with other items. An item can also have links  to other items and be a target for a link. Also, an item can belong to an item class, which in turn, can belong to a superclass . The item  gets its properties  directly from DOM attributes , and its behavior from a script.

In this example, the item's behavior also comes by way of functions, which are identified as \u201cturnOn\u201d and \u201cturnOff.\u201d Because the foregoing script defines AirForce1 as having a global identifier, anywhere in the script, a modeler could use a code such as the following:\n\n","Each item has a certain number of intrinsic properties. For example, every item has a \u201clocation\u201d property that refers to its current location. In most instances, an item's location refers to another item, however an item's location can be \u201cnothing\u201d or \u201cundefined\u201d which means that it either does not exist in the model or is at the top of the location tree.

The first linking mechanism allows a modeler to use the \u201cLink\u201d element to provide the name and an XPath expression to identify the target. The second mechanism allows a modeler to use the \u201cLinks\u201d element to provide a name and supply interlinks. When a schema is used and attributes of the type IDREF or IDREFS are provided, SRML treats them in the same way it treats links.","Items have other built-in properties beside the Location and Items properties. When the SR Simulator creates an item as described below, it automatically assigns a unique numeric value to the item's \u201cItemID\u201d property. This property can then be used to uniquely identify the item in the presence or absence of an explicit ID attribute. Items also have a language neutral \u201cSelf\u201d property that refers to a particular item instance in which a script is running. Also, an item's \u201cEvents\u201d collection contains references to all the events scheduled or posted for that item. This characteristic makes it easy at runtime to find and possible alter previously scheduled events. In addition, as a simulation runs, the scripts operate directly on the underlying DOM nodes as they alter item properties and locations. Therefore, each item has a \u201cNode\u201d property that returns its corresponding Node. Moreover, each item also contains a reference to its item class by way of its \u201cItemClass\u201d property. Shared properties and behaviors can be added to a specific item class in the same way they are added to regular items.","SRML also allows items to be moved. The static structure of a model represents inner-connected items at a particular point in time. As a simulation progresses, however, an item may need to be moved to a different location. This is done by simply assigning the Location property to a different item. For example, with JavaScript, the following code moves Vehicle to Alaska.\n\n","Items can also have fixed location properties. Some items, such as geographical locations, for example, may have their locations fixed for an entire simulation. When an item has a unique name within its containing locations, such as California within the United States, SRML makes it directly accessible by specifying a LocationFixed=\u2018True\u2019 attribute.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0050"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Sites.xml:"},{"entry":"<Location ID=\u2018World\u2019 LocationFixed=\u2018True\u2019>"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<Location Name=\u2018USA\u2019 LocationFixed=\u2018True\u2019>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<Location Name=\u2018California\u2019 LocationFixed=\u2018True\u2019>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<Location Name=\u2018Anaheim\u2019 LocationFixed=\u2018True\u2019>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<Vehicle Name=\u2018Truck\u2019 Quantity=\u2018100\u2019 \/>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<\/Location>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<\/Location>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<\/Location>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<\/Location>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Thus, somewhere in a script, the first Truck in Anaheim within the World may be addressed by the following syntax:\n\n","SRML also allows a user to find items that meet certain criteria. This is accomplished by providing an XPath expression to the FindItems function, which will return a collection of items that were found.","SRML also provides for event scheduling. Typically, items modeled correspond to physical things such as people, the weather, the ocean, mechanical devices, or electronic circuits. Items such as these can both send and receive stimulus to and from other items. The SRML runtime environment provides four procedures for sending synchronous, asynchronous, and scheduled events among objects. These procedures are: SendEvent, PostEvent, ScheduleEvent, and BroadcastEvent. Each of these procedures requires a target object, an event string, and any number of parameters. SendEvent sends the specified event immediately to the target object. PostEvent sends the event asynchronously to the target. ScheduleEvent takes the date-time parameter and sends the event at the specified time. BroadcastEvent sends the specified event to the specified number of target objects.","In a typical discrete-event simulation, many items will generate events autonomously. Since these items are linked to other items, communication proceeds naturally. SRML also allows for the simulation to generate metrics such as a count of an event of a certain type over a period of time, or a trace of those same events for example. SRML also allows the course of the simulation to change as the result of an event. This is accomplished by placing a Script element directly inside the Simulation object to create a \u2018mainscript\u2019 that can intercept every event in the simulation immediately after it occurs. Of course, the mainscript is optional; however, providing it allows a modeler to describe a completely self-contained simulation within the SRML. In the following example, the mainscript receives the \u201cfailed\u201d and \u201crepaired\u201d events of the Motor item, after the Motor has received these

operation, the SRML is executed in a runtime environment. Referring now to , there is shown a schematic diagram of an environment in which the SR Simulator according to the present invention may operate. The SR Simulator  is a collection of software objects that can read SRML input from the simulation model , and, in turn, build and manage the corresponding simulation items, connect those items together and provide an event-driven mechanism for items to communicate. The SR Simulator  also provides simulation support in the form of a random number generator, simulation primitives such as time averages and data structures, math functions, statistical functions, and the ability to generate outputs  as defined by the stimulation model .","Simulations can run in many environments. For example, a simulation may run as part of a web page, as part of a spreadsheet, or embedded in a custom application. The SR Simulator  is a single software component that can support all of these environments for SRML. Thus, a modeler can choose any host environment  that is capable of creating a simulation object and using the host interface. Possible hosts include web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office applications, Microsoft Visual Basic, and Java.","The host environment  preferably resides on a general purpose computer. The computer, thus, includes a processor; standard memory devices such as random access memory (RAM); an output device such as a CRT display and\/or printer; an input device such as a keyboard and\/or mouse; a network interface such as a standard Ethernet adapter; and a storage device such as a hard disk drive, CD-ROM, DVD, flash memory or other mass storage device. In such a case, the host environment, therefore, comprises the general-purpose computer specifically configured with any of the foregoing host programs.","Using the host environment, a modeler creates the desired simulation model  according to the SRML declaration syntax. Thus, the modeler defines the overall system structure using the Item and ItemClass definitions, and assigns behavior and attribute properties, if desirable, to each defined Item. In this way, the entire process flow is defined in the SRML format which is platform-independent and standards-based.","The SR Simulator  provides a class of Simulation objects. Each Simulation object encapsulates a simulation instance or run, and is primarily responsible for providing the runtime environment. The SR Simulator may be embodied in the same general-purpose computer as the host environment, or reside on a separate computer or network terminal. Similarly, the Simulation Model  and output  can also be embodied in the same computer or network terminal as the host environment  and SR Simulator . In addition, since a Simulation is an object that embodies a particular execution of a simulation, many simultaneous simulations can exist on the same computer, or be distributed across a network as a client or server.","Referring now to , there is shown a schematic diagram of the architecture of a SR Simulator  and its associated environment. The SR Simulator includes a simulation server  and a simulation engine. A simulation server is a network-aware host application that takes requests from remote computers to load and execute simulations designated for the computer in which it resides. The simulation engine  receives the simulation model from the host  and manages the items  and events , and also provides functions for random number generation , simulation primitives , and mathematical and statistical functions  to carry out the simulation. Simulation primitives are a collection of standard simulation objects and methods to aid a modeler in building a simulation. These include objects such as queues, stacks and time averages, and in-memory databases. The math and statistics processor  can be a dedicated logic unit within the SR simulator  to provide these functions or software implemented functions executed by the simulation engine .","Referring now to , the simulation loading process begins when a calling procedure invokes the Load (Step ) method of a Simulation object and passes the location of the XML. At that point, the item manager  calls upon an XML parser to build a validated DOM tree  from the specified input (Step ). If successful, the simulation then traverses the DOM tree and creates items  and schedules events  (Steps , ) from the nodes, attributes, links and scripts contained therein. The nodes, attributes, links and scripts are supplied from the Model , SRML Schema , and application-specific schema . Code within an item's script that appears outside a function or procedure gets executed as the item is created as either a remote service  or extension . These are typically called by the simulation primitives (Step ). Given that some items are loaded before others, this outer code has limited access to other items and follows specific rules of loading. In particular, an item can only access its Location property, its ItemClass property, any related SuperClasses, and the Simulation object. The item under consideration cannot access any sub-items, links, and any global items until after the load is complete. If an item requires further initialization, a modeler can broadcast a downward event from the root that invokes a specified initialization method.","When the Load has completed, the simulation is ready to begin processing events, and a Simulation object is configured according to an object model as illustrated in . The scripts within every item in the simulation have access to the objects in this model. The simulation object model  includes a collection of all of the items  that link to their corresponding nodes . The simulation object model also includes a link to the XML DOM document , which allows the items to manipulate the DOM directly. The Simulation object's Object property  provides a virtual interface to the entire simulation runtime environment, and is useful to a host. A host can set an external Extension Object , and the Simulation object will map all of the Extension's properties and methods into the runtime environment as if they were intrinsic to the simulation.","Once the simulation has been loaded, the Simulation object can execute the model as individual steps or as a single run (Step ). The execution of the simulation is governed by the event manager . To execute the model as individual steps, the commands DoNextEvent and ForwardLastEvent are initiated. The Run method is initiated to execute the model as a single run. In all cases, the Simulation object makes every event available to the host by either generating an EventOccurred event or by invoking the method in the host. The following example code shows an example run of a SR Simulator and Simulation from Microsoft Visual Basic for the example code Motor.XML described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0071"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Private WithEvents Sim As Simulation"},{"entry":"Private Sub Simulate( )"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Set Sim = CreateObject (\u201cSR_Simulator.Simulation\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"Sim.RandomizeSeed"]},{"entry":[{},"Sim.Load App.Path & \u201cMotor4.xml\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"Sim.CurrentTime = Now"]},{"entry":[{},"Sim.EndTime = DateAdd(\u201cyyyy\u201d, 1, Simulation.CurrentTime)"]},{"entry":[{},"Sim.Run Me, True"]},{"entry":[{},"Debug.Print \u201cFailures \u201d & Simulation.Object.nFailures"]},{"entry":[{},"Debug.Print \u201cRepairs \u201d & Simulation.Object.nRepairs"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"End Sub"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Having described the behavior of SRML, Table 1 provides a list of the XML key words associated with SRML:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0073"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"XML keywords:"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Element","Type","Applies","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Item","Element","Globally","Defines an item.
