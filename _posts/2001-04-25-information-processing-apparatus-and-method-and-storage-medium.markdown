{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for information processing and a storage medium for storing such a method. More particularly, the invention relates to an apparatus and a method for information processing and a storage medium for accommodating that method, whereby advertisement information is presented in an efficient and effective manner to avatars that are active in a shared virtual space.","There have existed personal computer network services such as NIFTY-Serve (trademark) of Japan and CompuServe (trademark) of the United State. Each of these entities allows a plurality of users to connect their personal computers through modems and over a public switched telephone network to a centrally located host computer in accordance with a predetermined communication protocol. A cyberspace service called Habitat (trademark) has been known in this field.","The development of Habitat was started in 1985 by LucasFilm Ltd. of the United States. When completed, Habitat was run by QuantumLink, a U.S. commercial network, for about three years before Fujitsu Habitat (trademark) began to be offered in Japan by NIFTY-Serve in February 1990. Habitat embraces a virtual city called \u201cPopulopolis\u201d which, drawn in two-dimensional graphics, is inhabited by users' alter egos called avatars (incarnations of Hindu deities). Through their avatars, the users carry on between them what is known as a chat (a real-time text-based dialogue in which characters are input and read by users). More detailed information about Habitat is found in \u201cCyberspace: First Steps\u201d (ed. by Michael Benedikt, 1991, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., ISBN0-262-02327-X, pp. 282-307).","In a conventional cyberspace system run by the above-mentioned type of personal computer network service, virtual streets as well as house interiors were described in two-dimensional graphics. For apparent movement toward the depth of a scene or back to its front side, avatars were simply moved upward or downward against a two-dimensional background. There was precious little power of expression to make users enjoy a virtual experience of walking or moving about in the virtual space. Furthermore, a given user's avatar was viewed along with other users' avatars simply from a third party's point of view in the virtual space. This was another factor detracting from the effort to let users have more impressive virtual sensory experiences.","In order to improve on such more or less unimpressive proxy experiences, there have been proposed functions which display a virtual space in three-dimensional graphics and which allow users freely to move about in the virtual space from their avatars' points of view. Such functions, disclosed illustratively in U.S. Pat. No. 5,956,038, are implemented by use of 3D graphic data in description language called VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language). A description of various cyberspace environments in which users may carry on chats using avatars is found in the Sep. 9, 1996 issue of Nikkei Electronics (a Japanese periodical; No. 670, pp. 151-159).","Where it is desired to present advertisement information to avatars that are active in the above-mentioned shared virtual space, it has been customary to set up billboards at predetermined locations within the space, the billboards carrying the advertisements.","One disadvantage of such a conventional setup is that some billboards may turn out to be located in places where few avatars congregate. In that case, the advertisements obviously are not effective.","Another disadvantage is that users, represented by their avatars, have difficulty taking in the advertisements unless they come close to the billboards.","Furthermore, even if the billboards are erected where avatars concentrate, most of the avatars may already have seen the displayed advertisements. In that case, it becomes difficult to present the advertisement information to newly-arriving avatars that have not seen it yet.","In addition, because the advertisements remain the same in content when presented to all avatars, it is difficult to present new advertisement information efficiently to each avatar.","The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and provides an apparatus and a method for presenting advertisement information to avatars in an efficient and effective manner.","In carrying out the invention and according to a first aspect thereof, there is provided an information processing apparatus for controlling an application object moving autonomously in a shared virtual space in which avatars representing users of other information processing apparatuses are active, the information processing apparatus comprising a distribution examining element for examining distribution of the active avatars in the shared virtual space, a coordinate controlling element for controlling coordinates of the application object in accordance with results of the examination by the distribution examining element and a display controlling element for controlling display of information by the application object controlled in coordinates by the coordinate controlling element.","In one preferred structure of the information processing apparatus according to the first aspect of the invention, the display controlling element may cause the application object to display advertisements.","According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an information processing method for use with an information processing apparatus for controlling an application object moving autonomously in a shared virtual space in which avatars representing users of other information processing apparatuses are active, the information processing method comprising the steps of examining distribution of the active avatars in the shared virtual space, controlling coordinates of the application object in accordance with results of the examination in the distribution examining step and controlling display of information by the application object controlled in coordinates in the coordinate controlling step.","According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a program storage medium which stores a computer-readable program for use by an information processing apparatus for controlling an application object moving autonomously in a shared virtual space in which avatars representing users of other information processing apparatuses are active, the program comprising the steps of examining distribution of the active avatars in the shared virtual space, controlling coordinates of the application object in accordance with results of the examination in the distribution examining step and controlling display of information by the application object controlled in coordinates in the coordinate controlling step.","The information processing apparatus according to the first aspect of the invention, the information processing method according to the second aspect of the invention, and the program storage medium according to the third aspect of the invention can permit controlling in coordinates of the application object that displays information in accordance with the distribution of the avatars involved. This makes it possible to present desired information to the users represented by the avatars in an efficient and effective manner.","According a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided an information processing apparatus for controlling an application object moving autonomously in a shared virtual space in which avatars representing users of other information processing apparatuses are active, the information processing apparatus comprising an attribute examining element for examining attributes of the active avatars in the shared virtual space and a display controlling element for controlling display of information by the application object in accordance with results of the examination by the attribute examining element.","One preferred structure of the information processing apparatus according to the fourth aspect of the invention may further comprise a coordinate controlling element for controlling coordinates of the application object in accordance with results of the examination by the attribute examining element.","In another preferred structure of the information processing apparatus according to the fourth aspect of the invention, the display controlling element may cause the application object to display advertisements.","According to a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided an information processing method for use with an information processing apparatus for controlling an application object moving autonomously in a shared virtual space in which avatars representing users of other information processing apparatuses are active, the information processing method comprising the steps of examining attributes of the active avatars in the shared virtual space and controlling display of information by the application object in accordance with results of the examination in the attribute examining step.","According to a sixth aspect of the invention, there is provided a program storage medium which stores a computer-readable program for use by an information processing apparatus for controlling an application object moving autonomously in a shared virtual space in which avatars representing users of other information processing apparatuses are active, the program comprising the steps of examining attributes of the active avatars in the shared virtual space and controlling display of information by the application object in accordance with results of the examination in the attribute examining step.","The information processing apparatus according to the fourth aspect of the invention, the information processing method according to the fifth aspect of the invention and the program storage medium according to the sixth aspect of the invention can permit controlling of the information displayed by the application object in accordance with the attributes of the avatars. This enables ever-new information to be presented to the users symbolized by the avatars in an efficient and effective manner.","According to a seventh aspect of the invention, there is provided an information processing apparatus for controlling an application object moving autonomously in a shared virtual space in which avatars representing users of other information processing apparatuses are active, the information processing apparatus comprising an examining element for examining at least either distribution or attributes of the active avatars in the shared virtual space, a coordinate controlling element for controlling coordinates of the application object in accordance with results of the examination by the examining element, a display controlling element for controlling display of information by the application object, a counting element for counting the number of avatars positioned within a predetermined range around the application object and a charging element for processing charges for the information controlled in terms of display by the display controlling element in accordance with results of the counting by the counting element.","In one preferred structure of the information processing apparatus according to the seventh aspect of the invention, the counting element may weight the number of the avatars in keeping with the attributes thereof.","According to an eighth aspect of the invention, there is provided an information processing method for use with an information processing apparatus for controlling an application object moving autonomously in a shared virtual space in which avatars representing users of other information processing apparatuses are active, the information processing method comprising the steps of examining at least either distribution or attributes of the active avatars in the shared virtual space, controlling coordinates of the application object in accordance with results of the examination in the examining step, controlling display of information by the application object, counting the number of avatars positioned within a predetermined range around the application object and processing charges for the information controlled in terms of display in the display controlling step in accordance with results of the counting in the counting step.","According to a ninth aspect of the invention, there is provided a program storage medium which stores a computer-readable program for use by an information processing apparatus for controlling an application object moving autonomously in a shared virtual space in which avatars representing users of other information processing apparatuses are active, the program comprising the steps of examining at least either distribution or attributes of the active avatars in the shared virtual space, controlling coordinates of the application object in accordance with results of the examination in the examining step, controlling display of information by the application object, counting the number of avatars positioned within a predetermined range around the application object and processing charges for the information controlled in terms of display in the display controlling step in accordance with results of the counting in the counting step.","The information processing apparatus according to the seventh aspect of the invention, the information processing method according to the eight aspect of the invention, and the program storage medium according to the ninth aspect of the invention can permit counting of the number of the avatars located within a predetermined range around the application object and, based on the results of the counting, process charges for the information displayed by the application object. This provides easy and reliable processing of the charges appropriate to the effects of the information presented to the users.","Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent upon a reading of the following description and appended drawings.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","For the moment, the description of the embodiments is preceded by an explanation hereunder of VRML (virtual reality modeling language), a description language capable of handling three-dimensional information in unified fashion through the use of a framework called WWW (World Wide Web) that offers diverse kinds of information over the Internet, a globally established computer network.","The WWW, an information offering system utilized on the Internet, was developed by CERN (European Center for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland. The system permits browsing over the network of information made up of text, images and sounds in what is known as hypertext format. Information held in WWW servers is transferred asynchronously to terminals such as personal computers in accordance with a protocol called HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).","The WWW server is constituted by server software called an HTTP demon and by HTML files that store hypertext information. The demon signifies programs that perform management and processing in the background in a UNIX work environment. Hypertext information is expressed in description language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). A hypertext description expresses a logical text structure enclosed by format codes \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d called tags. Description of links to other information is provided by link information called anchors. Locations of information are designated by anchors using URL (Uniform Resource Locator).","Files described in HTML are transferred over a TCP\/IP (Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol) network in accordance with the HTTP protocol. HTTP transfers requests from clients for information to WWW servers and sends hypertext information in HTML files back to the clients.","An environment in which to utilize the WWW is provided by client software called WWW browsers such as Netscape Navigator (trademark of Netscape Communications Corporation of the United States).","WWW browsers allow users to look up so-called websites, i.e., URL-compatible files in WWW servers located over the Internet expanded throughout the world. In what is known as net-surfing, users can hop from one website to another through links to access multitudes of WWW information sources.","Recently a new type of browsers called VRML browsers has been developed. A VRML browser permits users to access WWW servers one after another through links established in hypertext regarding objects drawn in an extended WWW format, i.e., three-dimensional graphics in a 3D space described in 3D graphics description language called VRML.","Details of VRML are described illustratively in \u201cVRML: Browsing & Building Cyberspace\u201d (by Mark Pesce; 1995, New Readers Publishing, ISBN 1-56205-498-8) and in \u201cLatest Trends of VRML and CyberPassage\u201d (articles by Koichi Matsuda and Yasuaki Honda in a Japanese periodical \u201cbit\u201d published by Kyoritsu Shuppan Co., Ltd., 1996; Vol. 28, No. 7, pp. 29-36; No. 8, pp. 57-65; No, 9, pp. 29-36; No. 10, pp. 49-58).","When a file described in VRML-compatible file format is transferred from a server to a user's personal computer and processed by browser, a three-dimensional virtual space is computed on the basis of VRML data. The 3D virtual space thus computed is allowed to appear on a display of the user's personal computer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In , reference numerals ,  and  denote client PCs (personal computers) in which a VRML browser and a WWW browser are installed and active.

The linkup permits transmission of shared messages through the shared server  regarding locations and motions of shared 3D objects, as indicated by numeral () The transmission of the shared messages implements a multiuser environment, as pointed to by numeral ().","More detailed steps for implementing the connection above are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,956,038.","The AO server  that manages behaviors of virtual life objects in the shared virtual space exchange data about virtual life objects with the shared server  by use of VSAP. The HDD contains data about specific virtual life objects (i.e., sandwich men in this case).","With this embodiment, a sandwich man \u201cs\u201d shown in  moves about autonomously as a virtual life object in the virtual space (world). The sandwich man \u201cs\u201d carries plates Pand Pin front of his chest and on his back, the plates showing predetermined advertisement information. The autonomous action of the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d is controlled by the AO server .","How the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d is controlled in its behavior through processing by the AO server  will now be described by referring to the flowchart of FIG. .","In step S of , the CPU  of the AO server  examines attributes of avatars in the shared virtual space (world) and their distribution. More specifically, the CPU  of the AO server  acquires from the shared server  coordinates of each of the avatars in the virtual world and stores the obtained avatar coordinates on the hard disk drive .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":"131"},"The number of times each avatar has seen an advertisement is counted and stored (this is the number of times each avatar has met a sandwich man; more precisely, the number of times each avatar has entered an aura  (see ) of the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d) The example of  shows illustratively that the avatar \u201ca\u201d has seen an advertisement Aonce but has yet to see advertisements Aand A; the avatar \u201cb\u201d has seen the advertisement Aonce and the advertisement Atwice but has not seen the advertisement Ayet.","As described, the CPU  can examine the distribution of the avatars by referring to their coordinates stored on the hard disk drive .","Illustratively, as sketched in , examining the coordinates of the avatars in the virtual world  reveals that the avatars \u201ca\u201d through \u201cf\u201d are located in a region Rand the avatars \u201cg\u201d through \u201ci\u201d in a region R. A check on the attributes of the avatars in the regions Rand Rthus determines whether the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d has so far presented advertisements to each of these avatars.","In step S of , the CPU  detects regions with a high concentration of avatars that have yet to meet the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d (i.e., avatars yet to be presented with advertisements). In step S, the CPU  performs of a process of moving the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d to the regions where the avatars yet to be encountered congregate (specifically, movement data (coordinate data) representing the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d are output to each client PC via the shared server ).","Suppose that a sandwich man is to move simply toward a region with a higher concentration of avatars. In the situation of , the region Rhas six avatars located therein while three avatars congregate in the region R. In that case, as shown in , the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d moves toward the region Rthat has the higher avatar concentration than the region R.","However, as indicated in , the avatars \u201ca\u201d through \u201cf\u201d in the region Rhave already seen the advertisement A, whereas the avatars \u201cg\u201d and \u201ci\u201d among the three avatars \u201cg\u201d through \u201ci\u201d in the region Rhave yet to see the advertisement A. As a result, it is not the region Rbut the region Rwhere the avatars yet to be met by the sandwich man (i.e., avatars yet to be presented with the advertisement A) are more concentrated. In that case, the sandwich man may as well move toward the region Rfor better advertising effects.","The process of moving the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d is carried out by each client PC on the basis of the coordinate data supplied by the AO server .","In step S, the CPU  of the AO server  performs an advertisement display process. Details of this process are shown in the flowchart of FIG. .","In step S of , the CPU  selects one of the avatars located within an aura  of the sandwich man \u201cs.\u201d In the example of , the avatar \u201cg\u201d is selected illustratively from among the three avatars \u201cg\u201d through \u201ci\u201d in the region R.","In step S, the CPU  examines the attribute of the avatar selected in step S (avatar \u201cg\u201d in this case). As indicated in , the avatar \u201cg\u201d has never seen the advertisement A(i.e., has never met the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d carrying the advertisement A).","In step S, the CPU  causes the plates Pand Pof the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d to display an advertisement appropriate to the attribute examined in step S. In this example, the plates Pand Pindicate the advertisement Afor the avatar \u201cg\u201d to see. More specifically, data representing the advertisement Aare transferred from the AO server  to each client PC via the shared server . Given the data, the client PCs cause the plates Pand Pof the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d to display the advertisement A.","In step S, the CPU  updates the attribute of the avatar selected in step S. In this example, the attribute of the avatar \u201cg\u201d is modified to indicate that the avatar has seen the advertisement Aonce.","In step S, the CPU  checks to see if all avatars within the aura  have been selected. If there is any avatar yet to be selected, step S is reached again and subsequent steps are repeated.","Suppose now that the avatar \u201ch\u201d is selected in step S. In that case, the CPU  examines the attribute of the avatar \u201ch\u201d in step S. As indicated in , the avatar \u201ch\u201d has seen the advertisement Aonce but has never seen the advertisement A. Then the CPU , reaching step S, causes the plates Pand Pof the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d to display the advertisement A.","In step S, the CPU  updates the attribute of the avatar \u201ch\u201d to indicate that the avatar has seen the advertisement Aonce. In step S, the CPU  checks to see if all avatars within the aura  have been selected. If there is any avatar yet to be selected, step S is reached again and subsequent steps are repeated. If in step S the CPU  has ascertained that all avatars within the aura  have been selected, the process is brought to an end.","The process outlined above is further described below with reference to . Illustratively, as shown in , suppose that the avatars \u201cg\u201d and \u201ch\u201d in the virtual world  are located inside the aura  of the sandwich man \u201cs.\u201d In that case, the browser of the user G symbolized by the avatar \u201cg\u201d causes the plates Pand Pof the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d to display images of the advertisement Aas shown in FIG. .","On the other hand, as depicted in , the browser of the user H represented by the avatar \u201ch\u201d causes the plates Pand Pof the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d to display images of the advertisement A.","That is, the advertisement carried by the plates Pand Pof the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d varies from one avatar to another (i.e., from one user to another) That never happens in the real world but is made possible in the virtual space. The scheme enables each user to be presented with new advertisement information more efficiently than before.","When the advertisement display process in step S of  is completed as described above, step S is reached. In step S of , the CPU  of the AO server  checks to see if there is any region in the virtual world  to which the sandwich man has never been before. If there is any such region, step S is reached again and subsequent steps are repeated. If in step S no region is judged to exist to which the sandwich man has yet to go, the process is terminated.","Where there are a plurality of sandwich men, the processes described above are carried out individually with regard to each of them.","As described, each sandwich man \u201cs\u201d moves around in the virtual world  carrying advertisement information on the plates Pand P. By coming close to avatars, the sandwich man presents various kinds of advertisement information to the users they represent.","The provider of the virtual world  processes charges for the presentation of advertisements in that world. The charge processing is carried out by the charge server  as outlined in FIG. .","In step S of , the CPU  of the charge server  counts the number of avatars (N) met once by the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d and the number of avatars (N) met twice or more by the same sandwich man. In the example of , the number of avatars (N) to which the sandwich man \u201cs\u201d has presented the advertisement Aonce is six, while the number of avatars (N) to which the sandwich man has met twice or more carrying the same advertisement is one.","In step S, the CPU  of the charge server  calculates a weighted value NW using the following formula:\n\n\n\nwhere, Wand Ware coefficients by which to weight the avatar counts Nand Nrespectively. Illustratively, the coefficient Wmay be  and the coefficient Wmay be 1.
