No. 11\/998,978, filed Nov. 5, 2007, entitled \u201cUnderwater Surface Cleaning Vehicle For Integrated Cleaning and Effluent Treatment System\u201d, which is based on U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/856,472, filing date Nov. 3, 2006, hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy, and, thus the claimed invention may be manufactured, used, licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The following description relates generally to a method and apparatus for underwater hull cleaning, and in particular to an integrated underwater hull cleaning and effluent treatment process.","Navy ships are periodically cleaned using open cycle cleaning devices such as, for example, submerged cleaning and maintenance platform (SCAMP) technology that utilizes integrated impeller and cleaning brush technology and results in the direct discharge of removed constituents such as, for example, biological fouling, hull coatings, and corrosion byproducts into surrounding water. Most antifouling coatings utilize heavy metals such as Cu and Zn as biocides that are released during cleaning operations at levels that can exceed water quality criteria. This has prompted governments to develop standards to manage this discharge or, in some cases, to prohibit open water cleaning of hulls with coatings that have antifoulants in them without special permission.","Waterborne underwater hull cleaning is critical to the worldwide operation and maintenance of Navy ships and impacts operating capability (e.g., speed and maneuverability), acoustic signature, fuel efficiency and the maintainability and lifecycle of critical systems including underwater hull coatings, impress current cathodic protection systems, and propulsion systems.","Disclosed are systems and techniques for conducting integrated waterborne underwater hull cleaning using successive onboard vehicle processing and working fluid reuse with shore or pierside treatment of concentrated contaminants, including heavy metal toxicants in antifouling paint, with subsequent management and disposal of the wastestream by existing infrastructure.","In one aspect, the invention is an integrated hull cleaning and treatment system. The system includes a cleaning vehicle for removing fouling from an underwater hull surface of a docked watercraft and for drawing water entrained material away from the cleaning region. The system further includes a land treatment unit for treating liquid waste received from the cleaning vehicle and converting the liquid waste into dewatered solids and treated effluents. According to the invention, the land treatment unit has a gravity settling unit, a chemical treatment unit, a gravity thickening unit, and a land intake port for receiving the liquid waste from the cleaning vehicle. In this aspect, the invention includes a land intake hose having a first end and a second end, the first end attached to the cleaning vehicle and the second end attached to the land intake port of the treatment unit.","In another aspect, the invention is an environmentally friendly method of cleaning an underwater hull surface using an integrated hull cleaning and treatment system. According to this method, the system includes a cleaning vehicle, a land treatment unit, and a flexible intake hose attached at one end to the cleaning vehicle and at another end to the land treatment unit. In this aspect, the method includes, removing, with the cleaning vehicle, fouling material from an underwater hull surface of a docked watercraft, and drawing through the cleaning vehicle, a particulate flow of water entrained material removed from the cleaning region. The method further includes, conveying, via the flexible intake hose, liquid waste from the cleaning vehicle to the land treatment unit, and converting, in the land treatment unit, the liquid waste into dewatered solids and treated effluents.","In another aspect, the invention is a cleaning vehicle for cleaning an underwater surface, the cleaning vehicle having a cleaning deck. In this aspect, the cleaning deck includes a deck mouth, and one or more circulation pumps downstream of the deck mouth for initiating cleaning deck suction onto the underwater surface and for initiating a particulate flow of water entrained material removed by the cleaning deck. The invention also includes one or more abrasion devices for removing fouling from the underwater surface. The cleaning vehicle further includes a discharge port for discharging the particulate flow of water entrained material to a remotely located treatment unit.","Other objects, features, and advantages will be apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","An integrated waterborne underwater hull cleaning system incorporates successive onboard vehicle processing and working fluid reuse with integrated treatment of concentrated contaminants, including metal toxicants in antifouling paint, and subsequent management and disposal of the wastestream by existing infrastructure.","Disclosed is an integrated waterborne underwater hull cleaning and integrated effluent treatment process that mitigates the release of removed constituents to surrounding waters.  are exemplary flow diagrams of an integrated hull cleaning and effluent treatment system  for performing the above-recited functions.

The chemical treatment unit also includes a sand recirculation pump  and a hydrocyclone .","In the neutralization chamber , neutralizing chemicals such as sodium hydroxide are added to the liquid waste overflow to neutralize the waste. In the chemical co-precipitation chamber or coagulation chamber , coagulants such as ferric chloride are added and mixed in a preferable rapid mix zone to ensure good coagulant dispersion. In the injection chamber , ballasting sand and polymer are added to improve flocculation. Following the addition of sand and polymer in the injection chamber , the flow is passed to a slow mix zone, maturation chamber , to promote stable floc formation. The flocculated mixture is then passed to the clarifier chamber  for solid\/liquid separation. The clarified effluent is collected in the effluent tank . From the effluent tank , clarified effluent is pumped by effluent pump , via line or hose , to either a public owned treatment works or other asset for final processing and discharge. Recirculation pump  pumps solids settled at the bottom of the clarifier  to the hydrocyclone . In the hydrocyclone , the sludge is separated from the sand. The reclaimed sand is reintroduced into the sand and polymer injection chamber  while the captured sludge is diverted to the sludge thickening unit  for further processing.","In the sludge thickening unit , polymers are added to thicken the sludge, prior to slow stirring. Pump  then pumps the thickened sludge to hoppers  for dewatering. Although  shows the use of hoppers  to perform the dewatering process, other dewatering systems may be substituted or used in a complementary manner. For instance, a rotary press or other filtration system may be used.","The land treatment unit  is designed to operate in both manual and fully automated modes, operating in fill, start and shut-down (daily and final) sequences. In shutdown mode, the intake of liquid waste from the cleaning vehicle is terminated and substituted with relatively clean water, which may be surrounding water or hydrant\/fire main water, to conduct final clean processing and flushing of the system. The intake of liquid waste may be stopped by design or due to sub-system failure, such as the underwater hull cleaning vehicle. The surrounding water or hydrant water enters the pier treatment unit via water intake line . In the shut-down mode, various tanks or subsystem are systematically eliminated from use, cleaned and isolated. The process includes a combination of solids partitioning and separation within the system followed by isolating primary clarifier , sludge thickening system  and finally, the chemical treatment module  itself prior to directing final contents of chemical treatment module  to bag filters , via a drain tank and pump to the discharge riser location.
