{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a weapons system designed to defeat torpedoes and other underwater targets and more particularly to a gun-armed countermeasure device.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Presently, torpedo countermeasure systems can be grouped into two categories\u2014passive and hard kill. Passive countermeasure systems rely upon creating distractions to attacking torpedoes causing the torpedoes to fail to locate their target. Hard-kill systems, like the anti-torpedo torpedo, physically damage attacking torpedoes so they cannot reach their target.","Passive countermeasure systems are common on surface ships and submarines with a diameter of the systems being either three and a quarter inches or six and a quarter inches. Special launchers have been developed for these countermeasure systems and have been integrated into most naval platforms. As such, an inventive countermeasure system which can be launched from existing launchers is a more receptive concept than a countermeasure system which requires a varying sized launcher or a different launcher arrangement.","Underwater gun systems have been considered in the hard-kill countermeasure category as anti-mine and anti-torpedo devices. The system is generally composed of projectiles for use underwater, a gun, a ship-mounted turret, a targeting system, and a combat system. Undersea targets are identified and localized with the specialized targeting system. The combat system provides the control commands to direct the ship-mounted turret to point the gun towards the target. The underwater gun then shoots the projectiles which are specially designed for neutralization of undersea targets at a relatively long range (typically 200 meters).","An improvement on existing countermeasure systems would be an autonomous countermeasure device for defeating torpedoes and other underwater threats.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide an autonomous countermeasure device for defeating torpedoes and other underwater threats.","To obtain the object described, there is provided a countermeasure device and method of use, the countermeasure device generally comprising an autonomous module to which the module has means for enabling the module to hover at a desired water depth, means for detecting an underwater target, means for orienting itself in a firing position, and means for firing at least one projectile at the underwater target.","Other details of the gun-armed countermeasure device of the present invention, as well as other objects and advantages attendant thereto, are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Referring now to  of the drawings, the countermeasure device  of the present invention is deployed as a cylindrical module . The module  of the type shown is preferably equal in diameter and length to a six and a quarter inch countermeasure device; however, the module can have other dimensions based on anticipated operating conditions. The module  is autonomous in that the module is not tethered to a ship or other platform which the device  is protecting.","Referring to , the central portion of the device  includes a gun , which has a barrel  and a linear magazine . Folded to the sides of the device  are acoustic array panels  which can be deployed to form a large aperture array that detects the underwater target. In addition to the panels , small propulsors such as thrusters  and inflatable chambers  are folded along the sides of the device . The thrusters  and the inflatable chambers  are deployed to keep the device  from sinking and to maneuver the device into a firing position as will be discussed further.","The acoustic array panels  are used to detect and localize the undersea targets, such as torpedoes (not shown). During a launch or some maneuvers of the device , the array panels  are folded against the device. Acoustic array elements  are positioned along the span of each acoustic array panel . The array elements  can be any suitable elements known to those skilled in the art and operate actively or passively to detect and localize the undersea target. After launch or during other maneuvers of the device , the array panels  are mechanically deployed to a predetermined angle with respect to a countermeasuring axis.","In order to minimize the range to the undersea target and to point the gun  at the undersea target, a plurality of propulsors, such as thrusters , are provided to orient the device . The individual thrusters  are located along each side of the device . The thrusters  are initially stowed within the dimensional constraints of the launcher.","After launch, the thrusters  are folded out to provide positioning and maneuvering of the device .","While any suitable thruster known in the art may be utilized, it is preferred to use flapping foils to provide the thrust. Flapping foils are preferred over standard propeller thrusters since they can provide large thrusts and are easily stowed. Any suitable means known in the art may be used to flap the foils forming the thrusters  and to move the thrusters between the stowed position and the folded out position.","The components, described above, within the device  make the device much denser than water. Consequently, added buoyancy is required to prevent the device  from sinking or requiring excessive thrust to maintain its depth. Buoyancy is added to the device  by the inflatable chambers  distributed about the device to give the device a center of mass nearly coincident with the center of buoyancy. The distribution of the inflatable chambers  improves the maneuvering capability of the device  as well as allowing the device to be recovered, reloaded, and reused. The buoyancy by the inflatable chambers  further allows the device  to hover in an undersea environment at varying depths. Any suitable inflatable module known in the art may be used for the inflatable chambers .","The destructive mechanism of the device  is the gun . The gun  fires supercavitating underwater munitions capable of traveling significant underwater ranges (typically 200 meters), and capable of carrying destructive energy to their target, as either kinetic or explosive energy. Water may be initially cleared from the gun  with compressed air from a compressed air source . A burst of projectiles then follows with multiple bursts possible for firing from the device .","In operation, the device  is deployed from a countermeasure launcher (not shown) when an attack from a torpedo or some other threat is perceived. The device  immediately deploys its thrusters , inflatable chambers , and acoustic array panels  as discussed above. The device  then begins to scan for the threat.","When the threat is detected, the device  orients itself so that the gun  points toward the undersea target. When the undersea target is in range, compressed air from the compressed air source  clears the barrel  and then a projectile is fired. When the projectile is fired, the undersea target is reacquired and a subsequent projectile is fired. The range of the projectiles enables the device  to repeatedly engage an undersea target as the target approaches the vessel the device is defending. After all rounds of projectiles have been expended, the device  disarms itself and either ascends to the surface of the body of water for recovery or sinks to the bottom for security.","If the operational situation requires, the device  can operate as a mine by sitting on the bottom or hovering near the surface to target passing sea and air craft.","The countermeasure device  is a unique weapon system well suited for offensive strikes against marine targets, including torpedoes, mines, submarines, surface craft, etc. The device  has the unique features of being an autonomous and self-contained weapons system: having the ability to simultaneously maneuver and target its gun; being recoverable and reusable and having multiple alternative functions as a mine or a slow-moving weapon.","It should be noted that the gun  can be a \u201cGattling\u201d gun, a chain gun, or a single firing system. The gun  can be of any size ranging from a small caliber gun (0.22\u2033) to a cannon (6\u2033).","If the operational situation requires, the thrusters  can act as inflatable devices, serving a dual purpose of buoyancy and maneuvering control. Further, the buoyancy can be integrated into the acoustic array panels .","It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention a gun-armed countermeasure device which fully satisfies the objects, means and advantages set forth hereinbefore. While the present invention has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof, other alternatives, modifications, and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace those alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims."],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
