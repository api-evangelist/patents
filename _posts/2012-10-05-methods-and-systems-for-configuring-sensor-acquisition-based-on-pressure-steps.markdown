This application is incorporated hereby by reference in its entirety as if fully set forth herein.","The present invention may have been made, at least in part, with support from NASA award number NNX09AP51G. The Government may have certain rights in this invention.","Underwater vehicles (such as floats) may be used to measure physical and chemical properties of the ocean, detect underwater objects, and image seafloors or lakebeds. Various sensors such as pressure sensors, chemical sensors, temperature sensors, and sonars may be disposed on an underwater vessel. The underwater vessel may be tethered\/towed from a platform, such as a ship, anchored to the hull of the ship, or may be an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) or autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).","Systems, apparatuses, and methods are provided for underwater measurements. In some embodiments, a system is provided comprising an underwater vessel comprising a plurality of sensors disposed thereon for measuring underwater properties including pressure; and a programmable controller configured to select one or more of the plurality of sensors to activate and\/or sample based at least in part on an underwater pressure.","In embodiments, a method is provided for measuring underwater properties, comprising: measuring, by a pressure sensor, a current pressure; comparing, by one or more computers, the current pressure to pressure threshold limits for a plurality of respective pressure ranges, wherein each of the respective pressure ranges is associated with a respective set of one or more of the sensors, and activating and\/or sampling, by the one or more computers, a respective one of the sets of one or more of the sensors when the current pressure range is within the pressure range associated with the respective one set of sensors.","In embodiments, a method for measuring underwater properties is provided comprising: measuring, by a pressure sensor, a current pressure; comparing, by one or more computers, the current pressure to pressure threshold limits for a plurality of respective pressure ranges, wherein each of the respective pressure ranges is associated with a respective set of one or more of the sensors; comparing, by one or more computers, a current time and\/or date to a plurality of sets of data and\/or time ranges, wherein the respective sets of the one or more sensors are associated with respective time and\/or date ranges, and activating and\/or sampling, by one or more computers, a respective one of the sets of one or more of the sensors when the current pressure range is within the pressure range associated with the respective one set of sensors and a current time and\/or date is within the time and\/or date range associated with the respective one set of sensors.","It should be appreciated that all combinations of the foregoing concepts and additional concepts discussed in greater detail below (provided such concepts are not mutually inconsistent) are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein. In particular, all combinations of claimed subject matter appearing at the end of this disclosure are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein. It should also be appreciated that terminology explicitly employed herein that also may appear in any disclosure incorporated by reference should be accorded a meaning most consistent with the particular concepts disclosed herein.","The foregoing and other aspects, embodiments, and features of the present teachings may be more fully understood from the following description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to, and embodiments of, inventive methods and apparatus for underwater measurements and controls. It should be appreciated that various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the disclosed concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation. Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.","In various embodiments disclosed herein, measurements are made during \u201cprofiling\u201d of water, where a float is ascending or descending through the water. The profile may be a vertical profile over a column of water, and\/or have a significant or insignificant lateral span during the ascent or descent. In embodiments, a mechanism is implemented to control when different sensors are used\/activated throughout a profile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","100","230"]},"In embodiments, a top surface or remote modem  may communicate with the float . In embodiments, the float  may be powered and\/or towed by a surface vessel  or an underwater vessel . In embodiments, the float  may be fully autonomous and without tethering cables. In embodiments, the modem  may connect to float  via a cable , via a port , and underwater cable , or wirelessly, to name a few. In embodiments, the float  may be managed by a computer , which may be connected to the modem  by various available means such as cable , or wirelessly. In embodiments, a computer for managing the float  may be disposed in the float , itself. The computer in the float  may then communicate with the computer on the vessel  via the modem .","During ascent or descent, a profile of parameters of the water volume  may be measured by sensors onboard the float , and transmitted to the modem  and computer  for analysis. In embodiments, some or all of the analysis may be performed by a computer on-board the float . In embodiments, a pressure sensor disposed on the float  may be coupled to a processing circuit or control circuit configured to process measurement of the pressure of the water in the area around the vessel. In embodiments, the processing circuit may then be configured to select one or more sensors for activation, sensing, or reading based at least in part on the sensed pressure. As noted, the processing circuit may be disposed in the float  and\/or may be disposed in the vessel.","In embodiments, users require a variety of sensor packages on their underwater vessels such as floats, but do not need to use all of these sensors through an entire water volume. This leads to a scenario where data collected is then discarded. The energy used by the float  to collect and\/or to sample the data is wasted. In embodiments, conserving energy may be important for autonomous underwater floats that are designed to function independently for many days.","In embodiments, a control circuit may be used to measure and\/or sample the measurement of all or a selected set of sensors at predetermined pressure points or in predetermined pressure ranges. In embodiments, the control circuit may use \u201cPressure tables\u201d to determine when to measure and\/or sample. In embodiments, pressure tables may be programmed into the floats  by manufacturers. In embodiments, the pressure tables may not be changeable in the field. In embodiments, the pressure tables may be changeable in the field either remotely or by the operator.","In embodiments, the control circuit may comprise a comparison circuit for comparing current pressure from the pressure sensor to predetermined pressures in a pressure table. In embodiments, the control circuit may compare current pressure from the pressure sensor to upper and lower threshold limits that define one or more pressure ranges.","In embodiments, a profile may be stored in a memory in either the float  or the vessel , for example in the form of a table. In embodiments, the table may be divided into a plurality of pressure ranges defined by upper and lower thresholds. Within the given range, one or more of the sensors may be activated and\/or sampled and\/or used selectively or differently.","In embodiments, behavior of the float  may be controlled based at least in part on the particular pressure range. In embodiments, an ascent rate and\/or a descent rate may be controlled based at least in part on the particular pressure range. In embodiments, the control circuit (as set by the user or as pre-set) may be pre-programmed to cause different sensors to sample and\/or to activate at different points or ranges in the water volume . In embodiments, the control circuit (as set by the user or as pre-set) may be pre-programmed to cause different sensors to sample and\/or activate at different points or ranges in the water volume  with different resolutions (number of samples in the pressure range) in the data profiles. In embodiments, the program may be stored in a non-transitory computer-readable medium onboard the float , implemented as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gated array (FPGA). In embodiments, the program may be stored in a non-transitory computer-readable medium, implemented in the remote computer , as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gated array (FPGA).","Profile threshold levels (which may be editable by the user) may be used to describe how the various sensors and float behaviors are activated and\/or sampled while profiling, and are shown in the example Table 1 below. Each profile may be divided into a plurality of pressure ranges, within which sensors may be used differently.","For example, Table 1 divides the pressure into:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0028"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Pressure","Interval","Slow","Sensor","Sensor","Sensor","Sensor"]},{"entry":[{},"(dbar)","(dbar)","(Y\/N)","1","2","3","4"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","1000","10","N","ON","OFF","OFF","ON"]},{"entry":["2","700","25","Y","OFF","ON","ON","ON"]},{"entry":["3","300","5","N","ON","ON","OFF","ON"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"\u201cPressure\u201d in the Table indicates the pressure at which to start the sampling scheme. The \u201cinterval\u201d entries indicate when (within each pressure range) sensors are activated\/used. For example, an interval entry of 25, in row 2, indicates use of sensors at pressures of 700, 675, 650, 625, 600, 575, . . . , 300 dbar. The data profile resolution would be lower in this case as compared with pressure range 1, where an interval of 10 dbar is adopted, or pressure range 3, where an interval of 5 dbar is adopted.","\u201cSlow\u201d in the Table indicates whether the float should ascend slowly (e.g., at 0.04 dbar\/sec) or quickly (at 0.08 dbar\/sec) during the particular pressure range. In embodiments, specific speeds of ascent or descent may be set. This may be modified to allow for other accent or descent rates as well. By programming the speed of ascent and\/or descent parameter, the user may control the data sampling speed. Additional float behaviors may be added or substituted in place of the pressure parameter to control the ascent and\/or descent of the float  through the water volume. For example, the ascent and\/or the descent behavior may be based at least in part on salinity as measured by the salinity sensor, and\/or the temperature, and\/or the flow rate.","\u201cSensors 1-4\u201d with indicators \u201cON\u201d indicate at what pressure step the sensor is turned on. Pressure intervals may be as small or as large as needed, and pressure steps may be as close or as far apart as needed. In embodiments, for those pressure ranges (corresponding to depth ranges) in which the sensors are programmed to be \u201cOFF,\u201d the specified sensors may be turned \u201cOFF\u201d or in dormant states to save energy. In embodiments, the user may program as many parameters as desired.","In embodiments, a commercially available float (e.g., Teledyne Webb Research Apex float) or a non-commercially available float may be implemented with the inventive embodiments disclosed herein and used for, for example, bio-geo-chemical profiling measurements. A variety of commercially-available sensors may be used, such as a Satlantic\/WETLabs bio-optical sensor system, or sensors to be developed in the future may be used.","In embodiments, different sets of sensors, and\/or different sampling modes, may be used between different pressure ranges (corresponding to different depths) and at different times, such as different times during the day. In addition, float behavior (such as ascent rate or descent rate) may be controlled, depending on the pressure range. In embodiments, sensors may be grouped into sets, with properties such as data verbosity (e.g., amount of data in a text stream) levels. For example, where data transmission bandwidth is limited, a sensor with a high verbosity level may be combined with sensors with low verbosity levels or which are set to have low verbosity levels based on sampling rate. In embodiments, sensors may be grouped into sets based at least in part on whether they are active-optic measurement sensors (e.g., radiating light or other radiation into the water and measuring a response), or radiometry-related measurement sensors (e.g., measuring a response in the water from sunlight). In embodiments, profiles may be divided into pressure ranges, with each sensor set being programmed separately within each pressure range. In embodiments, profiles may be updated remotely (e.g., via the Iridium satellite system), which may be important when ocean properties to be measured change due to season or float location. An onboard controller may receive the instructions from the user to program the control table such as the example illustrated as Table 1.","In embodiments as illustrated in , a method for measuring underwater properties may comprise a step  of measuring, by a pressure sensor, a current pressure. In embodiments, the method may further comprise the step  of comparing, by one or more computers, the current pressure to pressure threshold limits for a plurality of respective pressure ranges, wherein each of the respective pressure ranges is associated with a respective set of one or more of the sensors. In embodiments, the method may further comprise the step  of activating and\/or sampling, by the one or more computers, a respective one of the sets of one or more of the sensors when the current pressure range is within the pressure range associated with the respective one set of sensors.","In embodiments, the method may further comprise controlling, by the one or more computers, an ascent or descent rate of the underwater vessel based at least in part on the current pressure.","In embodiments of the method, a respective frequency of activation and\/or sampling is associated with each of the respective pressure ranges, and the activating and\/or sampling step may activate and\/or sample the set of one or more of the sensors with the associated frequency when the current pressure is within the pressure range associated with the respective one set.","In embodiments of the method, the frequency of activation and\/or sampling is further associated with a time range and\/or a date range, and the activating and\/or sampling step may activate and\/or sample the set of one or more of the sensors with the associated frequency only when a current time and or date is within is within the time and\/or date range associated with the respective frequency.","In embodiments of the method, the programmable controller is configured to control an ascent or descent rate of the underwater vessel based at least in part on the underwater pressure.","In embodiments as reflected in , a method for measuring underwater properties may comprise the step  of measuring, by a pressure sensor, a current pressure.

Accordingly, embodiments may be constructed in which acts are performed in an order different than illustrated, which may include performing some acts simultaneously, even though shown as sequential acts in illustrative embodiments.","All definitions, as defined and used herein, should be understood to control over dictionary definitions, definitions in documents incorporated by reference, and\/or ordinary meanings of the defined terms.","The indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can,\u201d as used herein in the specification and in the claims, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, should be understood to mean \u201cat least one.\u201d","The phrase \u201cand\/or,\u201d as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be understood to mean \u201ceither or both\u201d of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Multiple elements listed with \u201cand\/or\u201d should be construed in the same fashion, i.e., \u201cone or more\u201d of the elements so conjoined. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the \u201cand\/or\u201d clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to \u201cA and\/or B\u201d, when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as \u201ccomprising\u201d may refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.","As used herein in the specification and in the claims, \u201cor\u201d should be understood to have the same meaning as \u201cand\/or\u201d as defined above.

This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase \u201cat least one\u201d refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, \u201cat least one of A and B\u201d (or, equivalently, \u201cat least one of A or B,\u201d or, equivalently \u201cat least one of A and\/or B\u201d) may refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.","In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccarrying,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d \u201ccontaining,\u201d \u201cinvolving,\u201d \u201cholding,\u201d \u201ccomposed of,\u201d and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to.
