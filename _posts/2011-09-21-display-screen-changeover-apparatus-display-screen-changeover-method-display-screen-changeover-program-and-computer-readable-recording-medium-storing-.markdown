{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a display screen changeover technique to quickly and easily perform a changeover of content display on a TV screen.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventionally, there is a television receiver (hereinafter, referred to as TV) that receives broadcast signals transmitted via radio frequencies by an antenna or the like, and provides to viewing audience a preferred program selected by a tuner by displaying the program on a screen. A conventional TV displays a screen according to a format specified by a standard definition television (SDTV) or a format specified by a high definition television (HDTV). Here, the aspect ratio used in SDTV is different from the aspect ratio used in HDTV. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications No. 2004-186803 and No. 2007-60676 discloses a technique to convert a program according to an aspect ratio contained in broadcast signals into a program according to a previously set aspect ratio used in a display screen, and display the converted program on a display screen.","In recent years, in order to provide to viewing audience various kinds of information such as program related information, whether information, news information, etc., together with broadcast programs, there is provided data broadcast service such as cable television broadcast, digital broadcast, Internet protocol (IP) broadcast, etc. In this case, for example, signals sent from the above-mentioned various kinds of broadcast are converted into viewable data to be displayed on a TV screen. It should be noted that STB is provided with functions of demodulating or decoding each broadcast data, cancelling scramble, controlling limited reception, displaying electronic program guide (EPG), etc.","Furthermore, the conventional STB has a function of displaying on a TV screen a hyper text markup language (HTML) content such as a Web page (HTML page) acquired from an external server through, for example, the Internet.","According to the service using HTML contents, such as a HTML page supposing TV display, the aspect ratio of the HTML page is set to 4:3 (SD) or 16:9 (HD) so that HTML page can be displayed without scrolling by the display terminal.","It is usual for the service to display HTML pages on a TV to fix the size of the HTML page to an SD size or an HD size. Therefore, the display terminal merely has one browser display corresponding to either the SD size or the HD size.","However, in the service using both the HTML page of HD size and the HTML page of SD size, if a display is made with the fixed browser size, various problems may occur. For example, if an HTML page of SD size is displayed on the browser of HD size, the HTML page is displayed by left-aligned. Additionally, if a browser of HD size is displayed on 4:3 TV, it becomes a letter box display.","Because the HTML page of SD size is displayed in this letter box display, the HTML page displayed becomes small with respect to an area displayed by the TV. Moreover, if an HTML page of HD size is displayed on the browser of SD size, the entire HTML page does not fall within a display area of the browser, and it is necessary to scroll the screen when viewing the HTML page.","With such a service, it is assumed that a general HTML page is used other than that specified in the service. However, in a general site, because a page structure is not set in consideration with TV's over-scanning, the browser display may run off a TV display frame, which may result in that a part of the page cannot be displayed. Accordingly, in many cases, even if it is over-scanned on the TV side, a display is made by scaling the size to be smaller than an actual size so that the entire page can be displayed.","Moreover, when displaying on a TV screen, a display according to a format which a contents provider side desires to display cannot be displayed because the display is made in a state where a user previously sets by STB or the like.","It is a general object of the present invention to provide a display screen changeover apparatus, a display screen changeover method and a display screen changeover program in which the above-mentioned problems are eliminated.","A more specific object of the present invention is to provide a display screen changeover apparatus, a display screen changeover method and a display screen changeover program which can quickly and easily perform a changeover of a contents display on a TV screen.","There is provided according to one aspect of the present invention a display screen changeover apparatus changing a screen display when displaying HTML contents on a display screen of a television receiver, comprising: a contents analysis part configured to analyze display setting information with respect to the television receiver based on address information given to the HTML contents; and a display setting part configured to set a display of said HTML contents with respect to the display screen based on a result of analysis obtained by the contents analysis part.","There is provided according to another aspect of the present invention a display screen changeover method of changing a screen display when displaying HTML contents on a display screen of a television receiver, comprising: a contents analysis step of analyzing display setting information with respect to the television receiver based on address information given to the HTML contents; and a display setting step of setting a display of said HTML contents with respect to the display screen based on a result of analysis obtained by the contents analysis step.","Additionally, there is provided a computer readable program causing a computer to perform the above-mentioned display screen changeover method. Further, there is provided a computer readable recording medium storing a program causing a computer to perform the above-mentioned display screen changeover method.","Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","A description will be given below, with reference to the drawings, of an embodiment according to the present invention.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a piece of information, such as an aspect ratio of an HTML page (Web page) itself or a page displayed next is embedded in HTML contents. On a receiver side, the embedded information is acquired from the HTML page, and a size of a browser to display is adjusted according to the acquired information. Thereby, a display matching the HTML page can be made. Additionally, according to an embodiment of the present invention, a display efficiently using a TV display area is made by using aspect information of an HTML page and a TV type (4:3 or 16:9) connected presently.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a determination can be made even when there is no information regarding an aspect ratio in the HTML page to be displayed. When there is no information concerned, a control such as a display with an HD reduction size is performed. Thus, for example, measures for a TV over-scan can be taken only when displaying an HTML page (a page does not have aspect ratio information) of a general site.","A description will be given below, with reference to the drawings, of an embodiment of a display screen changeover apparatus, a display screen changeover method and a display screen changeover program.

Specifically, the contents analysis part  analyzes whether a predetermined character or value indicating the display setting information is contained using a query description portion and\/or a domain description portion contained in contents address information such as URL and previously set various pieces of basic information for analysis. It should be noted that the above-mentioned address information can be acquired from URL assigned to a plurality of sites obtained by a search performed on, for example, a Web page (HTML page) of a specific search site or the contents server  by using a search keyword input by a user through the search site.","The display setting part  sets display contents of a display screen based on a result of analysis by the contents analysis part . The display setting part  changes the display contents of a contents page based on the set-up contents. Specifically, the display setting part  changes the display contents, such as an SD display, an HD display, or a reduction HD display, based on display conditions based on analysis result set up beforehand.","The setting management part  manages the set-up display contents. Specifically, the setting management part  manages URL of set-up HTML contents so that setting can be adjusted, if necessary. That is, if the HTML contents include address information of a predetermined domain, the setting management part  causes the previous setting contents to be usable, or a new contents analysis to be performed.","Furthermore, the setting management part  also manages various kinds of setting information. The setting information includes setting contents of a screen size (pixel), setting contents of a resolution (for example, 960\u00d7540, 720\u00d7480, 640\u00d7480, etc.), setting of a contrast and volume, mode setting of SD\/HD, setting of high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI), setting of I-LINK, etc., from the TV .","When analyzing address information of the above-mentioned HTML contents, the setting management part  can change any one of pieces of information mentioned above by a query analysis or a domain analysis.

Specifically, the STB  checks address information, such as URL (Uniform Resource Locator) related to each HTML contents, and analyzes whether a predetermined character string or value exists in a query added to the address information such as URL (S). In the process of S, an analysis is made as to whether the domain contained in the address information is the set-up domain by referring to the address information such as URL assigned to each HTML contents as mentioned above.","Then, a display screen setting is performed (S) based on the result of analysis obtained in the process S and S. Then, the set contents are output to the TV  to cause the set contents to be output on a screen (S).","Thereby, according to the present embodiment, a changeover of a display by a TV screen can be quickly and easily performed using only address information without analyzing source code of HTML contents.","Here, a description is given of an example of basic information used when performing the contents analysis and the display screen setting in the present embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5C","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5C"]},"As basic information at the time of query interpretation illustrated in , an SD display setting and an HD display setting are indicated as conditions for changing the display screen. Specifically, when performing the SD display setup, one of a plurality of character strings contained in a query part contained in URL information of the HTML contents are set. For example, as illustrated in , when the SD display is performed with respect to the contents, \u201cSD=1\u201d is set and when the HD display is performed, \u201cSD=0\u201d or \u201cHD=1\u201d is set as basic information.","Therefore, in the present embodiment, it is judged in the query analysis by the contents analysis part  mentioned above whether the character strings \u201cSD=1\u201d, \u201cSD=0\u201d, \u201cHD=1\u201d are contained in the query part contained in URL by referring to URL of contents of HTML. Additionally, by making that a plurality of conditions can be set, if, for example, the query of HD=1 is used for other conditions, \u201cSD=0\u201d can be used. Thereby, general versatility is given in setting of query, and the present embodiment is applicable extensively.","In the present embodiment, when none of the conditions is met in the query analysis using the basic information illustrated in , for example, a reduced size (reduction of HD size) display for countermeasures for TV over-scan can be performed in the above-mentioned display setting part .","As illustrated in , by previously setting a domain, if the domain is contained in URL, a setting according to the previously set display condition (for example, an SD display) can be made. It should be noted that if the URL of the HTML contents to be displayed does not contain the domain described in , an HD display can be used. Additionally, the SD display and the HD display may be set respectively. In such a case, if it does not match the domain of each of SD and HD, the setting can be changed to the HD reduction display.","As illustrated in , by setting an arbitrary reduction magnification, a display can be made by reducing by the reduction magnification set for the input contents (for example, 90% in the example of ). It is desirable to set the reduction magnification to, for example, about 75% to 95%, but it is not limited to such a reduction magnification in the present embodiment.","That is, in the present embodiment, based on the above-mentioned basic information, the SD display is applied if the query of \u201cSD=1\u201d is given to the URL and contents in the site registered as a domain to perform the SD display, the HD display is applied if the query of \u201cSD=0\u201d is given to URL, and the reduction HD display is applied if the domain other than the SD display domain and the query of \u201cSD=*\u201d does not exist.","In addition, in the present embodiment, the contents to be changed based on the result of the query analysis or the domain analysis with respect to the address information such as URL are not limited to the above-mentioned contents. For example, by directly inputting a screen size (pixel) or a resolution (for example, 960\u00d7540, 720\u00d7480, 640\u00d7480), etc., in a query, a more detailed output setting can be made to the TV.","A description is given of a specific example of the contents interpretation method in the present embodiment.  are illustrations indicating examples of address information to be subjected to the contents interpretation process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C"]},"In the examples of , if address information is \u201chttp:\/\/www.test.com\/index.html?stbid=12345&SD=0\u201d, for example, \u201cwww.test.com\u201d is a domain description portion and \u201cstbid=12345&SD=0\u201d is a query description portion. That is, a portion subsequent to a predetermined character sequence \u201c?\u201d is a query description portion.","Especially regarding the predetermined character sequence \u201c?\u201d which divides two description portions as mentioned above, the predetermined character sequence is not limited to \u201c?\u201d. Because the order of the notation of the URL notation is defined in RFC (Request for Comments), a description order cannot be changed arbitrarily. Moreover, with respect to a query description portion, there is no limitation to the notation order of queries because a plurality of queries can be arranged with \u201c&\u201d.","Moreover, the above-mentioned address information can be acquired by displaying a Web page of a specific search site or acquired from URL assigned to a plurality of sites obtained by a search performed on, for example, a Web server by using a search keyword input by a user through the search site. It should be noted that acquisition of address information is not limited to this, and, for example, a method which can acquire URL of contents by a method such as downloading may be used.","As illustrated in the example of , when distinguishing the display setting information in the query description portion, the SD display is applied if the query character \u201cSD=1\u201d is under URL, and the HD display is applied if the query character \u201cSD=0\u201d is under URL. If there is no query character such as \u201cSD=0\u201d and \u201cSD=1\u201d, the reduction HD display is applied.","Specifically, if the query \u201cSD=1\u201d is given to URL, the SD display is applied. If the query \u201cSD=0\u201d is given to URL, the HD display is applied. In the present embodiment, even when a plurality of queries are described and if one of the above-mentioned query characters is present in the plurality of queries, a display according the one of the query characters is applied.","For example, if there is no query beginning by \u201cSD=\u201d, it is determined as contents of a general site, and the HD reduction display is applied. If a query completely matches \u201cSD=0\u201d or \u201cSD=1\u201d, a determination of display is made.","Moreover, as illustrated in , when judging the display setting information by the domain description portion, the domain to which the SD display is applied is registered previously, and the SD display is performed when displaying URL defined in the domain concerned.","Specifically, when \u201chttp:\/\/www.testtest.com\u201d and \u201chttp:\/\/www.test-sd.com\/index.html\u201d are set up as conditions for the SD display, URL of the HTML contents to be displayed is referred to. If the URL concerned includes the above-mentioned domain, the SD display is applied, and in other cases, a control is performed to apply, for example, the HD reduction display. It is not necessary to carry out a display changeover setup to a query for each HTML contents on the contents provider side, and contents display can be managed collectively.","In the present embodiment, the contents interpretation may be performed using both the query analysis. In such a case, a top priority is given to the query name distinction, and the domain name distinction is performed after the query analysis. That is, even if it is a page of a domain to which the SD display is applied, a priority is given to a query so that the HD display is applied.","For example, when \u201cwww.test-sd.com\u201d is registered as a domain to which the SD display is applied, as illustrated in , the HD display is applied by giving \u201cSD=0\u201d query even if the contents are in a domain to which the SD display is applied. On the other hand, if it is not the domain to which the SD display is applied, and there is no query matching \u201cSD=0\u201d and \u201cSD=1\u201d, the reduction HD display is applied.","Thus, by setting up as mentioned above, contents can be displayed on a screen in a suitable state according to the address information of the contents.","In the present embodiment, the display contents of SDTV and HDTV may be displayed as a parameter in a source code of an HTML page. The description in the HTML page can be achieved by, for example, providing an exclusive tag to notify aspect information in a <header> tag or a <body> tag, or using a method of describing as an exclusive script. It should be noted that the information to describe is not limited to the aspect information, and, for example, using info\/notion regarding a resolution of HTML may provide the same effect.","However, in describing in an HTML page, all the contents of a source code must be analyzed by the receiver apparatus side of the STB side, which requires a complicated analysis. Therefore, in order to change the contents display on TV screen quickly and easily, it is desirable to perform the query analysis and the domain analysis as mentioned above.","A description is given of an example of display on a TV screen in the present embodiment.  are illustrations indicating examples of display on a TV screen in the present embodiment.  illustrates an example of the SD (standard image quality) display,  illustrates an example of the HD (high definition) display, and  illustrates an example of a reduction HD display.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":["FIG. 7C","FIG. 7C","FIG. 7C"]},"In the case of the example illustrated in , generally, the HTML contents are not provided with a safety zone supposing TV display, and, thus, a display cutoff may be generated when an over-scan display is performed on the TV side. As countermeasures for such a problem, the reduction display is performed in the present embodiment to prevent the display cutoff.","Here, the above-mentioned display screen changeover apparatus can realize the above-mentioned display screen changeover by executing a program (display screen changeover program) which causes a computer to perform each function mentioned above. The display screen changeover program is installed, for example, in the STB  mentioned above.","The CPU  illustrated in  (the control part  illustrated in ) reads the display screen changeover program written in the EPROM  illustrated in  (the accumulation part  illustrated in ), and executes the read display screen changeover program. The display screen changeover program may be distributed by being stored in a recording medium, such as a magnetic disk (a flexible disk, a hard disk, etc.), an optical disc (a CD-ROM, a DVD, etc.), and a semiconductor memory, etc. Alternatively, the display screen change program may be downloaded from a predetermined server.","As mentioned above, according to the present embodiment, the contents display on the TV screen can be changed quickly and easily. That is, according to the present embodiment, a user, such as a TV viewing audience, does not need to directly set up the display contents, and can cause the TV screen to output an optimal display result automatically. Moreover, according to the present embodiment, the contents provider side can set up the screen which is desired to be displayed to the viewing audience.","Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, for example, a size of an HTML page to be displayed can be known by embedding the aspect ratio information as a query in link URL of an HTML page or previously registering a domain to be SD displayed (or HD displayed) on the reception terminal side, and the display can be changed to a display suitable for the page concerned. Thereby, a display area of a TV can be used efficiently to provide a best display can be provided to viewing audience.","Moreover, according to the present embodiment, even if the service is continued from the time where a 4:3 TV is a mainstream size, an HTML page of an SD size, which has been used, can be applied without change.
