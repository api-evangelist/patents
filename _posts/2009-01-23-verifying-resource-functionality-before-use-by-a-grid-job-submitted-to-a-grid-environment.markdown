title: Verifying resource functionality before use by a grid job submitted to a grid environment
abstract: A method, system, and program for verifying resource functionality before use by a grid job submitted to a grid environment are provided. When a new resource is allocated to a particular execution environment within a grid environment managed by a grid management system, then a grid verification service automatically selects and runs at least one functionality test on the new resource as controlled by the grid management system. Responsive to a result of the functionality test, the grid verification system verifies whether the result meets an expected result before enabling routing of the grid job to the new resource, such that the functionality of the new resource is automatically verified before access to the new resource is allowed to maintain quality of service in processing grid jobs.

No. 11\/031,427, filed Jan. 6, 2005, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The present application is related to the following co-pending applications:","(1) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/031,490;","(2) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/031,541; and","(3) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/031,543.","1. Technical Field","The present invention relates in general to improved grid computing and, in particular, to automated verification of resource functionality for resources within a grid environment. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to verifying grid resource functionality before enabling routing of a grid job submitted to the grid environment to the resources, such that the functionality of resources handling grid jobs is ensured.","2. Description of the Related Art","Ever since the first connection was made between two computer systems, new ways of transferring data, resources, and other information between two computer systems via a connection continue to develop. In typical network architectures, when two computer systems are exchanging data via a connection, one of the computer systems is considered a client sending requests and the other is considered a server processing the requests and returning results. In an effort to increase the speed at which requests are handled, server systems continue to expand in size and speed. Further, in an effort to handle peak periods when multiple requests are arriving every second, server systems are often joined together as a group and requests are distributed among the grouped servers. Multiple methods of grouping servers have developed such as clustering, multi-system shared data (sysplex) environments, and enterprise systems. With a cluster of servers, one server is typically designated to manage distribution of incoming requests and outgoing responses. The other servers typically operate in parallel to handle the distributed requests from clients. Thus, one of multiple servers in a cluster may service a client request without the client detecting that a cluster of servers is processing the request.","Typically, servers or groups of servers operate on a particular network platform, such as Unix or some variation of Unix, and provide a hosting environment for running applications. Each network platform may provide functions ranging from database integration, clustering services, and security to workload management and problem determination. Each network platform typically offers different implementations, semantic behaviors, and application programming interfaces (APIs).","Merely grouping servers together to expand processing power, however, is a limited method of improving efficiency of response times in a network. Thus, increasingly, within a company network, rather than just grouping servers, servers and groups of server systems are organized as distributed resources. There is an increased effort to collaborate, share data, share cycles, and improve other modes of interaction among servers within a company network and outside the company network. Further, there is an increased effort to outsource nonessential elements from one company network to that of a service provider network. Moreover, there is a movement to coordinate resource sharing between resources that are not subject to the same management system, but still address issues of security, policy, payment, and membership. For example, resources on an individual's desktop are not typically subject to the same management system as resources of a company server cluster. Even different administrative groups within a company network may implement distinct management systems.","The problems with decentralizing the resources available from servers and other computing systems operating on different network platforms, located in different regions, with different security protocols and each controlled by a different management system, has led to the development of Grid technologies using open standards for operating a grid environment. Grid environments support the sharing and coordinated use of diverse resources in dynamic, distributed, virtual organizations. A virtual organization is created within a grid environment when a selection of resources, from geographically distributed systems operated by different organizations with differing policies and management systems, is organized to handle a job request.","While clusters or other groups of servers can be grouped within a grid environment, Grid technologies do not solve all the problems associated with ensuring quality of service and performance where groups of resources are managed by different management systems with different standards are handling grid jobs. In particular, an attribute and benefit of grid technology is that resources are moved around into different virtual organizations, also referred to as execution environments, to optimize available resources. Clients submitting jobs to any computing system expect that the resources provided to handle a grid job are functional. A problem in the grid environment, however, is that with each resource reallocation to a new execution environment, however, the functionality of the resource is no longer verified. For example, when a network adapter is allocated in a new execution environment, connectivity with the network adapter is no longer verified unless a system administrator runs a test to ensure the connectivity of the network adapter. As the number of resources and resource reallocations increases in a grid environment, using a system administrator to manually select and run tests for each resource will degrade performance.","In view of the foregoing, there is a need for a computer-implemented method, system, and program for detecting new resources in an execution environment, testing each resource for functionality, and verifying the functionality of a resource, before routing a grid job to that resource, to assure quality of service of each job submitted to a grid environment.","In view of the foregoing, the present invention in general provides for improved grid computing and in particular to automated verification of resource functionality for resources within a grid environment. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to verifying resources within an execution environment before enabling routing of a grid job submitted to the grid environment to the resources within the execution environment, such that the functionality of resources handling grid jobs is ensured.","In one embodiment, when a new resource is allocated to a particular execution environment within a grid environment managed by a grid management system, then a grid verification service automatically selects and runs at least one functionality test on the new resource as controlled by the grid management system. Responsive to a result of the functionality test, the grid verification system verifies whether the result meets an expected result before enabling routing of the grid job to the new resource, such that the functionality of the new resource is automatically verified before access to the new resource is allowed to maintain quality of service in processing grid jobs.","The grid management system may detect that a new resource is allocated to a particular execution environment when the new resource is added to an existing execution environment of resources previously tested for functionality. In addition, grid management system may detect that a new resource is allocated to a particular execution environment that is newly built, and thus all the resources in the execution environment need to be tested for functionality. Further, the grid management system may detect that a new resource is allocated to a particular execution environment to replace a defective resource in the execution environment.","In running at least one functionality test on the new resource, tests may be selected according to type of resource and further specified according to class of resource or resource brand. One type of functionality test directs a test job to the new resource from the grid management system and the test result for the test job is collected. Another type of functionality test calls a diagnostic tool enabled to locally test the new resource and a log file indicating the test results is received.","If an error condition is detected in the result, the grid verification service may attempt to resolve the error. If the error is resolved, then the grid verification service verifies the functionality of the new resource. Alternatively, if the error is not resolved, then the grid verification service identifies the error and the grid management system may attempt to replace the resource.","Referring now to the drawings and in particular to , there is depicted one embodiment of a computer system which may be implemented in a grid environment and in which the present invention may be implemented. As will be further described, the grid environment includes multiple computer systems managed to provide resources. Additionally, as will be further described, the present invention may be executed in a variety of computer systems, including a variety of computing systems, mobile systems, and electronic devices operating under a number of different operating systems managed within a grid environment.","In one embodiment, computer system  includes a bus  or other device for communicating information within computer system , and at least one processing device such as processor , coupled to bus  for processing information. Bus  may include low-latency and higher latency paths connected by bridges and adapters and controlled within computer system  by multiple bus controllers. When implemented as a server system, computer system  typically includes multiple processors designed to improve network servicing power.","Processor  may be a general-purpose processor such as IBM's PowerPC\u2122 processor that, during normal operation, processes data under the control of operating system and application software accessible from a dynamic storage device such as random access memory (RAM)  and a static storage device such as Read Only Memory (ROM) . The operating system may provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to the user. In one embodiment, application software contains machine executable instructions that when executed on processor  carry out the operations depicted in the flowcharts of , , and other operations described herein. Alternatively, the steps of the present invention might be performed by specific hardware components that contain hardwired logic for performing the steps, or by any combination of programmed computer components and custom hardware components.","The present invention may be provided as a computer program product, included on a machine-readable medium having stored thereon the machine executable instructions used to program computer system  to perform a process according to the present invention. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d as used herein includes any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor  or other components of computer system  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Common forms of non-volatile media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, a hard disk, magnetic tape or any other magnetic medium, a compact disc ROM (CD-ROM) or any other optical medium, punch cards or any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a programmable ROM (PROM), an erasable PROM (EPROM), electrically EPROM (EEPROM), a flash memory, any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other medium from which computer system  can read and which is suitable for storing instructions. In the present embodiment, an example of a non-volatile medium is mass storage device  which as depicted is an internal component of computer system , but will be understood to also be provided by an external device. Volatile media include dynamic memory such as RAM . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire or fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio frequency or infrared data communications.","Moreover, the present invention may be downloaded as a computer program product, wherein the program instructions may be transferred from a remote virtual resource, such as a virtual resource , to requesting computer system  by way of data signals embodied in a carrier wave or other propagation medium via a network link  (e.g. a modem or network connection) to a communications interface  coupled to bus . Virtual resource  may include a virtual representation of the resources accessible from a single system or systems, wherein multiple systems may each be considered discrete sets of resources operating on independent platforms, but coordinated as a virtual resource by a grid manager. Communications interface  provides a two-way data communications coupling to network link  that may be connected, for example, to a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that provide access to network . In particular, network link  may provide wired and\/or wireless network communications to one or more networks, such as network , through which use of virtual resources, such as virtual resource , is accessible as provided within a grid environment . Grid environment  may be part of multiple types of networks, including a peer-to-peer network, or may be part of a single computer system, such as computer system .","As one example, network  may refer to the worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use a particular protocol, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), to communicate with one another. Network  uses electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link  and through communication interface , which carry the digital data to and from computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information. It will be understood that alternate types of networks, combinations of networks, and infrastructures of networks may be implemented.","When implemented as a server system, computer system  typically includes multiple communication interfaces accessible via multiple peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus bridges connected to an input\/output controller. In this manner, computer system  allows connections to multiple network computers.","Additionally, although not depicted, multiple peripheral components and internal\/external devices may be added to computer system , connected to multiple controllers, adapters, and expansion slots coupled to one of the multiple levels of bus . For example, a display device, audio device, keyboard, or cursor control device may be added as a peripheral component.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware depicted in  may vary. Furthermore, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the depicted example is not meant to imply architectural limitations with respect to the present invention.","With reference now to , a block diagram illustrates one embodiment of the general types of components within a grid environment. In the present example, the components of a grid environment  include a client system  interfacing with a grid management system  which interfaces with server clusters , servers , workstations and desktops , data storage systems , and networks . For purposes of illustration, the network locations and types of networks connecting the components within grid environment  are not depicted. It will be understood, however, that the components within grid environment  may reside atop a network infrastructure architecture that may be implemented with multiple types of networks overlapping one another. Network infrastructure may range from multiple large enterprise systems to a peer-to-peer system to a single computer system. Further, it will be understood that the components within grid environment  are merely representations of the types of components within a grid environment. A grid environment may simply be encompassed in a single computer system or may encompass multiple enterprises of systems. In addition, it will be understood that a grid vendor may provide grid environment , where the grid vendor may calculate a cost for use of resources within grid environment  based on the amount of time required for a grid job to execute or the actual amount of resources used, for example.","The central goal of a grid environment, such as grid environment  is organization and delivery of resources from multiple discrete systems viewed as virtual resource . Client system , server clusters , servers , workstations and desktops , data storage systems , networks  and the systems creating grid management system  may be heterogeneous and regionally distributed with independent management systems, but enabled to exchange information, resources, and services through a grid infrastructure enabled by grid management system . Further, server clusters , servers , workstations and desktops , data storage systems , and networks  may be geographically distributed across countries and continents or locally accessible to one another. It will be understood that mechanisms for discovery of grid resources within virtual resource  are not depicted herein, however, client system  may discover the resources within virtual resource  as advertised from local and global directories available within grid environment .","In the example, client system  interfaces with grid management system . Client system  may represent any computing system sending requests to grid management system . In particular, client system  may send virtual job requests and jobs to grid management system  and grid management system  may respond with a grid offer and controls processing of grid jobs. Further, while in the present embodiment client system  is depicted as accessing grid environment  with a request, in alternate embodiments client system  may also operate within grid environment .","While the systems within virtual resource  are depicted in parallel, in reality, the systems may be part of a hierarchy of systems where some systems within virtual resource  may be local to client system , while other systems require access to external networks. Additionally, it is important to note, that client system  may physically encompass the systems depicted within virtual resources . Further, the systems in virtual resource  may be allocated among resource nodes and execution environments, where a resource node is a grouping of resources enabled to perform a particular grid function and an execution environment is a grouping of resources and resource nodes enabled to handle a particular grid job.","To implement grid environment , grid management system  facilitates grid services. Grid services may be designed according to multiple architectures, including, but not limited to, the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA). In particular, grid management system  refers to the management environment which creates a grid by linking computing systems into a heterogeneous network environment characterized by sharing of resources through grid services.","In one example, as will be further described in detail, grid management system  may include a grid service that allocates resources and resource nodes to an execution environment suitable for an incoming grid job and manages resources and resource nodes within the execution environment to ensure the performance of the grid job. In addition, grid management system may include a grid service that first tests and verifies grid resources allocated to an execution environment before a grid job is routed to the allocated resources. In the event that an error is detected, the grid service will attempt to resolve the error or replace the resource.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrates one example of an architecture that may be implemented in a grid environment. As depicted, an architecture  includes multiple layers of functionality. As will be further described, the present invention is a process which may be implemented in one or more layers of an architecture, such as architecture , which is implemented in a grid environment, such as the grid environment described in . It is important to note that architecture  is just one example of an architecture that may be implemented in a grid environment and in which the present invention may be implemented. Further, it is important to note that multiple architectures may be implemented within a grid environment.","Within the layers of architecture , first, a physical and logical resources layer  organizes the resources of the systems in the grid. Physical resources include, but are not limited to, servers, storage media, and networks. The logical resources virtualize and aggregate the physical layer into usable resources such as operating systems, processing power, memory, I\/O processing, file systems, database managers, directories, memory managers, and other resources.","Next, a web services layer  provides an interface between grid services  and physical and logical resources . Web services layer  implements service interfaces including, but not limited to, Web Services Description Language (WSDL), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and eXtensible mark-up language (XML) executing atop an Internet Protocol (IP) or other network transport layer. Further, the Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OSGI) standard  builds on top of current web services  by extending web services  to provide capabilities for dynamic and manageable Web services required to model the resources of the grid. In particular, by implementing OGSI standard  with web services , grid services  designed using OGSA are interoperable. In alternate embodiments, other infrastructures or additional infrastructures may be implemented a top web services layer .","Grid services layer  includes multiple services which may be incorporated into grid management system . For example, grid services layer  may include grid services designed using OGSA, such that a uniform standard is implemented in creating grid services. Alternatively, grid services may be designed under multiple architectures. Grid services can be grouped into four main functions. It will be understood, however, that other functions may be performed by grid services.","First, a resource management service  manages the use of the physical and logical resources. Resources may include, but are not limited to, processing resources, memory resources, and storage resources. Management of these resources includes scheduling jobs, distributing jobs, and managing the retrieval of the results for jobs. Resource management service  monitors resource loads and distributes jobs to less busy parts of the grid to balance resource loads and absorb unexpected peaks of activity. In particular, a user may specify preferred performance levels so that resource management service  distributes jobs to maintain the preferred performance levels within the grid.","Second, information services  manages the information transfer and communication between computing systems within the grid. Since multiple communication protocols may be implemented, information services  manages communications across multiple networks utilizing multiple types of communication protocols.","Third, a data management service  manages data transfer and storage within the grid. In particular, data management service  may move data to nodes within the grid where a job requiring the data will execute. A particular type of transfer protocol, such as Grid File Transfer Protocol (GridFTP), may be implemented.","Finally, a security service  applies a security protocol for security at the connection layers of each of the systems operating within the grid. Security service  may implement security protocols, such as Open Secure Socket Layers (SSL), to provide secure transmissions. Further, security service  may provide a single sign-on mechanism, so that once a user is authenticated, a proxy certificate is created and used when performing actions within the grid for the user.","Multiple services may work together to provide several key functions of a grid computing system. In a first example, computational tasks are distributed within a grid. Data management service  may divide up a computation task into separate grid services requests of packets of data that are then distributed by and managed by resource management service . The results are collected and consolidated by data management system . In a second example, the storage resources across multiple computing systems in the grid are viewed as a single virtual data storage system managed by data management service  and monitored by resource management service .","An applications layer  includes applications that use one or more of the grid services available in grid services layer . Advantageously, applications interface with the physical and logical resources  via grid services layer  and web services , such that multiple heterogeneous systems can interact and interoperate.","With reference now to , there is depicted a block diagram of an instance of a grid management system managing multiple execution environments within a grid environment in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, grid management system (GMS)  manages multiple execution environments  and . In the example, each of execution environments  and  include multiple resources allocated for handling a particular grid job or batch of grid jobs. It will be understood that GMS  may physically include multiple instances that provide the functions of GMS . In addition, GMS  may be distributed across multiple physical systems within grid environment  and may incorporate multiple grid services.","According to one embodiment, GMS  builds execution environments of grid resources that are able to handle grid jobs and provide a particular level of quality of service for grid jobs. GMS  may build an execution environment of all new resources, where a new resource is one that has not previously been included in a particular execution environment. In addition, GMS  may build an execution environment and then add new resources as additional resources are required or as faulty resources requirement replacement. Additionally, GMS  may reuse an execution environment for multiple grid jobs from multiple disparate clients, as long as the execution environment meets the specifications agreed to for the performance and other requirements of each grid job.","Within an execution environment, each resource may be controlled by a local management system that interfaces with GMS  via the grid infrastructure. In addition, within an execution environment, groups of resources may be controlled by a hardware level management system, such as a cluster based management system that manages the load across multiple server systems grouped in a cluster. It will be understood that additional configurations of resources, in additional to the configurations depicted for purposes of example, may implement the present invention.","In one example, execution environment  includes multiple grid resources, which when viewed individually, include a hardware platform , a network adapter , and operating system software . These individual resources may be distributed among multiple physically disparate locations. Further, these individual resources may be part of clusters of server systems managed by cluster management tools.","GMS  may also manage an execution environment . Execution environment  includes hardware platform , network adapter , and operating system software . In addition, GMS  moves hardware platform  from execution environment  to execution environment .","To illustrate an advantage of the invention, when GMS  allocates hardware platform  to execution environment , hardware platform  is considered a new resource which needs to be verified for functionality before allowing any grid jobs routed to execution environment  to execute on hardware platform . In one example, GMS  calls a hardware testing diagnostic tool  of operating system software  to request that hardware testing diagnostic tool  perform diagnostic testing of the functionality of hardware platform . Additionally, an operating system resource executing on hardware platform  may be called to perform the diagnostic testing. Hardware testing diagnostic tool  may return a log file indicating any errors found during the testing. In another example, GMS  may direct test equations or test operations to hardware platform  and receive test results which can be compared with expected results to determine if there are any functionality errors. If a functionality error is detected, then GMS  may remove the new resource and attempt to replace the resource within execution environment .","In the example, hardware testing diagnostic tool  is depicted as an example of a local or native diagnostic tool that can be called to perform functionality testing at the resource level, rather than from a test job performed by GMS . It will be understood that each type of resource may include a local, native, or on-board diagnostic tool or commands that can be called to perform functionality testing at the resource level. In addition, it will be understood that operating systems or application software may include diagnostic tools or command that can be called to perform functionality testing of other resources at the resource level.","Referring now to , there is depicted a block diagram of a grid management system for managing a grid environment in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. In the example, GMS  includes multiple grid modules that provide grid services and store data for access across grid environment . It is important to note that the grid modules described in GMS  may be distributed among multiple grid managers within grid environment  and may interact with resource level management tools.","As depicted, GMS  includes a grid scheduler  for detecting incoming jobs and scheduling execution of incoming jobs within grid environment . In particular, when grid scheduler  detects an incoming grid job, grid scheduler  passes the incoming grid job to a grid allocation service .","Grid allocation service  controls the allocation of resources within execution environments. Grid allocation service  may maintain available execution environments, may move resources among execution environments, and may build new execution environments. In one embodiment, grid allocation service  may build resource nodes of resources required to support a type of job and then move entire resource nodes among execution environments. For example, grid allocation service  may build a resource node with the hardware platform, operating system resources, network connector resources, storage subsystems, and application software required to support database based jobs. In addition, grid allocation service  may communicate with grid management systems for other grid environments to control access of additional resources from external grid environments.","When grid allocation service  allocates a new resource within an execution environment, grid allocation service  may call grid verification service  before enabling job router  to route a grid job to the new resource. In another embodiment, grid allocation service  may call grid verification service  to test a resource at the completion of a current grid job, but prior to allocating the new resource to a new execution environment. Further, in another embodiment, grid verification service  may continue to test and verify a resource after a grid job begins in the execution environment, and in particular, may test a verify the resource using client provided testing criteria.","Grid verification service  determines what tests should be run on the new resource to verify functionality, runs the tests on the new resource, and analyzes the test results. Grid verification service  returns a report to grid allocation service  either indicating the verified functionality of the new resource or indicating the unresolved error condition within the new resource.","According to one embodiment, if grid verification service  detects an error in the functionality of a new resource, grid verification service  calls grid degradation prevention service  with a request for error resolution. Grid degradation prevention service  may attempt to resolve the error in the new resource by communicating with error resolution tools local to the new resource or by performing error resolution routines. In one example, if grid verification service  detects that the average utilization of a CPU is greater than 90%, then grid verification service  may call grid degradation prevention service  because CPU average CPU utilization of more than 90% is considered an error. Grid degradation prevention service  may then enable another CPU or activate another logical partition to prevent further deterioration of the performance.","In addition to performing tests to detect errors, grid verification service  may receive error indicators from grid error monitoring service . Grid error monitoring service  monitors each execution environment within grid environment  for conditions which may indicate errors in the environment. The errors reported by grid error monitoring service  may be in the form of error messages or error logs. In one example, grid error monitoring service  may detect and report errors in a manner similar to the grid error monitoring service described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/031,541, herein incorporated by reference.","It will be understood that although the services described herein provide automated processing for a grid job, any of the grid services described as part of grid management system  may be performed by a system administrator through human intervention. In addition, it will be understood that grid management system  may include additional grid services, job queues, and storage systems for improving the efficiency of grid environment  overall and the efficiency of grid management system  in handling individual grid jobs.","With reference now to , there is depicted a block diagram of examples of components of a grid verification service in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As illustrated, grid verification service  includes a testing controller . Testing controller  is initiated when a new resource is added to an execution environment. In addition, it will be understood that testing controller  may be initiated responsive to other events within the grid environment.","When testing controller  is initiated, testing controller  searches available test table  for applicable tests for the new resource. As will be further described with reference to , available test table  includes tests according to type of resource and further specified by class of resource. In addition, available test table  includes both tests that call local resource tests and test jobs to be run by testing controller . In addition to accessing available test table , testing controller  may query new resources to determine if the resource includes a local diagnostic tool that can be called to allow the new resource to self-verify.","Testing controller  collects test results in a test results table . Test results table  may include both log file data and direct testing results, organized according to new resource.","Once testing controller  completes testing of a new resource, error detector  analyzes test results table  for errors. In particular, error detector  may search log files for error conditions. In addition, error detector  may compare test results from tests performed by testing controller  with expected results and detect errors where results do not match expectations.","Then, error detector  accesses acceptable errors table  when determining how to respond to detected errors. Acceptable errors table  includes conditions for errors that are acceptable within a particular execution environment or within the grid environment. For example, a log file for a tested disk subsystem may indicate the reallocation of bad blocks, however, reallocation of bad blocks on a disk subsystem is designated in acceptable errors table  as a normal function of disk controllers.","Error detector  may call grid degradation prevention service  with a request for grid degradation prevention service  to attempt to resolve detected errors. In one example, grid degradation prevention service  is able to resolve a detected error and returns the error resolution report to error detector . In another example, grid degradation prevention service  is not able to resolve a detected error and returns an indicator that the error was not resolved. Error detector  then informs grid allocation service  whether there are any unresolved errors or whether all new resources are verified.","Referring now to , there is depicted an illustrative example of entries in a test availability table in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, available test table  includes tests specified according to the general type of resource and further specified according to a class of resources within the type. In addition, tests may be specified for each particular resource by resource name. It will be understood that the tests depicted in available test table  are examples of the types of tests that may be performed and called, and that the actual test sequences may be adjusted according to the precision of testing required to validate the functionality of a grid resource.","When a resource is a processor, available test table  designates multiple available tests and the expected result types, as illustrated at reference numeral . In a first example, a processor may be tested by calling the native processor diagnostics that can be invoked from an operating system; available test table  may include the call references for multiple types of operating system based processor diagnostics. The native processor diagnostics may return a log file. In a second example, a processor may be tested by running a test job with a set of test equations and collecting test results. Multiple sets of test equations may be available and specified according to the type of processor or processors. In either example, processors, including the bus and backplanes may be tested and the results verified.","When a resource is memory, available test table  designates multiple available tests and the expected result types, as illustrated at reference numeral . In a first example, memory may be tested by calling a local operating system based memory diagnostics tool; available test table  may include the command references for multiple types of operating system based memory diagnostics. In a second example, memory may be tested by running a test job of a bit check test on the memory; test results are collected for comparison against an anticipated bit pattern. In a third example, memory may be tested by running a test job of a full pattern read and write test designed to verify the memory functions; test results are collected for determination whether the read and write were properly executed. In one example, testing controller  may select the full pattern read and write test for faster memory resources and the bit check test for slower memory resources.","When a resource is a network adapter, available test table  makes multiple tests are available and sorted by the class of network adapter, as illustrated at reference numeral . Classes of network adapters may include, but are not limited to, SAN adapters and IP adapters. For each class of network adapter, a series of tests may be performed. First, in the series, testing controller  is directed to call an on-board loop back test. In particular, a network adapter may include on-board diagnostics that can be invoked by other systems through a command call. Second, in the series, testing controller  is directed to run a connectivity test. In one example, a connectivity test such as a ping test may be used, where a resulting \u201cping\u201d is expected. It will be understood that additional tests may be specified to test the functionality of both individual network adapters and classes of network adapters.","When a resource is a device controller, such as a SCSI device controller, available test table  makes multiple tests available and stored by class of device controller, as illustrated at reference numeral . For each class of device controller, a series of tests may be performed. First, in the series, testing controller  is directed to call an on-board loop back test to test the local hardware. Second, in the series, testing controller  is directed to perform test job of a test access of the hardware. A test access, in general, includes instructions that enable verification of the adapters, paths, and read and write capabilities of a device controller. For example, if the device controller is a disk subsystem, the test access may include instructions to write a file on each disk with a predetermined data pattern, read back each file, and then delete each file.","When a resource is a storage subsystem, such as a disk or tape, available test table  makes multiple tests available and stored by class of storage subsystem, as illustrated at reference numeral . For each class of storage subsystem, a particular test access may be performed. In a case where the media is not removeable, the test may include instructions to verify each part of the storage subsystem. Alternatively, in a case where the media is removeable, the test may include instructions to verify the paths and read and write capabilities of the whole storage subsystem. Further, if a storage subsystem includes an on-board diagnostic tool, available test table  may include a call operation for the on-board diagnostic tool.","When a resource is operating system software, available test table  makes multiple tests available according to type of operating system, as illustrated at reference numeral . For each type of operating system, the test includes instructions to call the operating system tools for parameter testing and readiness testing. In particular, each operating system may include diagnostic tools that can be called to verify the operating system. In one example, the test may include instructions to call tools within the AIX operating system (AIX is a registered trademark of International Business Machines Corporation). In particular, with reference to the AIX operating system, a \u201clppchk-v\u201d instruction can be called to test to ensure that no software components inconsistencies exist; a \u201coslevel-r\u201d instruction can be called to request the operating system release level and maintenance level; a \u201cinstfix-ik\u201d instruction can be called to verify that all filesets are present for the current release and maintenance level; a \u201clslpp-L\u201d instruction can be called, and used with a filter that specifies which results are requested to determine the presence and state of any specific operating system file set or device driver; and a \u201cset\u201d instruction can be called, and used with a filter, to determine the presence and value of required environment variables. It will be understood that additional AIX operating system instructions may be called to test the parameters and readiness of the AIX operating system. In addition, it will be understood that other types of instructions may be specified to call for other operating systems.","When a resource is application software, available test table  makes multiple tests available according to the type of software, as illustrated at reference numeral . If application software includes a self-verification routine, available test table  may include a specific call for the self-verification routine. Alternatively, available test table  may include an instruction to run a functionality test job for the particular class of application of the current application. In one example, the application software resource is DB2 database software (DB2 is a registered trademark of International Business Machines Corporation), which is in the database software class. A database class functional test job would require performance of the following operations: (1) verify the correct daemons and processes are running; (2) connect to the database and verify connection to the database; (3) create a test table in the database; (4) populate test data into the table; (5) execute a query with known results against the table and verify the results; (6) delete the test table; (7) disconnect from the database; and (8) remove the database alias. It will be understood that additional operations that test and verify database software may be invoked. In addition, it will be understood that available test table  illustrates sample test cases with results and result types, however, those skilled in the art could extend these sample test cases to additional or more suitable platforms and applications.","With reference now to , there is depicted is a high level logic flowchart of a process and program for controlling grid job routing to verified resources within an execution environment for the grid job in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention.
