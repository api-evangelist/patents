{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-44098 filed on Feb. 26, 2008, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to electrophotographic photoreceptors containing a pyranthrone compound used for image formation of an electrophotographic system and an image formation apparatus by use thereof.","In recent years, opportunities to use an electrophotographic copier and a printer have been increased in the field of printing as well as color printing. In the field of printing as well as color printing, high quality digital monochromatic or color images tend to be demanded. In order to respond to such the demand, it is proposed that a laser light having a short wavelength is employed as a source for exposure to light to form high definition digital images. However, the electrophotographic image finally obtained has not sufficiently achieved high image quality, even though the laser light having a short wavelength is employed, and the dot size of exposure is narrowed to form a minute electrostatic latent image on the electrophotographic photoreceptor.","The reason is that photosensitive properties of the electrophotographic photoreceptor, an electrification characteristic of toner in a developer and so forth do not satisfy properties required for formation of minute dot latent images as well as formation of toner images.","That is, in cases where the electrophotographic photoreceptor is an organic photoreceptor prepared for a conventional long wavelength laser, (hereinafter, the organic photoreceptor will be also referred to simply as a photoreceptor), reproducibility of dot images is sometimes insufficient since a sensitivity characteristic is insufficient, and no clear dot latent image is formed, when imagewise exposure in which the dot size of exposure is narrowed is conducted with laser light having a short wavelength.","Anthanthrone based pigments and pyranthrone based pigments are conventionally well known as a charge generation material in a photoreceptor utilized for a short wavelength laser (Patent Document 1). However, there is no description in Patent Document 1 concerning polycyclic quinone pigments such as the anthanthrone based pigments subjected to a specific treatment, and they are simply considered to be commercially available pigments, but as for properties such as sensitivity and so forth obtained when these commercially available pigments are employed, neither sensitivity nor high speed performance is sufficiently obtained with a high speed printer and copier equipped with a short wavelength laser which is expected to be developed in the near future.","It is known that a particle size of the charge generation material is minimized to form a charge generation layer having high density of the charge generation material in order to improve sensitivity from another aspect. However, when this particle-minimizing technique is applied to a photoreceptor suitable for a short wavelength laser, sensitivity itself is improved, but sufficient high speed processing or fogging property is not obtained.","A short wave light emission diode (short wave LED) emitting light having wave length of 350-500 nm has characteristics liable not to generate moir\u00e9 used as a short wave exposure source in comparison with short wave light emission semiconductor laser. However an organic photoreceptor suitable for the short wave LED and utilizing the advantage of the short wave LED has not been developed.\n\n","The present invention was made on the basis of the above-described problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide an organic photoreceptor exhibiting high sensitivity, suitable for exposure to a light emission diode having an emission wavelength of 350-500 nm, as well as high processing speed of 300 mm\/sec or more, with which fog is minimized even under high speed processing. Another object is to provide an image forming apparatus fitted with the organic photoreceptor.","The inventors have found out that when a charge generation material made of particles of a condensed cyclic pigment are arranged to be in the similar forms near an ellipsoid, dispersion characteristics of the pigment in an charge generation layer can be improved, whereby not only sensitivity is improved, but also generation of fog or image defects is minimized even under high speed processing.","The organic photoreceptor comprises a photosensitive layer including a charge generation layer and a charge transport layer provided on an electroconductive substrate.","The organic photoreceptor has a charge generation layer and a charge transport layer provided on a conductive substrate, a ten-point surface roughness Rz of the substrate is from 0.2 \u03bcm or less, the charge generation layer contains particles of a condensed polycyclic pigment having an average major axis of 500 nm or less, an average aspect ratio of 2.5 to 5.0, and an aspect ratio variation coefficient of 16% or less, and quantum efficiency \u03a6 of the photoreceptor is not less than 0.5, the quantum efficiency \u03a6 being defined by a Formula of \u03a6=\u0394Q\/(n\u00d7e), wherein \u0394Q is reduced amount of charge [C] in case that light having light amount predetermined so as to make the electric field E becomes \u2154 times of initial electric field after unit time (1 sec.) is exposed to the organic photoreceptor under condition of the initial electric field E=2.5\u00d710[V\u00b7cm], and n([cm\u00b7s]) is a number of incident photons per unit area (1 cm) and in unit time (1 sec.) in case that light having light amount predetermined so as to make the electric field E becomes \u2154 times of initial electric field after unit time (1 sec.) is exposed to the organic photoreceptor under condition of the initial electric field E=2.5\u00d710[V\u00b7cm], and e is an amount of charge that an electron has, or an elementary electric charge, 1.3\u00d710[C].","The condensed polycyclic pigment is preferably a compound represented by the Formula (1).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0015"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"48.34mm","wi":"69.93mm","file":"US08288065-20121016-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"The condensed polycyclic pigment is a charge generation material in the organic photoreceptor.","The organic photoreceptor is suitably employed in an image forming apparatus, which includes a charging device to charge the organic photoreceptor, a light exposing device which exposes the charged organic photoreceptor to form an electrostatic latent image, a developing device to develop the latent image by a toner for forming a toner image and a transfer device which transfers the developed toner image to a transferee, and the exposing device comprises an emission diode having an emission peak at wavelength of 350 to 500 nm as the imagewise exposure source.","The organic photoreceptor of this invention is suitable for image exposure employing short wave LED for the image forming, and generation of image noise such as black spots or fogging is minimized and gives an electrostatic photographic image with good gradation characteristics of a halftone image.","The organic photoreceptor of this invention comprises a photosensitive layer including a charge generation and a charge transport layer provided on a conductive substrate.

The ratio of such the solvent in the whole solvent is from 30 to 100%, preferably from 40 to 100%, and more preferably from 50 to 100%, by weight. Methanol, benzyl alcohol, toluene, methylene chloride, cyclohexanone and tetrahydrofuran are usable as a co-solvent giving good result by using together with the above solvent.","The thickness of the intermediate layer is preferably from 0.3 to 10 \u03bcm. Generation of black spots is minimized and good reproduction of dot image is obtained by a thickness of intermediate layer of from 0.3 to 10 \u03bcm. The thickness of intermediate layer is more preferably from 0.5 to 5 \u03bcm.","It is preferable that the intermediate layer is substantially electric insulating. The insulating layer has a layer having a volume resistance of not less than 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm. The volume resistance of the intermediate layer and the protective layer is preferably from 1\u00d710to 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm, more preferably from 1\u00d710to 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm, and further preferably from 2\u00d710to 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm. The volume resistance can be measured by the following method.\n\n","When the volume resistance is not less than 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm, good blocking ability of the intermediate layer is obtained, occurrence of black spots is minimized and good potential holding ability of the organic photoreceptor is obtained so that sufficient image quality is obtained.","Photosensitive Layer","The layer constitution of the photoreceptor of the invention is preferably a separated function structure in which the function of the photosensitive layer is separated to a charge generation layer (CGL) and a charge transfer layer (CTL) though a single layer configuration may be applied, in which the charge generation function and the charge transfer function are possessed by one layer. By the function separating structure, the residual potential caused by repeatedly use can be controlled to low and another photographic property can be easily controlled so as to suit for purpose of use. In the negatively charging photoreceptor, a configuration is preferable, in which the charge generation layer is provided on the intermediate layer and the charge transfer layer is provided on the charge generation layer.","The constitution of the photoreceptor of the function separated negatively charging photoreceptor is described bellow.","Charge Generation Layer","The charge generation material represented by the formula (1) is incorporated in the charge generation layer of the organic photoreceptor. Another charge generation material may be used according to necessity additionally to the above charge generation material. A phthalocyanine pigment, an azo pigment, a perylene pigment and a polycyclic quinine pigment are cited as the pigment to be used together with.","Reins can be used as the binder of the charge generation material in the charge generation layer. A formal resin, a butyral resin, a silicone resin, a silicone-modified butyral resin and a phenoxy resin can be cited as a preferable resin. The ratio of the charge generation material to the resin binder is preferably 20 to 600 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the binder resin, and more preferably 300 to 600 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the binder resin. The pigment particles according to this invention can be incorporated much more amount for the amount of the binder than conventional pigment particles. The increasing in the residual potential caused by repeating use can be restrained by the use of such the resins. The thickness of the charge generation layer is preferably 0.3 \u03bcm to 2 \u03bcm.","Charge Transport Layer","The charge transfer layer may be constituted by a single layer or plural layers.","A charge transport layer is composed of a charge transport material and a binder to bind the charge transport material to form the layer. There may optionally be incorporated additives such as an antioxidant.","A positive hole type (P-type) charge transport material can be used as a charge transfer material (CTM), example of which includes a triphenylamine derivative, a hydrazone compound, styryl compound, benzidine compound and butadiene compound. It is preferable to use an organic compound exhibiting low absorbance for a laser light with an emission wavelength in the range of 400 to 500 nm, for example, compound (3) described

Since each of the LED elements composed of the LED array corresponds to each of the lenses included in the lens array one by one, it is possible to form the electrostatic latent image on the surface of the photoreceptor  by focusing the lights emitted from the LED elements onto the surface through the lenses. Further, a driving electronic current and\/or a light emitting duration of each of the LED elements are\/is compensated for in advance, so that an equality of the light intensity between the LED elements can be maintained.","A semiconductor laser or an emission diode at an emission wavelength of 350 to 500 nm is used as an exposure light source to form a latent image on the photoreceptor .

The light intensity distribution includes, for example, a Gauss distribution and a Lorenz distribution. The exposure dot diameter is an area up to 1\/eis a spot area in both of light intensity distributions in this invention.","A latent image formed on the photoreceptor  is developed by supplying a toner with the developing device  to form a visible toner image on the surface of the photoreceptor. It is preferred to use a polymer toner for a developer supplied by the developing device in this invention. Specifically, a combined use of the polymer toner having uniform shape or particle size distribution and the organic photoreceptor of this invention can achieve high-precise image formation of superior sharpness.","The latent image formed on the photoreceptor is visualized via development. The toner used in the development includes pulverized toner and granular polymerization toner. A granular polymerization toner is preferable in view of uniform particle distribution obtained by polymerization process.","Toner particles of the granular polymerization toner is prepared by a process wherein resin particles are prepared by polymerization and, if required, the resin particles are subjected to chemical process to obtain polymer particles having necessary particle diameter. Colorant is incorporated during the process.","The granular polymerization toner is practically prepared through polymerization such as suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization, and fusing process of particles mutually conducted if required after the polymerization.","Volume average particle diameter of the toner, i.e., 50% volume particle diameter (Dv 50) is preferably 2-9 \u03bcm, and more preferably 3-7 \u03bcm in view of high image definition. Content of fine particles of the toner can be reduced despite of microparticle toner, and good image reproduction, good sharpness and stable image can be obtained for long period.","A developer used in the development stage may be a single component developer or a two-component developer.","Single component developers include a non-magnetic single component developer and a magnetic single component developer in which magnetic particles of 0.1 to 0.5 \u03bcm are contained in toner particles.","A two-component developer is prepared by mixing a toner with a carrier. Magnetic particles as a carrier can use conventionally used materials, for example, metals such as iron, ferrite and magnetite and alloys of the foregoing metals and a metal such as aluminum or zinc. Of these, ferrite particles are preferred. The foregoing magnetic particles preferably have a volume average particle size of from 15 to 100 \u03bcm, and more preferably from 25 to 80 \u03bcm.","The volume average particle size of a carrier can be determined typically using a laser diffraction type particle size distribution measurement apparatus, provided with a wet dispersing machine, HELOS (produced by SYMPATEC Corp.).","A carrier preferably is one in which a magnetic particle is covered with a resin and one in which magnetic particles are dispersed in a resin, so-called a resin dispersion type carrier. The examples of resin usable for the carrier coating include an olefin resin, styrene resin, styrene-acryl resin, silicone resin, ester resin and a fluoro-resin. Examples of a resin constituting a resin dispersion type carrier include a styrene-acryl resin, polyester resin, fluororesin and phenol resin.","The image forming apparatus may employ a system in which constituent elements such as the photoreceptor, the developing device, the cleaner and the like are integrated to form a so-called process cartridge of a unit structure which is easily detachable from the main body of the apparatus.
