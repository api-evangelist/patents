title: Speech recognition with request level determination
abstract: A recognition result determination section determines whether or not a character string identified by a speech recognition section through a speech recognition process includes a desire type character string (non-specific instruction type operation character string) in which an object to be operated is not specified. Further, a request level determination section determines a request level related to the desire type character string by detecting a change in sound pressure level on the basis of a speech signal. When the recognition result determination section makes a positive decision, a level-based instruction execution section specifies the object to be operated and gives a predetermined operation instruction on the basis of a content of the desire type character string and a request level determination result.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to a speech processing system which subjects input speech or input words to speech recognition and outputs various operation instructions on the basis of a result of the speech recognition.","Many systems have conventionally been available which input operation instructions or the like to various units through a speech recognition technology. Such a conventional system is equipped with a speech processing system that subjects speech or words, which are spoken by a user in order to input an operation instruction or the like, to a speech recognition process to thereby specify both a unit to be operated and an operation to be performed and that outputs an operation instruction corresponding thereto. Taking a vehicle system comprising various vehicle units, such as a navigation unit, an audio unit and an air conditioner, as an example, the above-mentioned speech processing system can give an operation instruction by means of speech to such units, thereby allowing the user to operate them with ease, particularly when his body is shaken during driving.","In the above-mentioned conventional speech processing system, when an operation instruction is given in the form of speech, it is required to clearly specify a unit to be operated and an operation to be performed. For example, when the user wishes to find a restaurant close to the current vehicle position in the above-mentioned example of the vehicle system, the user inputs words instructing to \u201cfind a restaurant\u201d or the like, so that the speech processing system specifies from the word \u201crestaurant\u201d the navigation unit as the unit to be operated and from the word \u201cfind\u201d an operation of finding a restaurant as the specific operation to be performed, and outputs an operation instruction corresponding thereto to the navigation unit.","However, a person who entertains some kind of feeling, desire or the like generally often speaks first a phrase that honestly expresses such a feeling, desire or the like. This is understood from words spoken by a child who has only a small vocabulary. When he is hungry, he says, first of all, \u201cI'm hungry\u201d which directly expresses his desire, rather than \u201cI want to eat something\u201d or \u201cI want to go to a restaurant\u201d which indicate more specific objects. However, the conventional speech processing system cannot specify a unit to be operated and an operation to be performed from a phrase expressing a feeling, desire or the like, and thus the user has to memorize a predetermined phrase necessary to give a desired operation instruction. Hence, the conventional speech processing system has not necessarily been a user-friendly machine.","To respond to the above-mentioned phrases honestly expressing a feeling, desire or the like in the conventional speech processing system, a table of correspondence between such phrases and specific operation instructions must be stored. For example, the phrase \u201cI'm hungry\u201d should be made to correspond to an operation instruction to \u201cfind a restaurant,\u201d a phrase \u201cI feel hot\u201d should be made to correspond to an operation instruction to \u201creduce the temperature setting of the air conditioner,\u201d and a phrase \u201cI'm tired\u201d should be made to correspond to an operation instruction to \u201cfind a rest area.\u201d That is, as long as phrases are made to correspond to operation instructions on a one-to-one basis, even the conventional speech processing system can respond to phrases honestly expressing a feeling, desire or the like. However, taking the phrase \u201cI'm hungry\u201d as an example, when the user speaks this phrase, it may imply that he wishes to find a nearby convenience store to buy something to eat right away, or that he wishes to find a good restaurant to dine a little later since he can still control his hunger. However, as mentioned above, when phrases are made to correspond to operation instructions on a one-to-one basis, the operation instruction to \u201cfind a restaurant\u201d is always specified for the phrase \u201cI'm hungry\u201d with no possibility of giving an operation instruction to \u201cfind a nearby convenience store.\u201d That is, the conventional speech processing system cannot determine a user's request level from a phrase spoken by the user to give an operation instruction corresponding to such a determined request level.","The present invention has been made in view of the above inconvenience, and an object thereof is to provide a speech processing system capable of giving an appropriate operation instruction even when a phrase in which neither an object to be operated nor a request level are specifically indicated is inputted.","To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a speech processing system which, when a speech signal is inputted, causes speech recognition means to subject the input speech signal to a speech recognition process to thereby specify a recognized character string corresponding to the speech signal, causes operation character string determination means to determine whether or not the recognized character string includes a non-specific instruction type operation character string in which an object to be operated is not specified, and causes request level determination means to determine a request level related to the operation character string on the basis of at least one of the speech signal and the recognized character string, and when the operation character string determination means makes a positive decision, causes operation instruction means to specify the object to be operated and give a predetermined operation instruction on the basis of the content of the operation character string and the request level determined by the request level determination means. Therefore, even if speech not specifically indicating an object to be operated and a request level is inputted, the object to be operated can be specified and an operation instruction can be given on the basis of the content of an operation character string and a request level related to this operation character string. Hence, various operation instructions can be inputted using natural spoken language close to a conversation between humans and, at the same time, an appropriate operation instruction corresponding to a request level can be selected.","It is further desirable that the above-mentioned operation character string determination means determines whether or not the recognized character string includes not only the non-specific instruction type operation character string but also a specific instruction type operation character string in which an object to be operated is specified, and when the recognized character string includes the specific instruction type operation character string, the operation instruction means gives a predetermined operation instruction to the object to be operated which has been specified on the basis of the specific instruction type operation character string. When the recognized character string includes a specific instruction type operation character string, an object to be operated can be specified easily from this specific instruction type character string, and thus a process for giving an operation instruction can be simplified.","It is still further desirable that when the recognized character string includes the non-specific instruction type character string and if the request level determined by the request level determination means is low, the operation instruction means instructs the object to be operated which has been specified by the non-specific instruction type operation character string to give various information. When the request level is low, a user may not be positively requesting that the object to be operated perform the predetermined operation, but may merely be requesting that various information be given. The speech processing system of the present invention can respond to such a request, and hence can accommodate various needs of the user with carefully-selected appropriate operation instructions.","It is still further desirable that the above-mentioned request level determination means extracts as a feature amount at least one of the loudness of a voice, the pitch of the voice and a phonation interval when determining a request level on the basis of the speech signal, and determines the request level on the basis of the feature amount which has been extracted. Generally, a change in feeling tends to appear in the form of a change in speech, and therefore, by extracting at least one of the above-mentioned feature amounts from the speech signal, the user's request level can be easily determined.","It is still further desirable that when determining a request level on the basis of the recognized character string, the above-mentioned request level determination means determines the request level on the basis of a character string related to a predetermined modifier included in the recognized character string. For example, when the recognized character string includes a character string related to a modifier, such as \u201ca little\u201d or \u201cvery much,\u201d the request level can be determined on the basis of such a character string. Therefore, even for a user whose speech changes so slightly that the system finds difficulty determining his request level on the basis of a change in any of the feature amounts extracted from the speech signal, the use of the above-mentioned predetermined modifier as a determination factor allows the user's request level to be determined reliably.","An embodiment, in which a speech processing system according to the present invention is applied to a vehicle system, will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.  is a block diagram showing the construction of a vehicle system according to the embodiment. A vehicle system  shown in  includes a speech processing system  for giving various operation instructions in response to speech or words spoken by a user, a navigation unit  for displaying a map of areas surrounding the user's vehicle by detecting the current position of the vehicle and performing operations such as searching and guiding a route to a destination selected by the user, a display unit  for displaying various images outputted from the navigation unit , a speaker  for outputting various spoken messages such as guide messages outputted from the navigation unit , and an air conditioner  for adjusting temperature and the like within the vehicle.","The speech processing system  shown in  includes a microphone , a speech recognition section , a speech recognition dictionary storage section , a recognition result determination section , a request level determination section , a level-based instruction execution section , and an instruction execution section .","The microphone  picks up speech or words spoken by the user and converts the speech or words into a speech signal. The speech recognition section  analyzes the speech signal outputted from the microphone , subjects the analyzed signal to a predetermined speech recognition process, and specifies a character string corresponding to the speech or words spoken by the user. The speech recognition dictionary storage section  stores a signal waveform corresponding to standard speech as a dictionary for speech recognition.","The recognition result determination section  determines whether a character string (recognized character string) specified by the speech recognition section  expresses a user's desire or clearly indicates a unit to which an operation instruction is given and an operation to be performed by such a unit. A character string expressing a user's desire will hereinafter be referred to as a \u201cdesire type character string,\u201d and a character string indicating both a unit to which an operation instruction is given and an operation to be performed will hereinafter be referred to as a \u201cspecific instruction type character string.\u201d The \u201cdesire type character string\u201d corresponds to a \u201cnon-specific instruction type operation character string,\u201d and the \u201cspecific instruction type character string\u201d corresponds to a \u201cspecific instruction type operation character string.\u201d When the recognition result determination section  determines a character string to be a desire type character string, it not only outputs this character string to the level-based instruction execution section , but also instructs the request level determination section  to output a request level detection result.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"Further, specific instruction type character strings include \u201cEAKON WO TSUKERU (Turn on the air conditioner),\u201d \u201cRESUTORAN WO SAGASU (Find a restaurant)\u201d and \u201cNUKEMICHI WO SAGASU (Find a bypath).\u201d Specifically, for example, in \u201cEAKON WO TSUKERU (Turn on the air conditioner),\u201d which is one of the above-mentioned specific instruction type character strings, a character string \u201cEAKON,\u201d which indicates an air conditioner, allows the system to identify that the unit to which an operation instruction is given is the air conditioner , and a character string \u201cTSUKERU\u201d allows the system to specify an operation to be performed (i.e., the air conditioner  should be operated). Further, in \u201cNUKEMICHI WO SAGASU (Find a bypath),\u201d which is another example of the specific instruction type character strings, a combination of a character string \u201cNUKEMICHI\u201d and a character string \u201cSAGASU\u201d allows the system to recognize that the user wishes to cause the navigation unit  (a unit to be operated) to find a bypath (an operation to be performed). As is understood from the above, each specific instruction type character string has the characteristic of clearly indicating both a unit to which an operation instruction is given and an operation to be performed. Note that the desire type character strings and the specific instruction type character strings are not limited to the above examples, but may include various other patterns.","By the way, in the actual speech recognition process, a character string extracted from an input speech signal indicating a phrase such as \u201cEAKON WO TSUKERU\u201d is generally identified as two character strings \u201cEAKON\u201d and \u201cTSUKERU\u201d with an article such as \u201cWO\u201d omitted. However, to simplify the illustration, a plurality of character strings including a character string corresponding to an article such as \u201cWO\u201d which are identified as expressing a single phrase during the speech recognition process will be collectively expressed as a single character string throughout this specification.","The request level determination section  determines a request level indicated by the user on the basis of a change in the sound pressure of speech or words spoken by the user (a change in the loudness of his voice).  is a block diagram showing a more detailed construction of the request level determination section . As shown in , the request level determination section  includes a sound pressure level measurement section , an average sound pressure level storage section , and a sound pressure level comparison section . The sound pressure level measurement section  measures a sound pressure level on the basis of a speech signal outputted from the microphone , and converts the measured sound pressure level into digital data. The average sound pressure level storage section  stores an average sound pressure level of words spoken by the user as digital data. The average sound pressure level is updated every time the user inputs speech to the speech processing system  according to this embodiment. The sound pressure level comparison section  classifies the request levels to be indicated by the user into three levels, level 1 to level 3, by comparing the sound pressure level outputted from the sound pressure level measurement section  with the average sound pressure level stored in the average sound pressure level storage section . Specifically, the sound pressure level comparison section  groups sound pressure levels outputted from the sound pressure level measurement section  which are lower than the average sound pressure level into level 1, sound pressure levels which are substantially equal to the average sound pressure level into level 2, and sound pressure levels which are higher than the average sound pressure level into level 3. These levels 1 to 3 correspond to the user's request levels. That is, level 1 indicates that the user's request level is low and level 3 indicates that the user's request level is high, while level 2 indicates that the user's request level is between levels 1 and 3.","The level-based instruction execution section  has an operation instruction table in which various operation instructions for operating units such as the navigation unit  are stored for selection, and selects and executes an appropriate operation instruction corresponding to both a character string (desire type character string) outputted from the recognition result determination section  and a request level determination result outputted from the request level determination section .  is a diagram showing an exemplary operation instruction table, which stores operation instructions prepared for levels 1 to 3 classified in correspondence to the contents of desire type character strings. For example, for the desire type character string \u201cTSUKARETA,\u201d the table stores the following operation instructions in three levels: \u201cIndication of continuous driving hours\u201d (level 1); \u201cIndication of a message suggesting that the user take a rest\u201d (level 2); and \u201cInstruction to find a rest area\u201d (level 3). Further, for the desire type character string \u201cATSUI,\u201d the table stores the following operation instructions in three levels: \u201cIndication of the temperature inside the vehicle\u201d (level 1); \u201cIndication of a question as to whether the user wishes to operate the air conditioner\u201d (level 2); and \u201cInstruction to operate the air conditioner\u201d (level 3). Note that operation instructions corresponding to desire type character strings are not limited to those examples shown in , but may include various other patterns.","When a desire type character string outputted from the recognition result determination section  is \u201cTSUKARETA\u201d and a user's request level outputted from the request level determination section  is level 2, the level-based instruction execution section  selects an instruction, which is \u201cIndication of a message suggesting that the user take a rest,\u201d from the above-mentioned operation instruction table shown in FIG.  and executes the selected instruction. In this case, a message such as \u201cWHY DON'T YOU TAKE A REST?\u201d is indicated to the user in the form of an image and speech. To indicate such a message in the form of an image and speech, the level-based instruction execution section  generates an image and a speech signal utilizing sections such as an image generation section (not shown) and an audio section (not shown), arranged in the navigation unit , and displays and announces the message on the display unit  through the speaker , respectively.","The instruction execution section  stores various operation instructions corresponding to specific instruction type character strings outputted from the recognition result determination section , and selects an operation instruction corresponding to the content of a specific instruction type character string to thereby output the selected instruction to the navigation unit  or the like. For example, when \u201cRESUTORAN WO SAGASU (Find a restaurant),\u201d which is one of the specific instruction type character strings, is inputted, the instruction execution section  outputs to the navigation unit  an operation instruction that causes the unit  to find restaurants located within a radius of 5 km from the current vehicle position and to display a list of the restaurants that are found.","The speech recognition section  and the speech recognition dictionary storage section  correspond to speech recognition means. The recognition result determination section  corresponds to operation character string determination means. The request level determination section corresponds to request level determination means. The level-based instruction execution section  and the instruction execution section  correspond to operation instruction means.","The vehicle system  and the speech processing system  according to this embodiment have the above-mentioned configurations. Next, an operation procedure will be described in which the speech processing system  subjects speech or words spoken by the user to a predetermined process to thereby output an operation instruction to the navigation unit  or the like. For example, an operation procedure to be followed by the speech processing system  when the user speaks the words \u201cI'm tired\u201d will be described.  is a flowchart showing the operation procedure to be followed by the speech processing system .","The speech recognition section  constantly determines whether or not the user has inputted his speech or words to the microphone  (Step ). When the speech has been inputted, the speech recognition dictionary storage section  identifies a character string corresponding to the speech picked up by the microphone  using the speech recognition dictionary (Step ). If the words spoken by the user are \u201cI'm tired\u201d as mentioned above, the speech recognition section  specifies the character string \u201cTSUKARETA\u201d corresponding to these words.","When the speech recognition section  specifies the character string and outputs the same, the recognition result determination section  determines whether or not this character string is a desire type character string (Step ). For example, the above-mentioned character string \u201cTSUKARETA\u201d is determined to be a desire type character string by referring to the table shown in FIG. . When the inputted character string is determined to be a desire type character string, the recognition result determination section  outputs this character string to the level-based instruction execution section  (Step ) and, at the same time, instructs the request level determination section  to output the determination result of a request level detected from the user's speech to the level-based instruction execution section .","Next, the level-based instruction execution section  selects an appropriate operation instruction corresponding to the character string (desire type character string) outputted from the recognition result determination section  and the request level determination result outputted from the request level determination section  (Step ). For example, when the recognition result determination section  outputs the character string \u201cTSUKARETA,\u201d and if the request level determination result is \u201clevel 1,\u201d then the level-based instruction execution section  selects the operation instruction: \u201cIndication of continuous driving hours.\u201d Further, when the request level determination result is \u201clevel 2,\u201d the section  selects the operation instruction: \u201cIndication of a message suggesting that the user take a rest,\u201d and when the request level determination result is \u201clevel 3,\u201d the section  selects the operation instruction: \u201cInstruction to find a rest area.\u201d","The level-based instruction execution section  thereafter executes the selected operation instruction (Step ). Specifically, if the above-mentioned \u201cIndication of continuous driving hours\u201d (corresponding to level 1) is selected, the level-based instruction execution section  outputs to the navigation unit  an instruction requiring the unit  to indicate to the user his continuous driving hours in the form of an image and speech. In response to this instruction, for example, a message such as \u201cYOUR DRIVING HOURS ARE 2 HOURS AND 45 MINUTES\u201d is displayed on the display unit  and also announced through the speaker  to the user. Similarly, when the operation instruction \u201cIndication of a message suggesting that the user take a rest\u201d (corresponding to level 2) is selected, a message such as \u201cWHY DON'T YOU TAKE A REST?\u201d is displayed on the display unit  and also announced through the speaker  to the user. Further, when \u201cInstruction to find a rest area\u201d (corresponding to level 3) is selected, the level-based instruction execution section  instructs the navigation unit  to send to the user a message such as \u201cREST AREAS WILL BE FOUND\u201d through the display unit  and the speaker  and, at the same time, also instructs the unit  to find rest areas near the current vehicle position (e.g., convenience stores, parking areas). Upon completion of an operation corresponding to the selected operation instruction, control returns to Step  to repeat the operation of determining whether or not speech has been inputted and the other operations subsequent thereto.","When the character string outputted from the speech recognition section  is determined as not being a desire type character string, the decision in Step  mentioned above is negative, and then the recognition result determination section  determines whether or not the character string outputted from the speech recognition section  is a specific instruction type character string (Step ). If it is determined that the character string is not a specific instruction type character string, this means that the inputted speech does not fall under any of the previously stored desire type and specific instruction type character strings, and hence the recognition result determination section  informs the user of an error in the form of an image and speech through the instruction execution section , and prompts the user to input speech again (Step ).","When the character string outputted from the speech recognition section  is a specific instruction type character string, the decision in Step  mentioned above is positive, and then the recognition result determination section  outputs this character string to the instruction execution section  (Step ). The instruction execution section  selects an operation instruction corresponding to the content of the character string (specific instruction type character string) outputted from the recognition result determination section  (Step ). Then, the instruction execution section  executes the selected operation instruction (Step ). Specifically, for example, when a character string outputted from the recognition result determination section  is \u201cEAKON WO TSUKERU,\u201d the instruction execution section  not only gives an operation instruction to the air conditioner  to operate the air conditioner , but also indicates a message such as \u201cAIR CONDITIONER WILL BE TURNED ON\u201d through the display unit  and the speaker  in order to inform the user of the content of the operation to be performed. Upon completion of the operation corresponding to the selected operation instruction, control returns to Step  to repeat the operation of determining whether or not speech has been inputted and the other operations subsequent thereto.","As mentioned above, the speech processing system  according to this embodiment determines whether or not a character string identified after a speech signal has been subjected to a speech recognition process is a desire type character string and, at the same time, determines a request level related to the desire type character string on the basis of a change in the sound pressure level extracted from the speech signal, and specifies an object to be operated and gives a predetermined operation instruction to the specified object to be operated on the basis of the content of the desire type character string and the request level determination result. Therefore, even if speech or words such as the above-mentioned example of \u201cI'm tired\u201d for which neither an object to be operated nor a request level are specifically indicated is inputted, the system can specify both the object to be operated and the request level so that an appropriate operation instruction can be given.","Note that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, but may be modified in various modes within the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, although the request level determination section  determines a user's request level on the basis of a change in the sound pressure level of speech or words spoken by the user in the above mentioned embodiment, the user's request level may be determined on the basis of a change in the pitch of a voice or in phonation interval.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00044","num":"00044"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["18","18","280","282","284","280","10","282","284","280","282"],"i":["a ","a "]},"In a specific example, the fundamental frequency comparison section  groups cases where a fundamental frequency outputted from the fundamental frequency measurement section  is lower than an average fundamental frequency into level 1, cases where the former is substantially equal to the latter into level 2, and cases where the former is higher than the latter into level 3. As mentioned above, these levels 1 to 3 correspond to the user's request levels. Level 1 indicates that the user's request level is low and level 3 indicates that the user's request level is high, while level 2 indicates that the user's request level is between levels 1 and 3. Although the request level determination section shown in  detects the pitch of a voice by attaching importance to the fundamental frequency of speech, it may detect the pitch of the voice by considering other frequency components in the speech.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00046","num":"00046"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["18","18","380","382","384","380","10"],"i":["b ","b "]},"For example, when words such as \u201cI'm tired\u201d are inputted, a time interval corresponding to each of the syllables \u201cTSU,\u201d \u201cKA,\u201d \u201cRE,\u201d and \u201cTA\u201d for the character string \u201cTSUKARETA\u201d is detected as a value of, e.g., tens of milliseconds, and the phonation interval is calculated as an average of the above time intervals corresponding to the syllables. Note that the phonation interval may be calculated by a method which is different from the above-mentioned example. The average phonation interval storage section  stores an average phonation interval of words spoken by the user as digital data. The average phonation interval herein means an average of phonation intervals obtained when the user speaks a number of times. The average phonation interval is updated every time the user inputs words. The phonation interval comparison section  classifies the user's request levels into three levels, level 1 to level 3, by comparing the phonation interval measured by the phonation interval measurement section  with the average phonation interval stored in the average phonation interval storage section .","In a specific example, the phonation interval comparison section  groups cases where a phonation interval outputted from the phonation interval measurement section  is longer than an average phonation interval into level 1, cases where the former is substantially equal to the latter into level 2, and cases where the former is shorter than the latter into level 3. As mentioned above, these levels 1 to 3 correspond to the user's request levels.

Further,  is a block diagram showing a more detailed construction of the request level determination section . As shown in , the request level determination section includes a modifier detection section , a request level recognition data storage section , and a request level recognition section .","The modifier detection section  detects a predetermined modifier when such a predetermined modifier is included in a character string outputted from the speech recognition section .

For example, when a character string outputted from the modifier detection section  is \u201cSUGOKU (terribly),\u201d the request level recognition section  recognizes a user's request level as being level 3 on the basis of the data table stored in the request level recognition data storage section . Further, when the modifier detection section  outputs the information that a predetermined modifier is not detected, the request level recognition section  recognizes the user's request level as being level 2.","While the case where any one of the loudness of a voice (sound pressure level), the pitch of a voice, the phonation interval, and the predetermined modifier is considered as a factor for determining a user's request level has been described in the above-mentioned example, a combination of two or more of these factors may be used to determine a user's request level.","Further, while the user's request levels are classified into three levels, i.e., level 1 to level 3, in the above-mentioned embodiment, the user's request levels are not limited to these three levels, but may be reduced to two levels for simple speech processing or may have an increased number of levels.","Moreover, while an exemplary case where the speech processing system in which the present invention is embodied is applied to the vehicle system has been described in the above-mentioned embodiment, the present invention is not limited thereto, but can be applied to various other systems.","As mentioned in the foregoing, according to the present invention, even if speech or words, which specifically indicates neither a unit to be operated nor a request level, are inputted, the unit to be operated can be identified and an operation instruction can be given on the basis of the content of an operation character string and a request level related to the operation character string. Therefore, various operation instructions can be interactively inputted through natural spoken language close to a conversation between humans and, at the same time, an operation instruction corresponding to a request level can be selected."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00013","num":"00013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00018","num":"00018"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00019","num":"00019"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00020","num":"00020"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00021","num":"00021"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00022","num":"00022"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
