{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to on-line payments, and in particular, to funding of on-line payments.","2. Related Art","More and more consumers are purchasing items and services over electronic networks, such as the Internet. Consumers routinely search for and purchase products and services from merchants and individuals alike. The transactions can take place directly between an on-line merchant or retailer and the consumer, where payment is typically made by entering credit card or other financial information. Transactions can also take place with the aid of an on-line payment provider, such as PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. Such payment providers can make transactions easier and safer for the parties. Payment providers enable payments to be made through many different convenient methods.","When making a payment, the payer, user of the services, or consumer typically specifies a funding source for the payment. Examples of funding sources can be an account with the payment provider, a credit card, a bank or checking account, or the like. When the user specifies a funding source, the payment provider may process the payment request to determine whether the user has sufficient funds or credit to make the payment. If so, the payment request is approved, and the purchase is completed. However, if there are insufficient funds or credit, the payment request may be denied, resulting a lost sale for the seller or payee and a lost purchase by the buyer or payer.","In accordance with different embodiments, a user of a payment provider service, such as PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., is able to select one or more \u201cfriends,\u201d who also have accounts with the payment provider, as an alternate or additional funding source of a payment. Each \u201cfriend\u201d or friendly funding source identifies one or more other users of the payment provider service as ones that can use the friend to fund a payment. The friendly funding source may also set limits on the funding for each user. For example, user A, identified by an email address, user name, phone number, or other unique identifier, may have a per transaction limit, a per day limit, a per week limit, a per month limit, and\/or other type of limit. User B may have the same or different limits.","When a user is ready to make a purchase through the payment provider, the user may see one or more friends or friendly funding sources as funding options, along with any limits associated with each friendly funding source. The user can then select one or more of the friendly funding sources, either with or without another traditional funding source, such as the user's payment provider account or checking account.","The payment is processed using one or more friendly funding sources. Thus, the user is able to make a purchase in a situation where the user may not have been able to make the purchase using conventional means. The friendly funding source(s) may be notified by the payment provider when source is used, including the identity of the user and the amount used.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102"]},"Using this information, the payment provider determines, at step , whether the friend has an account with the payment provider. This can be done by searching an account database of the payment provider with the friend information. If no account exists, the friend may be asked to enter information again, as the original information may have been entered incorrectly. If still no account is found, an account may be created at step . Account creation may include the payment provider requesting certain information from the friend, such as a username, email address, phone number, credit card information, bank information, PIN, password, and\/or address. Using the requested information, the payment provider creates an account for the friend at step . Note that if an account was found, but not valid, such as expired funding source, expired account, etc., the payment provider may only need to request a limited amount of information to re-activate the account, such as an a valid funding source.","Once an account is created or if the friend has a valid account, the payment provider next receives a request, at step , from the friend to add the friend as a funding source for one or more other users. This may be received in any suitable manner. For example, the friend may see an option or notification or tab on the friend's home page, which the friend selects, to be added as a funding source. The request may be sent in any suitable manner. For example, a user can ask for a certain amount of funds from the friend to be approved.","Upon receiving this request, the payment provider may ask the friend to provide an identifier of the user for which the friend will be a funding source for. In one embodiment, the identifier is an email address, although other identifiers may also be suitable, such as, but not limited to a username or a mobile phone number. The friend enters the requested information and communicates it to the payment provider, which the payment provider receives at step .","The payment provider then determines, at step , whether the user has an account with the payment provider, such as by searching based on the information received at step . If the user does not have an account or a valid account, the user is notified at step . Notification may be through any available contact information and means. For example, if the friend provided a user email address, the payment provider may send the user an email about opening or creating an account and that a friend has offered to be a funding source. If the friend provided a mobile phone number, the payment provider may send an SMS text message to the user. Other means may also be possible, such as a voice message or mailed letter.","Next, a determination is made, at step , whether the user wishes to open or create an account with the payment provider. The determination may be based on whether anything is received by the user, either electronically or by mail. Without a response or with an affirmative indication that the user does not want to open an account, the process ends, and the friend may be notified that the user does not have an account with the payment provider, so that the friend cannot be added as a friendly funding source for the user.","However, if the user does wish to create an account, an account is created at step . Account creation may include the payment provider requesting the user for specific information, such as name, username, password, PIN, mailing address, credit card or bank information, etc. With this information, the payment provider may create an account for the user at step .","Once a user account is created (step ) or found (step ), the payment provider receives limits for the funding at step . The friend enters limits for the user, which are transmitted to the payment provider. The friend may set specific limits or different limits may be provided by the payment provider for the friend to select. Examples of limits include: 1) a dollar amount to be funded per transaction, 2) a dollar amount to be funded per day, per week, per month, or other time period, 3) a total number of transactions per day, per week, per month, or other time period, 4) certain categories for funding or certain categories for not funding, 5) certain payees for funding or certain payees for not funding, 6) different funding limits for different categories of purchases, and\/or 7) a time limit for when the funding will be available or will expire. Various combinations of the above or other limits can be set for the friend to control funding for the user.","For example, a parent may allow funding for a child, but only for school supplies, gas, and food. The parent may allow the child to use $100 per day for school supplies the week before and after a semester or quarter starts, but only $100 per week during the other times of the school year. The parent may also limit $50 per month for gas. Numerous other possibilities exist for the friend to control and limit funding for the user.","Upon receiving user limits, the payment provider associates the limits with the user's account and the friend's account. The friend's account is added, at step , as a funding option for the user when the user is making a payment through the payment provider. Thus, when the user is ready to make a payment, the user sees the friend's account as a possible funding source, which can be used partially or entirely to fund a payment or purchase.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202"]},"At step , the payment provider determines whether the user has an account with the payment provider, based on the information received at step . The payment provider may make the determination by searching an account database using the information provided. Results may include no account exists, an active account exists, or an inactive account exists. If the payment provider does not find a valid or active account, the payment provider may create an account for the user, at step , if desired by the user. This may include the user entering requested information, such as name, email address, phone number, mailing address, credit card or bank information, social security number, password, PIN, etc.","Once the user's account is created (step ) or found (step ), the payment provider accesses the account at step . Accessing the account allows the payment provider to determine certain information about the user and\/or the account, such as account limits or restrictions, available funding sources, etc. It also enables the payment provider to make any determinations about the authenticity of the user.","After account access, the payment provider receives transaction information at step . The transaction information may be received by an indication that the user is ready for check-out or payment of selected items, services, donations, or digital goods. For example, the user may select the desired items by placing them in a cart on a merchant site and selecting a button or link, such as \u201cCheckout,\u201d \u201cPay,\u201d \u201cContinue,\u201d etc. This may transmit or lead to transmitting the transaction information to the payment provider. Transaction information may include merchant identification, including a merchant account identifier, and purchase information, including price, tax, shipping costs, and totals.","The payment provider determines funding options for the user and the transaction, such as based on the user information and\/or the transaction information. For example, the user may have specific funding options associated with the account. Conventional funding options may include a user bank\/checking account and one or more credit cards. The user may also have limits to these conventional funding options, such as limits imposed by the instrument or a user controlling the instrument like a parent.","The funding options may also include one or more funding sources from friends of the user (i.e., \u201cfriendly funding sources), as described above. Thus, any of the user's friends who had previously designated the user as one who could use their account for funding a payment would be included as a possible funding option for the current transaction.","The available funding sources are then provided to the user at step . The friendly funding sources may include an identification of the person, such as the friend's name or email address. Other information may include any restrictions for the friendly funding source, such as limits. In one embodiment, the payment provider only provides or shows friendly funding sources that can be used with the particular transaction. Thus, even though the user may be associated with several different friendly funding sources, the specifics of the transaction may exclude one or more of those sources. In other embodiments, all friendly funding sources are shown to the user, regardless of whether one or more may be unusable due to the details of the transaction.","Based on the funding sources provided by the payment provider, the user selects one or more funding sources as payment for the transaction. Selection may be by simply checking a box next to desired ones of the funding sources or other selection means, such as clicking on the desired funding source. The selected funding source(s) are then communicated to and received by the payment provider at step .","Next, the payment provider determines whether to approve the payment at step . The determination process may include checking on limits or restrictions associated with the user's account, the details of the transaction or purchase, and the availability of one or more selected funding sources. Any number of reasons may cause the transaction to be declined, such as any indication of a fraudulent transaction, the type of transaction, purchase, or merchant was specifically forbidden, spending limits have been reached or exceeded, and\/or insufficient funds for the transaction amount. For example, the user may have selected one or more friendly funding sources that are not available for this transaction or user based on restrictions placed on the friendly funding sources and\/or the funding sources selected are insufficient to fund the transaction amount.","If the requested payment is not approved, the user may have the option of re-submitting the request by changing one or more parameters, such as adding a funding source and\/or changing a funding source. If the user wishes to re-submit the request, as determined at step , the user re-submits and the payment provider receives the new funding sources at step , where processing continues as before. If the user does not wish to re-submit the request or the user is not given the option of re-submitting (such as in the case where the reason for not approving the transaction was based on the actual type of transaction), then the transaction ends without a payment.","However, if the transaction request is approved, the payment provider processes the payment at step . The processing may include debiting the appropriate amount of funds from each of the specified funding sources and\/or accounts, crediting the appropriate amount of funds to the payee or merchant, and notifying the payee or merchant that the payment request has been approved. Notification can be by any means, including email, text, through the merchant or seller site, etc. Once notified, the merchant can release, ship, or otherwise transfer the purchase to the user.","If the user is using one or more friendly funding sources, the \u201cfriends\u201d may also be notified, at step , that the user has used their account to make a purchase. The notification may be through email, text, phone call, or notification on the friend's account page with the payment provider. The friend may be informed about various details of the transaction, including amount of funds used, total amount of the transaction, description of the purchase, the merchant or payee, and the date of the transaction.","Therefore, using embodiments of the present invention, a user may be able to make a purchase, where in the past, the user may not have been able to make the purchase. The reason is that one or more friends have allowed the user to use at least a portion of their account as a funding source for the purchase. This results in a sale that otherwise may not have happened. The friends can control the use of their funds at any time, which limits exposure or abuse of these additional funding sources. For example, a friend may see that the user is using the friendly funding source for non-essential items, resulting in the friend placing additional restrictions on the user or removing the source altogether. In another example, a parent may see that a child is using the funds for school supplies, but that the school supplies are costing more than anticipated. The parent may then raise limits on the friendly funding source for purchase of school supplies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","362","340","370","360","370","305","310","306","362","310","340","370"]},"First user device , second user device , merchant server , and payment provider server  may each include one or more processors, memories, and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and\/or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications, data, and steps described herein.

First user device  includes one or more user identifiers  which may be implemented, for example, as operating system registry entries, cookies associated with browser application , identifiers associated with hardware of first user device , or other appropriate identifiers, such as used for payment\/user\/device authentication. In one embodiment, user identifier  may be used by a payment service provider to associate first user  with a particular account maintained by the payment provider as further described herein. A communications application , with associated interfaces, enables first user device  to communicate within system .","Second user device  may have similar applications and modules as first user device , but is used, in this example, for designating one or more users and allowing the one or more users, such as first user , to select an account associated with second user  for funding a purchase by the one or more users. Restrictions, limitations, and conditions may be placed for each designated user. Second user device  may also include one or more browser applications  and one or more toolbar applications  which may be used, for example, to provide a convenient interface to permit second user  to browse information and perform tasks over network . For example, in one embodiment, browser application  may be implemented as a web browser configured to view information available over the Internet and communicate with payment provider server  to receive and send information about adding a friendly funding source for another user to use.","Second user device  may further include other applications  such as security applications for implementing client-side security features, programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) over network , or other types of applications. Applications  may also include email, text, IM, and voice applications that allow second user  to communicate through network , designate users, and create and manage friendly funding sources.
