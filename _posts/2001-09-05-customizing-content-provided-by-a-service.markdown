title: Customizing content provided by a service
abstract: A method and apparatus for providing a network based operating system for mobile clients is disclosed. Services may be developed that can be used to support different client devices with different capabilities. The services provide output with multiple variations based on different devices, and an intermediary selects the variation best suited for the requesting device. An online software development system is provided to allow services to create, edit, test, and deploy applications at an intermediary using only a browser at the client end. Services may also be provided that can be accessed and referred to by other services, thereby facilitating the combining of different services. Services may also store and access data at an intermediary using variables and a mapping of the stored data to the variables. Data stored at the intermediary may be used to allow an end user to return to a previously accessed service.

HARDWARE OVERVIEW"],"p":["This application claims domestic priority from prior U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60\/230,489 filed Sep. 6, 2000, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","The present invention relates to providing services to clients and, more specifically, to customizing content provided by a service.","The World Wide Web includes a network of servers on the Internet, each of which is associated with one or more HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) pages. The HTML pages associated with a server provide information and hypertext links to other documents on that and (usually) other servers. Servers communicate with clients by using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The servers listen for requests from clients for their HTML pages, and are therefore often referred to as \u201clisteners\u201d.","Users of the World Wide Web use a client program, referred to as a browser, to request, decode and display information from listeners. When the user of a browser selects a link on an HTML page, the browser that is displaying the page sends a request over the Internet to the listener associated with the Universal Resource Locator (URL) specified in the link. In response to the request, the listener transmits the requested information to the browser that issued the request. The browser receives the information, presents the received information to the user, and awaits the next user request.","Traditionally, the information stored on listeners is in the form of static HTML pages. Static HTML pages are created and stored at the listener prior to a request from a web browser. In response to a request, a static HTML page is merely read from storage and transmitted to the requesting browser. Currently, there is a trend to develop listeners that respond to browser requests by performing dynamic operations. For example, a listener may respond to a request by issuing a query to a database, dynamically constructing a web page containing the results of the query, and transmitting the dynamically constructed HTML page to the requesting browser.","Another trend is to expand Internet access to devices other than conventional computer systems. For example, many mobile clients (or mobile devices), such as wireless phones, have been developed that include embedded web browsers. Due to size and cost constraints, the \u201cmicro browsers\u201d contained in these devices have very limited functionality relative to the browsers that have been developed for full-fledged computer systems. However, devices with embedded micro browsers are usable in circumstances under which using a conventional computer system is impractical.","The number of device types that are able to display web content, in one form or another, continues to increase. For example, there are desktop, laptop and pocket computers, mobile phones, pagers, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) that can be described as \u201cweb-enabled\u201d because they are able display web content. As the number of web-enabled device types increases, so does the variation in the capabilities of the devices. For example, general purpose computer systems compensate for their immobility by providing large color screens, sophisticated sound output, significant processing power, ergonomic keyboard input, and an easy-to-use selection device such as a mouse, track ball, or track pad. Conversely, small mobile devices achieve their portability at the expense of screen size and user-input ease-of-use.","Yet another trend is to offer services to clients via a server on a network. Typically the network is the Internet, the client is a user, and the service is available from the server via a website. The service may supply information such as restaurant reviews, weather reports, stock quotations, or news updates. The service may also be more interactive, such as allowing the user to purchase goods, such as books or music, or to purchase services, such as booking travel arrangements. As used herein, the term \u201cservice\u201d refers to providing information, functions, or capabilities to a client.","The process by which the user accesses the service depends on the type of client the user has. For example, a desktop computer can connect to the Internet through a dial-up line, a digital subscriber line (DSL), a cable modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) connection, or many other available methods. Wireless application protocol (WAP) phones may connect to the Internet over a wireless connection through a WAP-to-HTTP gateway. Generally, the client logs in to the website and is presented with a list of available services, from which the client selects the desired service.","Generally, a service is provided in one of two ways: as a hosted application or as a portal application. With a typical hosted application, a developer creates the application, but a host installs and maintains the application for access by end-users, or customers, on the host network of servers. In contrast, with a typical portal application, the developer both creates the application and deploys it for access by end users, or customers, via one or more servers controlled by the developer. The \u201cdeveloper\u201d referred to herein may be the individual, company, or other entity that provides the service (also referred to as a service provider), or the developer may be another entity providing software development services to the service provider.","A common problem with providing services via applications, whether they are hosted applications or portal applications, is that the application must be designed to work with all devices. However, devices will vary widely in their capabilities based on both the type of device and the particular capabilities of different models of devices of the same type or class of device. For example, a desktop computer will generally have a fully functional web browser, whereas a personal computing device will have a micro browser with limited functionality. Also, some mobile phones may have a limited display that only allows for a single word on each line of the display, while other mobile phones may have a larger display capable of showing several words on each line.","The variation of capabilities can make it difficult for an application developer to support all possible devices. For example, a service may involve the display of graphic images, such as those of products offered for sale, which may be easily viewed on the full function web browser of a desktop computer but which may be incapable of display on a mobile phone. Also, even if the developer is only concerned with a certain type or class of device, the differences in capabilities may be significant. For example, if the application programmer sends output containing multiple words describing several items of information, mobile phones with limited display screens may only be capable of showing the first word of each information item on each line of the display screen, or the output for a single information item will fill multiple lines on the phone display, precluding other information items from being shown simultaneously.","One approach to solving the problem of designing for devices of varying capabilities is to design for the \u201clowest common denominator.\u201d The lowest common denominator approach involves designing the application to work on the most limited device available. For example, if a menu of options is to be displayed on a client device, such as a mobile phone, an application programmer may select short, one-word labels for each of the options because all devices that will use the application can support one-word labels. For example, the application developer may employ the single word menu item \u201cReturn\u201d for a mapping application for the option of generating return directions from a selected destination.","However, a drawback of the lowest common denominator approach is that the output does not take advantage of the superior capabilities of other devices. For example, if a client device is capable of displaying a longer label, such as \u201cGenerate Return Directions,\u201d the longer label would be preferred, since \u201cReturn\u201d is ambiguous and may be incorrectly interpreted by the user as meaning \u201cReturn to Previous Menu.\u201d In addition, the capabilities incorporated into new devices would go largely unused if all applications were targeted to the minimal capabilities of older devices.","An alternative approach to solving the problem of designing for clients or devices of varying capabilities is to design for some intermediate level of capability, such as the most common type of mobile phone. However, an application using this intermediate approach may not function properly on devices with lesser capabilities, and the application will still fail to take advantage of the enhanced capabilities of other devices.","Another problem with providing services via applications is how to support additional devices that become available after the application is developed. For example, several months after release of an application by a service provider, a device manufacturer may release a new device. The new device could be an evolutionary advance over current devices that improves existing features, or the new device could be a more significant advance in that class of device that adds significant new features, or the new device may be a new type of device that adds new capabilities or has a new combination of capabilities.","New devices with improved capabilities can be accommodated by using the lowest common denominator approach, but the enhanced features and capabilities of the new devices, such as larger displays, may go largely unused. For example, if the application only provides one-word menu options, the application will not be taking advantage of an improved device that is able to display multiple word options. Furthermore, with a later released device, the lowest common denominator approach may completely avoid using new capabilities, such as being able to handle voice data or graphics. Even if the application is designed for an intermediate level of capabilities, the application may still fail to fully utilize all of the advances and improvements in future devices that may be created.","Yet another problem with application development is having easy access to the tools available to the developer to create the application. Typically, a developer designing an application for a particular platform (e.g., a combination of hardware, operating system and\/or protocols) will utilize a software development kit (SDK). An SDK will generally contain an application programming environment, some commonly used libraries for various features, application programming interfaces, utilities, documentation, a compiler for generating executable code from source code, and a debugger for diagnosing programming problems. To use these tools, the developer obtains the software, documentation, and other materials from an SDK provider, and then the developer installs the software and other tools onto a local computer or network. Later, as the SDK provider makes improvements and upgrades, the developer incorporates such changes into the local installation of the SDK package. Thus, the application developers may have to expend significant resources to install and maintain the SDK. In addition, conventional SDK's typically require significant resources not only for the SDK itself, but also for application development and the infrastructure for the setup, testing, and deployment of the runtime applications.","Individual service providers may want to offer other services that are related to their core services to enhance the overall experience of the customers of the service. For example, if a user seeks out driving directions to a particular destination from one service provider, the driving direction provider may also want to offer the user additional information about the weather or dining options at the particular destination. One way for the driving direction provider to offer such additional information is to create the necessary additional services, which can entail significant additional development resources. Another approach is for the service provider to make arrangements with another service provider to obtain the desired functionality. However, making arrangements with other service providers may involve significant coordination, both in establishing the technical infrastructure to connect the two providers' services and also to establish a means for gauging the level of use by the first provider's customers for billing purposes.","Still another concern with providing services via applications is that the service provider may want to incorporate into the applications durably stored data that is available to the applications when executed. The service provider may then have to incur the burden of establishing and maintaining the stored data so that the data is available when required by the applications.","Based on the foregoing, it is desirable to provide improved techniques for designing applications that more effectively work with all devices. It is also desirable to have improved techniques for creating applications. Further, it is desirable to have improved techniques that allow service providers to offer additional services. Also, it is desirable to have improved techniques for incorporating stored data into an application.","Techniques are provided for customizing content provided by a service. According to one aspect, output provided by a service is customized by an intermediary. In response to a request, data is received at the intermediary from the service. The data includes several output segments, or variations, each of which satisfies the request. A particular output segment is identified based on parameters associated with the request, such as the client device from which the request is sent or network conditions. A reply to the request is generated that includes the particular output segment that is the best match based on the parameters, and the reply is sent in response to the request.","In other aspects, the identification of the particular output segment may be based on satisfying one or more conditions that are included with each output segment by comparing the parameters to the conditions. The identification of the particular output segment may also be based on comparing the parameters to the conditions in a hierarchy of conditions and selecting the particular output segment based on the lowest of the satisfied conditions in the hierarchy of conditions that correspond to the output segments in the output from the service. The parameters and conditions may specify a particular model of client device, a class or type of client device, a capability of client devices (e.g., the ability to display graphics), or environmental conditions associated with providing the requested service, such as the congestion over the network that the reply will be delivered.","A network based operating system for mobile devices is described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","In the following description, the various functions shall be discussed under topic headings that appear in the following order:","I. STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW\n\n","II. DEVELOPING APPLICATIONS ONLINE\n\n","III. GENERATION OF DEVICE-SPECIFIC MARK-UP CODE\n\n","IV. ACCESSING OTHER APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES\n\n","V. HARDWARE OVERVIEW","Techniques are provided for facilitating the creation and deployment of applications that are used to provide services for access by devices such as mobile clients. These techniques include the development of applications that can be executed on a variety of devices by tailoring the output, after it has been generated by the application, based on the particular circumstances of the end user's use of the application, such as the capabilities of a mobile client or the network conditions existing at the time a customer requests service from the application. Also, these techniques include combining the output, capabilities, and features of services together, including techniques for allowing an end user to return to a previously accessed service. In addition, these techniques include storing data at an intermediary for access by the applications associated with a service using variables and a mapping of the variables to the stored data.","Further, these techniques include providing an online software development kit (SDK) so that application developers can create, test, modify, and deploy applications without having any special client-side software. Developers enter code through an interface provided by the website of the SDK over the Internet. Because the website of the SDK is based on XML and HTTP standards, the developer can reuse existing code. For example, if the developer has a Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) server that serves \u201c.asp\u201d pages, the online SDK can access the developer's existing server and pages.","As used herein, the term \u201cend user\u201d denotes any person, organization or other entity that may use a device to access a service or application. The term \u201cend user\u201d encompasses the term \u201ccustomer\u201d although term \u201ccustomer\u201d does not necessarily imply a commercial relationship with a service provider. Also, the term \u201cend user\u201d is distinguished from the term \u201cuser\u201d, which as discussed below, refers to developers and service providers that create and maintain the applications, or computer programs, that provide services to the end users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","100"]},"Host server  may be implemented on one or more servers at an intermediary, such as a hosting service provider, also known as a host provider or simply as a host. The function of the host is to install and maintain applications, such as on host server , that are developed by either the host provider or other application developers. The applications are typically part of a service, such as a web site, a paging service, or a telecommunications service. The host may also provide \u201cpartial\u201d or \u201cshared\u201d hosting of applications in which the applications are stored on servers associated with the application developer or service provider, but the applications may be accessed via the host. Partial or shared hosting of applications is distinguished from portal applications that are stored on servers associated with the application developer or service provider but which are not accessed via the host. End users access the services offered by other parties and companies via the host by interacting with the hosted and partially hosted applications.","Network  also includes users , ,  that are interconnected with host server  and each other on network  as illustrated. In , users , ,  may be service providers that offer services for use by end users. Users , ,  may also be application developers, who may be part of or associated with the service providers. The service providers, application developers, and other parties create and maintain applications that are part of a service offered to end users.","The applications that are part of a service may be hosted by the hosting provider, such as on host server . The applications may also be partially hosted by being stored at a server associated with a user, as illustrated by an application  that is included with user , and being accessed via the hosting provider, such as via host server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1"],"b":["130","132","134","110","140","142","144","130","132","134","100","130","132","134","100","130","110","132","110","134","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["150","130","120","152","134","124","150","152","110","130","120","130","120","110","130","120","110","130","120","110","130","140"]},"As another example, end user  may be a mobile phone that is interacting with host server . End user  may request via host server  a service that is supplied by a shared hosted application, such as application  that is served from user . The host server  then passes along the request for service from end user  to user . User  then executes the appropriate application, such as application , and sends the resulting output to end user  over connection .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["110","110","160","162","110","126"]},"Host server  includes a middleware transformer  for transforming application output into output that is tailored or customized based on parameters or conditions associated with a service request. For example, the capabilities of the client devices used by end users may vary widely. According to one embodiment, the application developer designs the application to produce generic output that includes several output variations, also referred to as output segments, for presenting or displaying the output on the client device. The generic output is received by middleware transformer . The middleware transformer  also receives or detects the parameters or conditions associated with the service request. Middleware transformer  then selects a particular output variation or option based on the parameters or conditions of the service request.","For example, the client, or end user, may be a mobile phone that is requesting driving directions from a map service provider. The mobile phone may not be capable of displaying graphics, and therefore the map service provider need only supply a response to the request that includes text, not graphics, showing the desired route. However, the map service provider may have other customers that use other devices, such as laptop computers, that are capable of displaying graphics in addition to text.","The application used by the map service provider may therefore generate generic output that includes several variations of the requested directions, such as one output segment with text only and one with text and graphics. The application provides the generic output to middleware transformer , which also receives parameters or information from the request, such as data that indicates that the client device is a mobile phone. Middleware transformer  then selects the output segment with text only from the generic output and generates customized output that contains the text only output segment from the application, and then middleware transformer sends the customized output to the end user. In another embodiment, the application produces a comprehensive set of output that is customized or formatted by middleware transformer  based on a style sheet selected based on the client device.","The approach of using a host to receive generic output and generate customized output provides several benefits. For example, the application developer does not have to write different applications, or different output routines, for each specific condition that may merit changes to the output. In fact, the application developer does not even have to be able to test for those conditions. Rather, the application developer may write one application with output variations for each of the special conditions, which may include the specific model of the client device, the type of the client device, and broad or narrow class of the client device, the network conditions, etc. As new devices and capabilities are introduced, the middleware transformer can select the output variation that best matches the capabilities of the new client devices.","As another example, the output segments may depend on conditions that exist at the time of the request, such as network congestion, the time of the request, or the location of the user, which allow the middleware transformer to select an output variation or to format the output by taking into account such conditions. Therefore, the application developer may design the application to provide generic output that includes output segments for each of a variety of conditions and then allow the host to select the particular output that is to be provided to the end user based on the particular conditions for the particular request.","Host server  also includes a service linker  for handling requests from end users for service and forwarding the requests to the appropriate service or application for a response. In addition, service linker  can keep the session (or transaction) of other services active. For example, an end user may be a mobile phone that is communicating with the host. The host provides the end user with a list of service options that may include a map service. When the end user selects the map service using the mobile phone, service linker  receives the request from the end user and forwards the request to the provider of the appropriate service. For example, if the service is supplied using a shared hosted application, the request may be forwarded to a server associated with the map service provider over the World Wide Web. The response to the request from the shared hosted application may be received at the host in the form of generic output that is customized for the mobile phone, such as by using a middleware transformer as discussed above.","In another embodiment, applications incorporate the features and output of other applications. The applications may also be referred to as mobile modules or simply modules. For example, if application  in  provides map directions, the map service provider may also want to include information regarding the weather at the destination location specified by the end user. Instead of developing a separate weather application, the map service provider may link to another hosted or shared hosted application provided by a weather information service provider that is associated with host server . For example, application  may be a weather application or module provided by a different company than the company providing the map service. However, because both companies have modules associated with the host server, both may include links to the other company's modules in the output of each company's application. Based on the links, the middleware transformer may incorporate output from one application into another, or a link may be presented to the end user to allow access to the features of another service.","In addition, because the host server handles the interaction between the two services, the host can track which modules are called by each other to facilitate billing between the services. Furthermore, this tracking feature allows one module to call back to another module without being aware of the identity of the other module. For example, if a first module calls a second module, the tracking feature allows the second module to call back the first. As a result, any service can be used as a module, which may be described as providing a reusable web service to other services.","Host server  also includes a database  to support storage of data at the host by the services for use by the services' applications. Although database  is shown as part of host server , database  may also be supported by another server or other device suitable for providing database functions. Database  may include a data structure for storing data and also a mapping of variables, or identifiers, to specific data, or information items. Services may use database  to durably store and maintain information at the host server, thereby freeing the services of the obligation to support such a database themselves. For example, an application may generate output with an identifier \u201c% xyzlogo\u201d that is identified in the mapping as corresponding to a particular graphical image of the XYZ Company stored in database . As another example, the application's output may include a variable \u201c%date\u201d to denote the current date when the application is accessed in response to a request from an end user. Upon receipt of the output at the middleware transformer, the current date is substituted in the output for the variable %date.","Host server  also includes an online software development kit  that services and application that developers may use to create, edit, test, deploy, and otherwise manage applications or modules associated with the hosting service. According to one embodiment, an application developer uses a browser to log into an online development website associated with the hosting service to access online software development kit . After logging in, online software development kit  provides a user interface for display on the developer's web browser. The user interface presents the user with various options, such as creating a new application, modifying an existing application, testing an application, or deleting an existing application. For example, to create a hosted application, the developer enters or modifies program code using the user interface via the developer's browser and then saves the code at host server  under a module or application name, or identifier. If the developer wishes to establish a shared hosted application, the developer logs into the online development website and provides a URL of the application. The hosted and shared hosted applications may then be made immediately available for use. For example, end users may log into the service provider via a website to access a list of available services.","According to one embodiment, a developer uses a browser running on a client to log on to a website through which the developer can access the tools necessary to develop an application without any special client-side SDK software. The website may be referred to as a development website, or as an \u201cSDK website\u201d when, for example, the website provides, or hosts, an online software development kit (SDK).","As used herein, a \u201cdeveloper\u201d is synonymous with both a \u201cservice provider\u201d and a \u201cuser\u201d (since the developer makes use of the online development website). Also, a \u201cuser\u201d is distinguished from an end-user or a customer that uses the service provided by the developer.","The provider of the application development tools and host of the online development website may be referred to as the development provider, SDK provider, or simply as the host. The development provider typically uses one or more servers to support the development website and the tools provided thereby.","Access to the development website may be controlled by requiring the user to have a name and password. After the user has gained access to the website, the user may be presented with a list of mobile applications (also referred to herein as services), that the developer or user has previously created. The user may also have access to other services, such as samples provided by the development website provider. The development website may present the user with several options, such as to add a new service, modify an existing service, or delete an existing service. For example, if the user selects the \u201cadd service\u201d option, the user is presented with a user interface that allows the user to add a service.","According to one embodiment, a service may be either a hosted application or a portal application. A hosted application is an application whose code is maintained at the development website, also referred to as the host website. A portal application is an application whose code is maintained at another website associated with the portal application developer and may typically be accessed by customers or end users via the developer's website. However, according to another embodiment, a portal application may also be accessed or served to clients through the development website, in which case the portal application may be referred to as a \u201cshared hosted application\u201d or a \u201cpartially hosted application.\u201d","The deployment of a hosted application may involve several steps, such as initially creating the application, subsequently editing of the application, and testing of the application. In one embodiment, to create a hosted application, the development website provides the developer or user with an interface for writing and editing code for the application. The interface may include an editing window or edit field that the user may use to type in the code for the application. Similarly, to edit an existing application, the user is presented with an interface that displays the existing application code to the user in an editing window that allows the user to edit the code of the selected application.","Application code can be written in an appropriate mark-up language (ML), such as the extensible markup language (XML). According to one embodiment, the code is written in a mark-up language referred to herein as \u201cportal-to-go XML\u201d. \u201cPortal-to-go\u201d and \u201cPortal-to-go XML\u201d may also be referred to as Oracle9iASWireless and Oracle9iASWireless XML (or just IASWireless XML), respectively.","Portal-to-go XML consists of a set of XML tags that may be used to indicate boundaries between alternate output segments. Each output segment in a set of output segments may be specifically designed for certain devices, such as mobile devices that typically have small screens, and others with voice capabilities.","Portal-to-go XML can be generated by any of the traditional means of generating dynamic HTML, such as JavaServer Pages, CGI, or Active Server Pages, such that instead of generating HTML, the code or script generates Portal-to-Go XML. The details of such a markup language such as Portal-to-go XML may be defined in a Document Type Definition (DTD). For example, a DTD of portal-to-go XML as implemented in one embodiment is described in U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60\/230,489, filed Sep. 6, 2000.","Accorded to another embodiment, both the application code for a hosted application and the code that causes the generation of the user interface used to enter and edit the code are stored on one or more servers associated with the development provider. Consequently, the only client-side software required to develop and deploy a mobile application is a web browser, such as Netscape Navigator.","When the user finishes inputting the code for a new application or editing the code for an existing application, the user can save the code shown in the interface. The \u201csave\u201d code function may be an object, such as a button, included in the interface. By clicking on the object, the code is submitted, or sent, to a server remote from the client, such as a server associated with the development provider. If a new application is being created, the user specifies a service name and the code is saved in association with the service name. After saving the new code, the new service name will be displayed in a list of existing services shown when users and end users log into the development website. If an existing application is being modified, the user may choose to save the code under the existing service name or under a new service name.","To test the application, the user can access the application or service via the development website using a mobile device or a mobile device simulator. This is discussed in more detail below under \u201cAccessing the New Application or Service.\u201d The hosted application that is deployed via the development website is immediately available to the user for testing and to end users for use via the host website.","In another embodiment, to create a shared hosted application, the user writes either a portal-to-go XML document or an application program that generates a portal-to-go XML document as output. The terms \u201cpartially hosted application\u201d or the \u201cshared hosted application\u201d may be used to refer either to the XML document or the application that generates an XML document as output. The shared hosted application may be saved, for example, at the application developer's own website. The user then associates a URL with the shared hosted application using, for example, an HTTP listener\/web server that services the application developer's web site. The shared hosted application is then added as a \u201cservice\u201d by logging into the development website, or the SDK website, and providing the name of the service and the URL associated with the shared hosted application.","As soon as a service has been created and\/or revised, end users or customers that can connect to the network on which the server resides (e.g., the Internet) can access the service. The process by which the service is accessed may vary based on the type of end user. For example, a desktop computer can connect to the Internet through a dial-up line, a DSL connection, a cable modem, an ISDN connection or many other available methods. WAP phones may connect to the Internet over a wireless connection using a synchronous protocol, such as through a WAP-to-HTTP gateway, or using an asynchronous protocol, such as the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) or the short message service (SMS) protocol.","In general, the end user logs in to the development website and is presented with a list of available services. The end user may select the service that was just created and\/or modified. In response to the selection of a service, the application associated with the service is obtained. The application may be associated with a portal-to-go XML document or another document written in a suitable markup language. For example, with hosted applications, the XML may be obtained by retrieving the portal-to-go XML that was saved at a server associated with the intermediary (e.g., the host). For portal applications, a request may be sent to the URL that was specified by the developer for the service. The web server that manages that URL may invoke the portal application and send the portal-to-go XML associated with the portal application back to the server associated with the intermediary. Once the portal-to-go XML for the service is obtained for either a hosted or portal application, the server associated with the intermediary uses the portal-to-go XML to provide the selected service to the client associated with the end user.","According to one embodiment, the mark-up language output, such as portal-to-go XML, is produced by a service without regard to the type of client device that is invoking the service. According to one embodiment, prior to providing the output to a client, one or more extensible stylesheet language (XSL) style sheets are selected based on the device type of the client. XSL style sheets are discussed in more detail in U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/631,884, filed Aug. 4, 2000, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","The selected style sheets are applied to the XML output from the service to produce customized output that is specifically formatted for the client that requested the service. For example, the same XML output by a mobile application may ultimately be manifested in the following three ways, depending on the type of client that requested the service: (1) a list of options on the display of a mobile phone, (2) a pull-down menu on a browser, and (3) an orally presented list of options on the voice interface of a telephone. The application developer achieves any-device support without having to do any special programming because the applications are designed to produce the same XML output regardless of the device used to request the service and since the device-specific formatting takes place outside the applications, such as by an intermediary applying device-specific XSL style sheets.","Further, because the execution of the code and the application of XSL style sheets to the output thereof occur via the host, all hosted and portal applications automatically gain device-specific support for new devices whenever the host installs XSL style sheets for the new devices. The application developer need not make any changes to the application code to support any additional or newly developed client devices. Of course, if the developer wants to take advantage of improved or added capabilities, the developer may update the application to provide addition output segments or variations for such capabilities.","Another problem with providing services via applications is that the applications function the same regardless of the specific circumstances existing at the time when the applications are used. For example, it may be desirable to modify the application's output based on the congestion of the network at the time a user accesses the application. If the network is heavily congested, it may be better to limit the amount of detail provided in the output being provided during such times of heavy congestion. Again, the application programmer can take the lowest common denominator approach and design the application for the worst-case conditions. However, this approach fails to take advantage of improved conditions when they exist at other times. If the programmer selects a higher level of detail, then the ability of the application to deliver output to the client device will suffer during periods of heavy network congestion.","Techniques are provided for producing output that takes into account conditions, parameters, and characteristics associated with a service request (which are also referred to as \u201crequest-conditions\u201d). Request-conditions may include, for example, information about the type of client that is requesting the service, such as a device type, or environmental conditions, such as the time at which the service request is made or responded to, or the congestion on the network over which the service is requested or supplied.","According to one embodiment, an application program continues to generate the same output regardless of the request-conditions. Because the output of the application is the same regardless of request-conditions, it is referred to herein as \u201ccondition-independent output\u201d.","According to another embodiment, the condition-independent output produced by an application contains \u201chints\u201d (or criteria, conditions or other guidance) as to how the output should be processed under certain request-conditions. A middleware transformer is provided that receives the condition-independent output and uses the hints contained therein, along with knowledge of the client and request-conditions, to transform the condition-independent output into \u201ccondition-specific output,\u201d which may also be referred to as \u201ccondition-dependent output.\u201d The condition-specific output is then provided to the client that requested the service that produced the output. The middleware transformer typically is associated with the host and may be provided by a server associated with a host, but the middleware transformer is not limited to implementations associated with the host.","According to one embodiment, application programmers design applications to generate output that contains \u201chints\u201d about how the output should be transformed based on request-conditions. According to one implementation, the application programmer designs the application to generate output that designates several variations of the output that satisfies a request to the application that resulted in the generation of the output. The variations of the output may also be referred to as alternative output segments.","The output from the application also includes one or more particular criteria or conditions that are associated with each of the alternative output segments. A middleware transformer is used to select the alternative output segment that best matches the request conditions to the criteria or conditions that are associated with each alternative output segment. A match may be determined based on whether the condition or conditions associated with a particular alternative output segment are satisfied or not satisfied (or whether the conditions are true or false).","For example, if the application output is in the form of a mark-up language, such as XML, the output may include a section of code that has the form:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0105"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<section>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<condition 1>"]},{"entry":[{},"Use this when Condition 1 is true"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/condition 1>"]},{"entry":[{},"<condition 2>"]},{"entry":[{},"Use this when Condition 2 is true and"]},{"entry":[{},"Condition 3 is not true"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<condition 3>"]},{"entry":[{},"use this when Condition 3 is true"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/condition 3>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<\/condition 2>"]},{"entry":[{},"Use this for Every Other Condition"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<\/section>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The application generates the output above without regard to the request-conditions that will exist at the time a request for a service is made by an end-user.

For example, if the alternative output segments are associated with different types of client devices, the middleware transformer determines the device type of the client to which the output is to be sent. Based on the applicable request-condition(s), the middleware transformer selects the output segment that most specifically matches the request-condition(s).","According to one embodiment, when the middleware transformer receives output that includes alternative output segments, the middleware transformer selects the output segment that most specifically matches the request-conditions via the process outlined in the flowchart of .

For example, if the device making the service request is a pager, then the condition associated with pager node  would be true, but the condition associated with phone node , as well as the other child nodes of \u201call devices\u201d node , would not be true. Conversely, if the device was a phone, then the condition associated with phone node  would be true and the remaining conditions associated with the remaining childe nodes of \u201call devices\u201d node  would not be true.","If a condition associated with a child of the current node is true, then step  sets that child node as the new current node and the process loops back to step . For example, if the current node is \u201call devices\u201d node  and the device is a pager, then the condition associated with pager node  is true. According to step , pager node  is set as the current node and the process returns to step .","If no condition associated with any child of the current node is true, then step  selects the output segment associated with the current node.

The lack of an exact match may be due to a number of reasons, such as that device-specific output is not required and\/or desired. The lack of an exact match may also be due to the device being new and thus the developer did not know of the new device and the capabilities of the new device when designing the application. Yet the new device can still receive output that is suitable for a phone in the example above instead of default output or output that is for another class of device, such as desktop computers.","The foregoing example is merely one technique that may be used by the middleware transformer to select the output segment that most specifically matches the request-conditions. Various alternative techniques may be used. For example, in one alternative technique, each tag may be assigned a number that corresponds to the level within the condition hierarchy of its corresponding node. Thus, <WML> could be assigned 3 and <phone> could be assigned 2.  The appropriate output segment of a set of alternative output segments may then be chosen by (1) identifying, within the condition-independent output, the tags that correspond to true conditions, and (2) selecting, from among those tags, the tag that has been assigned the highest value.","In the foregoing description, the request-condition used to select the appropriate output segment is the device type of the client to which the output is to be supplied. However, the request-condition used to select between alternative output segments may vary from implementation to implementation. For example, in one implementation, the alternative output segments in a set may each be associated with a different congestion level of the network. In another implementation, the alternative output segments in a set may each be associated with a different class of end-user. In yet other implementations, the alternative output segments may be associated with combinations of factors. For example, a particular output segment may be specified for use when (1) a particular class of user is using (2) a particular type of client device, and (3) has a connection that supports a particular transfer rate.","Further, the foregoing description gives examples in which the output is in the form of a mark-up language, such as XML. However, the nature of the output may vary from implementation to implementation. The techniques described herein may be used with any form of condition-independent output that includes (1) alternative output segments, and (2) some form of hints that may be used to select between the alternative output segments based on request-conditions.","Use of the <WML> tag in the example above illustrates a situation in which the request condition used to select an alternative output segment relates to the markup or programming language supported by the client device to which the output is to be sent. According to one embodiment, an alternative output segment associated with a \u201csupported-programming-language\u201d request condition may include, partially or entirely, code written in the supported programming language.","For example, the output segment placed between the <WML> and <\/WML> tags may consist entirely of WML code. Consequently, when the client device supports the WML language, the output sent to the client is in the WML language. While the WML language is used in this example, the technique may be used for any programming language, including but not limited to \u201cC++\u201d, HTML, Visual Basic, or Java.","Numerous benefits are realized by using a middleware transformer hosted by the middleware host to transform the condition-independent output prior to supplying the output to a client. For example, through this technique, the mobile application enjoys every-device support by virtue of the middleware host providing device-specific format and protocol transformations for new devices as the new devices are developed. Further, when the mobile application uses the alternative output segment techniques described above, the mobile application developer is able to provide users with output in which the content is based on conditions associated with the request, without designing applications that are able to detect those conditions.","In one embodiment, the content of the output received by a client may be tailored to the device type of the client without the mobile application being aware of the device type of the client to which the output is sent. For example, the client device may be a pager. By using an XSL style sheet as discussed above to transform the application output, such as output in portal-to-go XML, the middleware transformer can generate device-specific formatting for the pager.","Furthermore, the content of the output received by a client may be automatically tailored to new types of clients, based on the categories to which those new clients have been assigned, without the application developer even being aware of the new types of clients. For example, when a new type of WAP phone is developed, the middleware host will classify the new WAP phone at the appropriate location in the condition hierarchy. Consequently, the new WAP phone will automatically receive those alternative output segments associated with WAP phones, if any are specified in the output from the service application.","If a particular set of alternative output segments does not have an output segment associated with WAP phones, but does have an output segment associated with mobile phones, then the new phone will automatically receive the alternative output segment associated with mobile phones. In this manner, the content of the output delivered to new devices is device-specific, with the level of specificity determined by the application developer, even for newly developed devices that the application developer knows nothing about when creating the application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0174"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["410","420","420","410","430","410","420","432","430","432","430","432","410","440"]},"Service provider  includes an HTTP server  for handling communications between service provider  and other servers, such as service linker  or servers linked together as part of the Internet.

For example, output  may be a prompt for the end user to supply the name of a city for which a listing of restaurants is desired.","Service provider  also includes a database .

This feature allows the designer of one mobile module to take advantage of the functionality of all other mobile modules that may be available on the intermediary (e.g., the host). This feature also allows the transaction with the previous service to be kept active, as well as allowing the services to be used without having to know who is using the services.","Also, this feature is different from linking of objects among web pages where the browser running on a client.

The information may be used as the basis for business relationships between mobile module designers. For example, the designer of a calling module may negotiate to pay the designer of a called module a certain amount of money every time the calling module invokes the called module. The party providing the intermediary (e.g., hosting services) records the inter-module calls and provides them to the various module owners.","The tracking and management of the business relationships among application providers, or module owners, are not easily implemented outside the hosting framework described herein.

The called module need not have any information or knowledge about the identity of the calling module. Instead, the called module need only identify the \u201cpreviously\u201d accessed service (i.e., the previously used mobile module) and the intermediary will then identify the previously accessed service based on the stack information.","In response to selection of the \u201cdone\u201d option, a message is sent to the host to cause the host to perform the action specified on the top of the information stack. In the above example, the action specified at the top of the information stack is the callback information that was placed there at the time the called module was called. Typically, the callback information will cause the calling module to be invoked once again, and content or output from the called module will be delivered to the end user. From the perspective of the end user, it appears as if the end user is returning to calling module when the end user is done with the called module.","According to one embodiment, data may be stored at an intermediary for use by services that are accessed through the intermediary, and when the applications or mobile modules for the service are executed, the intermediary includes the stored data in the application output in place of variables in the output based on a mapping of those variables to the stored data. The intermediary, which may be a host, stores both the data, or values or information items, and a mapping between the information items and the variables, or identifiers. A service may store or update data for an existing variable or store data for a new variable to be added to the mapping.","The content or output generated by a mobile module may include one or more of the identifiers. In response to encountering output that refers to one of the identifiers, the intermediary supplies the corresponding information item before providing the output to the client requesting the output.","For example, for a particular session, the host may store the data item \u201cMike\u201d mapped to the identifier \u201cname\u201d.

An input device , including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus  for communicating information and command selections to processor . Another type of user input device is cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor  and for controlling cursor movement on display . This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.","The invention is related to the use of computer system  for implementing the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those techniques are performed by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions may be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory  causes processor  to perform the process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device . Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.","Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punchcards, papertape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor  for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system  can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus . Bus  carries the data to main memory , from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory  may optionally be stored on storage device  either before or after execution by processor .","Computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . Communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  that is connected to a local network . For example, communication interface  may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.","Network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) . ISP  in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d . Local network  and Internet  both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link  and through communication interface , which carry the digital data to and from computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information.","Computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link  and communication interface . In the Internet example, a server  might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet , ISP , local network  and communication interface .","The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, and\/or stored in storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof.
