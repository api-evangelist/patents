{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["A variety of business contact information services exist to provide potential business customers the contact information of a particular business entity. For example, a potential customer may look up the telephone number of the particular business entity in a phone book (e.g. the Yellow Pages), or by calling national 4-1-1 to make an inquiry. Global positioning system (GPS) devices have also come about. For example, nearly all new cell phones sold in America have some GPS receiving capability built in.","The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and\/or detailed. As such, a detailed discussion of reference number  would be found and\/or introduced in . Reference number  is introduced in , etc.","This disclosure details the implementation of methods, systems and computer program products for a remote business contact identifier (hereinafter, \u201cRBCI\u201d). RBCI systems implement a live application whereby users may obtain business and contact information of one (or more) target business entity and be automatically connected to the target business entity via a communication network by submitting indicative information of the target business to the RBCI service provider. For example, in some embodiments, the indicative information of the target business may be rich media files, such as, but not limited to images, video and\/or audio clips, and\/or the like.","For example, in one embodiment, as will be further illustrated in , in order to get contact information of a target business entity, a user may point his\/her mobile device which has a built-in camera on a target business, and take a picture of the target business entity (e.g. the store front, sign, billboard etc) which may have a \u201cRBCI\u201d label on it to indicate it is enabled for RBCI service. By way of example only, the target business entity may include, but not limited to a store front, a sign, a billboard, an advertisement on media publication, a logo on company vehicles, and\/or the like. The user may then send the picture to a RBCI service provider, and may be provided the contact information (e.g. the phone number, etc.) of the target business through his\/her mobile device and an option to dial the number of the target business. For example, in one implementation, if the user submits a picture taken at the front door of a restaurant, the RBCI system may provide the phone number of the exact restaurant to the user. In another implementation, if the original target business entity is a logo from a magazine, advertisement, vehicle, and\/or the like the RBCI system may then provide the user the contact information (e.g. phone number and street address, etc.) of at least one store associated with the logo, such as a location closest to the user at his\/her instant location.","In one embodiment, a method is disclosed, comprising: receiving rich media related to at least one business entity from a user mobile device; determining user location information based on the received data from the user mobile device; extracting recognition information of the at least one business entity from the received rich media; forming a query based on the extracted recognition information of the at least one business entity within a radius surrounding the determined user location in a business database; retrieving contact information related to the at least one business entity from the business database based on the query; and providing the retrieved contact information related to the identified at least one business entity to the user mobile device.","It is to be understood that, depending on the particular needs and\/or characteristics of a RBCI user, administrator, server, data payload, monetization model, hardware configuration, network framework, and\/or the like, various embodiments of the RBCI may be implemented that enable a great deal of flexibility and customization. The instant disclosure discusses embodiments of the RBCI primarily within the context of wireless cellular communications. However, it is to be understood that the system described herein may be readily configured\/customized for a wide range of other applications or implementations. For example, aspects of the RBCI may be adapted for wired telephony services, computer-based communications, and\/or the like applications. It is to be understood that the RBCI may be further adapted to other implementations or communications and\/or data transmission applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 3A-3C"],"b":["108","101","105","105","106","101","100","108","102","101","100","100","100","104","108","100","103","108","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["110","120","119","140","105","113","110","110","105","120","113","120","110","110","130","120","113","120","113"]},"In one implementation, the RBCI server  may submit the received indicative information of one or more target businesses together with its GPS location information to a RBCI database . In some embodiments, a RBCI server  may be integrated with a local RBCI database . In another embodiment, a RBCI server  may access a remote RBCI database  via the communication network . The RBCI server  and the RBCI database  may then exchange search information to identify the target business. For example, in one embodiment, the RBCI database may provide a list of businesses within a location range of the submitted GPS location information to the RBCI server . The RBCI server  may compare the indicative information of the target business with the stored business information, and then return indications to the RBCI database  to indicate whether the target business is identified, and to determine whether to enlarge the location range if target not identified.","At some point when the search process is finished, the RBCI server  may send the identified business and contact information to the user  via the communication network . In one implementation, the information returned to the user  may include a pick list of businesses within a location range. The user may then submit a selection and\/or a \u201cdirect connect\u201d request to the RBCI server . The RBCI server  may then coordinate with the communication network  to establish a connection between the user  and the target business entity . For example, in one embodiment, the RBCI server  may send an indication and the number of the business entity to a cellular base station wherein the user  is located, and the base station may then schedule a call between the mobile device of the user  and the target business entity  with a telephone switch.","A system administrator  may communicate with the RBCI server  and the RBCI database  for regular maintenance, service failure, system updates, database renewal, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the system administrator  may directly operate with the RBCI server  and the RBCI database  on an in-house basis. In another embodiment, the system administrator  may remotely access the RBCI server  and the RBCI database  and perform its functionality via the communication network . In one implementation, the system administrator  may receive reports of service failure from the RBCI server  if the RBCI server fails to identify the target business requested by a user. In that case, the system administrator  may conduct a manual search and resort to third party resources, e.g. yellowbook.com, GPS database, and\/or the like. The system administrator  may then return the result to the RBCI server  and update the RBCI database  accordingly. In another implementation, the system administrator  may serve as a call center representative. If the user determines to call the RBCI service provider, he\/she may choose to talk to the system administrator  to identify the target business.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","205"]},"In one embodiment, the RBCI controller  may be housed separately from other modules and\/or databases within the RBCI, while in another embodiment, some or all of the other modules and\/or databases may be housed within and\/or configured as part of the RBCI controller. Further detail regarding implementations of RBCI controller operation, modules, and databases is provided below.","In the implementation illustrated in , the RBCI controller  may be configured to couple to external entities via a communications interface . The communications interface may, for example, configure indicative information received from a user via a communication network, and receipt and\/or transmission of data to an external and\/or network database. In various implementations, a communications interface  may, for example, serve to configure data into application, transport, network, data link, and\/or physical layer formats in accordance with a TCP\/IP communications model. The communications interface  may further be configurable to implement and\/or translate Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP), and\/or the like data formats and\/or protocols. The communications interface  may further house one or more ports, jacks, antennas, and\/or the like to facilitate wired and\/or wireless communications with and\/or within the RBCI system.","In one implementation, the RBCI controller  may further be coupled to a plurality of modules configured to implement RBCI functionality and\/or services. An identification module  may, in one implementation, be configurable to receive and\/or process indicative information of one (or more) target business entities sent by one or more users. For example, in some embodiments, the identification module  may receive indicative information of one (or more) target business entities together with GPS information of the sender (user). The identification module  may, in one implementation, be further configurable to communicate with business database  to initiate an identification process. For example, the identification module  may send the indicative information of target business to the business database  to compare it with the stored business information within a location range of the user. In some embodiments, GPS information of the user may not be submitted to the RBCI system . For example, the user mobile device may not be equipped with a built-in GPS receiver, or the GPS service is temporarily unavailable at the time the service request is submitted, and the user may not submit his\/her location information manually (e.g. in a text message). In such cases, a location information extraction module  may, in one implementation, be configurable to receive and\/or process data signals pertaining to determining the location of the sender. The location information extraction module  may, for example, in some embodiments, analyze the information embedded in the received data signals from the user, reconstruct the location information of the user, and provide the result to the RBCI controller . For example, as will be further illustrated in , in one embodiment, the location information extraction module  may employ technologies such as, but not limited to GPS localization, cell tower triangulation, Wi-Fi Positioning System (WPS), and\/or the like.","In one implementation, the RBCI controller  may further be coupled to one or more databases configured to store and\/or maintain RBCI data. A users database  may contain information pertaining to callers and\/or call recipients, contact information, profile information, identities of hardware devices, Customer Premise Equipments (CPEs), and\/or the like associated with users, service preferences, service history, system settings, and\/or the like. A hardware database  may contain information pertaining to hardware devices with which the RBCI system may communicate, such as but not limited to voicemail servers, user telephony devices, CPEs, gateways, routers, and\/or the like. The hardware database  may specify transmission protocols, data formats, and\/or the like suitable for communicating with hardware devices employed by any of a variety of RBCI affiliated entities. A business database  may contain data pertaining to business entities recorded previously and\/or updated by the system administrator, which includes information such as, but not limited to the name of a business, the address of a business, the contact information, the URL address on the World Wide Web (WWW), and\/or the like.","The RBCI database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like.

If the RBCI system is not busy, the system may receive and process the data submitted by the user  which includes at least indicative information of one (or more) target business entity. The RBCI system may then decide whether location information of the user is specified  in the submitted data. For example, as discussed above, in one implementation, the street address may be specified by the user in a text message, but in another implementation, the submitted data may only include rich media with metadata without specified street address, or even no indication of location is submitted by the user. If location information is not available at step , the RBCI system may perform an extra procedure to extract location information  of the user, as will be illustrated in .","The RBCI system may then identify the target business based on the received indicative information and the location information , as will be illustrated in .

In turn, computers employ processors to process information; such processors are often referred to as central processing units (CPUs). A common form of processor is referred to as a microprocessor. CPUs use communicative signals to enable various operations. Such communicative signals may be stored and\/or transmitted in batches as program and\/or data components facilitate desired operations. These stored instruction code signals may engage the CPU circuit components to perform desired operations. A common type of program is a computer operating system, which, commonly, is executed by CPU on a computer; the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer information technology and resources. Common resources employed in information technology systems include: input and output mechanisms through which data may pass into and out of a computer; memory storage into which data may be saved; and processors by which information may be processed. Often information technology systems are used to collect data for later retrieval, analysis, and manipulation, commonly, which is facilitated through a database program. Information technology systems provide interfaces that allow users to access and operate various system components.","In one embodiment, the RBCI controller  may be connected to and\/or communicate with entities such as, but not limited to: one or more users from user input devices ; peripheral devices ; a cryptographic processor device ; and\/or a communications network .","Networks are commonly thought to comprise the interconnection and interoperation of clients, servers, and intermediary nodes in a graph topology. It should be noted that the term \u201cserver\u201d as used throughout this disclosure refers generally to a computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that processes and responds to the requests of remote users across a communications network. Servers serve their information to requesting \u201cclients.\u201d The term \u201cclient\u201d as used herein refers generally to a computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that facilitates, processes information and requests, and\/or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly referred to as a \u201cnode.\u201d Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of information from a source to a destination is commonly called a \u201crouter.\u201d There are many forms of networks such as Local Area Networks (LANs), Pico networks, Wide Area Networks (WANs), Wireless Networks (WLANs), etc. For example, the Internet is generally accepted as being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may access and interoperate with one another.","The RBCI controller  may be based on common computer systems that may comprise, but are not limited to, components such as: a computer systemization  connected to memory .","Computer Systemization","A computer systemization  may comprise a clock , central processing unit (CPU) , a read only memory (ROM) , a random access memory (RAM) , and\/or an interface bus , and most frequently, although not necessarily, the foregoing are all interconnected and\/or communicating through a system bus . Optionally, the computer systemization may be connected to an internal power source . Optionally, a cryptographic processor  and\/or a global positioning system (GPS) component  may be connected to the system bus. The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and provides a base signal. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of signals embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative signals may further be transmitted, received, and the cause of return and\/or reply signal communications beyond the instant computer systemization to: communications networks, input devices, other computer systemizations, peripheral devices, and\/or the like. Of course, any of the above components may be connected directly to one another, connected to the CPU, and\/or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.","The CPU comprises at least one high-speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and\/or system-generated requests. The CPU may be a microprocessor such as AMD's Athlon, Duron and\/or Opteron; IBM and\/or Motorola's PowerPC; IBM's and Sony's Cell processor; Intel's Celeron, Itanium, Pentium, Xeon, and\/or XScale; and\/or the like processor(s). The CPU interacts with memory through signal passing through conductive conduits to execute stored signal program code according to conventional data processing techniques. Such signal passing facilitates communication within the RBCI controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount of speed, parallel, mainframe and\/or super-computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively, should deployment requirements dictate greater portability, smaller Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) may be employed.","Power Source","The power source  may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells: alkaline, lithium hydride, lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel cadmium, solar cells, and\/or the like. Other types of AC or DC power sources may be used as well. In the case of solar cells, in one embodiment, the case provides an aperture through which the solar cell may capture photonic energy. The power cell  is connected to at least one of the interconnected subsequent components of the RBCI thereby providing an electric current to all subsequent components. In one example, the power source  is connected to the system bus component . In an alternative embodiment, an outside power source  is provided through a connection across the I\/O  interface. For example, a USB and\/or IEEE 1394 connection carries both data and power across the connection and is therefore a suitable source of power.","Interface Adapters","Interface bus(es)  may accept, connect, and\/or communicate to a number of interface adapters, conventionally although not necessarily in the form of adapter cards, such as, but not limited to: input output interfaces (I\/O) , storage interfaces , network interfaces , and\/or the like. Optionally, cryptographic processor interfaces  similarly may be connected to the interface bus. The interface bus provides for the communications of interface adapters with one another as well as with other components of the computer systemization. Interface adapters are adapted for a compatible interface bus. Interface adapters conventionally connect to the interface bus via a slot architecture. Conventional slot architectures may be employed, such as, but not limited to: Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), Card Bus, (Extended) Industry Standard Architecture ((E)ISA), Micro Channel Architecture (MCA), NuBus, Peripheral Component Interconnect (Extended) (PCI(X)), PCI Express, Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA), and\/or the like.","Storage interfaces  may accept, communicate, and\/or connect to a number of storage devices such as, but not limited to: storage devices , removable disc devices, and\/or the like. Storage interfaces may employ connection protocols such as, but not limited to: (Ultra) (Serial) Advanced Technology Attachment (Packet Interface) ((Ultra) (Serial) ATA(PI)), (Enhanced) Integrated Drive Electronics ((E)IDE), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1394, fiber channel, Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI), Universal Serial Bus (USB), and\/or the like.","Network interfaces  may accept, communicate, and\/or connect to a communications network . Through a communications network , the RBCI controller is accessible through remote clients (e.g., computers with web browsers) by users .

A communications network may be any one and\/or the combination of the following: a direct interconnection; the Internet; a Local Area Network (LAN); a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN); an Operating Missions as Nodes on the Internet (OMNI); a secured custom connection; a Wide Area Network (WAN); a wireless network (e.g., employing protocols such as, but not limited to a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), I-mode, and\/or the like); and\/or the like. A network interface may be regarded as a specialized form of an input output interface. Further, multiple network interfaces  may be used to engage with various communications network types . For example, multiple network interfaces may be employed to allow for the communication over broadcast, multicast, and\/or unicast networks.","Input Output interfaces (I\/O)  may accept, communicate, and\/or connect to user input devices , peripheral devices , cryptographic processor devices , and\/or the like. I\/O may employ connection protocols such as, but not limited to: Apple Desktop Bus (ADB); Apple Desktop Connector (ADC); audio: analog, digital, monaural, RCA, stereo, and\/or the like; IEEE 1394a-b; infrared; joystick; keyboard; midi; optical; PC AT; PS\/2; parallel; radio; serial; USB; video interface: BNC, coaxial, composite, digital, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), RCA, RF antennae, S-Video, VGA, and\/or the like; wireless; and\/or the like. A common output device is a television set, which accepts signals from a video interface. Also, a video display, which typically comprises a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) or Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) based monitor with an interface (e.g., DVI circuitry and cable) that accepts signals from a video interface, may be used. The video interface composites information generated by a computer systemization and generates video signals based on the composited information in a video memory frame. Typically, the video interface provides the composited video information through a video connection interface that accepts a video display interface (e.g., an RCA composite video connector accepting an RCA composite video cable; a DVI connector accepting a DVI display cable, etc.).","User input devices  may be card readers, dongles, finger print readers, gloves, graphics tablets, joysticks, keyboards, mouse (mice), remote controls, retina readers, trackballs, trackpads, and\/or the like.","Peripheral devices  may be connected and\/or communicate to I\/O and\/or other facilities of the like such as network interfaces, storage interfaces, and\/or the like. Peripheral devices may be audio devices, cameras, dongles (e.g., for copy protection, ensuring secure transactions with a digital signature, and\/or the like), external processors (for added functionality), goggles, microphones, monitors, network interfaces, printers, scanners, storage devices, video devices, video sources, visors, and\/or the like.","It should be noted that although user input devices and peripheral devices may be employed, the RBCI controller may be embodied as an embedded, dedicated, and\/or monitor-less (i.e., headless) device, wherein access would be provided over a network interface connection.","Cryptographic units such as, but not limited to, microcontrollers, processors , interfaces , and\/or devices  may be attached, and\/or communicate with the RBCI controller. A MC68HC16 microcontroller, commonly manufactured by Motorola Inc., may be used for and\/or within cryptographic units. Equivalent microcontrollers and\/or processors may also be used. The MC68HC16 microcontroller utilizes a 16-bit multiply-and-accumulate instruction in the 16 MHz configuration and requires less than one second to perform a 512-bit RSA private key operation. Cryptographic units support the authentication of communications from interacting agents, as well as allow for anonymous transactions. Cryptographic units may also be configured as part of CPU. Other commercially available specialized cryptographic processors include VLSI Technology's 33 MHz 6868 or Semaphore Communications' 40 MHz Roadrunner .","Memory","Generally, any mechanization and\/or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and\/or retrieval of information is regarded as memory . However, memory is a fungible technology and resource; thus, any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the RBCI controller and\/or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example, a computer systemization may be configured wherein the functionality of on-chip CPU memory (e.g., registers), RAM, ROM, and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism; of course, such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration, memory  will include ROM , RAM , and a storage device . A storage device  may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum; a (fixed and\/or removable) magnetic disk drive; a magneto-optical drive; an optical drive (i.e., CD ROM\/RAM\/Recordable (R), ReWritable (RW), DVD R\/RW, etc.); an array of devices (e.g., Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)); and\/or other devices of the like. Thus, a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.","Component Collection","The memory  may contain a collection of program and\/or database components and\/or data such as, but not limited to: operating system component(s)  (operating system); information server component(s)  (information server); user interface component(s)  (user interface); Web browser component(s)  (Web browser); database(s) ; mail server component(s) ; mail client component(s) ; cryptographic server component(s)  (cryptographic server); the RBCI component(s) ; and\/or the like (i.e., collectively a component collection). These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and\/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are stored in a local storage device , they may also be loaded and\/or stored in memory such as: peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM, various forms of memory, and\/or the like.","Operating System","The operating system component  is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the RBCI controller. Typically, the operating system facilitates access of I\/O, network interfaces, peripheral devices, storage devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant, scalable, and secure system such as: Apple Macintosh OS X (Server); AT&T Plan 9; Be OS; Unix and Unix and Unix-like system distributions (such as AT&T's UNIX; Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) variations such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and\/or the like; Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Ubuntu, and\/or the like); and\/or the like operating systems. However, more limited and\/or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple Macintosh OS, IBM OS\/2, Microsoft DOS, Microsoft Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/Vista\/XP (Server), Palm OS, and\/or the like. An operating system may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or the like. Most frequently, the operating system communicates with other program components, user interfaces, and\/or the like. For example, the operating system may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. The operating system, once executed by the CPU, may enable the interaction with communications networks, data, I\/O, peripheral devices, program components, memory, user input devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the RBCI controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the RBCI controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction, such as, but not limited to: multicast, TCP\/IP, UDP, unicast, and\/or the like.","Information Server","An information server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as, but not limited to Apache Software Foundation's Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server, and\/or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page (ASP), ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, Java, JavaScript, Practical Extraction Report Language (PERL), Hypertext Pre-Processor (PHP), pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the RBCI controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port , and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the RBCI database , operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and\/or the like.","Access to the RBCI database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the RBCI. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the RBCI as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","User Interface","The function of computer interfaces in some respects is similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, functionality, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, functionality, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua, IBM's OS\/2, Microsoft's Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/Vista (i.e., Aero)\/XP, or Unix's X-Windows (e.g., which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment (KDE), mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME)), provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.","A user interface component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The user interface may be a conventional graphic user interface as provided by, with, and\/or atop operating systems and\/or operating environments such as already discussed. The user interface may allow for the display, execution, interaction, manipulation, and\/or operation of program components and\/or system facilities through textual and\/or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect, interact with, and\/or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the user interface communicates with operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The user interface may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","Web Browser","A Web browser component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The Web browser may be a conventional hypertext viewing application such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit (or greater) encryption by way of HTTPS, SSL, and\/or the like. Some Web browsers allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, web browser plug-in APIs (e.g., FireFox, Safari Plug-in, and\/or the like APIs), and\/or the like. Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs, cellular telephones, and\/or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Web browser communicates with information servers, operating systems, integrated program components (e.g., plug-ins), and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. Of course, in entity of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar functions of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and\/or the like from the RBCI enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.","Mail Server","A mail server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as, but not limited to sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, and\/or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP, ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as, but not limited to: Internet message access protocol (IMAP), Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)\/Microsoft Exchange, post office protocol (POP3), simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and\/or the like. The mail server can route, forward, and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent, relayed and\/or otherwise traversing through and\/or to the RBCI.","Access to the RBCI mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and\/or the operating system.","Also, a mail server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses.","Mail Client","A mail client component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Mozilla, Thunderbird, and\/or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols, such as: IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, POP3, SMTP, and\/or the like. A mail client may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the mail client communicates with mail servers, operating systems, other mail clients, and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses. Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.","Cryptographic Server","A cryptographic server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU , cryptographic processor , cryptographic processor interface , cryptographic processor device , and\/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous (encryption and\/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash function), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and\/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the RBCI may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the RBCI component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the RBCI and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it may act as a client and\/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The RBCI Database","The RBCI database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the RBCI database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data, but may have other types of functionality encapsulated within a given object. If the RBCI database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the RBCI database  may be integrated into another component such as the RBCI component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A Users table may include fields such as, but not limited to: user_ID, user_name, user_password, contact_info, hardware_ID, mobile_device_type, usage_history, and\/or the like. A Hardware table may include fields such as, but not limited to: hardware_ID, hardware_type, hardware_name, data_formatting_requirements, protocols, addressing_info, usage_history, hardware_requirements, user_ID, and\/or the like. A business table may include fields such as, but not limited to: business_name, business_ID, business_category, business_address, business_contact, business_number, business_email, business_homepage, business_symbol, business_digital_image, business_content, and\/or the like. These tables may support and\/or track multiple entity accounts on the RBCI controller.","In one embodiment, the RBCI database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search RBCI component may treat the combination of the RBCI database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the RBCI. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the RBCI may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The RBCI may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The RBCI database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the RBCI database communicates with the RBCI component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The RBCI Component","The RBCI component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the RBCI component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the RBCI that was discussed in the previous figures. As such, the RBCI affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks.","The RBCI component is configurable to access, calculate, engage, exchange, generate, identify, instruct, match, process, search, serve, store, and\/or facilitate transmission of indicative information of target business entities, contact information of target business entities, and\/or the like between RBCI components and\/or affiliated entities, and use of the RBCI.","The RBCI component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, WebObjects, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the RBCI server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The RBCI component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the RBCI component communicates with the RBCI database, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The RBCI may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","Distributed RBCIs","The structure and\/or operation of any of the RBCI node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and\/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and\/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the RBCI controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), local and remote application program interfaces Jini, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components. Again, the configuration will depend upon the context of system deployment.","The entirety of this disclosure (including the Cover Page, Title, Headings, Field, Background, Summary, Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description, Claims, Abstract, Figures, and otherwise) shows by way of illustration various embodiments in which the claimed inventions may be practiced.
