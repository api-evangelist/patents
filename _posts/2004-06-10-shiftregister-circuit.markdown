As shown in the figure, a LCD panel  is formed by interlacing data electrodes (represented by D, D, D, . . . , Dm) and gate electrodes (represented by G, G, G, . . . , Gn), each of the interlaced data electrodes and gate electrodes is used to control a display unit.

The gate and drain of TFTs are connected to the gate electrodes (G-Gn) and the data electrodes (D-Dm) respectively. The connection can turn all the TFTs on the same line (i.e. positioned on the same scan line) on or off using a scan signal of the gate electrodes (G-Gn), thereby controlling the video signal of the data electrodes to be written into the corresponding display unit.","Gate driver  generates the scan signals (also referred to as scan pulses) of each gate electrode G, G, . . . , Gn according to a predetermined sequence. When a scan signal is carried by a gate electrode, the TFTs within all display units on the same row or the same scan line are turned on while the TFTs within all display units on other rows or other scan lines are turned off.
