{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel 3-phenylpropionic acid derivatives which carry a branched or cyclic alkyl substituent in the 3-position, to processes for their preparation, to their use for the treatment and\/or prevention of diseases and to their use for preparing medicaments for the treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, in particular for the treatment and\/or prevention of cardiovascular diseases.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitric oxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to attach to the central iron atom of haem, but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.","Through the production of cGMP and the regulation, resulting therefrom, of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system may be suppressed, which may lead for example to high blood pressure, platelet activation, increased cellular proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, thromboses, stroke and myocardial infarction.","A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.","Compounds, such as organic nitrates, whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of haem. Besides the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment [O. V. Evgenov et al., 5 (2006), 755].","Substances which directly stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase, i.e. without previous release of NO, have been identified in recent years. The indazole derivative YC-1 was the first NO-independent but haem-dependent sGC stimulator described [Evgenov et al., ibid.]. Based on YC-1, further substances were discovered which are more potent than YC-1 and show no relevant inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE). This led to the identification of the pyrazolopyridine derivatives BAY 41-2272, BAY 41-8543 and BAY 63-2521. Together with the recently published structurally different substances CMF-1571 and A-350619, these compounds form the new class of the sGC stimulators [Evgenov et al., ibid.]. A common characteristic of this substance class is an NO-independent and selective activation of the haem-containing sGC. In addition, the sGC stimulators in combination with NO have a synergistic effect on sGC activation based on a stabilization of the nitrosyl-haem complex. The exact binding site of the sGC stimulators at the sGC is still being debated. If the haem group is removed from the soluble guanylate cyclase, the enzyme still has a detectable catalytic basal activity, i.e. cGMP is still being formed. The remaining catalytic basal activity of the haem-free enzyme cannot be stimulated by any of the stimulators mentioned above [Evgenov et al., ibid.].","In addition, NO- and haem-independent sGC activators, with BAY 58-2667 as prototype of this class, have been identified. Common characteristics of these substances are that in combination with NO they only have an additive effect on enzyme activation, and that the activation of the oxidized or haem-free enzyme is markedly higher than that of the haem-containing enzyme [Evgenov et al., ibid.; J. P. Stasch et al., 136 (2002), 773; J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552]. Spectroscopic studies show that BAY 58-2667 displaces the oxidized haem group which, as a result of the weakening of the iron-histidine bond, is attached only weakly to the sGC. It has also been shown that the characteristic sGC haem binding motif Tyr-x-Ser-x-Arg is absolutely essential both for the interaction of the negatively charged propionic acids of the haem group and for the action of BAY 58-2667. Against this background, it is assumed that the binding site of BAY 58-2667 at the sGC is identical to the binding site of the haem group [J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552].","The compounds described in the present invention are now likewise capable of activating the haem-free form of soluble guanylate cyclase. This is also confirmed by the fact that these novel activators firstly have no synergistic action with NO at the haem-containing enzyme and that secondly their action cannot be blocked by the haem-dependent inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, 1H-1,2,4-oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), but is even potentiated by this inhibitor [cf. O. V. Evgenov et al., 5 (2006), 755; J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552].","It was thus an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds which act as activators of soluble guanylate cyclase in the manner described above and can be used as such in particular for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disorders.","WO 00\/64888-A1, EP 1 216 980-A1, EP 1 285 908-A1, EP 1 348 698-A1, EP 1 375 472-A1, EP 1 452 521-A1, US 2005\/0187266-A1 and US 2005\/0234066-A1 describe various aryl-alkanecarboxylic acid derivatives as PPAR agonists for treating diabetes, dyslipidaemia, arteriosclerosis, obesity and other disorders. EP 1 312 601-A1 and EP 1 431 267-A1 disclose substituted arylalkanecarboxylic acids as PGEreceptor antagonists for the treatment, for example, of states of pain, urological disorders, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Furthermore, WO 2005\/086661-A2 claims arylalkanecarboxylic acids as GPR40 modulators for the treatment of diabetes and dyslipidaemias, and WO 2004\/099170-A2, WO 2006\/050097-A1 and WO 2006\/055625-A2 describe phenyl-substituted carboxylic acids as PTP-1B inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, individual phenylacetamido-substituted phenylalkanecarboxylic acids which, in the form of non-covalent mixtures improve the delivery of active peptide compounds within the body are known from WO 96\/12473-A1 and WO 96\/30036-A1.

Particular isotopic variants of a compound according to the invention, especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be beneficial, for example, for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active compound distribution in the body; due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability, especially compounds labelled with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. In addition, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic benefits as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the compounds according to the invention may therefore in some cases also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention can be prepared by generally used processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the methods described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the particular reagents and\/or starting compounds therein.","The present invention moreover also includes prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. The term \u201cprodrugs\u201d here designates compounds which themselves can be biologically active or inactive, but are converted (for example metabolically or hydrolytically) into compounds according to the invention during their dwell time in the body.","As prodrugs, the present invention comprises in particular hydrolysable ester derivatives of the carboxylic acids of the formula (I) according to the invention. These are to be understood as meaning esters which can be hydrolysed to the free carboxylic acids, as the compounds that are mainly active biologically, in physiological media, under the conditions of the biological tests described later and in particular in vivo by enzymatic or chemical routes.

Administration forms suitable for parenteral administration include preparations for injection and infusion in the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, lyophilizates or sterile powders.","For the other administration routes, suitable examples are inhalable medicament forms (including powder inhalers, nebulizers), nasal drops, solutions or sprays, tablets, films\/wafers or capsules for lingual, sublingual or buccal administration, suppositories, ear or eye preparations, vaginal capsules, aqueous suspensions (lotions, shaking mixtures), lipophilic suspensions, ointments, creams, transdermal therapeutic systems (e.g. patches), milk, pastes, foams, sprinkling powders, implants or stents.","Oral or parenteral administration is preferred, especially oral and intravenous administration.","The compounds according to the invention can be converted to the administration forms mentioned. This can be done in a manner known per se, by mixing with inert, nontoxic, pharmaceutically suitable excipients. These excipients include carriers (for example microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, mannitol), solvents (e.g. liquid polyethylene glycols), emulsifiers and dispersing or wetting agents (for example sodium dodecylsulphate, polyoxysorbitan oleate), binders (for example polyvinylpyrrolidone), synthetic and natural polymers (for example albumin), stabilizers (e.g. antioxidants, for example ascorbic acid), dyes (e.g. inorganic pigments, for example iron oxides) and flavour and\/or odour correctants.","In general, it has been found to be advantageous in the case of parenteral administration to administer amounts of about 0.001 to 1 mg\/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 0.5 mg\/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results. In the case of oral administration, the dosage is about 0.01 to 100 mg\/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 20 mg\/kg and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg\/kg of body weight.","It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to deviate from the stated amounts, specifically as a function of the body weight, route of administration, individual response to the active compound, nature of the preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. For instance, in some cases, less than the aforementioned minimum amount may be sufficient, while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of administration of relatively large amounts, it may be advisable to divide these into several individual doses over the course of the day.","The working examples which follow illustrate the invention.
