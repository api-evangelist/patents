title: Resolving ambiguous queries
abstract: Methods, systems, and apparatus for resolving ambiguous queries. A search query is received and metrics are identified for the query that are associated with respective categories. Each metric indicates a user preference for search results that are responsive to the query and associated with the metric's respective category. The identified metrics are used to determine whether the query is ambiguous. Responsive to determining that the query is ambiguous, the identified metrics are used to determine a user preference for one or more categories of search results responsive to the ambiguous query. Search results associated with the one or more user preferred categories are ranked higher than search results that are not associated with the one or more user preferred categories.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This specification relates to textually ambiguous queries.","Search queries are used in various contexts to identify information from a collection of information. For example, a query can be used to search a database of records. In another example, a query is input by a user of a web browser to transmit a search request to a search engine to search information that is available to the user over the world wide web. In another example, a user of a mapping application that provides a graphical display of geographic information (i.e., a map) may input a query to search for a particular geographic location and\/or point of interest. Although users of such searching techniques may be considerably experienced, or not, in crafting queries, the nature of human languages leaves room for ambiguity. For example, a search term can have multiple meanings that are vastly different and that can each yield vastly different search results, some of which may be responsive to the user's query, but others of which will be highly unresponsive and therefore distracting to the user.","In general, one aspect, the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include receiving a search query and identifying, for the query, metrics associated with respective categories. Each metric indicates a user preference for search results that are responsive to the query and associated with the metric's respective category. The identified metrics are used to determine whether the query is ambiguous. Responsive to determining that the query is ambiguous, the identified metrics are used to determine a user preference for one or more categories of search results responsive to the ambiguous query. Search results associated with the one or more user preferred categories are ranked higher than search results that are not associated with the one or more user preferred categories. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.","These and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features, alone or in combination. The metric for each category can be a click-through-rate determined from historical data for search results previously presented to users in response to queries that match the received query. Using the identified metrics to determine whether the query is ambiguous can include determining whether any of the categories has a metric value that exceeds the metric values of all of the other categories by a predetermined amount. Using the metrics to determine whether the query is ambiguous can include determining whether the entropy of the metrics exceeds a predetermined value. Determining a user preference for one or more categories of search results responsive to the ambiguous query can include determining whether one or more of the identified metrics exceeds a predetermined value. Determining a user preference for one or more categories of search results responsive to the ambiguous query can include listing the identified metrics in decreasing numerical order, determining whether a drop-off that is greater than a predetermined value exists between any two metrics in the list, and responsive to such a drop-off existing, identifying categories associated with metrics occurring before the drop-off as user preferred categories.","Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. A query can be identified as ambiguous, and if so, information that relates to the query can be used in an attempt to determine categories of search results that are most likely preferred. When a search term has more than one meaning, the various meanings being vastly different from each other, the techniques and systems described can help to eliminate (or at least downgrade) search results that are most likely related to categories that are not relevant to the particular meaning of the search term intended by the user. A user that input the search query can thereby be provided with more responsive search results and less distracted by the inclusion of highly unresponsive search results. A user can avoid losing time trying to reformulate a query by adding disambiguating terms, which in term may degrade search results in any event.","The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.","Search queries can include terms that have more than one meaning. A search engine processing the search query can provide vastly different search results, depending on which meaning is attributed to the word in the search query. By way of illustrative example, a search query for POOL can yield search results that relate to swimming pools, pool tables or establishments where one can play pool, e.g., a sports lounge. Such a search query is therefore ambiguous because the meaning of the search term is open to more than one interpretation. Metrics recording user interactions with search results previously presented in response to search queries can be used to both identify ambiguous search queries, and to rank search results provided in response to ambiguous search queries to reflect user preferences for such search results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","106","104","104","106","106","104","102","102","116","106"]},"The query analyzer  is configured to analyze the received search query from the client computing system A and determine whether or not the search query is an ambiguous search query using information stored in the query\/category metric store . The query\/category metric store  includes multiple query\/category pairs that are each associated with a metric. The metric for a query\/category pair indicates a likelihood that a user is interested in a search result that is responsive to the query in the query\/category pair and that is associated with the particular category that is included in the query\/category pair.","The search engine  is configured to search a corpus of information, e.g., electronic files available to the client computing system A over the network , for search results that are responsive to a query received from the client computing system A. The ranking module  is configured to score and rank the search results so that those search results that are determined the most likely to be responsive to the query are presented first in a list of search results presented to the client computing system A. Various techniques can be used to score the search results, e.g., based on relevance and otherwise. In one implementation, when a query is determined to be ambiguous, the ranking module  can use information from the metric store  to disambiguate the query by scoring and ranking the search results.

The query can be input by typing or spoken by a user. For example, the search system  can receive a search query from the client computing system A over the network . In this example, the query is \u201cSUSHI\u201d. For the particular received query, i.e., \u201cSUSHI\u201d, multiple metrics are identified that are associated with multiple categories (Step ) or query\/category pairs. As mentioned above, each metric is associated with a particular query\/category pair and indicates a likelihood that search results that are responsive to the query and associated with the particular category are of interest to a user. Each category can be included in a hierarchy of categories having two or more hierarchical levels, although the categories need not be hierarchical. By way of example, the query analyzer  can identify query\/category pairs in the query\/category metric store  that have a query that matches the received query, i.e., that matches SUSHI.","In some implementations, the query analyzer  identifies query\/category pairs that have a query that is an exact match to the received query. In other implementations, a \u201cmatch\u201d can be identified even if the queries are not identical, e.g., if the received query is SUSHI RESTAURANT, the query analyzer  may still determine that it is a match to a SUSHI\/category pair in the query\/category metric store. In some implementations, a best matching query found in query\/category pairs in the store is identified as the matching query. In some implementations, a limit can be placed on how many terms can differ between the received query and a query included in the store, for example, a maximum of two different terms may be acceptable for a query to qualify as a \u201cmatch\u201d. Queries that have rare terms that match can be preferred.","The metrics can be determined, as explained below, from an analysis of historical data collected from previously received search queries and user-interaction with the search results that were presented in response to the search queries. Each search result can be associated with one or more categories, and each of the one or more categories may represent a level in a hierarchy of categories. Therefore, each search result can provide metrics about one or more query\/category combinations corresponding to the one or more categories associated with the search result. In some implementations, the metric is a click-through-rate or is based on a click-through-rate (CTR). In one example, a CTR can be calculated by dividing the number of times a user clicked on a previously presented search result to \u201cclick through\u201d to another document (e.g., to another web page) into the total number of times the search result was provided to the user or viewed (i.e., total clicks divided by total page impressions). A relatively high CTR for search results included in a particular category for a given query suggests that search results in the particular category are likely to be of greater interest to the user. The historical CTR can be recorded as the metric for the particular query\/category pair in the metric store .","In one example, shown in Table 1 below, the following query\/category metrics for the query SUSHI can be identified at the lowest level of the category hierarchy .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Query\/Category Pair","Category","Metric (CTR)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["(Sushi, Japanese restaurant)","Japanese restaurant 208A","35%"]},{"entry":["(Sushi, Thai restaurant)","Thai Restaurant 208B","30%"]},{"entry":["(Sushi, Italian restaurant)","Italian Restaurant 208F","13%"]},{"entry":["(Sushi, Mexican restaurant)","Mexican Restaurant","12%"]},{"entry":[{},"208E",{}]},{"entry":["(Sushi, Korean restaurant)","Korean Restaurant 208C","10%"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["108","200"],"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Based on the identified query\/category metrics, a determination is made whether the query is ambiguous (Decision Step ). In some implementations, a query is considered ambiguous if the entropy of categories or category metrics associated with search results that are responsive to the query is large (i.e., if a distribution of categories or category metrics is not sharply peaked). In these implementations, distributions having a large standard deviation are deemed to be ambiguous.","In one implementation, the determination of whether the query is ambiguous is based on analyzing the identified metrics and determining whether one metric is significantly higher than all of the other metrics. For example if the first metric is 90% and each of the other metrics is under 5%, the first metric would be determined to be significantly higher than the other metrics. In such an example, the query is determined not to be ambiguous, since search results falling within the category associated with the first query\/category metric are highly likely to be of interest to a user. If no such highly responsive metric is identified, i.e., there is no single metric that is significantly higher than the others, then the query can be determined to be ambiguous.","In some implementations, a metric is determined to be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than the other metrics if the value of the metric is at least 30% higher than each of the other metrics, although in other implementations this can be a different number, e.g., 50%, 100%, etc. For example, as shown in , a query for SUSHI would be considered ambiguous since there is no single metric in the query\/category pairs for SUSHI that is at least 30% larger than the value of all of the other metrics. While the metrics for Japanese restaurant and for That restaurant are each more than 30% larger than the metrics for the other categories shown in , the metric for the Japanese restaurant category (i.e., 35%) is only about 17% higher than the metric for the That restaurant category (i.e., 30%). Accordingly, the SUSHI query is determined to be an ambiguous query at this level of categorization.","If the query is determined not to be ambiguous (\u201cNo\u201d branch of Decision Step ), then the search results are obtained (Step ) and ranked using conventional scoring and ranking techniques (Step ). However, if the query is determined to be ambiguous (\u201cYes\u201d branch of Decision Step ), then a determination is made whether one or more metrics for one or more query\/categories at a given level of the category hierarchy exceeds a predetermined value (Decision Step ). In one implementation, the predetermined value is a CTR of 40%. If there is no metric in the given category level that exceeds that predetermined value (\u201cNo\u201d branch of Decision Step ), the hierarchical level for each category hierarchy (if any) is incremented by 1 (Step ) and the metrics are determined for the corresponding categories at the incrementally higher level in the category hierarchy (Step ). The process of searching for a metric that exceeds the predetermined threshold (Steps -) is then repeated until either a query\/category metric is found at some level in the category hierarchy that exceeds the threshold (step ) or the highest level in the category hierarchy has been reached (step ).","Referring again to , for example, all of the categories shown in Table 1 are included in the lowest level of the category hierarchy , i.e., level (1). The hierarchical level is incremented by one, i.e., is incremented up to level (2). Each of the following categories roll-up into the Asian restaurant category A: Japanese restaurant A; That Restaurant B and Korean Restaurant C. The Italian Restaurant category F rolls up into the European restaurant category C and the Mexican Restaurant category E rolls up into the North American category B. Metrics are determined for query\/category pairs at each of these incrementally-higher level categories, i.e., Asian A, North American B and European C. In some implementations, the metrics are determined by summing the metrics for the associated lower level categories that get rolled up into the incrementally-higher level categories, i.e., by performing an aggregation of the metrics. In other implementations, the query\/category metric for the higher level categories may already be stored in the query\/category metric store. The new metrics for the level 2 query\/category pairs are shown below in Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Category","Metric (CTR)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Asian 206A","75%"]},{"entry":[{},"North American 206B","12%"]},{"entry":[{},"European 206C","13%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Repeating steps - at the higher level, a determination is made whether the metrics for one or more of the incrementally-higher categories exceeds the predetermined threshold value (Step ). In this example, the metric for the Asian A category is 75%, which far exceeds the predetermined threshold value of 40%. As a result, the ambiguous query SUSHI is disambiguated to indicate that users searching for SUSHI prefer to view search results that can be classified as Asian restaurants. This information can then be used to score search results that are responsive to the query SUSHI to emphasize or promote those search results that can be categorized as Asian restaurants over search results that cannot be categorized as Asian restaurants.","Referring back to Decision step , if the determination is made that no categories exceed the predetermined value (\u201cNo\u201d branch of Decision Step ), and the highest level of the category hierarchy has been reached (\u201cYes\u201d branch of Decision Step ) without having identified a category having a metric that exceeds the predetermined value, the process continues at Step , i.e., search results are obtained and ranked using conventional techniques (Step ) without having disambiguated the categories. In this instance, the scoring and ranking for search results will not be changed to reflect user preference for one or more categories of an ambiguous search category, since no such preference has been determined from the query\/category metrics. If the determination is that there are one or more categories having a metric that exceeds the predetermined value (\u201cYes\u201d branch of Decision Step ), then a user preference for search results in the one or more categories is identified, i.e., search results that are classified with the one or more categories are preferred. Search results are obtained (Step ) and ranked based (at least in part) on the identified user preference (Step ). That is, search results that are included in the one or more categories can be boosted in the ranking as compared to search results that are not included in the one or more categories. In the example system shown, the search results can be obtained by the search engine  and ranked by the ranking module . It should be understood that obtaining the search results (i.e., Step ) can occur before or in parallel to the steps - discussed above. The ranked search results generated at either Step  or Step  are presented to the user (Step ).","It is noted that while in the example above, the categories were all included within one category hierarchy, i.e., the hierarchy for \u201cRestaurants\u201d, in general query\/category pairs identified from the query\/category metric store can be associated with categories that are in different category hierarchies. For example, a local query such as \u201cpool, Austin\u201d can be associated with query\/category pairs in a restaurant category (e.g., bars with pool tables), in a recreation category (e.g., pool tables), and in a sports category (e.g., swimming pools).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","108","400"]},"In process , a query is received (Step ). A set of search results are obtained (Step ), e.g., from the search engine  and ranking module . The search results are presented to a user that submitted the query (Step ), e.g., a user of client computing system A. For each search result that is presented to the user, a \u201cviews counter\u201d for the one or more categories that the particular search result is associated with is incremented by one (Step ). The one or more categories can be independent of each other, or can be related to each other in a hierarchy of categories. For each search result that the user clicks on (or other interacts with), i.e., to click through to a landing page, a \u201cclicks counter\u201d for the one or more categories associated with the search result is incremented by one (Step ). The click-through-rates for the one or more categories that are associated with the set of search results are then calculated by dividing the value of the clicks counter by the value of the views counter for the respective categories, i.e., is a ratio of the number of clicks to the total number of views (Step ). The query is then paired with each of the one or more categories, and the metrics (e.g., CTR and\/or views counter and clicks counter) for each of the query\/category pairs are stored in the query\/category metric store  (Step ).","The process  can be periodically run using historical data logs to insure the freshness of the data and user preferences. Alternatively, the process  can be run whenever a query is received, and user interaction data received in response to user interactions with presented search results can be used to update the query\/category metrics in metric store . In some implementations, the query\/category metric store  is populated using metrics generated from both historical and real-time data.","In the implementations described above, the metric used is a CTR. However, it should be understood that other metrics can be used that indicate user preferences for search results in a particular category. Examples include a metric that corresponds to the duration of a user interaction with a search result, wherein a longer interaction typically indicates a user preference for categories associated with that search result; and a number of times a user interacts with a search result, wherein the more times a user interacts with the search result the greater the user's preference for categories associated with that search result. Other factors can also be used to indicate a user's preference for one or more categories associated with search results provided in response to a given query, and can be measured and stored as a metric. The ones described herein are but a few illustrative examples.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","504","506"]},"If the query is determined not to be ambiguous (\u201cNo\u201d branch of Decision Step ), then the search results are obtained (Step ) and ranked (Step ) using conventional techniques. If the query is determined to be ambiguous (\u201cYes\u201d branch of Decision Step ), then the identified metrics are further analyzed to disambiguate the query. In particular, the metrics for the categories of search results responsive to the query are arranged in a list in order of decreasing metric value, and analyzed to determine whether there is a sharp drop-off in metric values between the metric values associated with any two categories in the list. In some implementations, a drop-off in metric values that is greater than some predetermined number, which can be expressed as a percentage drop-off (e.g., 40%) or an absolute drop-off, indicates a sharp drop-off in metric values.","For example, referring again to the example shown in Table 1, the categories shown in Column 2 are arranged in order of decreasing metric value. The category that is first in order, i.e., Japanese restaurant A has the highest value metric of 35%. The next category in order, i.e., That restaurant B, has a metric of 30%. Since this is a 15% drop-off from the first metric, it is not a sharp drop-off. The next category in order, i.e., Italian restaurant F, has a metric of 13%. Since this is an approximately 57% drop-off in metric value from the second metric, it is considered a sharp drop-off.","Referring again to , if the query is determined to be ambiguous (\u201cYes\u201d branch of Decision Step ), the metrics obtained from the query\/category metric store  corresponding to the received query are compared (Step ), and analyzed to determine whether a change in metric value between categories that are ordered by decreasing metric value exceed a predetermined threshold value (Decision Step ). If such a change is determined (\u201cYes\u201d branch of Decision Step ), categories that appear below the drop-off are considered inconsequential as there is a strong user preference to NOT view search results associated with such categories (Step ). Thus, in the example shown in Table 1, the categories of Italian restaurant F, Mexican restaurant E and Korean Restaurant C can be identified as inconsequential because there is a sudden drop-off in metric value between the That restaurant B and Italian restaurant F categories.","Search results can be obtained (Step ) and ranked (Step ) based (at least in part) on the identification of one or more categories as inconsequential. Search results that fall within inconsequential categories can be ignored, or otherwise penalized in their respective scoring for ranking purposes. That is, in some implementations, search results that fall within categories that are identified as inconsequential are ignored, i.e., not presented in the set of search results. In other implementations, the search results are not ignored completely, but their scores for ranking purposes can be negatively impacted by their being associated with an inconsequential category.","In instances where there is no sharp drop-off in metric value between any two categories in the list (\u201cNo\u201d branch of Decision Step ), the search results are obtained (Step ) and conventionally ranked (Step ), since no user preference for any one or more search categories over any other search categories has been determined. The ranked search results generated by either Step  or Step  are presented to the user (Step ). In some implementations, ambiguous queries can be resolved with a process that combines steps from both process  and process . For example, if a received query is determined ambiguous in process  (i.e., the \u201cYes\u201d branch of Decision Step ), then Steps ,  and  of process  can be undertaken to eliminate certain categories before proceeding to step . That is, inconsequential categories can be identified and ignored. The remaining categories can be then considered when determining whether one or more categories exceed a predetermined metric value (i.e., Step ) at a given level of the category hierarchy.","Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here may be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and\/or combinations thereof.
