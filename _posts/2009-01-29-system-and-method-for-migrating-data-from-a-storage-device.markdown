These traditional techniques, however, limit user productivity.","According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for migrating data from a storage device includes accessing data on a storage device. The method also includes providing at least one interface that allows for selecting a first operating system stored on the storage device. The interface further allows for selecting one or more settings stored on the storage device. The method further includes initiating a migration of the one or more settings from the storage device. The method further includes storing the one or more settings.","Particular embodiments of the present disclosure may allow for the migration of one or more settings stored on a storage device. As a result, an operating system can be executed on a new device with all the settings of the previous device. Accordingly, the operating system may appear to a user to be executed on the previous device, as opposed to the new device.","Particular embodiments of the present disclosure may further allow for the migrated settings to be transferred to a subsequent device. As a result, the settings may be applied to the operating system of any suitable device, even though the device was not involved in the original migration.","Particular embodiments of the present disclosure may further allow for migrated registry settings to be automatically applied to the registry on a new device. As a result, the device's registry may be more quickly set up for executing the device's operating system in accordance with the migrated registry settings.","Other technical advantages of the present disclosure will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims. Moreover, while specific advantages have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include all, some, or none of the enumerated advantages.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and its advantages are best understood by referring to  of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","18","14","18","18","18"]},"Data may refer to any type of information that may be stored on storage device .

As such, a user of second computer  may understand which operating systems are stored on storage device . In another embodiment, migration manager  may allow the user to select an operating system that is stored on storage device . For example, using input  of second computer , a user may select an operating system, such as Windows XP, stored on storage device . In one embodiment, migration manager  may only allow a user of second computer  to select an operating system having the same or an older edition of the operating system being executed on second computer . For example, if second computer  is executing Windows 2000 as an operating system, migration manager  may allow the user to select the operating system Windows 2000 from storage device , or may allow the user to select an older operating system, such as Windows NT. In such an example, however, migration manager  may not allow the user to select a newer operating system, such as Windows XP. In another embodiment, migration manager  may only allow a user of second computer  to select an operating system with settings that may be applied to an operating system being executed on second computer .","In a further embodiment, once a user has selected an operating system stored on storage device , migration manager  may be further operable to investigate and identify any other data stored on storage device . For example, migration manager  may investigate and identify various applications, such as Microsoft Office, Microsoft Word, Internet Explorer, or any other applications stored on storage device . As another example, migration manager  may further investigate any file, folder, and\/or any other information stored on storage device .","As a further example, migration manager  may investigate and identify any settings stored on storage device .

As such, migration manager  may be operable to investigate and identify the stored registry settings, including any changes made to the registry.","In another embodiment, migration manager  may be further operable to create a virtual operating system. For example, after the user selects an operating system stored on storage device , migration manager  may use storage device  as a slave disk, providing the user of second computer  with a virtual image of the data stored on storage device . Accordingly, the data may appear to a user of second computer  to have been accessed from (or executed by) a device which storage device  was previously associated with (such as a previous computer), as opposed to second computer . In one embodiment, migration manager  may create the virtual operating system by loading data stored on storage device . In a further embodiment, the virtual operating system may allow migration manager  to investigate and identify the other data (e.g., settings, applications, files, etc.) stored on storage device . In an additional embodiment, the virtual operating system may allow migration manager  to initiate migration of the data to second computer . For example, the virtual operating system may allow migration manager  to collect the data (such as system settings, application settings, etc.) for migration using an application programming interface (API) on second computer .","According to one embodiment, once the data stored on storage device  has been investigated and identified, migration manager  may allow the user of second computer  to select the data for migration. For example, using input  of second computer , a user may select any data, such as settings associated with the selected operating system, for migration. In one embodiment, the user may select all of the data stored on storage device . In a further embodiment, the user may pick and choose which data they would like migrated to second computer . According to one embodiment, the user may select the data for migration after migration manager  has created the virtual operating system. In a further embodiment, the user may not select the operating system stored on storage device  for migration.","In one embodiment, after the user has selected the data (i.e., settings, applications, and\/or any other data) to be migrated, migration manager  may be operable to initiate the migration of this data to second computer . In one embodiment, the migration of data from storage device  to second computer  may occur in any suitable manner. For example, the migration of data to second computer  may be a deferred migration. As such, migration manager  may save the data as a DNA file on second computer . In another embodiment, when the migrated data includes, for example, registry settings, migration manager  may automatically set up the migrated registry settings in a new registry on second computer , instead of saving it as a file.","In a further embodiment, when data is migrated from storage device  to second computer , all of the relationships for the data may be kept the same. For example, if a file was originally mapped to C:\\\\My_Pictures on storage device , the file may remain mapped to C:\\\\My_Pictures when migrated to second computer . Accordingly, in one embodiment, all of the file names and labels may be the same as they were on storage device .","In one embodiment, once the migrated data is stored on second computer  (i.e., as a DNA file), second computer  may use the migrated data. Furthermore, a user may access the data at second computer  instead of at storage device . In a further embodiment, the migrated data may be accessed at second computer , but appear as if it was accessed from storage device  (or the device previously associated with storage device ). For example, a user of second computer  may execute the migrated application Microsoft Word, and the application may have substantially the same appearance (i.e., font size, tool bar settings, paragraph format, etc.) as the application would have on storage device  (or the device previously associated with storage device ). In one embodiment, this may allow a seamless transition from the previous device to second computer .","As discussed above, once the migrated data is stored on second computer , for example, as a DNA file, the migrated data may be accessed on second computer . In a further embodiment, migration manager  may subsequently transfer the migrated data from second computer  to other systems. For example, when the data is saved as a DNA file, the DNA file may be transferred over a network, such as the internet, to a subsequent device, such as a third computer. Accordingly, the third computer may execute its operating system using the migrated data. As such, the migrated data may be accessed at the third computer, but appear as if it was accessed from storage device  (or the device previously associated with storage device ). As a further example, the migrated data may be saved to any data storage device (i.e., a CD ROM, external hard drive, etc.), or be transferred to and\/or stored at any other suitable device using any other suitable manner. Accordingly, in one embodiment, access to the migrated data may not be limited to second computer , but may occur at any other suitable device.","Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to system  without departing from the scope of the disclosure. The components of system  may be integrated or separated. Moreover, the operations of system  may be performed by more, fewer, or other components.

For example, the second interface may allow user profiles, applications, files, and\/or folders to be selected for migration. In a further embodiment, the first interface and the second interface may be the same interface. As such, one interface may allow for selecting a first operating system and for selecting one or more settings.","At step , a migration of the one or more settings from the storage device is initiated. In one embodiment, this initiation may cause the one or more settings to be transferred to the second computer. In a further embodiment, the initiation may allow any other selected data to be transferred to the second computer. According to one embodiment, the data may migrated from the storage device to the second computer over the connector.","At step , the one or more settings are stored. In one embodiment, the one or more settings are stored on the second computer. In a further embodiment, the one or more settings are saved as a DNA file on the second computer. In one embodiment, storing the one or more settings may allow the second computer to operate the operating system on the second computer so that it has substantially the same look and feel (i.e., including user profiles, user settings, background picture, saved files and folders, etc.) as the operating system stored on the storage device.
