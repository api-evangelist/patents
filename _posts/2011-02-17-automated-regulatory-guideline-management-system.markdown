{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to information retrieval.","Businesses such as food manufacturers, cosmetic companies, and the like, have a need to manage many ingredients and formulas for manufacture of their products. There are many regulations pertaining to most of these ingredients, and the regulations vary in different countries. Keeping track of such regulations is a time-consuming and costly activity for these businesses. Therefore, it is desirable to have an improved regulatory information retrieval system to reduce the time and cost associated with these activities.","Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and method for identifying regulator and customer restrictions pertaining to various substances, and the creation of file format guidelines for managing changes to those restrictions. There are various repositories available on the Internet, such as from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and similar organizations in other countries. Much of this information can be \u201ccrawled\u201d by a search engine which retrieves this information, and indexes it for fast retrieval. However, there are other documents that are not in text form. These may be TIFF files, graphic PDF files, or other formats. In some cases, these may undergo Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert the graphic images to text for storage.","In addition to retrieving relevant passages based on search terms, embodiments of the present invention apply a thesaurus to search terms to further expand the search. This allows identification of relevant passages that may not use the exact words of the search term. For example, acetylsalicylic acid also commonly is referred to as \u201caspirin.\u201dHence, a search regarding regulations for acetylsalicylic acid may also retrieve information citing \u201caspirin\u201d as relevant.","Embodiments of the present invention also apply emphasis to important words in the relevant passages. These important words may comprise \u201cregulatory words\u201d which help identify important rules and restrictions within the relevant passages.","The collection of relevant passages with emphasized words is used to comprise a guideline. The guideline is a form and the collection of an intelligent search result that provides a user with important information regarding a particular substance, identifying the categories of use, and the applicable restrictions. The user may optionally enter other parameters regarding his\/her use of the substance prior to the search. These parameters may include, but are not limited to, the type of application (e.g. food, cosmetic, etc. . . . ), the geographic location (e.g. U.S., Canada, Europe, etc. . . . ), and the intended age range of usage (e.g. a children's medicine, adult product, etc. . . . ). These parameters help focus the search to retrieve relevant regulations (e.g. for the proper countries), applications (such as cosmetics), and age groups. For example, a user planning to use an ingredient for a children's shampoo to be sold in Europe needs to refer to pertinent regulations for that situation.","Furthermore, the guideline information can be formatted into a data format, such as CSV (comma separated value) such that it may be imported into a third party program such as a formulation management system, or a spreadsheet application. In this way, the guideline information can be integrated into existing information systems.","In one embodiment, the method comprises building ingredient data for manufacturing businesses. Then, those ingredients are compared with regulatory requirements. Relevant requirements are identified regarding permitted usage, which then are extracted and converted to a guideline document. The guideline document can be viewed in a variety of ways, such as a detailed view, or an overview of repositories searched. The guidelines may then be converted to a file format that can be imported by other business applications.","The guidelines may include a variety of metadata that is part of the file format (e.g. CSV) that is imported into a third party software package. This metadata may include, but is not limited to:","An automatically generated reference number for the guideline;","Packaging and labeling restrictions;","Date of the regulation;","Author (source) of the regulation;","Country of the regulation;","Formulation restriction on composition percentages; and","Shelf life.","This metadata may be entered manually, or where possible, automatically populated. For example, when retrieving data from an FDA website, it is known that the country of the regulation is the United States, and the Author (source) of the regulation is the FDA.","Embodiments of the present invention also provide a method for generating viewable reports that display collected content on ingredient compliance. Fields are mapped to the guideline data structure so it can be fetched and displayed in these reports. A file can be exported summarizing this viewable report.","Embodiments of the present invention also provide a method for retrieving regulatory information. The method comprises indexing a plurality of regulatory corpuses, thereby forming a plurality of full-text searchable databases; receiving a search query comprising at least one search term; executing the search query on the plurality of full-text searchable databases to identify a plurality of relevant passages; emphasizing search terms within the plurality of relevant passages; and emphasizing regulatory words within the plurality of relevant passages, thereby forming emphasized relevant passages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","103","102","104","104","102","106","108","110","106","108","110"]},"The content servers (, , ) each comprise one or more databases. Each content server performs a search on the data in the databases using the search query that is communicated from the client device . The results of the search are then sent back to the backend search module  which then sends the results to the client device . The content servers (, , ), backend search module , and client device  are devices comprising a processor, and non-transitory computer storage which contains machine instructions, that when executed by the processor, perform methods disclosed herein. These devices are interconnected via communications network . In one embodiment, communications network  may include the Internet . Other embodiments may comprise multiple client devices, such as client device . Hence, embodiments of the present invention may support multiple simultaneous users. The content servers (, , ) build internal, searchable databases based on existing regulatory corpuses  and . In practice, there may be many such regulatory corpuses. In one embodiment, the regulatory corpuses may include regulations available on the Internet from the US Food and Drug Administration, and counterpart agencies internationally.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","106","108","110","200","211","213","200","224","226","228","222","222","220","104","104","104","102","103","220","220"]},"Optionally, an embodiment may further comprise Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module . In some cases, relevant documents from Internet sources may not be in a text-searchable form, and may comprise graphics files such as TIFF files or PDF files with no searchable text. In this case, OCR module  performs an OCR process to convert information to text, such that it may be stored in one or more of the repositories (, , ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","333","333","332","330","334","334","333","332","330","333","330","332"]},"Documents and passages within full-text database  that match the search query from the original terms or synonyms are input to the emphasis algorithm . The emphasis algorithm  highlights important terms within the relevant passages and documents supplied by match algorithm , thereby creating emphasized relevant passages. The emphasis algorithm  highlights the terms and related synonyms from the search query . Emphasis algorithm  may provide emphasis (e.g. via boldface font, colors, underlining, highlighting, or a combination thereof), for important words in a regulatory context. These \u201cregulatory words\u201d may include, but are not limited to:","Shall, must, can, may, cannot, allow, permit, require, prohibit, ban, forbid.","Other words may also be included or omitted, depending on the application. The emphasis algorithm  may apply the regulatory words with a stemming process, such that \u201cstemmed regular words,\u201d which are various tenses of the words, also get highlighted. For example, with the regulatory word \u201cprohibit,\u201d it is also possible to highlight stemmed regulatory words such as \u201cprohibiting\u201d and \u201cprohibited\u201d by applying a word stemming process. The output of the emphasis algorithm is an emphasized document database (EDD)  that comprises the relevant documents and\/or passages from the full-text database  with the search terms, synonyms, and regulatory words emphasized. The EDD is then used as source material for generating guidelines for various substances. In one embodiment, the EDD is converted into a CSV (comma separated value) file, such that it may be imported into a formulation management software package, such as Optiva. The fields within the CSV file may include, but are not limited to, an automatically generated reference number for the guideline, packaging and labeling restrictions, date of the regulation, author of the regulation, country of the regulation, formulation restriction on composition percentages, and shelf life.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","440","440"]},"Content repository , which is \u201cEU Sweeteners\u201d is selected to be searched by selecting checkbox .
