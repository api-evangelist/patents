title: Drilling formation tester, apparatus and methods of testing and monitoring status of tester
abstract: An integrated drilling and evaluation system includes a drill string having an interior portion and a drill bit, carried on a lower end, that includes ports for communicating fluid between the interior portion of the drill string and an uncased well bore. A packer, carried above the drill bit, is operable for sealingly closing a well annulus. A tester valve inserted in the drill string is operable for sealingly closing the drill string. The packer and tester valve are cooperatively operable for isolating a subsurface zone of interest. The system includes monitoring means inserted in the drill string for monitoring a parameter of well fluid from the subsurface zone. Once the subsurface zone is isolated, well fluid is communicated into the interior portion of the drill string through the ports of the drill bit, received by the monitoring means, and tested without removing the drill string form the well.

No. 60\/165,229 filed Nov. 5, 1999.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the drilling of oil and gas wells. In another aspect, the present invention relates to systems and methods for drilling well bores and evaluating subsurface zones of interest as the well bores are drilled into such zones. In even another aspect, the present invention relates to monitoring the operability of test equipment during the drilling process.","2. Description of the Related Art","It is well known in the subterranean well drilling and completion arts to perform tests on formations intersected by a well bore. Such tests are typically performed in order to determine geological and other physical properties of the formations and fluids contained therein. For example, by making appropriate measurements, a formation's permeability and porosity, and the fluid's resistivity, temperature, pressure, and bubble point may be determined. These and other characteristics of the formation and fluid contained therein may be determined by performing tests on the formation before the well is completed.","It is of considerable economic importance for tests such as those described herein above to be performed as soon as possible after the formation has been intersected by the well bore. Early evaluation of the potential for profitable recovery of the fluid contained therein is very desirable. For example, such early evaluation enables completion operations to be planned more efficiently. In addition, it has been found that more accurate and useful information can be obtained if testing occurs as soon as possible after penetration of the formation.","As time passes after drilling, mud invasion and filter cake buildup may occur, both of which may adversely affect testing. Mud invasion occurs when formation fluids are displaced by drilling mud or mud filtrate. When invasion occurs, it may become impossible to obtain a representative sample of formation fluids or at a minimum, the duration of the sampling period must be increased to first remove the drilling fluid and then obtain a representative sample of formation fluids.","Similarly, as drilling fluid enters the surface of the well bore in a fluid permeable zone and leaves its suspended solids on the well bore surface, filter cake buildup occurs. The filter cakes act as a region of reduced permeability adjacent to the well bore. Thus, once filter cakes have formed, the accuracy of reservoir pressure measurements decrease, affecting the calculations for permeability and produceability of the formation. Where the early evaluation is actually accomplished during drilling operations within the well, the drilling operations may also be more efficiently performed, since results of the early evaluation may then be used to adjust parameters of the drilling operations. In this respect, it is known in the art to interconnect formation testing equipment with a drill string so that, as the well bore is being drilled, and without removing the drill string from the well bore, formations intersected by the well bore may be periodically tested.","In typical formation testing equipment suitable for interconnection with a drill string during drilling operations, various devices or systems are provided for isolating a formation from the remainder of the well bore, drawing fluid from the formation, and measuring physical properties of the fluid and the formation. Unfortunately, due to the constraints imposed by the necessity of interconnecting the equipment with the drill string, typical formation testing equipment is not suitable for use in these circumstances.","Typical formation testing equipment is unsuitable for use while interconnected with a drill string because they encounter harsh conditions in the well bore during the drilling process that can age and degrade the formation testing equipment before and during the testing process. These harsh conditions include vibration from the drill bit, exposure to drilling mud and formation fluids, hydraulic forces of the circulating drilling mud, and scraping of the formation testing equipment against the sides of the well bore.","Drill strings can extend thousands of feet underground. Testing equipment inserted with the drill string into the well bore can therefore be at great distances from the earth's surface (surface). Therefore, testing equipment added to the drill string at the surface is often in the well bore for days during the drilling process before reaching geologic formations to be tested. Also if there is a malfunction in testing equipment, removing the equipment from a well bore for repair can take a long time.","To determine the functional status or \u201chealth\u201d of formation testing equipment designed to be used during the drilling process, one technique is to deploy and operate the testing equipment at time intervals prior to reaching formations to be tested. These early test equipment deployments to evaluate their status can expose that equipment to greater degradation in the harsh well bore environment than without early deployment. It is well known in the art of logging-while-drilling (LWD) how to communicate from the surface to formation testing equipment in the well bore. Such testing equipment can be turned on and off from the surface and data collected by the testing equipment can be communicated to the surface. A common method of communication between testing equipment in the well bore and the surface is through pressure pulses in the drilling mud circulating between the testing equipment and the surface.","Another problem faced using formation test equipment on a drill string far down a well bore is to ensure that a series of steps in a test sequence are carried out in the proper sequence at the proper time. Communication from the earth's surface to formation testing equipment far down a well by drilling mud pulse code can take a relatively long time. Also, mud pulse communication can be confused by other equipment-caused pulses and vibrations in the drilling mud column between the down-hole testing equipment and the earth's surface.","However, in spite of the above advancements, there still exists a need in the art for apparatus and methods for a way to monitor the functional status or health of the formation testing equipment prior to its use without deploying the system.","There is another need in the art for apparatus and methods for identifying early component failures in the formation testing equipment that can cause subsequent component failures that hide early precipitating failures, which do not suffer from the disadvantages of the prior art apparatus and methods. There is even another need in the art for apparatus and methods for accomplishing test sequences by formation testing equipment down-hole automatically upon an initiating signal from the earth's surface.","These and other needs in the art will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon review of this specification, including its drawings and claims.","It is an object of the present invention to provide for an integrated well drilling and evaluation system for drilling and logging a well and testing in an uncased well bore portion of the well. Generally the system comprises a drill string, a drill bit for drilling the well bore, wherein the drill bit is carried on a lower end of the drill string. Also, there is a logging while drilling apparatus, supported by said drill string, that during drilling and logging will generate data indicative of the nature of subsurface formations intersected by the uncased well bore, so that a formation or zone of interest may be identified without removing the drill string from a well. There is a packer, carried on said drill string above said drill bit, having a set position for sealingly closing a well annulus between the drill string and the uncased well bore above the formation or zone of interest and having an unset position such that the drill bit may be rotated to drill the well bore, the packer being selectively positionable between the set position and the unset position. There is a tester, inserted in the drill string, for controlling flow of fluid between the formation and the drill string when the packer is in the set position. There is a function timer, included in the drill string, that during drilling and testing will control the operation of at least one of the logging while drilling apparatus, the packer, and the tester, whereby, the well can be selectively drilled, logged and tested without removing the drill string from the well.","It is another object of the present invention to provide for an integrated drilling and evaluation system for drilling and logging a well and testing in an uncased well bore of the well, comprising a drill string, a drill bit, carried on a lower end of the drill string, for drilling the well bore, a packer, carried on the drill string above the drill bit, for sealing a well annulus between the drill string and the uncased well bore above the drill bit means. There is a surge receptacle included in the drill string, a surge chamber means, constructed to mate with said surge receptacle, for receiving and trapping a sample of well fluid therein and a retrieval means for retrieving the surge chamber back to a surface location while the drill string remains in the uncased well bore. There is a logging while drilling means, included in the drill string, for generating data indicative of the nature of subsurface zones or formations intersected by the uncased well bore. There is a circulating valve included in said drill string above said surge receptacles, and a function timer, included in the drill string, that during drilling and testing will control the operation of at least one of the logging while drilling apparatus, the packer, and the tester.","It is even another object of the present invention to provide for an integrate drilling and evaluation system for drilling and logging a well and testing in an uncased well bore portion of the well, comprising a drill string, and a drill bit carried on a lower end of the drill string, for drilling the well bore. There is a packer for sealing a well annulus between the drill string and the uncased well bore above the drill bit, the packer being selectively positionable between set and unset positions; a valve, included in the drill string, for controlling the flow of fluid between the well bore below the packer and the drill string when the packer is in the set position.

There is a circulating valve included in the drill string above the valve and a function timer, included in the drill string, that during drilling and testing will control the operation of at least one of the logging while drilling apparatus, the packer, the valve, and the circulating valve.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide for a method of early evaluation of a well having an uncased well bore intersecting a subsurface zone or formation of interest, comprising providing a testing string in the well bore comprising a tubing string, a logging tool included in the tubing string; a packer carried on the tubing string, a fluid testing device included in the tubing string, and a function timer, included in the tubing string. The method further includes logging the well with the logging tool and thereby determining the location of the subsurface zone or formation of interest. The method also includes without removing the testing string from the well bore after the previous step, setting the packer in the well bore above the subsurface formation and sealing a well annulus between the testing string and the well bore; and flowing a sample of well fluid from the subsurface formation below the packer to the fluid testing device, and controlling the operation of at least one of the logging tool, the packer, and the fluid testing device with the function timer.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide for an integrated drilling and evaluation apparatus for drilling a well and testing in an uncased well bore of a well, comprising a drill string, a drill bit, carried on a lower end of the drill string, for drilling the well bore, a packer, carried on the drill string above the drill bit, for sealing against the uncased well bore when in a set position and thereby isolating at least a portion of a formation or zone of interest intersected by the well bore and for disengaging the uncased well bore when in an unset position, thereby allowing fluid flow between the packer and the uncased well bore when the drill bit is being used for drilling the well bore. There is a fluid monitoring system, included in the drill string, for determining fluid parameters of fluid in the formation or zone of interest.

The method further comprises drilling the well bore with the drill bit until the well bore intersects a formation or zone of interest. The method even further comprises, without removing the drilling and testing string from the well after the previous step, effecting a seal with the packer against the uncased well bore and thereby isolating at least a portion of the formation or zone of interest.

The method still further comprises, without removing the drilling and testing string from the well, controlling a sequence of operation of at least one of the packer, and the well fluid condition monitor.","These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon review of this specification, including its drawings and claims.","Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to , the apparatus and methods of the present invention are schematically illustrated.","A well  is defined by a well bore  extending downwardly from the earth's surface  and intersecting a first subsurface zone or formation of interest . A drill string  is shown in place within the well bore . The drill string  basically includes a coiled tubing or drill pipe string , a tester valve , packer means , a well fluid condition monitoring means , a logging while drilling means  and a drill bit .","The tester valve  may be generally referred to as a tubing string closure means for closing the interior of drill string  and thereby shutting in the subsurface zone or formation .","The tester valve  may, for example, be a ball-type tester valve as is illustrated in the drawings. However, a variety of other types of closure devices may be utilized for opening and closing the interior of drill string . One such alternative device is illustrated and described below with regard to . The packer means  and tester valve  may be operably associated so that the valve  automatically closes when the packer means  is set to seal the uncased well bore . For example, the ball-type tester valve  may be a weight set tester valve and have associated therewith an inflation valve communicating the tubing string bore above the tester valve with the inflatable packer element  when the closure valve  moves from its open to its closed position. Thus, upon setting down weight to close the tester valve , the inflation valve communicated with the packer element  is opened and fluid pressure within the tubing string  may be increased to inflate the inflatable packer element . Other arrangements can include a remote controlled packer and tester valve which are operated in response to remote command signals such as is illustrated below with regard to .","As will be understood by those skilled in the art, various other arrangements of structure can be used for operating the tester valve  and packer element . For example, both the valve and packer can be weight operated so that when weight is set down upon the tubing string, a compressible expansion-type packer element is set at the same time that the tester valve  is moved to a closed position.","The packer means  carries an expandable packer element  for sealing a well annulus  between the tubing string  and the well bore . The packing element  may be either a compression type packing element or an inflatable type packing element. When the packing element  is expanded to a set position as shown in , it seals the well annulus  there below adjacent the subsurface zone or formation . The subsurface zone or formation  communicates with the interior of the test string  through ports  present in the drill bit .","The well fluid condition monitoring means  contains instrumentation for monitoring and recording various well fluid perimeters such as pressure and temperature. It may for example be constructed in a fashion similar to that of Anderson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,866,607, assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The Anderson et al. device monitors pressure and temperature and stores it in an on board recorder. That data can then be recovered when the tubing string  is removed from the well. Alternatively, the well fluid condition monitoring means  may be a Halliburton RT-91 system which permits periodic retrieval of data from the well through a wire line with a wet connect coupling which is lowered into engagement with the device . This system is constructed in a fashion similar to that shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,236,048 to Skinner et al., assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Another alternative monitoring system  can provide constant remote communication with a surface command station (not shown) through mud pulse telemetry or other remote communication system, as further described hereinbelow.","The logging while drilling means  is of a type known to those skilled in the art which contains instrumentation for logging subterranean zones or formations of interest during drilling. Generally, when a zone or formation of interest has been intersected by the well bore being drilled, the well bore is drilled through the zone or formation and the formation is logged while the drill string is being raised whereby the logging while drilling instrument is moved through the zone or formation of interest.","The logging while drilling tool may itself indicate that a zone or formation of interest has been intersected. Also, the operator of the drilling rig may independently become aware of the fact that a zone or formation of interest has been penetrated. For example, a drilling break may be encountered wherein the rate of drill bit penetration significantly changes. Also, the drilling cuttings circulating with the drilling fluid may indicate that a petroleum-bearing zone or formation has been intersected.","The logging while drilling means  provides constant remote communication with a surface command station by means of a remote communication system of a type described hereinbelow.","The drill bit  can be a conventional rotary drill bit and the drill string can be formed of conventional drill pipe. Preferably, the drill bit  includes a down hole drilling motor  for rotating the drill bit whereby it is not necessary to rotate the drill string. A particularly preferred arrangement is to utilize coiled tubing as the string  in combination with a steerable down hole drilling motor  for rotating the drill bit  and drilling the well bore in desired directions. When the drill string  is used for directional drilling, it preferably also includes a measuring while drilling means  for measuring the direction in which the well bore is being drilled. The measuring while drilling means  is of a type well known to those skilled in the art which provides constant remote communication with a surface command station.","Referring to , and particularly , the drill string  is shown extending through a conventional blow-out preventor stack  located at the surface . The drill string  is suspended from a conventional rotary drilling rig (not shown) in a well known manner. The drill string  is in a drilling position within the well bore , and it is shown after drilling the well bore through the first subsurface zone of interest . The packer element  is in a retracted position and the tester valve  is in an open position so that drilling fluids may be circulated down through the drill string  and up through the annulus  in a conventional manner during drilling operations.","During drilling, the well bore  is typically filled with a drilling fluid which includes various additives including weighting materials whereby there is an overbalanced hydrostatic pressure adjacent the subsurface zone . The overbalanced hydrostatic pressure is greater than the natural formation pressure of the zone  so as to prevent the well from blowing out.","After the well bore  has intersected the subsurface zone , and that fact has become known to the drilling rig operator as result of a surface indication from the logging while drilling tool  or other means, the drilling is continued through the zone . If it is desired to test the zone  to determine if it contains hydrocarbons which can be produced at a commercial rate, a further survey of the zone  can be made using the logging while drilling tool . As mentioned above, to facilitate the additional logging, the drill string  can be raised and lowered whereby the logging tool  moves through the zone .","Thereafter, a variety of tests to determine the hydrocarbon production capabilities of the zone  can be conducted by operating the tester valve , the packer means  and the well fluid condition monitoring means . Specifically, the packer  is set whereby the well annulus  is sealed and the tester valve  is closed to close the drilling string , as shown in . This initially traps adjacent the subsurface zone  the overbalance hydrostatic pressure that was present in the annulus  due to the column of drilling fluid in the well bore . The fluids trapped in the well annulus  below packer  are no longer communicated with the column of drilling fluid, and thus, the trapped pressurized fluids will slowly leak off into the surrounding subsurface zone , i.e., the bottom hole pressure will fall-off. The fall-off of the pressure can be utilized to determine the natural pressure of the zone  using the technique described in our copending application entitled Early Evaluation By Fall-Off Testing, designated as attorney docket number HRS 91.225B1, filed concurrently herewith, the details of which are incorporated herein by reference. As will be understood, the well fluid condition monitoring means  continuously monitors the pressure and temperature of fluids within the closed annulus  during the pressure fall-off testing and other testing which follows.","Other tests which can be conducted on the subsurface zone  to determine its hydrocarbon productivity include flow tests. That is, the tester valve  can be operated to flow well fluids from the zone  to the surface at various rates. Such flow tests which include the previously described draw-down and build-up tests, open flow tests and other similar tests are used to estimate the hydrocarbon productivity of the zone over time. Various other tests where treating fluids are injected into the zone  can also be conducted if desired.","Depending upon the particular tests conducted, it may be desirable to trap a well fluid sample without the necessity of flowing well fluids through the drill string to the surface. A means for trapping such a sample is schematically illustrated in . As shown in , a surge chamber receptacle  is included in the drill string  along with the other components previously described. In order to trap a sample of the well fluid from the subsurface zone , a surge chamber  is run on a wire line  into engagement with the surge chamber receptacle . The surge chamber  is initially empty or contains atmospheric pressure, and when it is engaged with the surge chamber receptacle , the tester valve  is opened whereby well fluids from the subsurface formation  flow into the surge chamber . The surge chamber  is then retrieved with the wire line . The surge chamber  and associated apparatus may, for example, be constructed in a manner similar to that shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,111,169 to Hyde, the details of which are incorporated herein by reference.","After the subsurface zone  is tested as described above, the packer  is unset, the tester valve  is opened and drilling is resumed along with the circulation of drilling fluid through the drill string  and well bore .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 1D","b":["12","46","46","24","22","46"]},"As will now be understood, the integrated well drilling and evaluation system of this invention is used to drill a well bore and to evaluate each subsurface zone or formation of interest encountered during the drilling without removing the drill string from the well bore. Basically, the integrated drilling and evaluation system includes a drill string, a logging while drilling tool in the drill string, a packer carried on the drill string, a tester valve in the drill string for controlling the flow of fluid into or from the formation of interest from or into the drill string, a well fluid condition monitor for determining conditions such as the pressure and temperature of the well fluid and a drill bit attached to the drill string.

As shown in , a sample of well fluid may be taken from the subsurface zone or formation  by running a surge chamber  on a wire line  into engagement with the surge chamber receptacle . When the surge chamber  is engaged with the surge chamber receptacle , a passageway communicating the surge chamber  with the subsurface zone or formation  is opened so that well fluids flow into the surge chamber . The surge chamber  is then retrieved with the wire line . Repeated sampling can be accomplished by removing the surge chamber, evacuating it and then running it back into the well.","Referring now to  another modified drill string B is illustrated. The modified drill string B is similar to the drill string A of , and identical parts carry identical numerals. The drill string B is different from the drill string A in that it includes a straddle packer  having upper and lower packer elements  and  separated by a packer body  having ports (not shown) therein for communicating the bore of tubing string  with the well bore  between the packer elements  and .","After the well bore  has been drilled and the logging while drilling tool  has been operated to identify the various zones of interest such as the subsurface zone , the straddle packer elements  and  are located above and below the zone . The inflatable elements  and  are then inflated to set them within the well bore  as shown in . The inflation and deflation of the elements  and  are controlled by physical manipulation of the tubing string  from the surface. The details of construction of the straddle packer  may be found in our copending application entitled Early Evaluation System, designated as attorney docket number HRS 91.225A1, filed concurrently herewith, the details of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The drill strings A and B both include an electronic control sub  for receiving remote command signals from a surface control station. The electronic control system  is schematically illustrated in . Referring to , electronic control sub  includes a sensor transmitter  which can receive communication signals from a surface control station and which can transmit signals and data back to the surface control station. The sensor\/transmitter  is communicated with an electronic control package  through appropriate interfaces . The electronic control package  may for example be a microprocessor based controller. A battery pack  provides power by way of power line  to the control package .","The electronic control package  generates appropriate drive signals in response to the command signals received by sensor\/transmitter , and transmits those drive signals over electric lines  and  to an electrically operated tester valve  and an electric pump , respectively. The electrically operated tester valve  may be the tester valve  schematically illustrated in , A\u2013C and FIG . The electronically powered pump  takes well fluid from either the annulus  or the bore of tubing string  and directs it through hydraulic line  to the inflatable packer  to inflate the inflatable elements  thereof.","Thus, the electronically controlled system shown in  can control the operation of tester valve  and inflatable packer  in response to command signal received from a surface control station. Also, the measuring while drilling tool , the logging while drilling tool , the functional status monitor  may be connected with the electronic control package  over electric lines , , , and .","Functional status monitor  has at least three benefits: (1) it warns of system degradation, while still potentially operational; (2) it warns of test system problems that can put the entire drilling operation at risk; and (3) it identifies component failure.","While drilling formation tester (DFT) tools comprising tester valve , circulating valve , packers ,  and  are in \u201csleep\u201d or low power mode, functional status monitor  occasionally monitors sensors to check the functional status of the test system. A status bit can be sent to indicate that the tool has a change in functional status. Such a status message would alert an operator that a potential problem could occur. An attached LWD communication system would report the status bit change to the operator. The functional status monitor  may comprise independent electronics or may be part of the tool electronics. The status monitor  function includes sensors that monitor the system.","Depending upon the types of sensors utilized, the functional status monitor evaluates one or more of the following:\n\n","It should be understood that any suitable definition scheme can be utilized for assigning meaning to the information bits.

Thus, the electronic control sub  in combination with the packer and valve apparatus  can selectively set and unset the packer  and independently selectively open and close the inflatable valve element .","As will be understood, many different systems can be utilized to send command signals from a surface location down to the electronic control sub . One suitable system is the signaling of the electronic control package  of the sub  and receipt of feedback from the control package  using acoustical communication which may include variations of signal frequencies, specific frequencies, or codes of acoustic signals or combinations of these. The acoustical transmission media includes tubing string, electric line, slick line, subterranean soil around the well, tubing fluid and annulus fluid. An example of a system for sending acoustical signals down the tubing string is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,375,239; 4,347,900; and 4,378,850 all to Barrington and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Other systems which can be utilized include mechanical or pressure activated signaling, radio wave transmission and reception, microwave transmission and reception, fiber optic communications, and the others which are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5, 555,945 to Schultz et al., the details of which are incorporated herein by reference.","While the illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described with particularity, it will be understood that various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the examples and descriptions set forth herein but rather that the claims be construed as encompassing all the features of patentable novelty which reside in the present invention, including all features which would be treated as equivalents thereof by those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A\u20131D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A\u20132C","FIGS. 1A\u20131C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
