title: Method for visualizing user path through a web site and a path's associated information scent
abstract: A method and system for visualizing actual and predicted usage patterns through a web site is provided. A plurality of web pages may be represented as a node and visualized on a dome tree. The dome tree is a three-dimensional image of a dome, with a portion of the outer wall removed, displayed on a two-dimensional monitor. Paths into and out of each node are displayed using a variety of colors and patterns and information relating to the nodes and paths may also be accessed. By designating a web page as the root node each of the associated pages are laid out within the dome tree radially based on actual usage information. Predicted information for each node is displayed as a bar near the node, thereby assisting a user in understanding the relationship between actual and predicted usage patterns.

Field of the Invention","The present invention is related to the field of displaying generalized graph structures and access patterns, such as World Wide Web sites, actual usage patterns, and predicted usage patterns, so that the important relationships are exposed.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","The World-Wide Web (\u201cweb\u201d) is perhaps the most important information access mechanism to be introduced to the general public in the 20th Century. As larger numbers of organizations rely on the Internet to distribute information to potential consumers and investors, they also realize its potential for distributing and organizing large volumes of data for later retrieval by employees and business partners. A company's web site is rapidly becoming one of its most important business investments.","As an information repository, a web site generally receives high amounts of usage. Due to the current trend of such high use, there is an increasing demand to efficiently organize a web site, prior to and after deployment, so that users can easily find the information they are looking for. For example, if it is predicted that users will often be searching for sales literature when they access a site it would be beneficial to provide a link on the initial page to the literature, or display the relevant literature on the initial page, thereby eliminating the need for a user to delve through several web pages before finding the information.","Once the web page has been deployed there is an ongoing need for analysts to be able to determine whether their predicted access patterns resemble actual usage. This information includes how the site is actually accessed, user access patterns, and whether users are finding the information they are searching for. Analysts want to be able to analyze the evolving web site, its use, and compare that data with predicted data.","Because of analysts' increasing desire to predict a user's access patterns, needs and goals, and discover and understand a user's actual access patterns, relationships between web page content and access patterns, and to efficiently structure a web sites' topology, a need exists far a set of visualization tools which aid in the process of web site design, analysis, and comparison of actual and predicted data. Since web sites are dynamically changing over time, analysts need to understand how changes to the topology affect usage and whether the actual usage resembles predicted usage. Although some conventional web site dispIay methods encode usage information in the visualization, conventional methods do not reference usage information in generating the structure to be displayed from the generalized graph structure. Additionally, typical methods do not allow analysts to compare predicted data with actual data. Moreover, conventional systems do not allow visualization of data in a three-dimensional area in such a way that occlusion of data is reduced.","A conventional technique for understanding a complex generalized graph structure is to display a representation of the links and nodes which constitute the generalized graph structure. One view of the World Wide Web is that of a generalized graph structure, with nodes representing web pages and lines representing use paths or links between the nodes. Because of the complexity of the generalized graph structure as evidenced by the large number of links between nodes, some links of the generalized graph structure are usually not presented in the representation so as to enable a viewer or user to effectively process the representation.","According to an aspect of the present invention, roughly described, a method for displaying a tree structure having a root node and a plurality of first level nodes is provided. The method comprising the steps of positioning the root node on a two dimensional plane, positioning the plurality of first level nodes in the tree structure radially outward a first distance from the root node, and shifting the plurality of first level nodes a second distance relative to the plane, thereby creating a three dimensional effect of a dome between the root node and the plurality of first level nodes.","According to another aspect ofthe present invention the tree structure further includes a plurality of second level nodes, and the method further includes the steps of positioning the plurality of second level nodes on the plane radially about the root node a third distance which is greater than the first distance, and shifting the plurality of second level nodes a fourth distance relative to the plane.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, a method for displaying information related to a node is provided. The method comprising the steps of selecting the node, displaying a first set of paths, representing paths into the node, responsive to selecting the node, displaying a second set of paths, representing paths out of the node, responsive to selecting the node, and displaying a list of information related to the selected node.","According to yet another aspect ofthe present invention, an article of manufacture including an information storage medium wherein is stored information for programming a computer to perform a method of displaying a tree structure having a root node and a plurality of first level nodes is provided. The method comprising the steps of positioning the root node on a two dimensional plane, positioning the plurality of first level nodes in the tree structure radially outward a first distance from the root node, and shifting the plurality of first level nodes a second distance relative to the plane, thereby creating a three dimensional effect of a dome between the root node and the plurality of first level nodes.","According to an aspect of the present invention, an article of manufacture including an information storage medium wherein is stored information for programming a computer to perform a method of displaying information related to a node, is provided. The method comprising the steps of selecting the node, displaying a first set of paths, representing paths into the node, responsive to selecting the node, displaying a second set of paths, representing paths out of the node, responsive to selecting the node, and displaying a list of information related to the selected node.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for displaying a tree structure having a root node and a plurality of first level nodes, is provided. The apparatus comprising a processor, a display device in communication with the processor, and a processor readable storage medium in communication with the processor, containing process readable program code for programming the apparatus to perform a method of displaying the tree structure. The method including the steps of positioning the root node on a two dimensional plane, positioning the plurality of first level nodes in the tree structure radially outward a first distance from the root node, and shifting the plurality of first level nodes a second distance relative to the plane, thereby creating a three dimensional effect of a dome between the root node and the plurality of first level nodes.","According to another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for displaying information related to a node is provided. The apparatus includes a processor, a display device in communication with the processor, and a processor readable storage medium in communication with the processor, containing process readable program code for programming the apparatus to perform the method displaying information related to a node. The method comprising the steps of selecting the node, displaying a first set of paths, representing paths into the node, responsive to selecting the node, displaying a second set of paths, representing paths out of the node, responsive to selecting the node, and displaying a list of information related to the selected node.","The Figures are more fully explained in the following Detailed Description. In the Figures, like reference numerals denote the same elements; however, like parts are sometimes labeled with different reference numerals in different Figures in order to clearly describe embodiments of the present invention.","The world wide web is a complex large directed graph. Visualizing a directed graph is a well-known and difficult problem. In fact, none of the current graph layout algorithms can deal with a 7,000-node graph in a reasonable manner. However, as a sub-domain of directed graphs, web site linkage structures tend to be rather hierarchical. That is, while a web site is not a tree, a tree representation often approximates a web site well. While the scope of the present invention extends far beyond applications to the web, the web is used to exemplify embodiments of the present invention.","Using a breadth-first traversal algorithm transforms a web graph into a tree by placing a node, which represents a web page, as closely to the root node as possible. After obtaining this tree, the structure may then be visualized using a dome tree visualization technique, according to an embodiment of the present invention.","A dome tree exists in a three dimensional work space and is created by stacking and aligning a two-dimensional three-quarter(\u00be) circular slice for each layer into a tiered dome representation. Each successive three-quarter circle has a diameter which is larger than the preceding three-quarter circle and denotes levels in the tree. Each layer is augmented in the third dimension, thereby producing what appears to be a dome having a quarter of the wall removed. Because conventional display monitors are two dimensional display devices, a three-dimensional display structure must be projected onto the two dimensional display. The third dimension is thus projected onto the first two. However, this projection does not negate the power of the three dimensional structure. Most readers can easily attest that although movies are projected onto a two dimensional screen, the three dimensional content being displayed is readily apparent. The three dimensional effect of the dome is enhanced in many respects. First, by connecting nodes of each layer with nodes of other layers based on access patterns it appears that the information is displayed on the inside of the dome and generating from the bottom of the dome, where the root node is located, outward. Additionally, removing a quarter of the dome wall creates the appearance that one is looking into the dome through a gap in the dome wall. Not only does removing a quarter of the dome wall enhance the three dimensional appearance, there is also no occlusion caused by the third dimension since a viewer can view the information by looking through the removed portion of the dome wall.","The layout algorithm runs in two passes. In the first pass, the algorithm traverses the entire hierarchy using post-order traversal. At each node, the algorithm calculates the number of leaf nodes in that sub-tree. So the total number of leaves in the tree is known. The algorithm then calculates the amount of angular space to be allocated for each leaf node (270 degrees divided by the total number of leaves). In the second pass, the algorithm traverses the hierarchy using breadth-first traversal. At each node, it allocates the amount of angular space for that node by looking to see how many leaf nodes are rooted at that sub-tree. In this manner, each leaf node is provided a fixed amount of angular space.","A viewer can gain increased understanding of visualizations if the choices made in mapping data into visual presentations is performed intelligently and strategically. The dome tree has several advantages. First, the structure of the tree is visualized compactly, with the pattern easily recognizable. Second, by eliminating a portion of the dome wall, in an embodiment one quarter of the dome wall, when viewed at different orientations and angles, there are no occlusion problems because it appears to a viewer that they are looking at the inside ofthe dome through the section that has been removed. Third, unlike conventional two dimensional trees, a viewer can manipulate the view of the dome tree in multiple ways. For example, a viewer can zoom into different portions of the dome tree, rotate the angle that the dome tree is being viewed from, or alter the shape of the dome tree thereby increasing or decreasing the distance between nodes and levels.","The visualization itself actually validates the choice of a usage-based traversal algorithm. The high traffic areas are usually concentrated near the root node. This means that the algorithm places easy to reach nodes starting from the root node. As the nodes get farther and farther away from the root node, the node has a lesser possibility of being accessed. Since there are normally a larger quantity of high traffic nodes near the root node the dome tree design provides a visually pleasing arrangement of the nodes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","104","105","105","104","107","103","108","106","110","109","100","101","101","100","101","100","101","100","102","107","108","109","103","110","106","104","105","101","102","109","101","102","109","100"]},"In an embodiment, the external storage  may include an operating system , such as Microsoft Windows\u00ae, or Unix\u00ae which is capable of executing programs or applications using the general purpose computer .

The angle formed by an outer most leaf , the outer most leaf point , and the root node  is 150\u00b0. Therefore, the angle of parent node  is the angle bisecting that 150\u00b0 angle. Similarly, parent point  has children points , , and . The children points  and  together with the root node  form a 60\u00b0 angle, therefore parent point  is placed at an angle which bisects that 60\u00b0 angle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["600","500","550","560","570","580","600","650","660","670","680","6","601","501","602","616","502","516","5"]},"The shaded portions , of the dome tree  represent what appears to be the outside of the dome. Due to the orientation of the dome tree , nodes , , , and  are covered by a portion of the dome and thus not viewable through the gap in the dome tree . The dome tree  may be altered, moved, shifted, or rotated in any direction, thereby allowing an unobstructed view of every node within the dome . In an embodiment, the outer portion ofthe dome, represented as shaded areas , may be transparent, so that nodes covered by these portions may still be seen. Alternatively, the dome may be inverted, thereby creating an image that appears to have the nodes on the outer portion of the dome.","The dome tree  need not be a pure curved dome, as represented in FIG. . For example, the dome tree may be augmented in the z direction in a step down fashion. In a dome tree represented using step down, it appears as if each layer, or three-quarter circle is a step down into the dome. This appearance makes each layer, or depth of the tree structure more apparent when viewed on a two-dimensional monitor . A step down dome tree is realized by either augmenting each three-quarter circle , , ,  a different distance in the z direction or increasing the size of each three-quarter circle , , ,  so that the dome is not purely conical.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the layout of graph structures is performed based upon preference information. Whereas conventional layout methods are based primarily upon either topology or content, the methods according to an embodiment of the present invention encode additional information by prioritizing (or ranking) some parameter, such as usage. These methods provide degree of interest functions for graph visualizations, thereby minimizing cognitive load.","Embodiments of the present invention address the problem of laying out large directed graphs, such as found in the world wide web, predicted access patterns and actual access patterns, so that the relevant relationships are exposed. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a usage based traversal turns a general graph into a tree. The order of traversal, order of layout, or both are chosen based upon usage data such as simple frequencies or cogitation frequencies. Using embodiments of the present invention, an Intranet view for a company can be dynamically organized.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, additional information is encoded into graph visualizations by laying out graphs based on actual or predicted usage-based information. A technique for obtaining usage based information is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/062,341, entitled \u201cUsage Based Methods Of Traversing and Displaying Generalized Graph Structures,\u201d incorporated above. For example, in information retrieval, hypertext documents are accessed in various frequencies (some are more popular than others). According to an embodiment of the present invention, the popularity of an item helps determine the priority the item will receive in the layout of the graph. By coupling the usage data and encoding it into the structural layout of the graph, changes in usage and topology can be viewed at the same time.","While the scope of the proposed invention is not limited to documents on the world wide web, the web as viewed by an administrator of a web site is used as an example to ground the concepts of the present invention. The present invention allows web administrators in charge of maintenance to understand the relationship between a web site's predicted usage patterns, actual usage patterns and its topology.","In addition to visualizing the structure and topology of a web site, an embodiment of the present invention also displays information relevant to the web site's design. For example, analysts may view actual user paths as they travel through different web pages. Viewing actual user paths assists in determining whether the site is well organized or whether users will have to go through multiple pages to reach their goal.","Another example of information which may be viewed using embodiments of the present invention is user's predicted paths through a site. A technique for predicting user paths is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/540,976 entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Predicting Web User Flow By Determining Association Strength Of Hypermedia Links,\u201d incorporated above. Using this technique, predicted paths are generated based on the structure of a web site, a given user information goal, and a simulation of user flow through the site to reach the goal. The simulation is performed by starting hypothetical users at different web pages, each with the same goal and predicting the paths used to reach the goal.","Viewing this information is beneficial in designing a web site to be more efficient and user friendly. For example, predicting user's paths to a given goal assists in determining whether random patterns are used to access the goal or whether a particular route is used.","Still another example of information that may be viewed using embodiments of the present invention is user's information goals. A technique for predicting user information goals is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/540,063, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Inferring User Information Need In A Hypermedia Linked Document Collection,\u201d incorporated above. Using this technique, user information goals are predicted based on the structure of a web site, observed user paths, and a simulation of user flow through the site. Viewing this information is beneficial in determining the type of data that interests users. For example, if it is predicted that users are interested in the stock price of a company, a web site will be more efficient if that information is placed in a highly traveled area. Alternatively, if it is predicted that a particular product for sale is often a goal, sales may increase by making that product more accessible.","In addition to viewing actual and predicted user paths and goals, an embodiment of the present invention allows viewing of this information together. Viewing both actual and predicted information allows analysts and developers to determine whether a design based on predicted patterns is actually being followed. When viewing actual and predicted paths, the predicted paths may be displayed as bars on the dome tree. Each bar represents the likelihood that a user, given a goal, will traverse a particular path. The longer the bar, the higher the likelihood. (Throughout this document, the likelihood of traversing a path maybe referred to as the strength of a scent).","Each ofthe above-described techniques generate a usage log. Also, actual user logs can be generated from session logs, or cookies. Once a log has been assembled, frequently traveled user paths may be generated for layout on a visual display. Because of the complexity and sheer number of links, some information maybe filtered out to enable effective cognitive visual processing. One technique for generating frequent user paths is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application, Ser. No. 09\/444,208, entitled \u201cSystem For Predictive Modeling Using Longest Repeating Subsequences,\u201d incorporated above.","This technique takes the log, either actual or predicted, and constructs frequent user paths between nodes. For analysis purposes, highly traveled paths tend to be the most interesting. For this reason, infrequently traveled paths are filtered out. Each path and node contains usage information such as how many users have traveled along this path or through this node, where they are going, where they came from, and other related information. In an alternative embodiment, the paths generated for viewing information may be generated from the usage logs. In such an embodiment, there is no need to use a filtering technique for generating frequent user paths.","An embodiment of the present invention employs usage information to make layout decisions for a variety of layout algorithms. Some of these algorithms attempt to maximize screen real estate while others function by trying to reveal subtle relationships amongst the elements. Frequency, recency, spacing of accesses, and path information are all forms of usage information which can be referenced according to the methods of the present invention. Additionally, derived usage information like need odds and cogitation clustering can also be used, though the present invention is not limited to only these forms.","One method to layout a topology according to an embodiment of the present invention involves starting with a node, called the root node, and spreading out the links radially on three-quarter circles, about the node. The ancillary nodes then repeat until the screen real estate is consumed. To optimally layout the nodes, the layout algorithm may wish to place the highest-used nodes farthest apart from each other so that they have the most growth space. The lowest-used nodes are then placed in the remaining space between the high-usage nodes. The layout continues to place nodes the farthest apart from each other based upon usage values, around the three-quarter circles. The highest used nodes are optimally separated from each other allowing plenty of screen real estate for their related children nodes to be placed. This is done at the expense of the less used nodes.","Another layout method according to an embodiment of the present invention orders the nodes by usage and then lays them out from high to low (or low to high) to reveal popularity (or deadwood).","As an example of usage-based layout, a modified breadth first traversal of a graph according to an embodiment of the present invention encodes usage in its structure. In a traditional breadth-first traversal based layout, the immediate children of the root node are laid out, then their children. Conventionally, the order in which the children are visited is not specified in the traversal. However, according to an embodiment of the present invention, additional information is encoded into the graph layout simply by choosing a visitation order based on some parameter. For example, the visitation order is determined by sorting nodes based on the amounts of usage (favor popular web pages over less popular ones).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["1","9","1","712","2","2","721","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","700","1","9","800","1","9","1","9","800","1","9","6","763","3","7","778","8","800","700","800","700","800"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 7","FIG. 9"],"b":["900","700","1","901","900","8","908","900","900","900","1","9","900"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIGS. 10"],"b":["1000","14","18"]},"In an embodiment of the present invention, the software methods illustrated by , , and  may be stored in an article of manufacture, such as a computer readable medium. For example, the software may be stored in a magnetic hard disk, an optical disk, a floppy disk, CD-ROM (Compact Disk Read-Only Memory), RAM(Random Access Memory), ROM (Read-Only Memory), or other readable or writeable data storage technologies, singly or in combination.","The method  begins at step  with the claiming of a root node. In order to generate a tree structure by a breadth first algorithm, the root node must be specified so that the depth of any node can be calculated relative to the root node. The claiming of the root node in step  can occur by a variety of mechanisms. For example, a user may place his cursor on a specific node of a generalized graph structure displayed on a computer monitor using his cursor control device and then select the node by pressing a button on the mouse . Alternatively, the root node may be claimed by implication from its node name. For example, in a web site, the web home page may have a URL (universal resource locator) which has a semantic structure which indicates that it must be the root node. For example, Xerox Corporation's home web page located at URL www.xerox.com may be parsed by a program implementing the methods according to an embodiment ofthe present invention, and this program may recognize that this web page is the root node of the web site to which the program is being applied by virtue of the name of the node. In any case, once a root node is specified at step , the current depth is set to zero at step . Step  merely specifies that the depth of the root node is, by definition, zero. This definition was illustrated in the tree structure  in  relative to the root node  at depth zero. At step , the method visits the claimed node having the highest usage parameter associated with it, which is at the current depth and which has not yet already been visited. When this step  is encountered for the first time during an execution of the method , the only node which will have been claimed is the root node, and the root node will also be the only node which exists at the current depth, and it will have not yet been visited. Therefore, the first time that step  is encountered in the method , the root node is visited.","At step , the method claims all children of the currently visited node, which have not already been claimed. The nodes which are claimed in step  can be easily identified by referring to the topology matrix and usage parameter vector. The children which should be claimed at step  are those nodes which have nonzero entries in the visited node's row of the topology matrix which have not already been claimed.","At step , the method  determines whether or not there are any additional claimed nodes at the current depth which have not yet been visited. The first time that step  is encountered in the method , the answer to the test presented in  will be no, because the only node at the current depth of zero is the root node itself. Therefore, branch  takes the method to step  where the current depth is incremented. The first time that step  is encountered in the method , the current depth will be set to one.","At step , the method  determines if there are any nodes at the current depth (which was just increased). In other words, test  determines whether or not all nodes in the generalized graph structure have been both claimed and visited. If there are no nodes at the current depth, then all nodes have been claimed and visited and branch  takes the method to completion at step . However, assuming that there are nodes at the newly incremented current depth, branch  takes a method back to step .
