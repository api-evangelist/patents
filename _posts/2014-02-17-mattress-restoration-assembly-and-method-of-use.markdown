Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to mattresses and mattress pads and more particularly pertains to a new Mattress Restoration Assembly and Method of Use for filling in body impressions formed in a mattress over time, to provide additional support, and to provide additional user comfort for worn mattresses.","2. Description of the Prior Art","The use of mattress pads and mattress repair systems is known in the prior art. More specifically, mattress repair systems heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.","One such illustrative example is United States Patent Application Publication 2006\/0117486, which requires a user to open up a mattress to be repaired, terminating any warranty, and to insert one or more inflatable bladders to provide additional support.","In these respects, the Mattress Restoration Assembly according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of providing additional support, filling in impressions caused by collapsed foam, padding or other support means.","In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of mattress repair systems now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new Mattress Restoration System and Method of Use wherein the same can be utilized for filling in impressions formed in the mattress, provide additional support, and improve user comfort.","To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a mattress abutting cover member positionable on the mattress to be restored, at least one support member operationally coupled to the mattress abutting cover member; a top cover member positioned over the mattress abutting cover member and the support member; and a securing means for selectively securing the mattress restoration assembly to the mattress.","There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.","In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.","As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention. It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.","One significant advantage of the present invention is the ability to fill in impressions formed in the mattress over time with a new support member, such as a poly foam rather than trying to push a collapsed or failed foam support into position with an air bladder.","Another significant advantage of the present invention is the ability to fill in the impressions formed into the mattress and to provide additional support without voiding the warranty of the mattress.","Further advantages of the invention, along with the various features of novelty which characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and the specific objects attained by its uses, reference should be made to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which there are illustrated preferred embodiments of the invention.","With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to  thereof, a new mattress restoration assembly embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral  will be described.","The mattress restoration assembly at its most basic includes at least one impression filling member , which is positioned in an impression formed in a mattress to be restored and a mattress topper assembly  which may be positioned on top of the mattress to be restored and the impression filling member .","In at least one preferred embodiment, the mattress restoration assembly  includes a first impression filling member  and a second impression filling member . The first impression filling member  may be trimmed by a user to substantially fit within and at least partially fill the impression to be filled. Preferably, the first impression filling member  has a thickness between 0.25 and 2 inches and more preferably is approximately 1 inch. The second impression filling member  may also be trimmed by a user to substantially fit within and at least partially fill the impression to be filled. Preferably, the second impression filling member  has a thickness between 0.25 and 2 inches and more preferably is 0.5 inches in thickness. The user may use both the first impression filling member  and the second impression filling member  to substantially fill in an impression in the mattress. Further, the user may use the first impression filling member  or the second impression filling member  individually, repetitively, or in combination as desired to fill the impressions in the mattress.","The use may affix either the first  or second impression filling member  to the mattress or to the mattress topper assembly  or to each other. From the perspective of maintaining warranty coverage for the mattress, it is preferable that the impression filling members ,  be affixed to the mattress topper assembly . Typically, the impression filling members ,  are affixed using an adhesive.","The present invention also contemplates the instance where a user prefers to have the impression filling members ,  cut to size and affixed to the mattress topper assembly  by the factory, rather than performing these operations themselves. In such a case, the impression geometry needs to be determined, communicated, and utilized to produce a custom restoration assembly.","Generally, the impression filling members ,  are made from poly foam, gel foam, memory foam, latex, synthetic latex, fabric pad, or thermal pad. The first  and second impression filling members  may be made from different materials or the same materials.","Similarly, the mattress topper assembly  may consist of one or more layers, each of which may be made from poly foam, gel foam, memory foam, latex, synthetic latex, fabric pad, or thermal pad.","In at least one embodiment, the mattress topper assembly  includes a main support member  and a main covering member . The main support member  is designed cover the top surface of the mattress to be restored. The main covering member  covers the top surface and a perimeter edge surface of said main support member .","In a further embodiment, the mattress topper assembly  includes multiple support members . Support members  may be oriented in longitudinally, or laterally, and may cover substantially all of the top surface of the mattress or a portion of the top surface of the mattress.","In still a further embodiment, the mattress topper assembly  includes a plurality of spring assemblies  positioned in a spaced array along a length of the assembly  and either along approximately one half of the width of the assembly  or along substantially the whole width of the assembly . Generally the plurality of spring assemblies  is positioned underneath the main support member.","In yet a further embodiment, the mattress topper assembly  also includes a lumbar support member , which generally runs laterally along a central third of the mattress topper assembly .","In still a further embodiment, the mattress topper assembly  includes a hip support member , which generally runs laterally along a central third of the mattress topper .
