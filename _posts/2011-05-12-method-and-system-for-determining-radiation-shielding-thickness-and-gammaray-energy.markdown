The contents of this application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357 between the United States Government and the UChicago Argonne, LLC, representing Argonne National Laboratory.","This invention pertains to radiation detection. More specifically this invention relates to determination of shielding thickness between a gamma-ray source and a detector.","This section is intended to provide a background or context to the invention that is, inter alia, recited in the claims. The description herein may include concepts that could be pursued, but are not necessarily ones that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","The need for accurate radiation surveillance is expanding as the perceived risk of unsecured nuclear materials entering and transmitting within the country increases. Tracking systems are required to detect, locate, and track a radiation source. Such a system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,465,924. After increased publicity of terrorist attacks there has been a fear that terrorists would carry a nuclear weapon or material into the US and cause catastrophic damage. One area of investigation has been on gamma radiation detection systems for shipping containers or trucks. This is a formidable task given the number of shipping containers, with the added consideration that the nuclear material\/device may be in a shielded location. Some solutions have been developed; however, the detection equipment is not lightweight, nor easily portable, detection times are slow, and require essentially a stationary target. The concern is that a terrorist would carry a radioactive source and detonate it at a public event, such as a football game. Because a source would have to be carried to such an event, sensors placed outside the event or in a nearby subway\/transit system could also provide an earlier detection method. In a crowded area, spectators provide shielding for the radioactive material in a nuclear device and make source detection difficult.","Current systems for detecting and tracking radioactive sources include a live video image of an area that includes the detected radioactive source. Further, current systems determine the most likely location of a radiation source. However, current systems lack the ability of determining the amount of shielding between the radiation source and a radiation detector. Current systems either make assumptions regarding the amount of shielding or ignore the impact of shielding.","Thus, there is a need for a source tracking system and methods for same which 1) determine the amount of shielding, 2) allow determination to be made in real-time, 3) allow for determination of the amount of shielding in a dynamic environment, and 4) rely on the spectral data from the source tracking system without the need for additional specialized detection equipment so that the source tracking system can more accurately predict the location of the source. These capabilities need to be provided in a way that maximizes the amount of data that the system can process.","One embodiment of the invention relates to a method of determining the shielding thickness for a radiation source using a plurality of distributed radiation detectors, a data collection and storage system in communication with the plurality of radiation detectors and a computer system in communication with the data storage and collection system, the computer system comprising a processor and a memory unit. The computer system includes instructions that when executed cause the system to: determine a background count; collect data for a gamma ray spectrum corresponding to each of the plurality of distributed radiation detectors for a predetermined time; normalize the collected gamma ray data; compute the signal as the difference between the background count and the normalized collected gamma ray data; calculate a signal-to-noise ratio using the computed signal; identify a portion of the spectrum corresponding to useful signal based upon the signal-to-noise ratio calculation; normalize the identified portion; compare the normalized identified portion to a predetermined reference; and compute for each of the plurality of distributed radiation detectors a shielding thickness between the radiation source and the respective detector. The system may further include further instructions to compute the location of the radiation source corrected for the computed shielding thickness. The computed location of the radiation source may be expressed in a graphical format, for example, a probability density plot.","In one embodiment, a method is provided for determining the shielding of a radiation source. The background count is determined. Data for a gamma ray spectrum corresponding to each of the plurality of distributed radiation detectors for a predetermined time is collected. The collected gamma ray data is normalized. The signal is computed as the difference between the background count and the normalized collected gamma ray data. A signal-to-noise ratio is calculated using the computed signal. A portion of the spectrum is identified as corresponding to a useful signal based upon the signal-to-noise ratio calculation. The identified portion is normalized. An offset between the normalized identified portion and a predetermined universal shielding curve is calculated. The shielding thickness between each detector and the radiation source is computed. The method may further include computing the location of the radiation source in view of the computed shielding thickness.","In one embodiment, a system is provided for determining the location of a shielded radiation source. The system includes a plurality of distributed radiation detectors. A data collection and storage system is provided in communication with the plurality of radiation detectors. A computer system in communication with the data storage and collection system is also included, the computer system comprising a processor and a memory unit. The computer system directs the system to: determine a background count; collect data for a gamma ray spectrum corresponding to each of the plurality of radiation detectors for a predetermined time; compute the signal as the difference between the background count and the normalized collected gamma ray data; calculate a signal-to-noise ratio using the computed signal; identify a portion of the spectrum corresponding to useful signal based upon the signal-to-noise ratio calculation; adjust the radiation counts by a correction factor; process radiation counts from each of the plurality of radiation detectors to determine a probability density function for the position of the shielded radiation source relative to the plurality of distributed radiation detectors; and output information indicative of the location of the shielded radiation source relative to the plurality of distributed radiation detectors.","These and other advantages and features of the invention, together with the organization and manner of operation thereof, will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like elements have like numerals throughout the several drawings described below.","In certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method and a system that utilizes data from an array of gamma-radiation detectors to track the movement of illicit radiological material in real-time while determining and accounting for shielding thickness between the radiation source and detectors. Radiation detectors for use with the present invention have been generally described in related applications; see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,465,924, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/881,928, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/881,943 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.","One embodiment of the detection system consists of gamma radiation detectors, networking for linking these detectors, signal processing algorithms, and a laptop for running the detection system, including the signal processing algorithms. The system is used to monitor an area and detect the presence of a radioactive source, to localize the position of the source, to track the movement of the source, and to identify the type of radioisotope. While numerous radiation detection systems are known, one embodiment of the invention uses a number of fixed detectors placed in any of a variety of configurations such as in a straight line, a square layout, or other non-linear layouts. The described method for real-time monitoring computes in essentially real-time the \u201ccrowd shielding\u201d that occurs when a radioactive source moves through an environment, such as a crowd of people, that provides shielding and creates a probability map that indicates the most probable location of that source. A method is provided for determining a radioactive source (for example, but not limited to uranium, plutonium, cobalt, etc.) in a crowd and accounts for the reduction in gamma ray intensity by the crowd. The system and methods described further below may be used to correct for the attenuating and scattering effects of the phantoms. In one embodiment, the calculated position of the source may be accurate to within one foot of the actual location. In one embodiment, it may be assumed that each person standing between the source and a gamma ray detector decrease the gamma ray strength by approximately 50%. Thus, the gamma ray signal drops off quickly in a crowd within two or three people being \u201cshields\u201d (i.e. between the source and the detector); however, the gamma ray attenuation plateaus and sensor detection remains fairly constant due to scatter off of the crowd, in fact potentially as well as off of the floor. The method described herein calculates the source energy by integrating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) up to that energy beyond which no further signal is detected (cutoff energy).","In one embodiment, each detector has 1,024 channels which provide an energy spectrum to the shielding system, and once the cutoff energy has been determined, the number of channels drops to about 100-500. It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, that the detector may have more or less than 1,024 channels and the actual number of channels prior to the cutoff energy may be more or less than 100-500. The gamma spectral data is compared with data in an existing library to identify the radiation source material. The probability map is updated, such as every second, with the data from the sensors being processed in about 0.1-0.2 seconds. In one embodiment, the system and method allows: 1) an accurate location of a radioactive source moving through a crowd can be determined in real-time, including the effects of \u201ccrowd shielding\u201d; 2) similarly, the effects of other shielding components (concrete pillars, cars, etc.) are also dynamically considered; 3) any gamma ray detector may be used; 4) multiple detectors are required and may be placed in any configuration; and 5) a gamma ray spectrum library is available and provides identification of the source (uranium, plutonium, and other elements).","Certain embodiments exploit the relationships that exist among multiple detectors deployed in a known spatial configuration, the inherent sensitivity characteristics of the detectors, the properties of radioactive sources, and the correlation among signals from multiple detectors. This information is used to minimize the probability of false positives and the probability of a missed positive (false negative) and provides an advantage in tracking sources in environments where the signal-to-noise ratio is low and would otherwise result in requirements that run counter to goals of equipment portability and reasonable cost.","The system determines a probabilistic estimate of source position in real-time by combining measured count rates with known models of radiation transport. The relationship between measured count rate and source-to-detector distance is well understood in unshielded configurations, however, the physics of source detection and localization is more complex when shielding and\/or scattering occurs, such in crowds of pedestrians. Moving crowds dynamically alter the shielding configuration, generating count rates that vary significantly with time. Thus, this must be accounted for dynamically in real-time in order to accurately perform source localization.","The attenuating effect of various infinite and semi-infinite shielding materials is well understood with a simple exponential model (Eq. 1) and with well-documented tables of attenuation coefficients.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},"msub":{"mi":"C","mn":"0"}},"mo":"=","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"E"}},"mi":"\u03c1"}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["\u03c1","x"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"Discrete or heterogeneous shielding, however, is much more difficult to characterize due to complex scattering interactions that occur within unevenly distributed matter. In many shielding situations, attenuation of direct radiation between the source and detector is the only radiation transport that is considered due to the fact that this tends to be the dominant effect. However, for non-uniform shielding material and non-homogeneous shielding, scattering phenomena from indirect radiation emissions must be considered as these quickly dominate direct attenuation effects for thick shadow-shielding cases. These gamma-rays are primarily a result of Compton scattering and affect detector gross count rates depending on the configuration of shielding material in the environment (see, e.g., ). The energy of a gamma-ray scattered in a Compton interaction is given by the incident gamma energy and the scattering angle (Eq. 2).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":["E","\u2032"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"E","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03b8"}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["E","\u03b3"]},"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["E","\u03b3"]},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["m","e"]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"c","mn":"2"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":["cos","\u03b8"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"It is clear from this relation that the scattered gamma-ray energy is always lower than that of the incident gamma ray. In a gamma energy spectrum these scattered gamma-rays raise the number of counts in the Compton continuum, the energy region resulting from scattered gamma-rays in the detector material ().  shows a case of two spectra collected from a Co source using a NaI(Tl) detector. The plot shows a spectrum collected with 1.8 mean free paths of shadow shielding between the source and the detector. The plot also shows a spectrum with the same shadow shielding plus additional material off-axis. The increase in the lower energy region below the photo peaks is the direct result of scattered gamma-rays from the additional material interacting with the detector.","As additional material is introduced, the Compton continuum becomes augmented to reflect the additional scattered gamma-rays. This augmentation is proportional to the amount of scattering media until the shielding becomes so dense that the material also significantly shields the secondary scattered photons.","A method of determining real-time shielding based on the shielding model previously described will now be described in detail.  illustrates a flow chart depicting the steps in one embodiment for determining the shielding between the radiation source and the detector. At step , an initial background measurement is performed to characterize the background count rate and the background rates in each channel of the spectrum (in one embodiment, 1024 channels for a standard NaI(Tl) detector). Thus, in one embodiment, the real-time shielding method uses the gamma-ray energy spectrum of each detector. At step , for a preset time interval (typically one second of real time), a gamma-ray spectrum is collected for each detector. At step , the spectra are normalized for live-time. This live-time normalization also accounts for incidents of significant dead-time and pulse pile-up. These phenomena occur when large (or exceptionally close) sources saturate the detector and cause reported count rates to be lower than actual rates of interaction in the detector in addition to generating false high-energy counts in the spectrum.","At step , the signal is computed for each channel in the spectrum as the count rate minus the average background rate. It should be appreciated that for small count times channels can be very noisy due to low statistics. Thus, in one embodiment, in order to smooth the data and reduce the noise, an uncertainty-based noise threshold may be used. The threshold is defined as \u03b1. The count rate in a channel is defined as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"r","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mi":["n","t"]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03c3","r"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03c3","n"]},"mi":"t"},"mo":"."}}}},"br":{},"sub":["S","T","B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03c3","S"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msqrt":[{"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"msub":{"mi":["n","T"]},"msubsup":{"mi":["t","T"],"mn":"2"}},{"msub":{"mi":["n","B"]},"msubsup":{"mi":["t","B"],"mn":"2"}}],"mo":"+"}},{"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"msub":[{"mi":["r","T"]},{"mi":["t","T"]}]},{"msub":[{"mi":["r","B"]},{"mi":["t","B"]}]}],"mo":"+"}}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"In order to prevent noise from distorting the shielding determination, in one embodiment a noise filter is obtained by eliminating counts in a given channel that fall below a noise threshold described by a multiple of the uncertainty on signal, \u03b1, as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["r","S"]},"mo":"\u2265","mrow":{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["\u03c3","s"]}}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":"\u2062","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"msub":[{"mi":["r","T"]},{"mi":["t","T"]}]},{"msub":[{"mi":["r","B"]},{"mi":["t","B"]}]}],"mo":"+"}}},{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":"\u2062","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["r","S"]},{"mi":["r","B"]}],"mo":"+"},"msub":{"mi":["t","T"]}},{"msub":[{"mi":["r","B"]},{"mi":["t","B"]}]}],"mo":"+"}}}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00007","num":"00007"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["r","S"]},"mo":"\u2265","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msup":{"mi":"\u03b1","mn":"2"},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":["t","T"]}},"mo":"+","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msubsup":{"mi":["t","T"],"mn":"2"}},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["r","B"]}},"msup":{"mi":"\u03b1","mn":"2"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":["t","T"]}},{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":["t","B"]}}],"mo":"+"}}}}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"5"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["T","B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00008","num":"00008"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["r","S"]},"mo":"\u2265","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msup":{"mi":"\u03b1","mn":"2"},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["r","B"]}},"msup":{"mi":"\u03b1","mn":"2"}}}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"6"}}]}}}}},"The threshold values on rare shown as a function of the background count rate for different values of \u03b1 in .  show two examples of the de-noising of spectrum from Ba using \u03b1=1.414.

Once the SNRvalues are calculated, in one embodiment, two or more channels may be grouped and their SNRvalues summed. In an embodiment using a typical 1024-channel spectrum, the resulting SNRvalues are grouped into 10-channel bins such that a typical 1024-channel spectrum would become 102 summed bins. This grouping into bins helps to smooth data for regions of the spectrum that still have low statistics. The bin with the maximum value of cumulative signal-to-noise ratio is determined. The channel number of the last channel in this bin is called the cutoff channel for the given detector and is used to approximate the maximum gamma ray energy from the radioactive source. The significance of this point is that the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio has peaked; the meaningful region of the spectrum has effectively ended and all counts above this point contribute only to the noise of the spectrum.  illustrates the cumulative SNR and the impact of noise above the cutoff channel. In one embodiment, an adjustment in the cutoff channel, called the adjusted cutoff, may also be made if a high dead-time is observed in the detector.

These adjusted count rates may then be utilized in the main tracking algorithm used for source localization. By adjusting the count rates to reflect the shielding thickness, the detection system provides a probability density map that can be used to determine the location of a source and track its position in the presence of time-varying shielding configurations. This approach has been demonstrated to be an effective first-order solution for use in real-time with low-resolution gamma-ray detectors, such as NaI(Tl), for a broad range of gamma ray sources and special nuclear material over a wide range of crowd densities.","Laboratory measurements were performed to examine the effect of shielding and scattering in situations with distributed heterogeneous shielding\/scattering phantoms representative of individuals in a crowd. For purposes of testing, human-analog phantoms were created which consisted of approximately 75 kg of water contained in a stack of four sealed 5-gallon buckets directly on the floor or placed on a movers dolly (to make them easier to reposition in the laboratory). The phantoms mimicked an average person (167 pounds), with a diameter of approximately 11.5 inches, and a height of 5 to 5.5 feet. The water-based shielding phantoms were utilized in various geometric configurations to provide an understanding of crowd shielding scenarios encountered in the field (see  for an example of one configuration that was measured). The measurements were performed by varying the number of phantoms, the pitch of the phantoms, the spacing between the source and the detector, and the energy of the incident gamma rays. The configurations maintained a uniform average density in a heterogeneous configuration based on the pitch of the phantoms.

Both of the theoretical models rely upon assumptions regarding uniformity of the shielding. However, in actuality, the shielding is not typically uniform, does not surround the source in all directions (or extend to essentially infinite lengths), and contains many streaming or scattering paths as a result of being made up of finitely-spaced heterogeneous bodies. Analyses of the measured spectra show a substantial scattering component that must be included to more accurately represent the observed radiation transport. A more sophisticated empirical model was created and may be represented by Eq. 11 presented above.","This model combines both attenuation and scattering phenomena to better predict the observed response of a detector system when used with a suitable scattering function, s(r,E,x). This model provides more accurate shielding calculations for real-world situations than the prior art theoretical shielding models. The scattering function, s(r,E,x), is derived empirically from laboratory data using uniform, heterogeneous shielding phantom arrangements as described previously. The source energy, crowd density, and source-to-detector distance were varied for each measurement and the three-dimensional scattering function was then fit to the measurement data.","With a known source-to-detector distance, r, an estimate of the major gamma energy, E, and an estimate of the instantaneous thickness of shielding (or crowd density), x, the algorithm can account for dynamic shielding in real-time.","Data was collected in several different locations to verify the validity of the shielding model and real-time shielding methods described above. The original data set used to develop the fits implemented in the current shielding methods (as seen in Table 1) made use of three sources with primary gamma-rays that cover a wide range of the gamma-ray energies that the detector system would be used to detect. To test the rigor of the data obtained from Co, Cs, and Ba, it was necessary to utilize a broad range of sources with varied peak energies and spectral features. A series of 5-minute dwell measurements were performed in order to accumulate data with high statistical certainty. These results are shown in Table 2, which gives a list of well-known sources with gamma peaks ranging from 40 keV to 1.4 MeV and with energy spectra characterized by both monoenergetic and polyenergetic photon emissions.

The cutoff energies are related to the cutoff channels according to the detector calibration, and it can be seen from Table 2 that each of these energies is slightly higher than the known photopeaks. The goal of the cutoff energy calculation is to capture the region of the spectrum with meaningful data, so it is important to retain the entire peak area (if there is a measurable peak). For this reason the cutoff energy will always fall just above the area of the peak.","In real-time operation, the statistical certainty declines dramatically due to the short counting time and results are prone to the effects of statistical fluctuation. Thus, in certain embodiments, the uncertainty due to small sample sizes may be overcome by providing a determination in slightly less than real-time. In one embodiment the system is designed to accumulate data for a prescribed time interval, such as for one second per accumulation. In these conditions the limits of stability in a measurement were studied. This can be quantified by observing the fluctuations in a calculated value as a function of signal-to-noise ratio, a natural metric for statistical certainty.  displays the result of measuring a weak Cs source that has been shielded, reducing the overall SNR to 3.8. At this SNR level, the calculated cutoff energy is subject to a bit of fluctuation. The data in  are cumulative such that each channel in the spectrum is a running sum of the total in the channel. This method allows the total SNR to increase with each second, increasing the statistics as time proceeds. One can see in  that as time progresses the value of cutoff energy begins to converge and reach stability along with the increasing signal-to-noise.","The universal shielding model designed to give an estimate of effective shielding thickness has been subjected to a similar validation process. Data collected during long-dwell measurements of Co, Cs, and Ba in a variety of shielding configurations yielded mean free path estimations that are tabulated in Table 3. Actual shielding thicknesses are listed along with values of \u03c6\/\u03c6(using Eq. 11) for the estimated and actual cases for comparison. From  one can see that as shielding material is introduced at a constant distance, the change in \u03c6\/\u03c6becomes decreasingly dependent on the thickness of shielding. The sensitivity of \u03c6\/\u03c6to fluctuations in mean free paths is important since the value of \u03c6\/\u03c6governs the final adjustment of the count rate to account for shielding. As is observed in , once the shielding has reached approximately 5 mean free path lengths, the changes to \u03c6\/\u03c6are generally small and beyond the scope of a first-order correction.

errors are listed in the final column of Table 3. The positive and negative values of error are indicative of over-adjustment and under-adjustment of count rate, respectively. It is clear that the unshielded and lightly shielded cases are successfully being characterized by the method, but the error tends to grow as the thickness increases. Thus, the accuracy of the present method may decrease as thickness increases, particularly beyond 5 mfp.","Series of long-dwell measurements are useful for evaluating the mechanics of the shielding algorithm in a diagnostic manner. However, for a real-time system, real-time data to support the validation is essential. Thus, a series of 30 one-second calculations based on real-time data is given in Table 4 for a 14 mCi Ba source obscured by 3.11 mfp of shielding material, i.e., the shielding was held relatively static throughout the test. Being a relatively low-energy source, Ba does not produce any obvious peaks when measured with this level of shielding. This causes a slightly lower cutoff energy than would be expected for an unshielded Ba source, with its most prominent energy contribution coming from a 356 keV gamma peak (and to a lesser extent, a nearby 303 keV peak). In either case the universal shielding method described above estimates an appropriate level of shielding from the shielded spectrum with very little fluctuation. The stability of the shielding calculation is apparent in the small standard deviation of 0.09 in mean free paths and only 0.004 in \u03c6\/\u03c6, which amounts to a 1.1% standard deviation from the mean adjustment on count rate (using Eq. 13).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Results for 30 one-second spectra from a shielded 14 mCi Ba source"},{"entry":{"sup":"133"}},{"entry":"Distance: 22.4 ft"},{"entry":"Actual Shielding: 3.11 mfp"},{"entry":"Actual \u03c6\/\u03c6: 0.368"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Cutoff",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Time","Gross CR","Net CR","Energy","Mfp","\u03c6\/\u03c6"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1","18007","16722","409","3.09","0.372"]},{"entry":[{},"2","18527","17242","316","3.30","0.361"]},{"entry":[{},"3","18503","17218","316","3.30","0.361"]},{"entry":[{},"4","18299","17014","316","3.43","0.357"]},{"entry":[{},"5","18372","17086","347","3.29","0.363"]},{"entry":[{},"6","18422","17136","316","3.39","0.358"]},{"entry":[{},"7","18620","17335","316","3.29","0.361"]},{"entry":[{},"8","18698","17413","284","3.04","0.368"]},{"entry":[{},"9","18123","16838","347","3.12","0.368"]},{"entry":[{},"10","18330","17044","316","3.26","0.362"]},{"entry":[{},"11","18463","17177","316","3.28","0.361"]},{"entry":[{},"12","18367","17082","347","3.16","0.367"]},{"entry":[{},"13","18805","17519","316","3.28","0.361"]},{"entry":[{},"14","18550","17265","347","3.15","0.367"]},{"entry":[{},"15","18376","17091","347","3.20","0.365"]},{"entry":[{},"16","18642","17357","347","3.26","0.364"]},{"entry":[{},"17","18315","17030","316","3.27","0.362"]},{"entry":[{},"18","18574","17289","316","3.34","0.360"]},{"entry":[{},"19","18284","16999","409","3.18","0.369"]},{"entry":[{},"20","18399","17114","347","3.20","0.365"]},{"entry":[{},"21","18730","17444","347","3.25","0.364"]},{"entry":[{},"22","18415","17130","316","3.29","0.361"]},{"entry":[{},"23","18460","17175","347","3.23","0.364"]},{"entry":[{},"24","18513","17227","347","3.16","0.367"]},{"entry":[{},"25","18464","17178","316","3.32","0.360"]},{"entry":[{},"26","18263","16977","347","3.15","0.367"]},{"entry":[{},"27","18295","17010","347","3.16","0.367"]},{"entry":[{},"28","18255","16969","347","3.12","0.368"]},{"entry":[{},"29","18342","17057","316","3.13","0.366"]},{"entry":[{},"30","18636","17351","347","3.09","0.369"]},{"entry":[{},"Mean","18434.9","17149.7","335.2","3.22","0.364"]},{"entry":[{},"\u03c3","177.7","177.7","26.5","0.09","0.004"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Table 5 illustrates a series of 30 one-second calculations for a variety of radiation sources with various shielding configurations.
