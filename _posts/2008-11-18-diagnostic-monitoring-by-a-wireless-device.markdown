No. 60\/989,050, entitled \u201cMODE SWITCHING USER DEVICE,\u201d filed Nov. 19, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference.","I. Field","The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically to techniques for supporting wireless communication for a wireless device.","II. Background","Wireless communication networks are widely deployed to provide various communication services such as voice, video, packet data, messaging, broadcast, etc. These wireless networks may be multiple-access networks capable of supporting multiple users by sharing the available network resources. Examples of such multiple-access networks include Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) networks, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) networks, Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA) networks, and Single-Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) networks. The wireless networks may also be referred to as radio networks, radio access networks, access networks, etc.","A wireless device may be within the coverage of zero, one or multiple radio networks at any given moment. The wireless device may access the most preferred radio network among all available radio networks and may establish a radio connection with this radio network. The wireless device may also establish a data session with a designated network entity. The wireless device may thereafter exchange data via the radio connection for the data session. The radio conditions and\/or network conditions may change during the data session and may affect the performance of the wireless device. It is desirable to efficiently monitor the radio and network conditions in order to obtain good service for the wireless device.","Techniques for monitoring radio conditions and network conditions to improve performance for a wireless device are described herein. In one design, the wireless device may include a diagnostic monitoring module, a modem, and an application. The diagnostic monitoring module may communicate with the modem via a diagnostic interface to receive diagnostic messages indicative of radio and network conditions, data performance of the wireless device, etc. The diagnostic monitoring module may provide pertinent information to the application, which may use the information to make decisions on service activation, network selection, etc.","In one design, the diagnostic monitoring module may receive diagnostic messages from the modem via the diagnostic interface. The module may process the diagnostic messages to obtain network status information indicative of the status of a radio network. The module may parse the diagnostic messages to obtain pertinent parameters for the radio network and may determine the network status information based on these parameters. The module may provide the network status information via a second interface (e.g., APIs) to the application for use by the application to control communication with the radio network.","In another design, the diagnostic monitoring module may process the diagnostic messages to obtain diagnostic information indicative of the performance of a radio connection or a data session or both for the wireless device. The module may parse the diagnostic messages to extract parameters of interest, discard remaining parameters, and store the extracted parameters in a buffer. The module may generate a report comprising a set of parameters stored in the buffer and may send the report to a network server. The report may comprise diagnostic information, which may be used by the network server for network monitoring, debugging, etc.","In yet another design, paging messages may be sent to the wireless device in different manners depending on the operating mode of the wireless device. The wireless device may receive a first paging message sent based on a first identifier (e.g., a Mobile Directory Number (MDN)) for the wireless device when it is operating in an inactive mode. The wireless device may receive a second paging message sent based on a second identifier (e.g., an Internet Protocol (IP) address) for the wireless device when it is operating in an active mode. The IP address may be associated with the MDN and a socket for an application at the wireless device. The second paging message may be sent to the socket for the application.","Various aspects and features of the disclosure are described in further detail below.","The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication networks such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA and other networks.

Applications  may communicate with modem  by exchanging AT commands via an AT interface, which is commonly used for modems.","An application may desire to establish a data call with a radio network in order to provide a service requested by the user. The application may exchange AT commands with modem  to establish a data call. The AT commands may support operations such as dialing, hanging up, and changing parameters of the data call. The AT commands may provide the application with limited information regarding the network conditions, e.g., which radio networks are available. The application may attempt to establish a data call with different radio networks until a successful data call is established. The application may thereafter communicate with a network entity (e.g., customer content server ) via the established data call. The AT commands may not be available once the data call is established. An escape sequence may be performed to interrupt the data call and allow for exchanges of AT commands. However, this interrupt may be disruptive to the service being provided to the user.

The command request messages from diagnostic monitoring module  and the command response messages from modem  may operate in a trigger\/response manner. A command request message may ask for a specific parameter, and a command response message may provide the requested parameter. A command request message may also direct modem  to perform a specific action, and a command response message may confirm completion of the action. For example, a command request message may invoke an item write to provision modem  with activation parameters for normal operation.","Log messages may be sent periodically and may provide designated parameters. The reporting of log messages may be configured by a configuration message, which may be referred to as a log mask. Different log messages may be defined and may be enabled based on the configuration of the log mask. Each log message may be associated with a specific bit of the log mask and may be enabled by setting the associated bit in the log mask to a predetermined value (e.g., \u20181\u2019). Each log message may provide a specific set of parameters based on a reporting schedule applicable for that log message. Modem  may provide log messages in a periodic manner to diagnostic monitoring module .","Event messages may be sent when triggered by events and may be enabled by a configuration message. Each event message may provide a specific set of parameters when triggered by a specific event, which may be expiration of a timer, a parameter value crossing a threshold, etc. Modem  may provide event messages in an asynchronous manner as events occur.","Debug messages may be streamed from various modules within modem  into a file during normal operation. Debug messages may be used to collect\/create a debug log as an aid for troubleshooting.","In general, modem  may provide a given parameter in any message. Certain parameters may be more suitably provided by certain types of message. For example, command request messages may be used to retrieve static or semi-static parameters. Log messages may be used to provide parameters that can change dynamically. Event messages may be used to provide parameters that may be pertinent when there are changes in the operation of wireless device , the radio connection, the data session, etc. A given parameter may also be provided in different types of message, e.g., in a log message as well as an event message. The different types of messages are described in further detail below.","An input processor and buffer  may receive command response messages, log messages, event messages, and debug messages from modem . Processor  may process the received messages to collect parameters of interest and may store the collected parameters in an input buffer. Processor  may provide the collected parameters to control module  and\/or other modules when requested. An output processor and buffer  may receive reports from control module  and may buffer the reports until they are ready to be sent. Processor  may provide the reports to modem  for transmission to diagnostic monitoring server  in  and\/or other network entities.","An initialization module  may receive parameters from input processor  and may process the parameters to determine network status information. Module  may monitor system determination and network access status of radio networks. Module  may receive requests for specific information from applications  and may provide the requested information. For example, an application may invoke a GetBars API. In response, module  may obtain pilot measurements for sectors in an active set (ASET) of wireless device , translate the pilot measurements to a bar value (e.g., 0 to 5 bars) indicative of the received signal strength of the radio network, and provide the bar value to the application. As another example, the application may invoke a GetRBI API. In response, module  may determine whether wireless device  is communicating with a preferred or non-preferred radio network and may provide a roaming bit indicator (RBI) as defined in a Preferred Roaming List (PRL) for the radio network. The application may also request for other types of information, e.g., system time, local time offset. etc. Module  may obtain the requested information and provide it to the application. The application may use the bar value, the RBI, and\/or other information from module  to determine whether or not to activate a service and initiate a data call, to select a radio network on which to initiate the data call, etc.","A QoS monitoring module  may receive log messages and event messages from modem  and may process these messages to determine the status and\/or performance of a data call. In one design, module  may be activated during an active window and disabled outside of the active window. Module  may detect for origination of the data call, which may be the start of the active window. Module  may also detect for release of the data call, which may be the end of the active window. Module may monitor radio performance and data performance during the active window, e.g., as background task. In another design, module  may operate whenever activated, e.g., by control module .","Module  may parse (e.g., in real-time) the log messages and event messages received from modem  to obtain different parameters for the radio connection, the data session, etc. Module  may group the different parameters and store them in the input buffer. Module  may detect for trigger conditions, which may include dropped call, PPP failure, call termination, failure to establish radio connection, failure to establish data connection, failure to acquire radio frequency (RF) lock or channel assignment, loss of sync channel or paging channel, etc. The trigger conditions typically denote abnormal conditions for wireless device . Whenever a trigger condition is detected, module  may collect parameters that are stored in the input buffer and associated with the trigger condition to obtain a snapshot of the current radio and network conditions. Module  may generate a report containing pertinent parameters for the trigger condition and may forward the report to processor  for transmission to diagnostic monitoring server  and\/or other network entities.","In general, diagnostic monitoring module  may send reports due to various trigger conditions, which may cover different types of failures and abnormal conditions. The reports may be used for various purposes such as trouble shooting, network monitoring, etc. For example, an application may encounter a failure that is captured by a trigger condition, and a report may be sent for the trigger condition. The user may call the network operator to report the failure, and the network operator may have information from the report to diagnose the cause of the failure. The network operator may also use the reports to monitor the performance of the radio network, to detect for error or overloading conditions, etc. The network operator may then take appropriate corrective actions.","An interactive diagnostic module  may support debug and diagnostic of a data call and a data session for wireless device . Module  may be invoked by the user, the network operator, a content provider, etc. When invoked, module  may present a debug\/diagnostic screen on wireless device . The debug\/diagnostic screen may provide radio parameters for the radio connection. Module  may obtain the radio parameters from among the parameters stored in the input buffer and may update these radio parameters on the screen as new log messages and event messages are received from modem . The user may navigate through the screen to view different radio parameters. The user may also capture the radio parameters on the screen (e.g., by hitting an \u201cS\u201d button) and may save the radio parameters to a file for export to diagnostic monitoring server . Module  may also use the radio parameters to determine network status, network access failures, etc.","Module  may also collect parameters for the data session and may provide data connectivity information as an aid for debugging, etc. The data connectivity information may indicate whether wireless device  is on-line or dormant, whether there is a data connection failure, etc. The data connectivity information may provide Mobile IP (MIP) authentication status, data connection status, etc. The data connection status may identify data connection issues and may provide a timestamp and an error code for localized identification of a data connection issue.","Module  may also capture information for various events affecting the operation of wireless device . Module  may capture information for a MIP event, e.g., a registration reply (RRP) code and a timestamp. Module  may capture information for a paging event, e.g., a timestamp of an incoming page, the location (e.g., latitude and longitude) of a base station sending the page, a local time offset of the geographic location, etc. Module  may capture information for an authentication event, e.g., failure condition for rejection of service by Radius server , Registration Reply Code (RRC), timestamp of failed authentication, etc. Module  may capture information on an event that may block an application from establishing a data call. The information may indicate whether the application is denied access due to (i) no service or out-of-range condition or (ii) roaming condition on an unauthorized radio network. The information may comprise parameters such as a PRL provisioned on wireless device , a System Identification (SID), a Network Identification (NID), a base station identification (BaseID), latitude and longitude of the base station, a color code, a sector ID, etc. Module  may also capture information on rejection of access by wireless device , e.g., due to an incorrect Mobile Station ID (MSID), a network rejection, etc. In general, module  may present captured information for any event on a debug\/diagnostic screen and\/or may send the capture information to diagnostic monitoring server .","Wireless device  may perform authentication with 1xRTT network  or EVDO network  during establishment of a data call. Diagnostic monitoring module  may keep track of the status of the authentication process. The status may be \u201cOK\u201d if modem access credentials (e.g., ESN and MSID) have passed authentication to a designated network entity, e.g., a Home Location Registry (HLR) or a Home Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (H-AAA). The status may be \u201cFAIL\u201d if wireless device  has failed authentication, e.g., due to mismatch in the modem access credentials. Module  may store information regarding the authentication process and may provide the information to facilitate debugging of data connectivity issues.","Wireless device  may utilize MIP for a data session and may perform registration for MIP. Diagnostic monitoring module  may keep track of the status of the MIP registration process.

Wireless device  may be paged via 1xRTT network  or EVDO network  in the active mode and via 1xRTT network  in the inactive mode.","In one design, wireless device  may be paged based on a voice service option (e.g., Service Option 3 (SO3)) via 1xRTT network  while operating in the inactive mode. Wireless device  may register with 1xRTT network  and may update its location with 1xRTT network  as wireless device  moves about. Wireless device  may also be assigned specific paging slots, which are time periods in which paging messages can be sent to wireless device . 1xRTT network  may send a paging message to wireless device  during an assigned paging slot and based on the current location of wireless device . The paging message may be sent to wireless device  using an MDN, which is a phone number for wireless device . Wireless device  may be ringed for a sufficiently long duration in order to assure multiple page notifications. Wireless device  may avoid answering a paging message sent using SO3 and may instead use this message as a trigger to originate a packet data call, e.g., with Service Option 33 (SO33) call back.","While in 1xRTT-only state , wireless device  may power down as much circuitry as possible and may wake up periodically during its assigned paging slots. Wireless device  may process the paging channel from 1 xRTT network  in each assigned paging slot to determine whether a paging message has been sent for wireless device . If a paging message is received and a response is needed, then wireless device  may transition to EVDO-preferred state .","In one design, wireless device  may be paged based on its IP address while operating in the active mode. Upon acquiring a radio network, wireless device  may establish a data session (e.g., a PPP session) with PDSN . Wireless device  may acquire an IP address during data session establishment (e.g., from a Home Agent after successful MIP authentication) and may use this IP address for the duration of the data session. The IP address may be associated with (i.e., linked to) the MDN of wireless device  as well as a socket for an application at wireless device . A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication path between an application at one entity and an application at another entity. A socket may be bound to a port number so that transport layer protocols such as TCP can identify the application mapped to the socket. The association between IP address, MDN, and socket may be stored in a binding table in a database by Radius server  (as assumed in much of the description below) or by some other network entity. Radius server  may receive framed IP attribute as well as (i) a session start record that indicates that a data session for wireless device  has begun and that the IP address is valid and (ii) a session stop record that indicates that the data session is closed.","A network entity (e.g., customer content server ) may desire to page wireless device  and may invoke a network API interface to ring the MDN of wireless device . A lookup in the binding table may be performed to determine if the MDN has an active IP address assigned to it. If an active IP address is assigned, then a notification packet may be sent to a specific port where a TCP server (or TCP listener) is running on wireless device . When the TCP listener detects the notification packet, an application may be notified. The application may then establish a mobile originated packet data call to the network entity. However, if a valid IP address is not assigned to the MDN, then a voice page (SO3) may be sent to the MDN of wireless device .","A socket-based paging message may thus be sent to wireless device  by determining the IP address of wireless device , determining the MDN and socket linked to the IP address, and sending a paging message (e.g., a notification packet) to the socket using the MDN. Wireless device  may receive the paging message and may process the paging message by detecting a payload string for content match. If there is a match, then an application is notified of the page, and a TCP listener may send an acknowledgement payload back to paging server  to complete the handshake. Both entities may then close their sockets after the exchange.","Paging server  may receive a paging message for wireless device  and may determine whether wireless device  is operating in the active mode or the inactive mode. Paging server  may send the paging message using SO3-based paging if wireless device  is operating in the inactive mode or using socket-based paging if wireless device  is operating in the active mode.

A storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a general-purpose or special-purpose computer, or a general-purpose or special-purpose processor. Also, any connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if the software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. Disk and disc, as used herein, includes compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","The previous description of the disclosure is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the disclosure.
