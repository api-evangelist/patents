abstract: One or more techniques and/or systems are disclosed for generating a genus 2 curve for use in cryptography. One or more invariant values used to generate the genus 2 curve are determined by evaluating one or more invariant functions on a Hilbert modular surface. The genus 2 curve is generated using the one or more invariant values to determine an equation describing the genus 2 curve. A group is generated from the genus 2 curve, and the group may be used for a cryptographic application.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Computers have become increasingly interconnected via networks (such as the Internet), and security and authentication concerns have become increasingly important. Cryptographic techniques that involve a key-based cipher, for example, can take sequences of intelligible data (e.g., typically referred to as plaintext) that form a message and mathematically transform them into seemingly unintelligible data (e.g., typically referred to as ciphertext), through and enciphering process. In this example, the enciphering can be reversed, thereby allowing recipients of the ciphertext with an appropriate key to transform the ciphertext back to plaintext, while making it very difficult, if not nearly impossible, for those without the appropriate key from recovering the plaintext.","Public-key cryptographic techniques are an embodiment of key-based cipher. In public-key cryptography, for example, respective communicating parties have a public\/private key pair. The public key of the respective pairs is made publicly available (e.g., or at least available to others who are intended to send encrypted communications), and the private key is kept secret. In order to communicate a plaintext message using encryption to a receiving party, for example, an originating party can encrypt the plaintext message into a ciphertext message using the public key of the receiving party and communicate the ciphertext message to the receiving party. In this example, upon receipt of the ciphertext message, the receiving party can decrypt the message using its secret private key, thereby recovering the original plaintext message.","An example of public\/private key cryptology comprises generating two large prime numbers and multiplying them together to get a large composite number, which is made public. In this example, if the primes are properly chosen and large enough, it may be extremely difficult (e.g., practically impossible due to computational infeasibility) for someone who does not know the primes to determine them from just knowing the composite number. However, in order to be secure, the size of the composite number should be more than 1,000 bits. In some situations, such a large size makes impractical to be used.","An example of authentication is where a party or a machine attempts to prove that it is authorized to access or use a product or service. Often, a product ID system is utilized for a software program(s), where a user enters a product ID sequence stamped on the outside of the properly licensed software package as proof that the software has been properly paid for. If the product ID sequence is too long, then it will be cumbersome and user unfriendly. Other common examples include user authentication, when a user identifies themselves to a computer system using an authentication code.","As another example, in cryptography, elliptic curves are often used to generate cryptographic keys. An elliptic curve is a mathematical object that has a structure and properties well suited for cryptography. Many protocols for elliptic curves have already been standardized for use in cryptography. Further, genus 2 curves can be used with cryptography; however, unlike the case of elliptic curves (which are genus 1 curves), protocols for these genus 2 curves have not been standardized.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Encryption and decryption are usually performed based on a secret. This secret is often an order of a group of points. A variety of different curves can be used, and in one implementation the curve is a genus 2 curve. A group of elements (e.g., points) derived from a genus 2 curve can be used in the encryption\/decryption, for example, as a discrete logarithm problem (DLP) for such a group is considered to be hard or difficult to solve. A hard DLP is preferred in cryptology in order to create a more secure encryption\/decryption process, for example.","Currently, when constructing a genus 2 curve for cryptographic purposes three auxiliary polynomials with rational coefficients are typically computed. These polynomials are usually Igusa class polynomials, and the roots are often referred to as \u201cinvariants,\u201d where three Igusa invariants can be used to construct a genus 2 curve, for example. Presently, computation of Igusa class polynomials is very difficult and computationally expensive.","One or more of the techniques and\/or systems described herein provide an alternate to using three Igusa invariants for generating a genus 2 curve. Using these techniques and\/or systems one may merely utilize two invariants to generate a genus 2 curve, for example, where the invariants are not Igusa invariants. In this way, for example, a genus two curve may be generated in a faster time, using less computing resources, as there are fewer invariants that are simpler to evaluate.","In one embodiment, when generating a genus 2 curve for use in cryptography, one or more invariant values, which may be used to generate the genus 2 curve, are determined by evaluating one or more invariant functions on a Hilbert modular surface. For example, polynomials generated by the invariant functions evaluated on the Hilbert modular surface may be used as the invariant values for determining the curve. The genus 2 curve can then be generated using the one or more invariant values, for example, by using the invariant values (e.g., polynomials) in an algorithm to recover an equation that describes the curve. After the genus 2 curve is created, a group, such as a set of elements, can be generated from the curve where the group is used for a cryptographic application.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","One or more of the cryptographic curve generation techniques and\/or systems described herein can create a genus 2 curve that can be used for cryptographic applications, such as to create a cryptographic key.","Typically, a curve-based cryptosystem utilizes a group (e.g., of elements and a binary multiplier) whose size is known to a cryptosystem designer, but is typically unknown and believed difficult to determine for potential malicious attackers of the cryptosystem. The curve-based encryption and decryption illustrated in , as an example, typically refers to encryption and decryption that uses keys that are generated based on aspects or characteristics of an algebraic curve. The exemplary cryptosystems of  are a function of the type of curve and a secret group size generated from the curve. In one embodiment of cryptographic curve generation, the curve may be a Jacobian of a genus 2 curve, and the secret group size can be the size of the group of points on the Jacobian of the genus 2 curve.","Curve-based cryptosystems can be used to encrypt a wide variety of information. For example, a cryptosystem may be used to generate a \u201cshort\u201d signature or product identifier, which is a code that allows validation and\/or authentication of a machine, program or user, for example. The signature can be a \u201cshort\u201d signature in that it uses a relatively small number of characters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","102","106","104","102","106","102","106"]},"An output module  of the encryptor  outputs an encrypted version of the plaintext message , which can be ciphertext . Ciphertext , which may comprise a string of unintelligible text or some other data, can then be communicated to the decryptor , which can be implemented, for example, on a computer system remote from a computer system on which encryptor  is implemented. Given the encrypted nature of ciphertext , the communication link between the encryptor  and the decryptor  need not be secure (e.g., it is often presumed that the communication link is not secure). As an example, the communication link can be one of a wide variety of public and\/or private networks implemented using one or more of a wide variety of conventional public and\/or proprietary protocols, and including both wired and wireless implementations. Additionally, the communication link may include other non-computer network components, such as hand-delivery of media including ciphertext or other components of a product distribution chain.","The decryptor  receives the ciphertext  at an input module  and, because the decryptor  is aware of the secret group size used to encrypt the message  (e.g., as well as the necessary generator), can decrypt the ciphertext  to recover the original plaintext message , which is output by an output module  as a plaintext message . In one embodiment, the decryptor  is a genus 2 curve-based decryptor that decrypts the message based on the size of the group of points generated from the genus 2 curve (e.g., a same value as was used by encryptor ), and is discussed in more detail below.","In one embodiment, the encryption and decryption are performed in the exemplary cryptosystem  based on a secret, which may be the size of the group of points generated from the genus 2 curve. The secret is a shared secret, as it is known to the decryptor , and a public key can be generated based on the secret known to encryptor . In this embodiment, this knowledge may allow the encryptor  to encrypt a plaintext message that can be subsequently decrypted merely by the decryptor . Other components, including the encryptor , which do not have knowledge of the secret, cannot decrypt the ciphertext (e.g., although decryption may be technically possible, it is not computationally feasible). Similarly, in one embodiment, the decryptor  may also generate a message using the secret based on a plaintext message; a process referred to as digitally signing the plaintext message. In this embodiment, the signed message can be communicated to other components, such as the encryptor , which can verify the digital signature based on the public key.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","202","204","202","210","206","202","202","202","210"]},"A product ID generator  can generate a product ID  that may include numbers, letters, and\/or other symbols. The generator  generates a product ID  using the genus 2 curve-based encryption techniques and\/or systems described herein. The product ID  may be printed on a label and affixed to either a carrier containing software media  or a box into which software media  is placed. Alternatively, the product ID  may be made available electronically, such as a certificate provided to a user when receiving a softcopy of the application program via an on-line source (e.g., downloading of the software via the Internet). The product ID  can serve multiple functions, such as being cryptographically validated to verify that the product ID is a valid product ID (e.g., thus allowing the application program to be installed). As a further example, the product ID  may serve to authenticate the particular software media  to which it is associated.","The generated software media  and associated product ID  can be provided to a distribution chain . The distribution chain  can represent one or more of a variety of conventional distribution systems and methods, including possibly one or more \u201cmiddlemen\u201d (e.g., wholesalers, suppliers, distributors, retail stores (either on-line or brick and mortar), etc.), and\/or electronic distribution, such as over the Internet. Regardless of the manner in which media  and the associated product ID  are distributed, the media  and product ID  are typically purchased by (e.g., licensed) or distributed to, the user of a client computer , for example.","The client computer  can include a media reader  that is capable of reading the software media  and installing an application program onto client computer  (e.g., installing the application program on to a hard disk drive or memory (not shown) of client computer ). In one embodiment, part of the installation process can involve entering the product ID  (e.g., to validate a licensed copy). This entry may be a manual entry (e.g., the user typing in the product ID via a keyboard), or alternatively an automatic entry (e.g., computer  automatically accessing a particular field of a license associated with the application program and extracting the product ID therefrom). The client computer  can also include a product ID validator  which validates, during installation of the application program, the product ID . In one embodiment, the validation can be performed using the genus 2 curve-based decryption techniques and\/or systems described herein. If the validator  determines that the product ID is valid, an appropriate course of action can be taken (e.g., an installation program on software media  allows the application to be installed on computer ). However, if the validator  determines that the product ID is invalid, a different course of action can be taken (e.g., the installation program terminates the installation process preventing the application program from being installed).","In one embodiment, the product ID validator  can also optionally authenticate the software media (e.g., application program) based on the product ID . This authentication verifies that the product ID  entered at computer  corresponds to the particular copy of the application be accessed, for example. As an example, the authentication may be performed at different times, such as during installation, or when requesting product support or an upgrade. Alternatively, in this embodiment, the authentication may be performed at a remote location (e.g., at a call center when the user of client computer  calls for technical support, the user may be required to provide the product ID  before receiving assistance).","In one embodiment, if an application program manufacturer desires to utilize the authentication capabilities of the product ID, the product ID generated by generator  for respective copies of an application program should be unique. As an example, unique product IDs can be created by assigning a different initial number or value to respective copies of the application program (e.g., this initial value is then used as a basis for generating the product ID). The unique value associated with the copy of the application program can be optionally maintained by the manufacturer as an authentication record  (e.g., a database or list) along with an indication of the particular copy of the application program. The indication of the copy can be, for example, a serial number embedded in the application program or on software media , and may be hidden in any of a wide variety of conventional manners. Alternatively, for example, the individual number itself may be a serial number that is associated with the particular copy, thereby allowing the manufacturer to verify the authenticity of an application program by extracting the initial value from the product ID and verifying that it is the same as the serial number embedded in the application program or software media .","A method may be devised that can allow a genus 2 curve to be generated, where a group (e.g., comprising points or elements) can be created from the genus 2 curve and the group can be used for cryptography. Generating a genus 2 curve for use in cryptography is known to be a difficult problem, with merely partial solutions in some cases. Effective cryptosystems are typically based on groups where a Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) for the group is hard (e.g., difficult to calculate), such as a group comprising points generated from the genus 2 curve. The DLP applies to groups, which is a collection of elements together with a binary operation, such as a group multiplication. As an illustrative example, the DLP may be: given an element g in a finite group G and another element h that is an element of G, find an integer x such that g=h.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","104"],"sup":["2","5","4","3 ","5"]},"Previously, to construct a genus 2 curve for cryptographic purposes three auxiliary polynomials with rational coefficients, such as Igusa invariants, are computed. As an illustrative example, these polynomials may have a form of X+aX+bX+dX+eX+f, where a, b, c, d, e, f are fractions. In this example, while the number 5 occurring in Xis used for illustration purposes, this number may be much larger. Further, in this example, in order to generate the genus 2 curve three polynomials are computed, which is very computationally expensive.","In this exemplary method , invariant functions are evaluated on the Hilbert modular surface to create improved invariant values, such as polynomials for generating the genus 2 curve equation, for example. In this example, the improvement is achieved by merely utilizing two invariant functions for generating the genus 2 curve, instead of three Igusa invariants previously used. Further, the improved invariant values on the Hilbert Modular surface are typically easier to calculate than the Igusa polynomials.","In one embodiment, determining the invariant values can comprise evaluating one or more invariant functions on complex multiplication (CM) points on a Hilbert modular surface. Descriptions of CM points in the Hilbert moduli space is simpler than a description of CM points in terms of period matrices on the Siegel moduli space (e.g., as with Igusa invariants). Additionally, modular forms evaluated to compute invariants on the Hilbert moduli space are exponential functions in two variables, instead of three, as with the Igusa polynomials previously used.","In one embodiment, invariant values can be determined by fixing a real quadratic field F. The Hilbert moduli space of principally polarized abelian surfaces can then be considered with real multiplication by O. In this embodiment, using a forgetful functor one can map to the Siegel moduli space of the principally polarized abelian surfaces. Two generators of the function field of the Hilbert moduli space can be studied, for example, as given by K. B. Gundlach, in Die Bestimmung der Funktionen zur Hilbertschen Modulgrupper des Zahlk\u00f6rpers Q(\u221a{square root over (5)}), Math. Ann. 152 (1963), 226-256.","At , the genus 2 curve is generated using the one or more invariant values. In one embodiment, a genus 2 curve can be given by y=f(x) (curve equation) over a finite field F, where p is a prime number and where f is a polynomial of degree 2g+1 and g is the genus of the genus 2 curve. In this embodiment, for example, desired (e.g., minimal) polynomials determined by evaluating the invariant functions on the Hilbert modular surface can be used to generate the curve equation for the genus 2 curve.","At , a group is created from the curve, where the group is used for a cryptographic application. For example, a group (e.g., a set of elements and an operation that forms an algebraic structure) generated from the genus 2 curve can have a solution for a discrete logarithm problem (DLP) that is considered hard. In this example, a group having a hard DLP solution can be desirable for use in cryptographic applications, such as for secure computer-based communications. In one embodiment, the group may be created by determining one or more Jacobian determinants (Jacobians) of the function of the genus 2 curve. A group comprising Jacobians of the curve is generally considered to have a hard DLP solution, and can be very useful in a cryptographic application.","As an example, the group may be used for cryptographic applications, such as: digital signatures that securely identify a person or document, encryption and decryption of electronic documents, and\/or keys, and public and private keys that are used in online communications. Having created a group for use in a cryptographic application, the exemplary method  ends at .","In one aspect, determining invariants for the genus 2 curve can involve defining new invariants, which are different from previously utilized Igusa invariants for creating a genus 2 curve. In this aspect, in one embodiment, a Hilbert Eisenstein series can be computed for the invariant functions, the new invariants can be defined, and a pull-back of the Igusa functions in terms of the new invariants can be computed.","For example,
