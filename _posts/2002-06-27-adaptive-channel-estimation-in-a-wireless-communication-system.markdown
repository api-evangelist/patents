title: Adaptive channel estimation in a wireless communication system
abstract: A method and circuit for adaptively estimating channel conditions of a pilot channel in a wireless communication system. The method includes estimating channel statistics of the pilot channel, and adaptively filtering the pilot channel in response to the estimated channel statistics. The estimation is performed by filtering a channel signal derived from the pilot channel to determine an estimated channel mean and an estimated channel covariance. In order to perform the adaptive filtering, the present invention partitions the pilot channel into one or more time slots and weights each time slot according to the channel statistics. Thus, an advantage of the present invention is that it automatically and continually updates the pilot filter parameters in order to optimize the pilot filter performance over a broad range of channel conditions.

No. 6,493,329 entitled \u201cADAPTIVE CHANNEL ESTIMATION IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM,\u201d issued Dec. 10, 2002, assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.","I. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to wireless communication systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for adaptively estimating the channel conditions of a wireless communication channel.","II. Description of the Related Art","In a wireless radiotelephone communication system, many users communicate over a wireless channel. Communication over the wireless channel can be one of a variety of multiple access techniques that allow a large number of users in a limited frequency spectrum. These multiple access techniques include time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), and code division multiple access (CDMA).","The CDMA technique has many advantages. An exemplary CDMA system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS,\u201d issued Feb. 13, 1990, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference. An exemplary CDMA system is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING SIGNAL WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d issued Apr. 7, 1992, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference.","In each of the above patents, the use of a forward-link (base station to mobile station) pilot signal is disclosed. In a typical CDMA wireless communication system, such as that described in EIA\/TIA IS-95, the pilot signal is a \u201cbeacon\u201d transmitting a constant zero symbol and spread with the same pseudonoise (PN) sequences used by the traffic bearing signals. The pilot signal is typically covered with the all-zero Walsh sequence. During initial system acquisition, the mobile station searches through PN offsets to locate a base station's pilot signal. Once it has acquired the pilot signal, it can then derive a stable phase and magnitude reference for coherent demodulation, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,764,687 entitled \u201cMOBILE DEMODULATOR ARCHITECTURE FOR A SPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM,\u201d issued Jun. 9, 1998, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference.","A functional block diagram of a typical prior art forward link data formatter as used by a CDMA base station is shown in FIG. . Data source  may be, for example, a variable rate vocoder such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,657,420, entitled \u201cVARIABLE RATE VOCODER,\u201d issued Aug. 8, 1997, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. Data source  generates traffic channel information in the form of frames of digital data. CRC and tail bit generator  calculates and appends cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits and tail bits to the frames generated by data source . The frame is then provided to encoder , which provides forward error correction coding, such as convolutional encoding, upon the frame as is known in the art. The encoded symbols are provided to repetition generator , which repeats the reordered symbols to provide the appropriate modulation symbol rate. The repeated symbols are then provided to interleaver , which re-orders the symbols in accordance with a predetermined interleaver format. The repeated, interleaved symbol stream is then covered with one of a set of orthogonal Walsh sequences in traffic Walsh coverer , and gain adjusted in gain element . It should be understood that other forward link data formatters are also known in the art. For example, it is well known that the repetition generator  may be placed after the interleaver .","Pilot signal generator  generates a pilot signal, which may be a sequence of all ones. The pilot signal is then covered with the all-one Walsh sequence and combined with the output of gain element  in combiner . The combined pilot channel and traffic channel data (which may be plus or minus ones) is then spread in PN spreader  using a complex PN code generated by PN generator , and then transmitted by radio frequency transmitter  over antenna . A similar forward link data formatter is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,396,804, entitled \u201cHIGH DATA RATE CDMA WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM,\u201d issued May 28, 2002, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","Other data formatting techniques also exist. For example, in the cdma reverse link, the pilot signal is time-multiplexed with power control commands. Additionally, in W-CDMA, the forward link uses dedicated pilot signals that are time-multiplexed with other information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","142","1","202","204","206","140","1"]},"The despread signal is then Walsh uncovered in traffic channel Walsh uncoverer  using the same Walsh sequence as that of the traffic channel Walsh coverer  of FIG. . The Walsh-uncovered chips are then accumulated into Walsh symbols in Walsh chip summer  and provided as a traffic channel signal to dot product circuit . In some applications, an additional delay element (not shown) is introduced between Walsh chip summer  and dot product circuit  to account for delays introduced by pilot filter . However, if pilot filter  is a causal filter, such a delay element (not shown) is not necessary. The dot product circuit is also known as a \u201cconjugate product\u201d circuit. It performs the operation expressed mathematically by one of the following equivalent forms: <a,b>=a\u2022b=ab* , where b*  is the complex conjugate of b.","The despread signal is also provided to Walsh chip summer  where they are accumulated into Walsh symbols and provided to pilot filter  as pilot channel symbols. Note that since the pilot channel is covered with the all-one Walsh sequence in Walsh coverer  of , a vacuous operation, the corresponding uncoverer is also vacuous in operation. However, in the general case, the pilot signal may be uncovered using any same Walsh sequence as is used to cover it. The pilot filter  serves to reject the noise in the pilot symbols, providing a phase and scale reference for the dot product circuit .","Once per symbol, the dot product circuit  computes the component of the traffic channel signal in phase with the pilot channel signal generated by the pilot filter . As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,506,865, entitled \u201cPILOT CARRIER DOT PRODUCT CIRCUIT,\u201d issued Apr. 9, 1996, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference, the dot product adjusts both the received signal's phase and scale as needed for coherent demodulation.","The symbols output from dot product circuit  are de-interleaved in de-interleaver , using the same format used by interleaver  of FIG. . The de-interleaved symbols are then decoded in decoder  according to the error correcting codes employed by encoder  of FIG. . The resulting decoded symbols are analyzed on a frame-by-frame basis by quality indicator (CRC CHECK)  to ensure that the frame was properly decoded. If the frame was properly decoded, then that decoded frame is forwarded for further processing. Quality indicator (CRC CHECK)  typically would examine the CRC portion of the frame, but may also use other frame quality indications such as Yamamoto metrics.","A typical pilot filter  is implemented as an equal-weight finite impulse response (FIR) filter with all defining parameters (e.g., weighting, window width, window center) remaining constant regardless of the channel conditions. Alternately, an exponential decay infinite impulse response (IIR) filter having fixed parameters (e.g., decay time constant, scaling) may be used. In other words, the designer of a typical prior art pilot filter  will choose a static filter design that performs adequately for a given energy per bit to noise density ratio (E\/N) under most channel conditions of interest, but not optimally over the entire range of conditions.","As a mobile station (e.g., a cellular telephone, PCS telephone or other wireless remote communication terminal) moves through the terrestrial environment, the signals it transmits and receives will experience various types of fading. The mobile environment is usually characterized by fading that can be either Rician or Rayleigh in nature. Other types of fading are also possible. The fading characteristic in the typical channel signal is caused by the signal being reflected from many different features of the physical environment, thus it is called multipath fading. At the UHF frequency bands usually employed for mobile radio communications, including those of cellular mobile telephone systems, significant phase differences in signals traveling on different paths may occur. The possibility for both constructive and destructive summation of the signals may result, with on occasion deep fades occurring.","Multipath channel fading is a function very sensitive to the physical position of the mobile unit. A small change in position of the mobile unit changes the physical delays of all the signal propagation paths, which further results in a different phase for each path. Thus, the motion of the mobile unit through the environment can result in a rapid fading process. For example, in the 850 MHz cellular radio frequency band, this fading can typically be as fast as one fade per second for every mile per hour of vehicle speed. Fading this severe can be extremely disruptive to signals in the terrestrial channel resulting in poor communication quality, particularly as the speed of the mobile station increases beyond 150 km\/hr.","As previously stated, the typical fixed-parameter pilot filter  is not optimized for such a broad range of channel conditions. It is typically designed to work adequately at speeds from stationary to about 120 km\/hr, or about as fast as a mobile station might be expected to travel in a motor vehicle on the highway. However, since the fading characteristics of the channel are vastly different as between a slow-moving mobile station and a fast-moving mobile station, the typical fixed-parameter pilot filter  cannot be optimized for both extremes. Typically, this forces the designer to design a pilot filter  that works well only when the mobile station is stationary or moves slower than about 150 km\/hr, and works poorly beyond 150 km\/hr. As transportation such as bullet trains and airplanes exceeds this speed, it is unlikely that the user of a mobile station will be able to obtain reliable communications. Even when operational, the signal-to-noise ratio (or in other words, the E\/N) of the communication link must be kept at a high enough level to be reliable in these severe fading conditions. Increasing the E\/Nof the communication link decreases the total capacity of the wireless system, particularly in a CDMA system where one transmitter's transmissions comprise interference to all other transmitters in the same CDMA frequency band. As a result, the designer of a fixed-parameter pilot filter  generally adopts an unfavorable compromise in selecting the filter parameters when faced with such a broad range of channel conditions.","Thus, there is a need for a more optimal pilot filtering method and apparatus, particularly in the wireless communication environment, that avoids these shortcomings in the prior art.","The present invention is a novel and improved method and circuit for adaptively estimating channel conditions of a pilot channel in a wireless communication system. The method includes estimating channel statistics of the pilot channel, and adaptively filtering the pilot channel in response to the estimated channel statistics. The estimation is performed by filtering a channel signal derived from the pilot channel, or any channel bearing ambiguous data with the ambiguity removed after detection or decoding. This determines an estimated channel mean and an estimated channel covariance. In order to perform the adaptive filtering, the present invention partitions the pilot channel into one or more time slots and weights each time slot according to the estimated channel statistics. Thus, an advantage of the present invention is that it automatically and continually updates the pilot filter parameters in order to optimize the pilot filter performance over a broad range of channel conditions.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the channel signal is filtered in one or more infinite impulse response (IIR) filters to determine the channel statistics. In another embodiment, the channel signal is filtered in a combination of IIR and finite impulse response (FIR) filters to determine the channel statistics.","In an embodiment applicable to the cdma system wherein the pilot channel comprises a pilot signal portion having a known sign and a power control bit portion having an unknown sign. The method of the present invention may also include determining the sign of the power control bit portion, correcting the sign of the power control bit portion, and then combining the sign-corrected power control bit portion with the pilot signal portion to generate the channel signal from which the channel statistics are estimated by the channel statistics estimator. In yet another embodiment, the method includes determining the sign of the traffic signal and generating the channel signal in response to the traffic signal.","In yet another embodiment applicable to a cdma system, wherein the pilot channel comprises a sequence of power control groups, each power control group having a pilot signal portion having a known sign and a power control bit portion having an unknown sign, the time slots have a duration substantially equal to the duration of the pilot signal portion.","A circuit for performing the method of the present invention is also described herein.","The present invention will now be described in an application that is specific but not limited to the demodulation of a cdma reverse link signal. As is described in the proposed IS-2000 standard, the cdma reverse link signal comprises a traffic channal signal and a reverse link pilot signal. Punctured into the reverse link pilot channel (R-PICH) is a forward link power control subchannel that is a single bit that spans the last quarter of each 1.25 ms power control group (PCG). This forward link power control bit is a signal from the mobile station to the base station transmitter to either increase or decrease its transmit power based on the mobile station's reception quality on the forward link. Such a reverse link pilot is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,396,804, entitled \u201cHIGH DATA RATE CDMA WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM,\u201d issued May 28, 2002, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","Because the R-PICH is used by the base station as a coherent reference for data demodulation, a frequency reference for frequency tracking, and a received power reference for power control measurements, the uncertainty introduced by the forward link power control subchannel in the otherwise determinate signal could degrade the reverse link performance. In other words, the puncturing of the forward link power control subchannel into the R-PICH could lead to poorer reverse link performance than a continuous pilot channel. For example, if we use only the non-punctured portion of the pilot channel to estimate the channel, the signal-to-noise ratio of the channel estimate calculated by the base station is decreased. A technique for resolving the sign ambiguity of the R-PICH and reconstructing a continuous pilot signal therefrom is given in U.S. Pat. No. 6,304,563, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROCESSING A PUNCTURED PILOT CHANNEL,\u201d issued Oct. 16, 2001, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated here by reference.","It will be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art that although the present invention is disclosed with reference to a cdma system having a R-PICH with a punctured power control subchannel, the present invention is equally applicable to other wireless communication systems having a non-punctured pilot channel. Thus, the following figures are intended to be example applications of the present invention and are not intended to limit the present invention to the cdma system.","Turning now to , a first embodiment of the present invention is illustrated as being implemented in a cdma reverse link traffic channel demodulator. Channel statistic estimator  estimates channel statistics which are used by adaptive non-causal channel estimator  to adaptively filter the pilot channel as will be discussed in more detail below. It should be noted that in other embodiments, indeed in the embodiment of  described below, an adaptive causal channel estimator or filter may be used in place of adaptive non-causal channel estimator . However, in the embodiment of , a non-causal filter is used for channel estimation due to its improved performance over a causal filter when the delay of the non-causal filter is tolerable. In the exemplary embodiment of , adaptive non-causal channel estimator  is an FIR filter. However, in the general case, adaptive non-causal channel estimator  may be an IIR filter or a hybrid filter with both FIR and IIR characteristics. One simple example is a filter that outputs the difference of two exponential decay IIR filters of the same time constant but different weights, such that the effective impulse response of the filter is of finite extent. Another example would be a cascaded FIR and IIR filter.","The filtered pilot channel symbols are then input to conjugate product circuits  and . Conjugate product circuit  also receives as a second input, the despread, Walsh uncovered, and delayed traffic channel that has been delayed by delay circuit . Delay circuit  delays the traffic channel by an amount substantially equal to the delay introduced by adaptive non-causal channel estimator . Conjugate product circuit  produces traffic channel symbols (soft decisions) for further de-interleaving and decoding as is known in the art.","Conjugate product circuit  receives as a second input the delayed pilot channel that has been delayed by delay circuit . Delay circuit  delays the pilot channel by an amount substantially equal to the delay introduced by adaptive non-causal channel estimator . Conjugate product circuit  performs a conjugate multiplication of the estimator  output with the delayed pilot channel which contains a power control bit punctured into the reverse link pilot channel. Conjugate product circuit then forwards the resultant power control bit signal to past forward link (FL) power control bit (PCB) detector .","Past FL PCB detector  compares the resultant power control bit signal to a threshold and thereby determines the sign of the punctured FL PCB. It should be noted that the term \u201cpast\u201d is used in describing the operation performed by past FL PCB detector  because the power control bit being detected at any given time is the power control bit from a pas power control group, as delayed by delay  and adaptive non-causal channel estimator . The FL PCB decision determined by past FL PCB detector  is then forwarded to PCB sign corrector  where the sign of the PCB is flipped, if necessary, to match the sign of the remainder of the pilot channel (+1). The output of PCB sign corrector  is then provided, along with the further delayed pilot channel from delay , to time multiplexer (MUX) . Time MUX  provides, during the first \u00be of the power control group, an output equal to the further delayed pilot channel from delay , which compensates for the processing time of the past FL PCB detector . Time MUX  provides, during the remaining \u00bc of the power control group, the output of PCB sign corrector  which is now equal in sign (+1) to the pilot channel. The resulting output signal from time MUX , is, therefore, a reconstructed pilot channnel signal of constant sign. A similar technique for continuous pilot channel reconstruction in given in the above-incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 6,304,563.","The reconstructed channel signal is provided to channel statistic estimator  which estimates channel statistics therefrom for use in setting the weighting factors used by adaptive non-causal channel estimator  as mentioned above. The generation of channel statistics by channel statistic estimator  and the application of weighting factors by adaptive non-causal channel estimator  will be discussed in further detail below.","It should be noted that the elements in the left-hand side of  that are involved soley in generating the reconstructed channel signal for use by channel statistic estimator  (i.e., delay , conjugate product circuit , delay , past FL PCB detector , PCB sign corrector  and time MUX ) are necessary only for a punctured pilot channel such as the R-PICH of the cdma reverse link. These elements may be omitted in applications having a non-punctured or otherwise continuous pilot channel. In such a case, the pilot channel signal itself may be sufficient for use by channel statistic estimator . Furthermore, the channel signal may also be generated from the additional energy contained in the traffic signal using the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,452,917, entitled \u201cCHANNEL ESTIMATION IN A CDMA WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM,\u201d issued Sep. 17, 2002, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. In the just-mentioned patent application, the decoded traffic channel symbols are re-encoded, re-interleaved, weighted according to the frame quality indicator and combined with the pilot channel estimate, which in , would be the reconstructed channel signal output from time MUX . Thus, in the general case, the generation of the channel signal, i.e., a signal that represents the channel, may be a weighted combination of contributions from the pilot portion of the R-PICH, the sign-corrected FL PCB from the R-PICH, and the sign-corrected traffic from one or more traffic channels.","Turning now to , a second embodiment of the present invention illustrated as being implemented in a forward link power control bit demodulator. In , channel statistic estimator , which may be the same as channel statistic estimator  of , is illustrated as receiving the channel signal, which may be the reconstructed channel signal of  in the case of a the R-PICH demodulator of , or a reconstructed channel signal from a sign-corrected traffic channel after successful decoding, re-encoding, and re-interleavi g as detailed in the above-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 6.452,917, or a weighted combination of the two signals. In the general case, channel statistici estimator  may be different than channel statistics estimator . Both may use essentially the same algorithm, described in detail below, but they may operate on different data, or over different time slots, or even different channel signal inputs. The channel signal is operated on by channel statistic estimator  as will be described further below in order to estimate the channel statistics by which adaptive predictive causal channel estimator  will assign filter weighting coefficients. In the exemplary embodiment of , adaptive predictive causal channel estimator  is an FIR filter. However, in the general case, it may be an IIR filter, or a hybrid filter having both FIR and IIR characteristics.","Adaptive predictive causal channel estimator  provides a channel estimate through delay  to conjugate product circuit . Conjugate product circuit  performs a conjugate multiplication on the channel estimate and the pilot channel (in this case, the R-PICH) to demodulate the FL PCB punctured into the R-PICH. The resultant power control bit signal is then forwarded to current FL PCB detector  for determination of the sign of the current FL PCB. Current FL PCB detector  may be of similar construction to past FL PCB detector  of FIG. . Current FL PCB detector  estimates a current FL PCB decision regarding the sign of the FL PCB by comparing the power control bit signal from conjugate product circuit  to a threshold. The current FL PCB decision may then be used by the forward link transmitter (not shown) to increase or decrease its power as necessary.","As described above, in both the embodiments of FIG.  and , the channel statistic estimators  and  estimate channel statistics for use by adaptive non-causal channel estimator  and adaptive predictive causal channel estimator , respectively, in setting their respective filter coefficients. To explain how this process occurs, the following mathematical description will be introduced. First, consider the received channel signal of a particular Rake finger of a Rake receiver entering the mobile station channel statistic estimator  or  input. This received signal is of the form:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere\n\n","Therefore, the dimension of the column vectors a[n], w[n], y[n], or the number of integral values that n can take on, is the same as the number of time slots of received channel signal used as input for adaptive channel estimation. In the second exemplary embodiment applicable to the predictive estimation of a FL PCB in a cdma R-PICH, each time slot may be \u00be of a single 1.25 ms power control group (i.e., the non-punctured portion of the pilot channel). Thus, if we use 2 PCG worth of channel signal as input for estimation, as n ranges from 1 and 2, y[] represents the received channel signal of the current \u00be PCG of pilot whereas y[] represents the received channel signal of the previous \u00be PCG of pilot. These y[] and y[] values can be obtained by simple averaging of pilot symbols over the said \u00be PCG of pilots.","Other embodiments may use larger or smaller time slots depending on the resolution and estimation accuracy desired as a tradeoff to the costs of computation. For example, in the cdma embodiment, the punctured FL PCB may be one coherent time slot, with an ambiguous sign, or it can comprise several smaller coherent time slots if finer resolution is desired. In the general case, the time slots may be of unequal duration, though the received channel signal at each time slot could be weighted appropriately to normalize the information signal amplitude or, depending on the application, the signal-to-noise ratio. In other embodiments, the time slots may be a configurable parameter. If a partition of the channel signal into finer time slots is used, the index n can range from one to a higher number. If a non-causal estimator is desired, as in the embodiment of , some of the elements of the column vectors y[n], a[n], and w[n] may also represent values after the time of interest in the system where the channel estimate is desired.","We must estimate the actual channel value x at a given moment, as shown below in Equation (2). Equation (2) represents the operation performed by both adaptive non-causal channel estimator  and adaptive predictive causal channel estimator . One difference between the two applications is the different partitions of the channel signal into different time slots as discussed above. Note that all estimates herein are denoted by the ^ (\u201chat\u201d) notation Let x be the desired channel value at a time slot of interest. For example, while the index n for the y, a, and w vectors takes on the values 1 and 2 representing the pilot portions of the pilot channel during the current and previous PCGs as in the exemplary embodiment of , x represents the channel value at the current PCB portion of the pilot channel,\n\n(])\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere\n\n","In other words, H is a vector representation of a linear-filter that when the filter is applied to an arbitrary signal z[n], the output resulting from the operation can be described in the following in time domain notation: \n\n\nwhere k is the vector index.\n","It is also possible to make x into a vector by packing more values into it when the channel estimate at multiple time instances are desired, especially if this provides extra implementational convenience in some embodiment of application due to the computational architecture used. Thus:\n\n(])\u2003\u2003(2a)\n\n\n\nwhere H now represents the filter matrix, and j and k are the vector indices for the row and column, respectively, with j being the index of a particular element {circumflex over (x)}[j] in the vector x to be estimated.\n","The values {circumflex over (m)}[n], {circumflex over (K)}, and {circumflex over (K)}are what are referred to herein as the estimated channel statistics. These are the values estimated by channel statistics estimator  and  for use by adaptive non-causal channel estimator  and adaptive predictive causal channel estimator , respectively, in determining the filter weighting used to estimate {circumflex over (x)}. Thus, these channel statistics are the needed components of Equation (2) above, given that y[n], the actual received channel signal, is already known.","Next, the generation of these channel statistics is described. Channel statistic estimators  and  generate the estimated channel signal mean, {circumflex over (m)}[n], according to the following relationship:\n\n\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nwhere gis a filter impulse response, which in the general case may be either an FIR or an IIR or hybrid filter that has both FIR and IIR characteristics; and the operator * represents convolution in the time domain.\n","Note that y[n] now represents a signal vector in time, and the time index over which the convolution operation is applied is not shown. If it were shown, both {circumflex over (m)}[n] and y[n] would have two indices, with the first one (shown) representing the time slots (e.g. \u201ccurrent PCG\u201d and \u201cprevious PCG\u201d as used for the second exemplary embodiment of the application above), and the second (not shown) representing the updating of the vector values as what is \u201ccurrent time\u201d proceeds.","The same method is used to calculate the estimate {circumflex over (m)}[n] since the elements of {circumflex over (m)}[n] represent the estimated channel just as the elements of {circumflex over (m)}[n] do, though at perhaps different time slots, so that only a shuffling of time slot indices is required before the direct application of the same method. Note that the channel mean usually does not change often, and when the time slots used as estimation inputs are close together in time, we may use one single value to represent all the elements in {circumflex over (m)}[n], {circumflex over (m)}[n] because they are similar in value, thus possibly saving computation. In another embodiment of application of the present invention in which the channel is known to have zero-mean, {circumflex over (m)}[n], {circumflex over (m)}[n] can be taken to be zero, thus simplifying Equation (2).\n\n(])\u2003\u2003(2b)\n","Channel statistic estimators  and  generate {circumflex over (K)}, the estimated covariance of x and the vector y[n] according to the following relationship:\n\n*()\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nwhere\n\n","Channel statistic estimators  and  generate {circumflex over (K)}, the estimated covariance of the y[n] vector according to the following relationship:\n\n*(])\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nwhere gis a filter impulse response, which in the general case may be either an FIR or an IIR or hybrid filter that has both FIR and IIR characteristics; and y*[m] is the conjugate of y[m].\n","Again, the time index over which the convolution operation is applied is not shown. The present invention also contemplates taking advantage of the fact that {circumflex over (K)}may be conjugate symmetric, that is,\n\n\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nsuch that only half of the values in the matrix {circumflex over (K)}need to be computed.\n","In addition, if part of the received channel signal vector y[n] has time slots of equal durations representing values equally spaced in time, we may also take advantage of the shift-invariant property of the covariance function and save computation further,\n\n\u2003\u2003(8)\n\nwhere k is any integer value as long as m+k and n+k are within the scope of valid indices of the matrix {circumflex over (K)}and where the above assumption about the partition of time slots is true.\n","The time constants of these three filters, g, g, g, are usually picked for the particular application at hand depending on the system parameters. For example, if the channel statistics do not change over a duration of time on the order of one second, the time constants of the filters g, g, g, may be chosen to be one second or shorter.","When multiple Rake fingers are used, a more sophisticated application of the present invention can make sure that the channel statistics from the different fingers are the same or similar, and use all the channel signals y[n] from different fingers for the statistics estimation, giving more accurate estimates due to the increased amount of available input for estimating the same or similar values of channel statistics.","So, as can be seen from the above mathematical relationships, channel statistic estimators  and  generate the channel statistics {circumflex over (m)}, {circumflex over (m)}, {circumflex over (K)}, and {circumflex over (K)}. These are in turn provided to the respective channel estimators (both adaptive non-causal channel estimator  and adaptive predictive causal channel estimator , which may also be referred to generically as \u201cpilot filters\u201d). The channel estimators of FIG.  and  then use these channel statistics in carrying out the operation described by Equation (2) above, i.e., adaptively estimating the channel conditions.","Central to the present invention is the concept that the channel statistics are slowly but constantly changing as the mobile station moves through the fading environment. These channel statistics are continually updated by channel statistic estimators  and  for use by adaptive non-causal channel estimator  and adaptive predictive causal channel estimator , respectively. Because these channel statistics form the basis for Equation (2), the adaptive filtering operation, both adaptive non-causal channel estimator  and adaptive predictive causal channel estimator  are changing their filter parameters in response to changes in channel conditions.","Advantageous to the present invention, Equation (2) gives an estimator that minimizes the mean squared error of the estimate output. Moreover, the present invention provides convenient and efficient methods to automatically calculate all the ingredients for employing this equation. Thus, both adaptive non-causal channel estimator  and adaptive predictive causal channel estimator  are continually updated by channel statistic estimators  and , respectively, such that they are optimized under the then-prevailing channel conditions. This allows both adaptive non-causal channel estimator  and adaptive predictive causal channel estimator  to generate the best channel estimate for a given channel condition under a broad range of channel conditions. In sharp contrast to the prior art, the present invention provides a method and apparatus for adaptively estimating the channel conditions in a wireless communication system based on the use of estimated channel statistics to determine the channel estimator's filter parameters. Thus, the present invention is always optimized for the current channel conditions, resulting in a significantly lower communication link E\/Nrequirement for a given bit error rate.","The previous description of the preferred embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention.
