title: Ferroelectric delay line based on a dielectric-slab transmission line
abstract: A delay line is made by sandwiching a thin slice of ferroelectric between two “cladding” layers of relatively low-ε, low loss material to form a dielectric slab waveguide, and may support the propagation of electromagnetic guided waves and hence be used as a source of electric-field tunable time delay. There is a frequency range within which a dielectric-slab delay line behaves like a homogeneous transmission line with an “average” dielectric constant that is much lower than that of the ferroelectric, thereby ameliorating the difficulty with the high dielectric constant of the ferroelectric material. The thin slice of ferroelectric material “expels” a large fraction of the wave electric field, causing most of it to occupy the low-loss cladding material, greatly reducing the propagation loss along the delay line while allowing delay time to be varied by applying an electric-field through the ferroelectric within the cladding structure.

No. 10\/361,563 filed Feb. 11, 2003 now abandoned.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The present invention relates to a ferroelectric delay line. In particular, the present invention is directed toward a ferroelectric electric-field variable delay line based on a dielectric-slab transmission line.","Due to its lack of moving parts and potential for conformal installation on vehicles, missiles and aircraft, the electrically scannable (E-scan) antenna is an important weapon in the arsenal of the Army's Future Combat Systems.","Most approaches to designing such antennas involve some type of phased array, in which the antenna beam is created by superimposing the outputs of many antenna subelements. Steering this beam is implemented by phase-shifting the input signals to these antenna elements relative to one another via phase shifters. The use of these phases shifters for beam steering has made it imperative that a simple, low-cost method be identified for electrically controlling them. However, existing approaches to designing phased-array antennas involves complicated sub-circuits with mixers, amplifiers, and the like, feeding each antenna element. Such circuitry makes the radius complicated, unreliable, and expensive to manufacture and maintain.","Recent work at the Army Research Lab on E-scan antennas as part of the Multifunction RF STO has centered on two architectures for such passed arrays: one based on the use of hundreds of discrete phase shifters, one for each antenna subelement, and the other a \u201ctrue-time delay\u201d approach in which a single tapped delay line is used to generate and phase all the signals sent to the antenna array elements at the same time.","In the true time-delay approach, a time-dependent input signal is launched as a wave on a waveguide. Electrodes (\u201ctaps\u201d) placed along the waveguide at equal intervals generate replicas of this input signal that are delayed relative to one another by the time the wave takes to go from one tap to another. In contrast to the discrete phase shifter approach, with its hundreds of elements, this approach makes possible the simultaneous generation of as many signals as are needed from a single monolithic element, the waveguide. When used in this fashion, the waveguide is referred to as a \u201cdelay line\u201d.","Some delay lines have the property that the delays imposed on the signal replicas appearing at its taps are the same regardless of the underlying signal frequency (in the art such a line is said to be \u201cnon-dispersive\u201d). When this is true, even complex time-dependent signals consisting of many frequencies (so-called \u201cbroadband\u201d signals) can be used to steer antenna beams in one direction without drifting or unintentional scanning. In contrast, the discrete phase shifter approach restricts the complexity of input signals lest they interfere with the steering in the specified direction, which makes them useless for sophisticated radar applications.","In order to electrically steer the antenna, it is necessary to electrically control the phase shifts imposed on the signal replicas sent to the antenna elements. It has long been known that electrically controllable phase shifters can be made by using ferroelectric materials, by virtue of the nonlinear dielectric response of the latter. Combining this choice of materials with the true-time delay approach leads to the novel concept of an electrically controllable delay line. Such a line can support the propagation of a signal along it like any other delay line, and can be tapped in the same way, leading to phase shifts between the taps. The choice of dielectric determines how much delay is obtained per length of line.","However, if the dielectric used to make the line is also a ferroelectric, the line properties can be changed by \u201cbiasing\u201d it with a DC voltage. The simplest way to implement such a line is to make it a microstrip, consisting of a ferroelectric layer on top of a metal ground plane with a narrow strip of metal on top of the ferroelectric layer. The input signal propagates along this metal strip as a voltage between the top conductor and the ground plane. This type of line is non-dispersive as defined above, so that complex signals can be used with it. In addition to this signal, a DC bias can be applied in the same way. Because the bias changes the RF propagation velocity, the delay, and hence the phase shift, can be controlled by the bias. This control applies to all the multiple versions of the signal obtained from the taps, i.e., all the phase shifts are controlled by a single DC bias. In principle, one delay line could steer an entire antenna array.","Unfortunately, such use of ferroelectrics is not without problems. Because dielectric constants are extremely high in these materials, the wavelengths of electromagnetic waves that propagate in them are very short, which leads to \u201ctoo much\u201d phase shift per centimeter of line. In addition, the loss per centimeter down the line is extremely high.","It can be shows that in order for a phased array antenna fed by a delay line to generate a strong main beam, the distance between delay line taps D must satisfy the relation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":["D","d"]},"mo":"\u2062","msqrt":{"mi":"\u025b"}},"mo":"<","mn":"1"},"mo":","}}},"br":{}},"These parameters make a microwave-based delay line using ferroelectrics difficult to manufacture. In addition, the dielectric constant of a pure ferroelectric material is extremely sensitive to temperature, and typically is lossy as well, which may distort the shape of the antenna beam and produce unintended beam motion.","The problems described above can all be solved by using the delay line of the present invention, which is made by sandwiching a thin slice of ferroelectric vertically between two \u201ccladding\u201d layers of relatively low-\u03b5, low loss material. This type of structure, referred to as a dielectric slab waveguide in the art, can support the propagation of electromagnetic guided waves like an ordinary microstrip, and hence can be used as a source of phase delay.","In general, the characteristics of this propagation are more complex than those of a simple microstrip (see Ref. 1). However, according to the present invention, there is a frequency (determined by proper choice of materials and geometry) below which this dielectric-slab wave guide behaves like a simple microstrip line, i.e., a metal strip over a uniform dielectric, with an \u201caverage\u201d dielectric constant. Because this average dielectric constant can be much lower than that of the ferroelectric, the difficulties associated with the high dielectric constant of the pure ferroelectric material can be overcome.","There are a number of advantages to the present invention. Because the structure \u201clooks like\u201d microstrip in the frequency range of interest, the delay it generates is almost frequency-independent as is the case for microstrip. Because the average dielectric constant can be made low, the delay line taps can be spaced farther apart, which prevents arcing from tap to tap under high-power operation. In addition, it can be shown that the thin slice of ferroelectric material \u201cexpels\u201d the wave electric field into the low-loss cladding material, which greatly reduces propagation losses along the delay line.","In principle, a nondispersive delay line could be obtained by simply mixing the cladding and ferroelectric materials together to form a uniform composite, and then putting the microstrip on top. However, such a mixture of dielectric and ferroelectric would tend to be unresponsive to the dc bias applied to the top conductor, because the voltage will tend to be felt by only the non-turnable and low dielectric material due to parallel capacitance effects, which inhibits the control of the phase shift. In contrast, the invention described here forces most of the dc bias field to pass through the thin slice of undiluted ferroelectric, causing a large change in the dielectric response. This greatly extends the range of controllable phase shifts, and hence the steering capability of the line.","With reference to , a ferroelectric layer  is placed between the vertical edges of two dielectric \u201ccladding\u201d layers , with all three layers resting upright on the ground plane . A metal strip  overlays the structure, covering the entire exposed edge of the ferroelectric  and a portion of the two cladding layers .","With reference to ), the ferroelectric layer  is sandwiched between the two cladding layers  and rests with them on the ground plane . The metal strip with taps  carries the input signal and distributes it along the taps to the patch antennas . In ) the structure is flipped upside down, with the ferroelectric layer  contacting the metal strip  on the underside of the cladding-plus-ferroelectric structure , which is labeled \u201cdielectric 1\u201d. The ground plane , which is now on top of the structure, is pierced by apertures  that allow the signal to penetrate a second dielectric layer , which is labeled \u201cdielectric 2\u201d. On this dielectric layer a patch antenna  is placed directly over each aperture , from which it receives signal power.","The ferroelectric delay line consists of two plates of relatively low-dielectric constant, low-loss material (henceforth referred to as \u201ccladding\u201d) placed edge-to-edge, with a thin slice of high-dielectric constant (ferroelectric) material inserted between their adjacent edges so that the entire structure forms a horizontal \u201csandwich\u201d, and a metal strip placed on top of the juncture that covers the \u201ctop\u201d of the ferroelectric layer and a predetermined amount of the cladding on both sides of the juncture, with the entire structure resting on a metal plate (henceforth referred so as the \u201cground plane\u201d).","This structure forms a laterally nonuniform microstrip transmission line that supports propagation of electromagnetic guided waves, which waves become a source of time delay and phase shift for signal processing and phased array antennas.
