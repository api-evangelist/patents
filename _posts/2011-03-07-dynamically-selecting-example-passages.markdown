title: Dynamically selecting example passages
abstract: Techniques for dynamically selecting example passages to output on an electronic device in response to a user selecting a word or other portion of a content item are described herein. In one example, a user selects a word from a rendered electronic book. In response, the device outputs an entry for the word from a reference work (e.g., a definition from a dictionary, etc.). In addition, the device outputs passages that include the word from other electronic books stored on the device. These passages are more likely to be recognized and appreciated by the user than generic passages, since the dynamically-selected passages are found in electronic books that the user has previously acquired and potentially previously read.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Example Architecture","Example Electronic Reader","Example User Interfaces (UIs)","Example Processes","Conclusion"],"p":["A large and growing population of users is consuming digital content items on a varying array of electronic devices. These electronic devices include dedicated electronic book reader devices, smartphones, desktop computers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet computing devices, and the like. While consuming content on these devices, users often utilize one or more reference works stored on or accessible by the devices. For instance, when reading an electronic book on an electronic book reader, a user may request to view a definition of a word that the user does not know the meaning of. In response, the device may display a definition of the word from a dictionary. However, because dictionaries or other reference works often include static content, the displayed definition or other type of reference work entry is often static. As such, the displayed definition or other entry is common across different users and devices.","This disclosure describes systems, devices, and processes (collectively \u201ctechniques\u201d) for dynamically selecting example passages to output on an electronic device in response to a user selecting a word or other portion of a content item.","For instance, when a user consumes (e.g., reads, listens to, etc.) a content item on an electronic device, the user may select a portion of the content item for the purpose of learning additional information about the selected portion. In one example, the user may select a portion of text found within the content item. In response, the techniques may retrieve a reference work entry associated with the selected portion. The reference work may comprise a dictionary, an encyclopedia, a thesaurus, an atlas, an almanac, a gazetteer, or any other type of reference work.","In addition, the techniques may identify one or more passages that include some or the entire selected portion from other content items that are associated with the user or the device. For instance, the passages may be identified from content items that are accessible to the electronic device (e.g., items stored locally on the device or stored remotely in an account associated with the user or the device).","In one example, when a user selects a particular word from an electronic book (e.g., \u201cadvantage\u201d), the techniques may attempt to find one or more other passages from other content items that either include the same word or include a stem of this word (e.g., \u201cadvantaged\u201d, \u201cadvantages\u201d, etc.). In some instances, the techniques attempt to find these passages from content items that the electronic device has access to due to the user previously purchasing or otherwise obtaining the items. As such, these accessible content items may reside locally or may be stored remotely on an account associated with the user and\/or the device.","After identifying other passages from other content items that include the word or the stem of the word, the techniques may rank these passages and output one or more of these passages based at least in part on the ranking. These passages may be output at a same time as the retrieved reference work entry, or at another time (e.g., one after the other, etc.). By outputting both the reference work entry and the example passage(s), the techniques aid the user in better understanding the meaning or context of the selected word. Furthermore, by surfacing a dynamically-selected passage from a content item that the user has previously obtained, the user is more likely to understand the meaning or context of the word based on the passage. That is, because the techniques surface one or more passages from content items that the user has previously purchased or otherwise obtained, it is more likely that the user will recognize and appreciate these example passages as compared to generic passages found in a static dictionary or other type of reference work.","In order to dynamically select passages in this manner, the techniques may rank the identified passages in any number of ways. In one example, the techniques may assign weights to the identified passages and may output passages based at least in part on the assigned weights. For instance, the techniques may output a highest ranking passage (or a number of highest ranking passages) based on the weights, may output each passage having a cumulative weight that is greater than a threshold amount, or the like. Furthermore, it is to be appreciated that while the examples described below describe identifying passages from content items and then assigning weights to the passages, in other instances the techniques may assign weights to content items and then identify passages therein.","In one example, the techniques assign a weight to each passage based on whether the passage exactly matches the selected word (e.g., \u201cadvantage\u201d and \u201cadvantage\u201d), or whether the passage includes a word that only matches a stem of the selected word (e.g., \u201cadvantaged\u201d and \u201cadvantage\u201d). The techniques may, in some instances, assign a higher weight to passages that include exact-matching words.","In another example, the techniques may rank the identified passages by first identifying a genre or category of the rendered content item\u2014that is, of the content item that includes the selected word. The techniques may then compare this genre to each content item that includes a passage that includes the selected word. The techniques may then rank the passages based on this comparison. In one example, the techniques assign a higher weight to passages from content items that are from a same or similar genre or category as the rendered content item. For example, if a user selects a word from within a \u201cmedical-related\u201d content item, then passages from other medical-related content items may be assigned a higher weight than passages from non-medical-related items.","A genre or category of a content item may be determined in a multitude of different ways, such as by analyzing a categorization of the content item in an electronic catalog, by identifying keywords within the content item, by utilizing crowd-sourcing techniques, or the like. In some instances, genres or categories may be determined using techniques described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/749,073, filed on Mar. 29, 2010 and entitled \u201cContext-Sensitive Reference Works\u201d, which is in herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In another example, the techniques may rank the passages based on how recently the user accessed the corresponding content item. For instance, if the techniques identify ten passages that include the selected word from ten different content items, the techniques may determine when the user last read or otherwise accessed each of the ten content items. The techniques may then rank the passages based at least in part on these determined times. In one example, passages associated with content items that have been read or otherwise accessed more recently may be assigned a weight that is greater than passages associated with content items that have not been read or accessed in quite some time. By doing so, the techniques are more likely to output passages that are fresh in the mind of the user and, hence, passages that are more likely to help the user understand the meaning or context of the selected word.","In yet another example, the techniques may rank the passages based on ratings associated with the content items. For instance, for each content item having a passage that includes the selected word, the techniques may determine a rating associated with the underlying content item. This may be the rating assigned to the content item by a user of the device, or by a community of users (e.g., all users that have provided a rating of the content item to a rating service). Then, the techniques may assign higher weights to passages that are from higher-rated content items. Similarly, the techniques may determine how often a particular content item appears in user-created lists (e.g., on a merchant web site), and may assign a higher weight to content items that appear on a relatively greater number of lists.","In yet another example, the techniques may assign weights to the passages based on how often the passages have been annotated. These annotations include users having commented on a passage, highlighted a passage, saved a passage, or otherwise having indicated an interest in a particular passage. After identifying a number of times that a passage has been annotated or a number of unique users that have annotated the passages, the techniques may assign weights to the passages accordingly. In some instances, passages that have been annotated more times and\/or by more users receive higher weights than other passages.","In still other instances, the techniques identify which passages the user of the electronic device has annotated, and assigns even higher weights to these passages. By weighting more greatly passages that the user has previously shown an interest in, the techniques again output passages that are likely to help the user understand the selected word associated with these passages.","While a few example factors have been listed, the techniques may take into account any other factor or combination of factors when determining which passages to output on the electronic device, and a manner (e.g., order, style, etc.) in which to output these passages. For instance, the techniques may take into account information associated with the user (e.g., age, preferences, etc.), a geographical location of the device (e.g., determined via triangulation or global positioning satellites (GPS)), and\/or the like.","Further, and as described below, the content items and the passages may comprise any sort of content that is able to be output visually, audibly, tactilely, or in any other user-perceivable manner. For instance, the passages may include sentences from books, clippings from websites, posts from a social networking, blogging, or micro-blogging services, audio clips, video clips, images, or the like.","The claimed techniques are described below with reference to an example architecture. However, it is to be appreciated that a number of other architectures may also employ these techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","102","104","106","106"]},"In this example, the electronic device  has a display  upon which electronic content such as content items or electronic books may be rendered. The terms content, content item, and electronic book include essentially any form of electronic data that may be consumed on a device, including textual and verbal works comprising sequences of words such as digital books, audio books, electronic magazines, papers, journals, periodicals, documents, instructional materials, course content, website content, music, movies, and so on. In other examples, the user  may employ electronic devices that do not include a display, but rather include speakers or another output device for outputting audio or the like.","As such, the electronic device  may comprise a desktop computer, a laptop computer, or any other type of electronic device. In some instances, the electronic device  may be a handheld or other small, light-weight, portable device upon which electronic books and other content can be rendered and conveniently viewed in a manner similar to viewing a paper book. Examples of electronic book readers include flat form-factor devices such as tablets, pads, smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and the like, as well as other types of electronic devices configured to render electronic books (e.g., personal computers, laptop computers, etc.).","In some embodiments, the electronic device  may comprise a dedicated-purpose electronic book reader device, having a flat-panel display and other characteristics that mimic the look, feel, and experience offered by paper-based books. For example, such an electronic book reader devices may have a high-contrast flat-panel display that appears similar to a printed page and that persist without frequent refreshing. Such displays may consume very negligible amounts of power, so that the electronic book reader devices may be used for long periods without recharging or replacing batteries. In some instances, these readers may employ electrophoretic displays.","In the example of , the electronic device  has networking capabilities. For example, the electronic device  may have a wireless communication interface that allows communication though a network . The wireless communications interfaces may utilize WiFi, cellular, or other wireless data and networking technologies. The network  may be any type of communication network, including a local-area network, a wide-area network, the Internet, a wireless network, a wide-area network (WWAN), a cable television network, a telephone network, a cellular communications network, combinations of the foregoing, etc.","In the described embodiment, the electronic device  includes non-volatile storage capabilities so that electronic content items can be downloaded and stored in their entirety on the device. In some instances, once an electronic book has been stored by an electronic reader, it can be displayed and read at any time, whether or not the electronic reader is connected to a network. In other embodiments, meanwhile, the device may stream or otherwise receive content items on-demand.","In the configuration illustrated by , the electronic device  may obtain content items from a content item service  and\/or from any other service. The service  and other services may be accessed using the networking capabilities of the electronic device . The service  and the other services may be accessible through other means as well, such as by connection to intermediary devices like personal computers, different types of mobile devices, and so forth.","In , the content item service  is illustrated as a network-based or cloud-based service, available over a public network such as the Internet. The electronic device  may be configured to allow the user  to conveniently browse for content and content items from the service , and to purchase and download selected content items from the service .","Various applications and user interfaces may be used in conjunction with the electronic device  to interact with the service , such as Internet browser programs that allow a user to interactively engage different online services. In addition, the service  may expose lower-level interfaces or APIs (application programming interfaces) through the network , through which devices and programs can access the underlying functionality of the service  without direct user interaction.","The service  might be implemented in some embodiments by an online merchant or vendor. Electronic books and other electronic content might be offered for sale by such an online merchant, or might be available to members or subscribers for some type of periodic or one-time fee. In some circumstances, electronic books or other content might be made available without charge. In either instance, the service  may include a client interface through which the electronic device  and other devices interact with the service . The client interface may include a virtual storefront or other type of online interface for interaction with consumers and\/or devices. The client interface may expose a graphical, web-based user interface that can be accessed by human users to browse and obtain (e.g., purchase, rent, lease, etc.) content items such as electronic books. The client interface may also expose programmatic interfaces or APIs that entities and devices can use to obtain digital content items and related services.","In the illustrated example, the user  may have utilized the web-based user interface or the APIs to obtain the content item  being rendered by the display . In addition, the user  may have also obtained one or more additional content items (), (), . . . ,  (N) from the service  or another service, as illustrated in . In some instances, the electronic device  may include non-volatile storage  that stores the currently-rendered content item  and the additional content items ()-(N), while in other instances these items may be stored remotely from the electronic device. For instance, the content item service  may store, in non-volatile storage , these items in association with an account of the electronic device  and\/or the user . Furthermore, in some instances, the electronic device  may locally store a portion of the content items previously acquired by the user, while the service  (or another remote entity) may store, in an account of the user  or the device , other content items that the user  has previously acquired.","Furthermore,  illustrates that the electronic device or the content item service  may store one or more reference works  that are accessible to the electronic device . The reference work(s)  may include a dictionary, thesaurus, encyclopedia, anthology, atlas, almanac, gazetteer, and\/or any other type of reference work or combination of reference works. In the illustrated example, the reference work  comprises a dictionary that is effective to output definitions in response to the user  selecting corresponding words within a rendered content item, such as the currently-rendered content item . As with the other items discussed above, the electronic device  may store the reference work  locally, or the electronic device  may access the reference work  at the service  or another remote entity (e.g., over the network ).","As illustrated, the user  may select one or more words and may request information associated with these word(s) from the reference work . In this example, for instance, the user  is shown to have selected the word \u201cadvantage\u201d from within the content item . In this example,  illustrates an indicator  to indicate the selected word. In response to this selection, the electronic device  may locate and output an entry for this word from the reference work . Here, the device  is shown to display a definition  for the word \u201cadvantage\u201d on the display .","In addition, in response to the user  selecting this word, the electronic device  may identify one or more other passages from within the additional content items ()-(N) that also include the word \u201cadvantage\u201d, or from other content items that are otherwise associated with the user  or the device . After identifying these passages, the device  may output (e.g., display) one or more of these passages. In some instances, when the device  identifies multiple passages from the within the additional content items ()-(N), the device  ranks these multiple passages and outputs a subset of the passages based on the ranking. For instance, if the device  identifies one hundred such passages, the device  may rank and select a single passage or any other number of passages for display.","As illustrated, in this example the device  has outputted a passage that includes the word \u201cadvantage\u201d and that resides in one of the content items ()-(N) accessible to the electronic device , namely \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\u201d. Therefore, as opposed to traditional reference works that may output a static passage that is common for each user that requests information about a particular word, the techniques described herein allow for a passage to be dynamically selected from items that are associated with the user and that are separate from the reference work . Here, for instance, the electronic device  outputs a passage from \u201cHuck Finn\u201d, which the user  has previously obtained and potentially has previously read. By providing a passage from a content item that the particular user of the device  has obtained, the user is more likely to understand and appreciate the displayed passage. In turn, the user is more likely to understand and appreciate the meaning and\/or context of the initially-selected word (here, \u201cadvantage).","As discussed above, the additional content items ()-(N) from which the passages are displayed may comprise an assortment of different sources. The items ()-(N) may include, for instance, books, periodicals, website content, movie quotes or content, posts from social networking sites, blogging sites, microblogging sites, and the like.","In addition, the device may dynamically select passages from some content items that are not stored on the device  or at the service , but that are otherwise associated with the user  or the device. For instance, if the user  often browses to a particular website using the device  (and\/or has marked this website as a \u201cfavorite\u201d), then the device  may identify and pull passages from this website. Or, if the user follows particular users on a social networking, blogging, or micro-blogging service, the device  may identify and pull passages from posts of these users. In yet another example, if the user  has expressed an interest in a particular movie (e.g., by rating the movie, etc.), then the device  may identify and pull movie quotes from this movie. While a few examples have been listed, it is to be appreciated that the device  may identify and dynamically select passages from any type of source that is somehow associated with the user  or the device .","Furthermore, while examples described herein illustrate the device  as selecting these passages, in other embodiments the service  or another entity may perform some or all of this functionality on behalf of the device .","In addition, and also as discussed above, in some instances the device  may identify multiple passages from the items ()-(N) (and\/or from other items) and may rank the items prior to displaying them on the display . This ranking may be based on a similarity between categories or genres of the rendered content item  and each of the additional content items ()-(N), how much time has elapsed since the user  last accessed each of the additional content items ()-(N), how often users have annotated the passages, a rating associated with each of the additional content items ()-(N), and the like. Furthermore, the ranking may be based on information associated with the user (e.g., demographic information), preferences of the user, a reading level of the user , and\/or feedback received from the user  and\/or from other users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["106","106","106"]},"In a very basic configuration, the electronic device  includes one or more processors  and memory . Depending on the configuration of the electronic device , the memory  may be a type of computer storage media and may include volatile and nonvolatile memory. Thus, the memory  may include, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory, or other memory technology, or any other medium which can be used to store media items or applications and data which can be accessed by the electronic device .","The memory  may be used to store any number of functional components that are executable on the processors . In many embodiments, these functional components comprise instructions or programs that are executable by the processors  and that implement operational logic for performing the actions attributed above to the electronic device . In addition, the memory  may store various types of data that are referenced by executable programs. Furthermore, it is noted that while the components described below are illustrated as residing on the device , in some embodiments some or all of these components may reside remote from the device . For instance, some or all of these components may reside on the content item service  and\/or another server that may perform some or all of the operations described herein.","As discussed above, the memory  may store one or more content items (e.g., the content item  and the additional content items ()-(N), illustrated in ), as well as one or more reference works  (e.g., the reference work  illustrated in ). The memory  may also store an operating system , a content presentation application , and a user interface (UI) module . The content presentation application  may function to output content on the device. For instance, the application  may display visual content on a display, audible content on a speaker, and the like.","The UI module , meanwhile, facilitates user operation of the electronic device . For instance, the UI module  may provide menus and other navigational tools to facilitate selection and rendering of content items. The UI module  may further include a browser or other application that facilitates access to sites over a network, such as websites or online merchants, or other sources of electronic content items or other products.","The memory  may further store an example passage module . The example passage module  functions to select one or more example passages to output on the device  in response to the UI module  receiving an indication that that a user of the device  has selected a particular portion of a rendered content item. As illustrated, the example passage module  includes a passage-identification component , a ranking component , and a selection component .","In response to a user of the device selecting a particular portion of content from a content item (e.g., the word \u201cadvantage\u201d), the passage-identification component  identifies other passages from other content items associated with the device or with a user of the device that include this portion. For instance, the component  may identify passages that are located within content items that a user of the device has previously acquired and, hence, content items that are stored on or accessible by the device .","For example, the component  may identify other passages that include the word \u201cadvantage\u201d from content items that a user of the device  has previously obtained. In some instances, these content items are stored in the memory . In other instances, these content items are stored in a remote account associated with the device. In other instances, meanwhile, these items comprise items that the device or the user account previously stored, but do not currently store (e.g., old versions of a periodical that have been removed from storage due to age).","After identifying one or more passages that include the selected word or other portion of the content item, the ranking component  ranks the passages according to one or more criteria. For instance, the component  may rank the passages based on how closely the words within the passages match the initially-selected words. For instance, passages that include the word \u201cadvantage\u201d may be ranked more highly than words that include the word \u201cadvantaged\u201d or \u201cadvantages\u201d.","In another example, the ranking component  may compare a category or genre of the rendered content item with a category or genre of each of the content items that include the identified passages. Here, passages from content items that match (or more closely match) the category\/genre of the rendered content item may be ranked more highly than other passages.","In another example, the ranking component  determines how often a passage has been annotated. Additionally or alternatively, the ranking component  determines how many different unique users have annotated a particular passage. Here, passages that have been annotated often and\/or have been annotated by many different users may be ranked more highly than other passages. In a related manner, the ranking component  may identify which passages a user of the device  has annotated, and may rank these passages higher than the remaining passages.","Also as discussed above, the ranking component  may analyze how recently a particular content item was accessed when ranking the passages. Here, the ranking component  may rank passages from recently-accessed content items more greatly than other passages.","The ranking component  may additionally or alternatively rank passages based on any other criteria. For instance, the component  may identify passages or content types that are preferred by the user and, hence, may rank certain passages more highly based on this information.","In another example, the ranking component  may rank passages based at least in part on a current location of the device . For instance, if a user of the device  selects a word while reading a book in a particular geographic location (e.g., San Francisco, Calif.), the component  may rank passages from content items associated with that location more highly. These passages may include passages written by a local author, passages from within a book about the area, or the like.","While a few examples have been given, it is to be appreciated that the ranking component  may rank these passages based on any other criteria or combination of criteria.","Once the passages have been ranked, the selection component  may select one or more passages to output on the electronic device . For instance, the selection component  may select the \u201cTop X\u201d ranked passages for output, where \u201cX\u201d is any number (user-defined or otherwise). In another instance, the selection component  may output each passage that has a weighted value that is greater than a threshold. As such, the number of outputted passages may vary on a per-selection basis. Without regard to the number of passages selected for output, the component  may output these passages visually, audibly, or in any other manner.","As illustrated, the electronic device  may further include a display  upon which the content items and the selected passages may be rendered. In one implementation, the display  uses electronic paper display technology. In general, an electronic paper display is one that has a high resolution (150 dpi or better) and is bi-stable, meaning that it is capable of holding text or other rendered images even when very little or no power is supplied to the display. The electronic paper display technology may also exhibit high contrast substantially equal to that of print on paper. Some example electronic paper displays that may be used with the implementations described herein include bi-stable LCDs, MEMS, cholesteric, pigmented electrophoretic, and others. One exemplary electronic paper display that may be used is an E Ink-brand display. Touch sensitive technology may be overlaid or integrated with the electronic paper display technology to enable user input via contact or proximity to the screen.","The electronic device  may further be equipped with various input\/output (I\/O) devices . Such devices may include various user interface controls (e.g., buttons, joystick, keyboard, etc.), audio speaker, connection ports, and so forth. In some instances, a user of the electronic device  utilizes one or more of the input devices to select portions of content items rendered on the display . The UI module  may receive indications of these selections and may in turn pass these indications to the example passage module , which operates as discussed immediately above.","Furthermore, the device  may include a network interface , which may support both wired and wireless connection to various networks, such as cellular networks, radio, WiFi networks, short range networks (e.g., Bluetooth), IR, and so forth. The network interface  facilitates receiving electronic books and other content as described herein.","The electronic device  may also include a battery and power control unit . The power control unit operatively controls an amount of power, or electrical energy, consumed by the electronic device . Actively controlling the amount of power consumed by the electronic device may achieve more efficient use of electrical energy stored by the battery.","The electronic device  may have additional features or functionality. For example, the electronic device  may also include additional data storage devices (removable and\/or non-removable) such as, for example, magnetic disks, optical disks, or tape. The additional data storage media may include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 1"],"b":["106","104","102","122","102","104","102"]},"By selecting this portion of the content item (here, the word \u201cadvantage\u201d), the user  may be requesting to view information associated with the word. For instance, the user  may request to view an entry of the word in a reference work, such as a dictionary, a thesaurus, or the like. In some instances, the selection alone is effective to request this information, while in other instances the user  may also select an option from a menu or may otherwise interact with the device  to make this request. In this example, the device  displays the definition  of the word in response to the selection.","In addition, in this example the device  also displays two example passages that include this word. Each of these passages are found within content items that are associated with the user  of the device or with the device  itself, such as the additional content items ()-(N) that the user  has previously acquired. Here, the device displays the passage  from \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\u201d, which the user may have previously downloaded or otherwise consumed on the electronic device  or on another device associated with the user. In addition, the device  displays a passage  from a movie entitled \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d. As illustrated, this passage  also includes the word \u201cadvantage\u201d.","The example movie \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d may be associated with the user  in any number of ways. For instance, the user  may have viewed this movie on the electronic device  or on another device, may have provided a rating or review of the movie on a website, may have posted information about the movie on a social network, blogging, or microblogging site, or may have otherwise indicated an interest in the movie in any other way. Regardless of how these content items are associated with the user  or the device , dynamically selecting and displaying the passages  and  rather than generic dictionary passages that include the word \u201cadvantage\u201d provide an experience that is tailored to the particular user  of the device . By doing so, the user  is more likely to appreciate and understand the passages  and  and, hence, the selected word.","As illustrated, the UI also includes an example icon  entitled \u201cMore\u201d. When the user  selects this icon, the user is able to view additional passages that include the selected word (or other portion of the content item ).
