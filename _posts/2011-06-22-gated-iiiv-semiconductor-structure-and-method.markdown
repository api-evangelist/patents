title: Gated III-V semiconductor structure and method
abstract: A gated III-V semiconductor structure and a method for fabricating the gated III-V semiconductor structure includes a threshold modifying dopant region within a III-V semiconductor barrier layer at the base of an aperture through a passivation layer that otherwise passivates the III-V semiconductor barrier layer. The passivation layer, which may comprise an aluminum-silicon nitride material, has particular bandgap and permittivity properties that provide for enhanced performance of a III-V semiconductor device that derives from the III-V semiconductor structure absent a field plate. The threshold modifying dopant region provides the possibility for forming both an enhancement mode gated III-V semiconductor structure and a depletion mode III-V semiconductor structure on the same substrate. The threshold modifying dopant region when comprising a magnesium (Mg) threshold modifying dopant may be incorporated into the gates III-V semiconductor structure using a dicyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2Mg) vapor diffusion method or a magnesium-silicon nitride (MgSiN) solid state diffusion method.

No. 61\/357,641, filed 23 Jun. 2010, and titled \u201cAlGaN\/GaN Device and Method\u201d the content of which is incorporated herein fully by reference.","This invention was funded under an Office of Naval Research grant number N-00014-03-1-0963. The U.S. Government has rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","Embodiments relate generally to III-V based gated semiconductor structures and gated semiconductor devices. More particularly, embodiments relate to enhanced performance within III-V based gated semiconductor structures and gated semiconductor devices.","2. Description of the Related Art","III-V based semiconductor structures and semiconductor devices often provide superior performance in certain applications in comparison with silicon based semiconductor structures and semiconductor devices. For example, gallium arsenide III-V based semiconductor structures and semiconductor devices are particularly common within microwave applications.","In addition, group III nitride based semiconductor structures and semiconductor devices, and in particular group III nitride transistors, are desirable for high power electrical circuit applications since group III nitride transistors are capable of carrying large currents (i.e., greater than about 1.5 amps\/mm normalized to gate periphery) at high operating electric field strengths (i.e., greater than several megavolts\/cm).","Group III nitride transistors comprise as an active semiconductor material at least one group III elemental nitride. Since the common group III elemental nitrides include aluminum, indium and gallium nitrides, several binary, ternary and quaternary compositions exist for group III nitride transistors.","Commonly, a group III nitride transistor comprises a substrate over which is successively layered at least two group III nitride material layers having different bandgap characteristics. A buffer layer is located closer to the substrate and a barrier layer is located upon the buffer layer and generally has a wider bandgap. Due to the difference in bandgaps a 2 dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is induced at the interface of the buffer layer and the barrier layer. The two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) typically is highly localized near the heterojunction interface, but largely within the buffer layer that has a narrower bandgap.","While III-V semiconductor structures, including group III nitride transistors, provide many performance advantages, III-V semiconductor structures are nonetheless not entirely without problems. In that regard, III-V semiconductor structures, like many other semiconductor structures and related semiconductor devices, are subject to improvement in operating capabilities and performance.","Since III-V semiconductor structures are likely to remain popular within several applications where the enhanced operating characteristics of III-V semiconductor devices that derive from operation of the III-V semiconductor structures are primary considerations, desirable are additional III-V semiconductor structures and methods for fabricating the additional III-V semiconductor structures, with enhanced operating capabilities and performance.","Embodiments include gated III-V semiconductor structures and methods for fabricating the gated III-V semiconductor structures. Each of the foregoing gated III-V semiconductor structures and related methods utilizes: (1) a threshold modifying dopant region included within a barrier layer beneath a gate within a gated III-V semiconductor structure; and (2) an aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer (or other material layer having equivalent bandgap and permittivity physical properties) passivating at least a portion of the barrier layer (and preferably a portion of the barrier layer adjoining the threshold modifying dopant region).","More particularly, the embodiments are directed towards a gated III-V semiconductor structure that includes: (1) a gallium nitride (GaN) buffer layer and aluminum-gallium nitride (AlGaN) barrier layer that includes the threshold modifying dopant region; and (2) an aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer passivating at least the portion of the barrier layer (and preferably a portion of the barrier layer adjoining the threshold modifying dopant region).","Within the context of additional disclosure below, the embodiments also include: (1) a vapor phase diffusion method for forming the threshold modifying dopant region within the barrier layer beneath the gate within the gated III-V semiconductor structure; as well as (2) a solid state diffusion method for forming the threshold modifying dopant region within the barrier layer beneath the gate within the gated III-V semiconductor structure. By including such a threshold modifying dopant region, a gated III-V semiconductor structure, such as but not limited to a group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure, may be fabricated with both enhancement mode semiconductor devices and depletion mode semiconductor devices upon a single monolithic substrate, thus providing a complementary high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structure within and upon the single monolithic substrate.","With respect to the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer that passivates the barrier layer within the gated III-V semiconductor structure preferably adjoining the threshold modifying dopant region, by locating and forming the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer upon at least the portion of the barrier layer within the gated III-V semiconductor structure preferably adjoining the threshold modifying dopant region, improved operating characteristics are realized within a gated III-V semiconductor device that comprises the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer, in comparison with a gated III-V semiconductor structure that includes a silicon nitride (SiN) passivation layer in the alternative of the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer. Notably, such improved operating characteristics allow for avoidance of use of a field plate within a III-V semiconductor structure, such as but not limited to a group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure in accordance with the embodiments.","While not necessarily being bound by any theory of operation of the embodiments, it is believed that the presence of the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer, rather than the silicon nitride (SiN) passivation layer, provides for superior passivation of the III-V semiconductor barrier layer surface due to a higher bandgap and a lower permittivity of aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) in comparison with silicon nitride (SiN).","In that regard,  shows an energy band diagram for an aluminum-silicon nitride (i.e., specifically AlNSiNor generally AlSiN) passivation layer deposited on an aluminum-gallium nitride\/gallium nitride (i.e., AlGaN\/GaN) high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structure (Ga face) in accordance with the embodiments.","To be consistent with experimental observations a fixed volumetric negative charge is introduced (denoted as N) within the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer in addition to a fixed positive interface charge \u03c3. For low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) deposited silicon nitride (SiN) layers, the interface charge is equal and opposite to the polarization charge present on the aluminum-gallium nitride (AlGaN) surface (\u03c3) which effectively eliminates the surface depletion of channel electron charge (\u03c3) for reasonably thick dielectric passivation layers (typically greater than 250 angstroms). For aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layers the fixed positive interface charge is reduced by as much as 50%, and additional negative charge is within the passivation layer, both of which reestablish the surface depletion with the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer located and formed upon the aluminum-gallium nitride (AlGaN) barrier layer surface (as opposed to a silicon nitride (SiN) passivation layer passivated high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structure) thereby reducing the channel charge in regions under the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer.","Using the energy bandgap diagram as illustrated in , and simple quantum mechanics and electrostatics, the equations of  may be used to predict the electron sheet charge present at the aluminum-gallium nitride\/gallium nitride (AlGaN\/GaN) heterojunction with an aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer present.","Within the equations of , \u2208, \u2208, and \u2208are the permittivities of the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer, the gallium nitride (GaN) buffer layer and the aluminum-gallium nitride (AlGaN) barrier layer, respectively. The thickness of the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer, the gallium nitride (GaN) buffer layer, and the aluminum-gallium nitride (AlGaN) barrier layer are given as t, t, and t, respectively. The potential \u03c6B is the surface barrier height, and the potentials \u0394Eand \u0394Eare the conduction band offsets for the gallium nitride\/aluminum-gallium nitride (GaN\/AlGaN) interface and the aluminum-gallium nitride\/aluminum-silicon nitride (AlGaN\/AlSiN) interface respectively.","The aluminum nitride (AlN) molar fraction in the passivation layer determines how much distributed negative charge and fixed positive charge is introduced. Controlling the composition of the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer and its thickness allows for the engineering of the channel charge in ungated portions of the III-V semiconductor structure channel. This in turn allows a semiconductor device designer to significantly reduce the longitudinal electric field strength on both the source side and the drain side of a gate for a given set of bias conditions. The sharp reduction in these electric fields strengths can minimize or eliminate undesirable characteristics of a III-V semiconductor device including non-linear increase in a device source resistance with a drain current, and a DC to RF dispersion which reduces the PAE (i.e., power added efficiency) of the semiconductor device as the drain bias is increased.","For illustrative purposes III-V semiconductor devices that were fabricated with 10 atomic percent aluminum within an aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer had volumetric negative charge densities of roughly 1e18 per cubic centimeter and a positive interface charge density which was 90% as large as the aluminum-gallium nitride (AlGaN) passivation layer polarization surface charge density. As shown in , the measured data for a silicon nitride (SiN) passivation layer is shown as the dark squares and the measured data for the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer is shown as the open circles. The smooth curves (i.e., reference numeral  for the silicon nitride (SiN) passivation layer and reference numeral  for the aluminum-silicon nitride (AlSiN) passivation layer) are produced using equation (1) in , where \u03c3and Nare adjusted to best fit the measured data.","A particular semiconductor structure in accordance with the embodiments includes a barrier layer comprising a first III-V semiconductor material located upon a buffer layer comprising a second III-V semiconductor material different than the first III-V semiconductor material in turn located over a substrate. This particular semiconductor structure also includes a passivation layer comprising an aluminum-silicon nitride material located upon the barrier layer and including an aperture that exposes a threshold modifying dopant region located within the barrier layer.

Rather, in a broad application, the embodiments are understood to provide superior performance characteristics for at least gated III-V semiconductor structures and gated III-V semiconductor devices that result from operation of the gated III-V semiconductor structures insofar as an aluminum-silicon nitride passivation layer (or equivalent passivation layer having appropriate bandgap and permittivity physical properties) in accordance with the embodiments is understood to provide a controlled charge depletion of a two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in ungated portions of a channel, in comparison with a silicon nitride passivation layer which provides no surface depletion of the two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the ungated portions of the channel, and thus results in a full channel charge in the ungated portions of the channel.","It is anticipated that a passivation material operative within the context of the embodiments will have: (1) a bandgap larger than silicon nitride; and (2) a permittivity lower than silicon nitride, within a particular microwave frequency range, to effect the foregoing results.

In particular, alternative methods for forming the threshold modifying dopant region  are also contemplated.

A magnesium threshold modifying dopant region formed in accordance with either of the two methods shifted the gallium nitride\/aluminum gallium nitride (GaN\/AlGaN) semiconductor device threshold in the positive direction by the introduction of about 1e13 magnesium (Mg) acceptors per square centimeter on the surface of the aluminum-gallium nitride (AlGaN) barrier layer.","In the dicyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2Mg) vapor diffusion method, a group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure in accordance with  was heated in a vapor mixture of dicyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2Mg), ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen at a volume flow ratio of about 93.48:36:2338 standard cubic centimeters per minute, and at about 975 degrees centigrade and 2 torr for a time period of about 2 hours. During this vapor mixture exposure time, a magnesium nitride (MgN) residue layer was formed upon the group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure which was presumably molten at the temperature of about 975 degrees centigrade, and the magnesium (Mg) presumably diffused into the group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure along with compensating hydrogen. Prior to cool down of the group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure that newly included the magnesium (Mg) threshold modifying dopant region both the dicyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2Mg) and the ammonia (NH3) vapor sources were extinguished and the group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure was annealed at the temperature of about 975 degrees centigrade briefly in nitrogen gas only.","Subsequently, the magnesium nitride (MgN) residue layer was removed from the annealed group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure using aqueous hydrochloric acid at elevated temperature and the resulting group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure was heated in an rapid thermal annealing (RTA) apparatus in nitrogen (N2) gas at a temperature of about greater than 1000 degrees centigrade under rapid thermal annealing conditions.","In the second solid diffusion method, a composite magnesium-silicon nitride (MgSiN) dopant effusing layer comprising about 3.4 atomic percent magnesium (Mg) was deposited upon a group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure in accordance with  by a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) method. Magnesium source material, silicon source materials nitrogen source materials may be selected from appropriate alkoxides and hydrides. The resulting composite semiconductor structure was annealed at a temperature greater than about 1000 degrees centigrade as a magnesium (Mg) threshold modifying dopant drive in process step.","A pair of secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) elemental profiles for each of the group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structures in accordance with the foregoing two magnesium (Mg) threshold modifying dopant region process sequence incorporation steps is shown in  and . Each of the group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structures included about 30 atomic percent aluminum (Al) in an aluminum-gallium nitride (AlGaN) barrier layer of thickness about 200 angstroms.","Within each of the elemental profile spectra diagrams of  and , the curves from top to bottom at the right hand side of each individual spectra correspond with gallium, nitrogen, aluminum and magnesium atomic concentrations. As is seen in  in comparison with , the dicyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2Mg) vapor source diffusion method (and associated MgN residue layer deposition) introduced significantly more magnesium (Mg) into the group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure than the solid source magnesium-silicon nitride (MgSiN) method that used the higher temperature rapid thermal annealing (RTA) treatment.","Comparisons of sheet electron concentration versus bias voltage (CV) characteristics (measured at 1 kHz) for the foregoing group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structures are shown in . From the sheet electron concentration versus bias voltage plot within , it is seen that the magnesium (Mg) threshold modifying dopant region (right hand curve) shifted the two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) threshold by about 1.25 volts positive while also increasing the two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) sheet charge by about 20 percent.","A volume concentration profile as a function of position graph at the right hand side of  suggests that a magnesium (Mg) diffusion front penetrated by roughly about 35 angstroms within the aluminum-gallium nitride (AlGaN) barrier layer within the group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) fabricated using the dicyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2Mg) and ammonia (NH3) vapor diffusion method.","From the foregoing data, one might estimate a shift in a threshold voltage of a group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure with magnesium (Mg) threshold modifying dopant region incorporation while assuming that the magnesium (Mg) threshold modifying dopant region concentration is uniform (i.e., about 10e20 magnesium (Mg) dopants per cubic centimeter) and distributed over the first thickness (i.e., xd) of about 35 angstroms of an aluminum-gallium nitride (AlGaN) barrier layer of the group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure.","The change in threshold voltage may be determined using the equation of  which yields a reasonable estimate of positive 1.18 V threshold voltage shift in comparison with the positive 1.25 V threshold voltage shift observed in the group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure including the magnesium (Mg) threshold modifying dopant region.","Assuming that the same magnesium (Mg) threshold modifying dopant region diffusion is introduced in a lower charge structure with a gate recess leaving about 75 angstroms of an A10.25Ga0.75N barrier layer within a group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure, a revised estimate in accordance with the equation of  yields a positive threshold voltage shift of about 1.5 volts, adequate for enhancement mode operation of the group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) device that includes the magnesium threshold modifying dopant region incorporation. Furthermore, a resulting pn junction under a gate within the group III nitride high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure may serve to significantly lower a gate leakage current.","Moreover, an additional experiment was undertaken with a recess at a gate location within an aluminum-gallium nitride (AlGaN) barrier layer within a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) semiconductor structure of about 100 angstroms, followed by a brief dicyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2Mg) and ammonia (NH3) diffusion at about 950 degrees centigrade to yield a resulting positive threshold voltage of about 0.1 V. More aggressive dicyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2Mg) and ammonia (NH3) diffusions on such recessed barrier layer structures resulted in removal of the two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) as the magnesium (Mg) threshold modifying dopant region diffusion front penetrated the heterointerface between the aluminum-gallium nitride (AlGaN) barrier layer and the gallium nitride (GaN) buffer layer. Presumably, on thin barrier layer structures within a III-V semiconductor structure a threshold modifying dopant region introduction process may desirably need to be fine tuned to secure a large positive threshold voltage presumably required for enhancement mode III-V semiconductor devices.","All references, including publications, patent applications, and patents cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties to the extent allowed and as if each reference was individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and was set forth in its entirety herein.","The use of the terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d and similar referents in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) is to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.
