Field of the Invention","The invention relates to determining distances. In particular, the invention relates to using one photon of a pair of entangled photons, reflected off an object, to determine a distance to that object.","2. Discussion of Background Information","Mankind has been interested in determining distances to remote objects for centuries. Presently known techniques for determining ranges include RADAR and LIDAR, which rely on detecting emitted electromagnetic radiation.","Photons are quanta of electromagnetic energy. Multiple photons may be entangled or not entangled. Photons that are not entangled together (i.e., random photons) exist as independent entities. In contrast, entangled photons have a connection between their respective properties.","Two photons entangled together are referred to as an entangled-photon pair (also, \u201cbiphotons\u201d). Traditionally, photons comprising an entangled-photon pair are called \u201csignal\u201d and \u201cidler\u201d photons. Measuring properties of one photon of an entangled-photon pair determines results of measurements of corresponding properties of the other photon, even if the two entangled photons are separated by a distance. As understood by those of ordinary skill in the art and by way of non-limiting example, the quantum mechanical state of an entangled-photon pair cannot be factored into a product of two individual quantum states.","In general, more than two photons may be entangled together. More than two photons entangled together are referred to as \u201cmultiply-entangled\u201d photons. Measuring properties of one or more photons in a set of multiply-entangled photons restricts properties of the rest of the photons in the set. As understood by those of ordinary skill in the art and by way of non-limiting example, the quantum mechanical state of a set of n>2 multiply-entangled photons cannot be factored into a product of n separate states. The term \u201centangled photons\u201d refers to both biphotons and multiply-entangled photons.","Photon properties that may be entangled include time, frequency, polarization, and angular momentum. In particular, photons that are entangled in time are referred to as \u201ctemporally-entangled photons.\u201d Such photons are generated nearly simultaneously. For given optical path lengths traveled by constituent photons in a temporally-entangled photon pair, detecting one of the photons places limits on the times at which the other photon may be detected. If the two temporally-entangled photons travel equal optical distances and the first photon is detected at time t, then the second may only be detected within Tof t, where Tis an entangled-photon parameter known as \u201centanglement time.\u201d","Known distance-determination techniques, such as RADAR and LIDAR, generally rely on transmitting certain types of electromagnetic radiation (e.g., relatively narrow band electromagnetic radiation, coherent electromagnetic radiation, pulsed electromagnetic radiation) that reflects off of an object in order to determine its distance from the RADAR or LIDAR unit. However, electromagnetic radiation as used by RADAR and LIDAR is easily detectable. Third party observers are therefore generally able to ascertain the existence and possibly location of operating RADAR and LIDAR systems. Thus, detectability by third parties remains a major drawback of using RADAR and LIDAR systems to measure distances for applications where stealth is desirable.","One aspect of the present invention provides a distance-determining system and method based on entangled photons that is substantially immune to detection by others.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a system for and method of determining a distance to an object is disclosed. The method includes generating a first photon and a second photon, the first photon and the second photon being entangled. The first photon is directed at an object. The first photon is received after being reflected off of the object. The second photon is caused to travel a known distance. The first photon and the second photon are directed to an entangled photon sensitive material. An entangled-photon absorption of the first photon and the second photon is detected by the entangled photon sensitive material. A distance to the object is found based on at least the known distance and the detecting.","Various optional and preferable features of the above embodiment include the following. The second photon may be caused to travel a known distance by using a bank of delays. The first photon and the second photon may be directed to an optical cavity. The first photon and the second photon may be directed to a first cavity or a second cavity. An adjustable delay may be used.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a system for and method of determining a distance to an object is disclosed. The method includes generating a first photon and a second photon simultaneously. The first photon is directed at an object. The first photon is received after being reflected off of the object. At least the second photon is caused to enter an optical cavity. An arrival of the first photon and an arrival of the second photon are detected. The detection is used to determine a distance to the object.","Various optional and preferable features of the above embodiment include the following. The detection may include detecting using electronic photon detectors. The detection may include detecting using an entangled photon sensitive material.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a system for and method of finding a distance to an object is disclosed. The method includes generating a plurality of first photons and a plurality of second photons, each of the plurality of first photons being associated with one of the plurality of second photons. At least a first portion of the first photons is directed to the object. A reflected portion of the first photons is received after being reflected off the object. At least a second portion of the second photons is directed to a cavity. A correlation between at least some photons in the reflected portion and at least some photons in the second portion is detected. The correlation is used to determine the distance to the object.","Various optional and preferable features of the above embodiment include the following. The detecting may include detecting using a coincidence counter. The coincidence counter may detect a temporal correlation between arrival times, at a first detector, of at least some photons in the reflected portion and arrival times, at a second detector, of at least some photons in the second portion. The temporal correlation may include a temporal translation. The detection may include detecting using a biphoton sensitive material. The correlation may include spatial coincidence between the at least some photons in the reflected portion and the at least some photons in the second portion. The distance to the object may be found as a remainder of the distance to the object upon being divided by a length of the cavity. At least a third portion of the second photons may be directed to a second cavity. A second correlation between at least some photons in the reflected portion and at least some photons in the third portion may be detected. The correlation and the second correlation may be used to determine the distance to the object. At least a third portion of the photons in the second portion may be delayed. The method may include spectral filtering. A binary coil bank may be used.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a system for and method of determining a distance to an object modulo a cavity length parameter is disclosed. The method includes generating a first photon and a second photon, the first photon and the second photon being entangled. The first photon is directed at an object. The first photon is received after being reflected off of the object. The second photon is caused to travel a known distance. At least the second photon is caused to enter an optical cavity. An arrival of the first photon and an arrival of the second photon are detected. A distance to the object modulo the cavity length parameter based on at least the known distance and the detection is found. The distance to the object modulo the cavity length parameter is used to determine the distance to the object.","Various optional and preferable features of the above embodiment include the following. The distance may be less than the cavity length parameter. The cavity length parameter may be the optical length of an optical cavity. The cavity length parameter may be a length associated with a plurality of optical cavities. The length associated with a plurality of optical cavities may be an effective cavity length.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a system for and method of processing entangled photons is disclosed. The method includes selecting a wavelength. A cavity is configured to have a cavity length. The cavity has cavity mirror parameters. The cavity length and the selected wavelength have a ratio, which is divisible by \u03c0 after being adjusted for the cavity mirror parameters. A plurality of photons are directed to the cavity. An entangled photon pair is detected, the entangled photon pair including a first photon and a second photon, the first photon having a first frequency and the second photon having a second frequency. The sum of the first frequency and the second frequency corresponds to the selected wavelength.","Other exemplary embodiments and advantages of the present invention may be ascertained by reviewing the present disclosure and the accompanying drawings.","The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the present invention. In this regard, the description taken with the drawings provides a fundamental understanding of the present invention, making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the present invention may be embodied in practice.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","120","125","125","130","125","140","145"]},"Signal photons  are directed to the object whose range is to be determined (the \u201ctarget object\u201d) using optical techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The target object reflects back a portion of signal photons  to entangled-photon range finder . Assuming the target object scatters light in a diffuse manner, the probability pthat a photon scattered from the target object at range z returns to aperture  may be represented as, by way of non-limiting example, p=A\/(4\u03c0z), where A is the area of the aperture. Using optical techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art, returning signal photons are gathered at aperture  and directed to optical cavity .","Idler photons  are directed to coiled polarization-preserving fiber . Fiber  sets the nominal range of the entangled-photon range finder embodiment. That is, fiber  delays idler photons  by an amount of time that corresponds to the estimated mean time it takes signal photons to arrive at, and return from, the target object. Preferably, the second photon of an entangled-photon pair to enter optical cavity  enters while the first photon of the pair to enter remains in optical cavity . Fiber  serves to ensure that signal photons  and idler photons  enter optical cavity  at approximately the same time by delaying entry of the idler photon to correspond with the delay resulting from the signal photon traveling to, and returning from, the target object. (Note, however, that either of reflected signal photons  or delayed idler photons  may be the first to enter optical cavity .) The nominal range of the entangled-photon range-finder is thus determined as the distance that corresponds to one-half of the delay introduced by fiber . From fiber , idler photons  are directed to optical cavity  such that they counter-propagate (i.e., enter at an opposite end of optical cavity ) with respect to signal photons .","Optical cavity  is configured to temporarily trap entering signal photons  and idler photons  by continuously reflecting them back-and-forth inside the cavity. Optical cavity  has high-quality mirrors ,  (e.g., at least 99% reflectance). Preferably, mirrors ,  are concave with foci set to ensure that photons remain inside optical cavity . A photon's probability of remaining inside optical cavity  drops to about 1\/e after it is reflected back and forth inside optical cavity  approximately 1\/(T+T) times, where T, Tare the transmittance of mirrors , , respectively. Thus, a photon's lifetime inside optical cavity  is approximately 2L\/c(T+T), where Lis the length of optical cavity . A typical photon's lifetime in an optical cavity is, by way of non-limiting example, on the order of 10seconds for mirrors with a 1% transmittance.","Optical cavity  contains biphoton sensitive material (\u201cBSM\u201d) . BSM  absorbs entangled-photon pairs with a high probability and allows single photons and random photon pairs to pass through with very low probability of being absorbed. BSM  is therefore essentially transparent to all photons except biphotons. Generally, both photons of an entangled-photon pair must be incident on the same atom or molecule of BSM  within the entanglement time in order to be absorbed. After absorbing an entangled-photon pair, an atom or molecule of BSM  ejects a fluorophoton, which may be detected to indicate an entangled-photon pair absorption. One or more suitable detectors in conjunction with BSM  thus detect a correlation between signal photons  and the idler photons  with which they are entangled. A detailed description of BSM  is found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/850,394, U.S. Publication No. 2005\/0006593 entitled \u201cSystema And Method Of Detecting Entangled Photons\u201d to Kastella et al., filed on May 21, 2004. BSM  may be, by way of non-limiting example, rubidium-87.","Detectors  are configured to detect evidence of entangled-photon pair absorption by BSM  within optical cavity . More particularly, optical cavity  is partitioned along its length Linto M resolution cells each of width \u0394 and each equipped with an individual detector configured to monitor indicia of entangled-photon absorption in that resolution cell. Thus, M\u0394=L. An individual detector  registering an entangled-photon absorption at its associated resolution cell indicates the location at which the signal photon has traveled essentially the same distance as the idler photon. Thus, registering an entangled-photon absorption provides an indication of distance to the target object. Each detector is functionally connected to a computer, which processes detection information as described herein.","The distance to the target object is resolved up to an integer number of cavity lengths L. (i.e., modulo the cavity length) according to the following. A signal photon returning from the target object and its corresponding idler photon will first be present in the same detector region according to, by way of non-limiting example:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["d","o"]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"-","mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]}}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u0394"}],"mo":"+"},{"msub":{"mi":["d","sys"]},"mo":["+","+"],"mrow":[{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["nL","c"]}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["M","j"],"mo":["-","+"],"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]}}},{"mi":"\u0394","mo":"."}],"mo":"\u2062"}]}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["180","110","150","110","110","170","170"],"sub":["o ","sys ","sys","c","o ","o ","o ","0 ","c"]},"When monitoring detectors , two resolution cells are likely to indicate biphoton absorptions.

Once both photons of an entangled pair are injected into optical cavity , they will continue to counter-propagate and be present together in resolution cells j and j\u2032 throughout their lifetimes in optical cavity .","The ambiguity between which detector  detects the true first location j at which the signal and corresponding idler photons are present together and which detector detects its conjugate j\u2032 may be resolved, by way of non-limiting example, as follows. Mechanically or electro-optically adjusting the path length dwill cause j and j\u2032 to change. Techniques for adjusting optical path length are discussed in detail below in reference to . If dis lengthened, j will increase and j\u2032 will decrease. Similarly, if dis shortened, j will decrease and j\u2032 will increase. Thus, by perturbing the path length and monitoring detectors  for the positions of j and j\u2032, the true resolution cell of first coincidence j will be identified. Other techniques for differentiating j and j\u2032 may also be used.","Both photons of an entangled-photon pair preferably enter optical cavity  before the first photon of the pair to enter is either absorbed or exits optical cavity . The depth of field (i.e., the distance about the nominal range in which ranges may be determined) is accordingly a function of the cavity lifetime of the first photon to enter optical cavity . Thus, the photon lifetime inside of optical cavity  is one parameter that affects the ranges that may be measured by an entangled-photon range finder embodiment. A target object that is within the depth of field of the nominal range will generally have its distance accurately determined.

Note that when the biphoton resonance condition is not met, the biphoton probability amplitude becomes very small relative to when the condition is met. If the frequency of the signal photons is changed (e.g., by the Doppler effect due to relative motion between the range finder and target object), the cavity or pump frequency should be adjusted to account for the change. The biphoton resonance condition can then be used to filter for a particular Doppler frequency in systems where relative motion is great enough to affect results. Relative motion between the range finder and target object may be accounted for in other ways, such as by limiting the integration time, or by sweeping an adjustable delay or coincidence delay \u03c4.","The presence of optical cavity  in an entangled photon range finder embodiment (e.g., optical cavity  in the range finder embodiment of ) has several advantages. In order for a BSM to detect a biphoton, both the signal photon and the idler photon should be present together at the same BSM molecule within the entanglement time. Without a cavity, this could be accomplished by delaying the idler photon (e.g., using fiber ) to precisely match the time it takes its corresponding signal photon to propagate to and be reflected from the target object. However, with optical cavity , the delay imposed upon the idler photon need not be exactly equal to the signal photon delay because the signal and idler photons will have the opportunity to encounter each-other numerous times within optical cavity . Optical cavity  serves to fold the optical path that a photon takes back onto itself a large number of times, and the signal and idler photons have an opportunity to encounter each-other with each such fold.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","540","545","510","525","530","525","535","525","530","565","540","545","540","580","590","595","545","595","540","587","585","587","510","510","515","570","540","545","515","510","570","570"]},"Binary coil bank  is used to set the idler photon optical path to about the same length as twice the estimated distance to the target object.

Further detail of binary coil bank  are presented below in reference to .","Adjustable delay  is set to produce maximal biphoton absorptions within the time interval from zero to 2L\/c. Maximal biphoton absorption coincides with each signal photon  entering optical cavity  or being reflected off mirror  within the entanglement time interval of the idler photon  with which it is entangled entering optical cavity  or being reflected off mirror . Maximal biphoton absorption also indicates that the total optical path length traveled by idler photons  equals the total optical path length traveled by signal photons . The time adjustment, \u03c4, from adjustable delay  can be resolved to within a fraction of the entanglement time. The entanglement length (the entanglement time multiplied by the speed of light) is analogous to resolution cell width \u0394 for this arrangement.

That is, to determine a setting of adjustable delay  that maximizes biphoton absorption, it suffices to test values of \u03c4 in the closed interval [0, 2L\/c].

Individual photons resonant with optical cavities constitute the majority of photons that contribute to accidental coincidence counts. Removing such photons may reduce the accidental coincidence rate by an order of magnitude or more while reducing the biphoton coincidence rate by only the fraction of the spectrum removed. To remove the photons resonant with the ranging cavity, both beams are reflected off other cavities of the same length. This arrangement provides the requisite filtering due in part to the fact that, under the biphoton resonance condition (equation (12)) the biphoton amplitude is independent of the frequencies of the photons, yet the individual count rates which contribute to the accidental coincidence count rate are functions of the individual signal and idler frequencies.  depicts such a configuration where four cavities of the same length are used.","Configuring the first pair of optical cavities ,  to have a lower finesse than the second pair of optical cavities ,  helps to reduce the accidental coincidence rate.

In particular, signal photons are sent to be reflected off of the target object. However, the signal photons as used herein are broadband and relatively low-flux. Although the signal and corresponding idler photon frequencies sum to a constant (the pump beam frequency), the frequencies of the individual signal and idler photons are distributed. Moreover, entangled-photon range finding does not require the emission of easily-detectable coherent radiation. Thus, in contrast with RADAR and LIDAR, the techniques disclosed herein may be used to measure distances with minimal threat of detection by other parties.","In embodiments of the present invention, the nominal range is preferably set to be approximately equal to the range to the target object. This may be accomplished by guessing, or by other methods. The nominal range may be set by using prior and\/or real-time information about any, or a combination of, the target object's location, its momentum, its velocity, its physical condition, and its physical properties. Conventional range-finding methods that give a gross approximation of the target object's range may be used to set the nominal range, and the techniques discussed herein may be used to more accurately find the range once the nominal range is set. This alternative is particularly useful if such conventional methods are highly difficult (or impossible, e.g., passive observation) to detect.","For the embodiments described herein, portions of one embodiment may be substituted, replaced, or inserted into other embodiments. That is, the teachings disclosed herein should be viewed collectively, with each embodiment capable of employing technologies drawn from other embodiments. By way of non-limiting example, the following embodiment portions or features may be used in embodiments other than those with respect to which they are explicitly discussed: optical coil bank, electronic coincidence counter, BSM, same-direction intra-cavity photon propagation, different-direction intra-cavity photon propagation, multiple cavities, and synchronized signal and idler photons.","The various calculations and judgments required during operation to determine ranges according to embodiments of the present invention may be accomplished by conventional computer hardware or software. These calculations are preferably performed automatically during the normal course of operation of embodiments of the present invention. By way of non-limiting example, the computations associated with the following equations as used to determine ranges may be performed by standard computer hardware or software: equations (1), (2), (3), (12), (15), and (23)-(31) (including algorithm (27)).","Note that in any of the embodiments described herein, either the signal photons or the idler photons may be sent to the target object. If the idler photons are sent to the target object, the signal photons will be retained at the range finder and delayed using any of the techniques discussed herein. More generally, the terms \u201csignal\u201d and \u201cidler\u201d may be used interchangeably.","Note also that instead of using multiple cavities at once to synthesize a larger effective cavity, the embodiments disclosed herein may use sequential measurements. In such a configuration, the optical lengths of the cavity may be changed between measurements. Alternately, various cavities of different lengths or a bank of cavities may be interchanged for different measurements. Interchanging cavities may be accomplished by way of electro-optical \u00bd-wave plates. Further, an iterative process may be employed where the range finding apparatus uses several different cavity lengths to home in on an object's distance.","By way of elaborating on earlier definitions, entanglement time is a quantity associated with the spread in phase differences between signal and associated idler photons. That is, entanglement time relates to the collection of differences in phase between signal and associated idler photons produced by an entangled-photon source (e.g., a non-linear crystal). Entanglement time may be, by way of non-limiting example, considered as the average time difference between when ordinary and extraordinary rays leave a nonlinear crystal. Ordinary rays leaving a nonlinear crystal are typically associated with signal photons, and extraordinary rays leaving a nonlinear crystal are typically associated with idler photons. By way of non-limiting example, entanglement time is a function of the length l of a non-linear crystal used to produce the entangled photons, and may be described as T=l(n\u2212n)\/2c, where n, nare indices of refraction associated with ordinary and extraordinary crystal directions, respectively. By way of non-limiting example, entanglement times on the order of T=5\u00d710seconds are possible with a crystal length of 5 mm. These parameters yield an entanglement distance (the distance that light can travel during the entanglement time) of 0.15 mm. Much shorter entanglement times (e.g., on the order of microns) are also possible.","Entangled photons may be produced according to a variety of methods. Those of ordinary skill in the art are capable of producing entangled-photon pairs, triples, etc. By way of non-limiting example, entangled photons may be produced according to types I or II parametric downconversion. That is, biphotons whose constituent signal and idler photons are orthogonally polarized may be used as well as biphotons whose constituent signal and idler photons are polarized in parallel. For type-I downconversion, signal photons may be separated from idler photons (and recombined with idler photons) using dichroic glass. For both types of downconversion, signal photons and idler photos may be selected as they exit the biphoton source by providing apertures at the appropriate angles. Any nonlinear crystal, not limited to BBO, may be used. Other ways to produce entangled photons include: excited gasses, materials without inversion symmetry, and generally any properly phase-matched medium. Entangled-photon production consistent with this disclosure is not limited to using BBO or any other particular non-linear crystal. Furthermore, the entangled photons are not limited to any particular wavelength or frequency.","In alternate embodiments of the present invention that employ a BSM, various indicia of entangled-photon absorption by the BSM may be used to detect entangled photons. By way of non-limiting example, entangled-photon absorption may result in fluorescence, phosphorescence, direct electron transfer, or ionization of the absorbing material. Detecting fluorescence, phosphorescence, direct electron transfer, or ionization may be used to detect entangled-photon absorption. Also by way of non-limiting example, avalanche photodiodes, photo multiplier tubes, or other devices may be used to detect the fluorophotons, ionization, direct electron transfer, or other absorption indicia.","In alternate embodiments of the invention, the BSM is not limited to rubidium-87. By way of non-limiting example, any material with appropriately structured energy levels, such as cesium-133 (Cs) or other alkalis may be used. Preferably, such materials are those with a very narrow multi-photon absorption linewidth. More preferably, such materials are those with a very narrow multi-photon transition to an excited state that decays through a path that includes a radiative transition. Further, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any particular entangled-two-photon absorption or random-two-photon absorption electron energy level transition. Pump, signal, and idler photon frequencies and wavelengths may vary from those disclosed herein.","The equations contained in this disclosure are illustrative and representative and are not meant to be limiting. Alternate equations may be used to represent the same phenomena described by any given equation disclosed herein. In particular, the equations disclosed herein may be modified by adding error-correction terms, higher-order terms, or otherwise accounting for inaccuracies, using different names for constants or variables, or using different expressions. Other modifications, substitutions, replacements, or alterations of the equations may be performed.","The particular optical manipulation devices depicted herein are illustrative and representative and are not meant to be limiting. By way of non-limiting example, prisms, apertures, filters, optical fiber, lenses, and particular lasers disclosed herein may be replaced with devices known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","Alternate embodiments of the present invention may delay one photon in various ways. By way of non-limiting example, a length of optical fiber may be inserted into the path of one or both photons. Alternately, sets of mirrors may be used to increase the path length of one or both photons. For electronic coincidence counting embodiments, electronic detection delays (i.e., coincidence delays) may be used. Other techniques for delaying one or more photons may also be used.","Note that this disclosure follows standard physics notational conventions. By way of non-limiting example, in some places Planck's constant h and the speed of light c may both considered to be one (1) for the purpose of calculations. This convention allows, inter alia, for common units for frequency and energy, as well as common units for time and distance (e.g., temporal delays may be considered as spatial lengths and vice versa). This notational convention is accounted for after calculations have been performed in order to deduce correct units for application purposes. This disclosure also uses Dirac bracket notation (e.g.|\u03c8), known to those of ordinary skill in the art, to denote quantum states.","It is noted that the foregoing examples have been provided merely for the purpose of explanation and are in no way to be construed as limiting of the present invention.
