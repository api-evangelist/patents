{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to managing heterogeneous cloud storage systems, and more particularly to defining of business rules and applying the defined rules to heterogeneous cloud (i.e., cloud) data storage systems.","An adoption of cloud computing storage systems has been increasing faster than ever. As the cloud adoption increases, the interest in exploring this resource properly arises as a necessity that claims special attention, specially for data management. To provide a powerful management capacity, it is necessary to pay close attention to fundamental requirements such as security, availability, integrity and backup. Also, it is important to focus on optimizing the use of cloud computing network bandwidth while keeping latency under control, and achieving lower operational costs at the same time. Naturally, these requirements when brought to corporate environments, are dissolved into several business policies that aims to mitigate any risk that could compromise company's data.","A system and a computer program product may be provided for managing heterogeneous cloud data storage systems. There are provided a system and a computer program product for managing heterogeneous cloud data storage systems across heterogeneous cloud computing systems.","A computing system defines, applies and enforces rules that govern a plurality of heterogeneous cloud data storage systems. The computing system receives complete data from a user's computer. The computing system splits the complete data. The computing system stores the split data according to the defined rules into the plurality of heterogeneous cloud data storage systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","130","130","130","130","105","125","105","125","130","155","130","105","125","135","150"]},"When a user wants to store data into a cloud data storage system, the user uses an API (Application Programming Interface) (not shown) or a GUI (Graphical User Interface) (not shown) of the Cloud Volume Management. The Cloud Volume Management stores the user's data according to the defined business rules. For example, an exemplary business rule, defined by a system administrator or like user of the multi-cloud data storage system , may state that any data shall be stored in a cloud data storage system whose resource usage is the lowest, i.e., available data storage space is the largest among the cloud data storage systems -. In one embodiment, the multi-cloud data storage system  may split the user's data and store the split data at one or more different cloud data storage systems whose resource usages are lowest. By running the business rules by the Cloud Volume Management , the multi-cloud data storage system  splits and\/or stores the user's data according to the run business rules.","In another example, the system administrator defines one or more criteria, e.g., in binary code, into the Cloud Volume Management , that are used to choose a cloud data storage system among the plurality of heterogeneous cloud data storage systems. Then, by running the binary code, the multi-cloud data storage system stores the user's data in a corresponding cloud data storage system that satisfies the defined criteria or that satisfies most of the defined criteria. The defined criteria include, but are not limited to: a price of storing in a cloud data storage system, etc.","In one embodiment, the Cloud Volume Management  is a distributed data storage management system that manages a plurality of heterogeneous cloud data storage systems, e.g., by running method steps described in . Each cloud storage system , , ,  or  may be designed and manufactured by a different vendor (or manufacturer). The Cloud Volume Management  is configured to split and store data, e.g., file(s), etc., into the cloud data storage systems A (), B () and N () and is further configured to use the cloud data storage systems C () and D () for backup (i.e., copying and archiving, etc.) the data stored in the cloud storage systems A (), B () and N ().","The multi-cloud data storage system  combines heterogeneous cloud data storage systems and decides how data is going to be stored according to pre-defined rules that are described below in detail. The Cloud Volume Management  provides storage and data management, e.g., of files, etc., as follows:\n\n","The multi-cloud data storage system  provides further benefits to the user(s) as follows:\n\n","Based on these benefits, the Cloud Volume Management  improves usability of the cloud data storage system(s), e.g., via the GUI and\/or API. By further employing a known data mining technique or a known business intelligence technique, the multi-cloud data storage system  increases its performance, its capability, and\/or its reliability and decreases the cost needed to maintain the cloud data storage system(s). For example, the cloud data storage systems in the multi-cloud data storage system  may store similar or equal amount of data, e.g., by (1) determining (via a known data mining technique) available data storage spaces of all the cloud data storage systems, (2) splitting the received data and (3) storing the split data within the cloud data storage system(s) in the way that each cloud data storage system utilizes similar or equal data storage spaces in order to store the split data. The business intelligence technique includes one or more of: a known data analysis technique, a known data mining technique, a known statistical analysis technique, testing, etc.","In one embodiment, the multi-cloud data storage system  encrypts the split data before storing the split data into the cloud data storage system(s). The multi-cloud data storage system  may stores the encrypted split data into each different cloud data storage system according to the defined rules.","In one embodiment, the multi-cloud data storage system  uses different data storage devices across multiple cloud data storage system(s) which are provided by the different vendors and\/or manufactures. Each cloud data storage system includes, but is not limited to: one or more different characteristics\u2014a different manner of accessibility, a different security level, a use of a different encryption algorithm to store the data, a different network to which the each cloud data storage system is connected, etc.","The Cloud Volume Management  stores, in its corresponding local memory device, the defined rules, cloud information (e.g., registration information, profile information, current status information), users definitions (i.e., users' information\u2014users' login identification and corresponding passwords), etc. Exemplary cloud profile information is described below. An exemplary defined rule is also described below. The Cloud Volume Management  communicates with the one or more users , e.g., via the GUI or API.

The Cloud Volume Management  applies the defined rules, by running binary code that encodes the defined rules, to each of the cloud data storage systems. The one or more users may customize the defined rules, e.g., by using a high-level programming language, etc., depending on each user's need. The Cloud Volume Management  may compile the defined rules written by the high-level programming language in order to generate an updated binary code, e.g., by using a compiler.","In one embodiment, the Cloud Volume Management  that runs the method steps shown in  may be implemented as a software application.

The Input Scheduler  sends the each data to a queue according to the determined priority. In another embodiment, the Input Scheduler  splits the received data - into several piece of data, e.g., by using a split( ) function in Java\u00ae programming language that breaks a character or numerical string to multiple substrings. For example, the Input Scheduler  splits a single received file into sperate individual files whose names are different.

The Input Scheduler ensures that incoming data include associated data priority, e.g., in a data field(s) incoming data. Based on the associated data priority, the Input Scheduler  assigns an amount of processing times and\/or resources to corresponding data. For example, the Input Scheduler  assigns more processing times and\/or resources to data with a high priority. The Input Scheduler  assigns less processing time and\/or resources to data with a low priority. Prioritization of each data may ensure that high priority data are processed as soon as possible. The following describes exemplary pseudo code run by the Input Scheduler  to determine a data priority of each data (g2) and further to send the each data to the Output Scheduler  (g3). The running of this exemplary pseudo code (g1-g3) may continue until the Input Scheduler  does not receive any input data (g1).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0061"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"While (hasInputData) {","\/\/ g1"]},{"entry":[{},"checkDataPriority(InputData);","\/\/ g2"]},{"entry":[{},"sendToOutputScheduler(InputData);","\/\/ g3"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Upon receiving the input data from the Input Scheduler , the Output Scheduler  applies the security rules, e.g., an encryption and\/or decryption, etc., on the received input data. In one embodiment, an applied security rule(s) is associated with a data priority of each received input data. The sort of security rule(s), e.g., the sort of encryption algorithm(s), etc., which to be applied may be defined by the security rule(s) which may be specific for each type of data. For example, the Output Scheduler  may apply an encryption algorithm with more bits in a key and more number of blocks, e.g., AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm which runs with 256-bit keys and 64 blocks each of which is 128 bit.","In one embodiment, the Output Scheduler  includes one or more software and\/or hardware modules which may communicate with each other as each node communicates in a tree data structure. For example, a module at leaf node may communicate only with the parent node(s) of that module. A module at a root node may control modules at other nodes (including all the modules other than the module located at the root node), e.g., by sending commands to modules located at intermediary nodes and at leaf nodes and receiving acknowledgement and\/or feedback data from modules located intermediary nodes and\/or leaf nodes. Each module may handle one or more data types with a specific priority, e.g., a high priority. For example, a module that is assigned to high priority data type may run AES or DES or both on data to be stored at corresponding cloud data storage systems. When the Input Scheduler  sends the input data, the Input Scheduler  sends directly or indirectly to a module in the Output Scheduler  which is assigned to process data types with one or specific data priorities. That module may process only data having those data types and\/or having those specific data priorities. When each data arrives at the Output Scheduler , the Output Scheduler identifies data priority of the each data and runs specific module(s) that are assigned to the identified data priority. Those specific module(s) have corresponding security rule(s). Those specific module(s) apply those security rule(s), e.g., particular encryption algorithm(s), etc., over the data sent to those module(s). The security rules include, but are not limited to: cryptography (i.e., data encryption\/decryption), splitting data to store each split data to multiple cloud data storage systems, running of data backup (e.g., implementing of RAID, etc.) and running of data replication (e.g., implementing of RAID, etc.) and implementing of data redundancy (e.g., implementing of RAID, etc.), etc. The following pseudo code (h1-h3) describes that the Output Scheduler  applies (different) security rules to each input data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0064"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"While (InputData) {","\/\/ h1"]},{"entry":[{},"applySecurityLayer(InputData);","\/\/ h2"]},{"entry":[{},". . .","\/\/ h3"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The Output Scheduler  sends the processed data (e.g., encrypted split data, etc.) to one or more destinations, i.e., one or more cloud data storage systems. Based on the defined rule(s), the Output Scheduler  determines where to send the current data. For example, by running an exemplary rule 2, the Cloud Volume Management  configures a cloud data storage system named \u201cmybusiness.storage.id\u201d to store a low priority word document(s) and further to store a high priority spreadsheet(s). By accessing the Cloud Volume Management  and\/or accessing a defined rule(s), the Output Scheduler  may be able to determine a destination of each processed data. Alternatively, each processed data may include a data field, e.g., header field, etc., which indicates a destination of each processed data. By inspecting and\/or examining the header field of the each processed data, the Output Scheduler  determines one or more final or intermediary destination of the each processed data.","Besides splitting and encrypting the input data and sending the encrypted split data to corresponding cloud data storage systems, the Output Scheduler  constantly verifies the status of each cloud data storage system and provides corresponding feedback data to the Cloud Volume Management . In one embodiment, the cloud interface unit  in the Output Scheduler  evaluates current status of each cloud data storage system and sends data that represent the evaluated current status of the each cloud data storage system to the output processing unit  in the Output Scheduler . The output processing unit  sends the data representing the evaluated current status of the each cloud data storage system to the Cloud Volume Management . The Output Scheduler  may dynamically re-assign and\/or update the defined rules in order to optimize (e.g., maximize, etc.) usages of the cloud data storage systems. In order to maximize the usages of the cloud data storage systems, the Output Scheduler  leverages a shortest path algorithm, e.g. Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, A*, Best-first, etc. The leveraging of these shortest path algorithm can determine a shortest path to a cloud data storage system in which corresponding data is to be stored. These shortest distance algorithms may be modified to run a graph whose nodes represent the Cloud Volume Management  and the cloud data storage systems and whose edges represent network communication connection between two or more nodes. An edge in the graph may have two or more weights: (1) a weight representing a network communication latency between two or more nodes; and (2) a weight representing a network communication bandwidth between two or more nodes. By monitoring the network communication latency and the network communication bandwidth associated with each cloud data storage system, the Cloud Volume Management  provides a real-time adaptation capability (e.g., updating the defined rules in real-time based on the feedback data, etc.) to the user(s) and\/or the cloud data storage systems. An example of the updating the defined rules include, but is not limited to: changing a data type that can be stored in a corresponding cloud data storage system. The following describes pseudo code (j1-j3) that may be run by the Output Scheduler . At j1, the Output Scheduler  receives the input data whose header information indicates a corresponding destination cloud data storage system. The Output Scheduler  further evaluates whether the destination cloud data storage system and\/or other cloud data storage system currently operate, e.g., by using sc.exe file in Windows\u00ae operating system which can be used for evaluate a current status of each cloud data storage system and\/or by using Remote Desktop Connection application which enables the Output Scheduler to connect to each cloud data storage system. At j2, upon determining that the destination cloud data storage system currently operates, the Output Scheduler  sends the processed data to the destination cloud data storage system. At j3, the Output Scheduler  continuously or periodically updates status of the destination cloud data storage systems, e.g., by using the sc.exe file or the Remote Desktop Connection application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0067"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},". . .",{}]},{"entry":[{},"checkCloudViability(destinationCloud);","\/\/ j1"]},{"entry":[{},"sendData(InputData);","\/\/ j2"]},{"entry":[{},"updateCloudStatus(destinationCloud);","\/\/ j3"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIGS. 5-11","b":["100","210"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["135","155","100","100","135","155","100","705","100","100","135","155","135","155","710","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["130","205","205","130","130","210","210","210","205","135","155","205","210"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["135","150","205","205","205","400","205","405","205","410","400","405","410","400","405","410"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIGS. 9-11","b":["415","135","400","410","415","415","420","105","110","115"]},"In one embodiment, there is provided a virtual machine (e.g., Java\u00ae virtual machine, etc.) (not shown) in the multi-cloud data storage system .
