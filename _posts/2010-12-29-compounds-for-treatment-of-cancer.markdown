In the United States, cancer accounts for 1 of every 4 deaths. The 5-year relative survival rate for all cancer patients diagnosed in 1996-2003 is 66%, up from 50% in 1975-1977 (& American Cancer Society: Atlanta, Ga. (2008)). This improvement in survival reflects progress in diagnosing at an earlier stage and improvements in treatment. Discovering highly effective anticancer agents with low toxicity is a primary goal of cancer research.","Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments consisting of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin heterodimers and are involved in a wide range of cellular functions, including shape maintenance, vesicle transport, cell motility, and division. Tubulin is the major structural component of the microtubules and a well verified target for a variety of highly successful anti-cancer drugs. Compounds that are able to interfere with microtubule-tubulin equilibrium in cells are effective in the treatment of cancers. Anticancer drugs like taxol and vinblastine that are able to interfere with microtubule-tubulin equilibrium in cells are extensively used in cancer chemotherapy. There are three major classes of antimitotic agents. Microtubule-stabilizing agents, which bind to fully formed microtubules and prevent the depolymerization of tubulin subunits, are represented by taxanes and epothilones. The other two classes of agents are microtubule-destabilizing agents, which bind to tubulin dimers and inhibit their polymerization into microtubules. Vina alkaloids such as vinblastine bind to the vinca site and represent one of these classes. Colchicine and colchicine-site binders interact at a distinct site on tubulin and define the third class of antimitotic agents.","Both the taxanes and vinca alkaloids are widely used to treat human cancers, while no colchicine-site binders are currently approved for cancer chemotherapy yet. However, colchicine binding agents like combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) and ABT-751 (), are now under clinical investigation as potential new chemotherapeutic agents (Luo, Y.; Hradil, V. P.; Frost, D. J.; Rosenberg, S. H.; Gordon, G. B.; Morgan, S. J.; Gagne, G. D.; Cox, B. F.; Tahir, S. K.; Fox, G. B., ABT-751-2009, 20, (6), 483-92; Mauer, A. M.; Cohen, E. E.; Ma, P. C.; Kozloff, M. F.; Schwartzberg, L.; Coates, A. I.; Qian, J.; Hagey, A. E.; Gordon, G. B., \u201c-751 -2008, 3, (6), 631-6; Rustin, G. J.; Shreeves, G.; Nathan, P. D.; Gaya, A.; Ganesan, T. S.; Wang, D.; Boxall, J.; Poupard, L.; Chaplin, D. J.; Stratford, M. R.; Balkissoon, J.; Zweifel, M., \u201c1b trial of CA4(-4 ), 2010, 102, (9), 1355-60.).","Unfortunately, microtubule-interacting anticancer drugs in clinical use share two major problems, resistance and neurotoxicity. A common mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR), namely ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein-mediated drug efflux, limits their efficacy (Green, H.; Rosenberg, P.; Soderkvist, P.; Horvath, G.; Peterson, C., \u201c--2006, 236, (1), 148-54; Wang, Y.; Cabral, F., \u201c-2005, 1744, (2), 245-255; Leslie, E. M.; Deeley, R. G.; Cole, S. P. C., \u201c-12(2) 2005, 204, (3), 216-237).","P-glycoproteins (P-gp, encoded by the MDR1 gene) are important members of the ABC superfamily. P-gp prevents the intracellular accumulation of many cancer drugs by increasing their efflux out of cancer cells, as well as contributing to hepatic, renal, or intestinal clearance pathways. Attempts to co-administer P-gp modulators or inhibitors to increase cellular availability by blocking the actions of P-gp have met with limited success (Gottesman, M. M.; Pastan, I., \u201c-1988, 263, (25), 12163-6; Fisher, G. A.; Sikic, B. I., \u201c1995, 9, (2), 363-82).","The other major problem with taxanes, as with many biologically active natural products, is its lipophilicity and lack of solubility in aqueous systems. This leads to the use of emulsifiers like Cremophor EL and Tween 80 in clinical preparations. A number of biologic effects related to these drug formulation vehicles have been described, including acute hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathies (Hennenfent, K. L.; Govindan, R., \u201c2006, 17, (5), 735-49; ten Tije, A. J.; Verweij, J.; Loos, W. J.; Sparreboom, A., \u201c2003, 42, (7), 665-85).","Compared to compounds binding the paclitaxel- or vinca alkaloid binding site, colchicine-binding agents usually exhibit relatively simple structures. Thus providing a better opportunity for oral bioavailability via structural optimization to improve solubility and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. In addition, many of these drugs appear to circumvent P-gp-mediated MDR. Therefore, these novel colchicine binding site targeted compounds hold great promise as therapeutic agents, particularly since they have improved aqueous solubility and overcome P-gp mediated MDR.","Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed noncutaneous cancers among men in the US and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths with over 180,000 new cases and almost 29,000 deaths expected this year. Patients with advanced prostate cancer undergo androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), typically either by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or by bilateral orchidectomy. Androgen deprivation therapy not only reduces testosterone, but estrogen levels are also lower since estrogen is derived from the aromatization of testosterone, which levels are depleted by ADT. Androgen deprivation therapy-induced estrogen deficiency causes significant side effects which include hot flushes, gynecomastia and mastalgia, bone loss, decreases in bone quality and strength, osteoporosis and life-threatening fractures, adverse lipid changes and higher cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction, and depression and other mood changes. It is believed that many of the estrogen deficiency side effects of ADT are mediated by ER\u03b1.","Leuprolide acetate (Lupron\u00ae) is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH). Leuprolide acetate is an LH-RH superagonist that eventually suppresses LH secretion by the pituitary. Leuprolide acetate acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion, resulting in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. In humans, administration of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in premenopausal females). However, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels (below 50 ng\/dL). In premenopausal females, estrogens are reduced to postmenopausal levels. Testosterone is a known stimulus for cancerous cells of the prostate. Suppressing testosterone secretion or inhibiting the actions of testosterone is thus a necessary component of prostate cancer therapy. Leuprolide acetate can be used for LH suppression, which is the reduction and lowering of serum testosterone to castrate levels to treat prostate cancer.","Malignant melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer, accounting for about 75% of skin cancer deaths. The incidence of melanoma is rising steadily in Western populations. The number of cases has doubled in the past 20 years. Around 160,000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed worldwide each year, and it is more frequent in males and Caucasians. According to a WHO Report, about 48,000 melanoma-related deaths occur worldwide per year.","Currently there is no effective way to treat metastatic melanoma. It is highly resistant to current chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. Metastatic melanoma has a very poor prognosis, with a median survival rate of 6 months and a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. In the past 30 years, dacarbazine (DTIC) is the only FDA-approved drug for metastatic melanoma. However, it provides only less than 5% of complete remission in patients. In recent years, great efforts have been attempted in fighting metastatic melanoma. Neither combinations of DTIC with other chemotherapy drugs (e.g., cisplatin, vinblastine, and carmustine) nor adding interferon-\u03b12b to DTIC have shown a survival advantage over DTIC treatment alone. Most recently, clinical trials with antibodies and vaccines to treat metastatic melanoma also failed to demonstrate satisfactory efficacy.","Melanoma cells have low levels of spontaneous apoptosis in vivo compared with other tumor cell types, and they are relatively resistant to drug-induced apoptosis in vitro. The natural role of melanocytes is to protect inner organs from UV light, a potent DNA damaging agent. Therefore, it is not surprising that melanoma cells may have special DNA damage repair systems and enhanced survival properties. Moreover, recent studies showed that, during melanoma progression, it acquired complex genetic alterations that led to hyperactivation of efflux pumps, detoxification enzymes, and a multifactoral alteration of survival and apoptotic pathways. All these have been proposed to mediate the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype of melanoma. With the rapidly rising incidence of this disease and the high resistance to current therapeutic agents, developing more effective drugs for advanced melanoma and other cancer types that can effectively circumvent MDR will provide significant benefits to cancer patients.","In one embodiment, this invention is directed to a compound represented by the structure of formula

Virtually all cancers have the potential to spread. Whether metastases develop depends on the complex interaction of many tumor cell factors, including the type of cancer, the degree of maturity (differentiation) of the tumor cells, the location and how long the cancer has been present, as well as other incompletely understood factors. Metastases spread in three ways\u2014by local extension from the tumor to the surrounding tissues, through the bloodstream to distant sites or through the lymphatic system to neighboring or distant lymph nodes. Each kind of cancer may have a typical route of spread. The tumor is called by the primary site (ex. breast cancer that has spread to the brain is called metastatic breast cancer to the brain).","In one embodiment \u201cdrug-resistant cancer\u201d refers to cancer cells that acquire resistance to chemotherapy. Cancer cells can acquire resistance to chemotherapy by a range of mechanisms, including the mutation or overexpression of the drug target, inactivation of the drug, or elimination of the drug from the cell. Tumors that recur after an initial response to chemotherapy may be resistant to multiple drugs (they are multidrug resistant). In the conventional view of drug resistance, one or several cells in the tumor population acquire genetic changes that confer drug resistance. Accordingly, the reasons for drug resistance, inter alia, are: a) some of the cells that are not killed by the chemotherapy mutate (change) and become resistant to the drug. Once they multiply, there may be more resistant cells than cells that are sensitive to the chemotherapy; b) Gene amplification. A cancer cell may produce hundreds of copies of a particular gene. This gene triggers an overproduction of protein that renders the anticancer drug ineffective; c) cancer cells may pump the drug out of the cell as fast as it is going in using a molecule called p-glycoprotein; d) cancer cells may stop taking in the drugs because the protein that transports the drug across the cell wall stops working; e) the cancer cells may learn how to repair the DNA breaks caused by some anti-cancer drugs; f) cancer cells may develop a mechanism that inactivates the drug. One major contributor to multidrug resistance is overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This protein is a clinically important transporter protein belonging to the ATP-binding cassette family of cell membrane transporters. It can pump substrates including anticancer drugs out of tumor cells through an ATP-dependent mechanism. Thus, the resistance to anticancer agents used in chemotherapy is the main cause of treatment failure in malignant disorders, provoking tumors to become resistant. Drug resistance is the major cause of cancer chemotherapy failure.","In one embodiment \u201cresistant cancer\u201d refers to drug-resistant cancer as described herein above. In another embodiment \u201cresistant cancer\u201d refers to cancer cells that acquire resistance to any treatment such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or biological therapy.","In one embodiment, this invention is directed to treating, suppressing, reducing the severity, reducing the risk, or inhibiting cancer in a subject, wherein the subject has been previously treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or biological therapy.","In one embodiment \u201cChemotherapy\u201d refers to chemical treatment for cancer such as drugs that kill cancer cells directly. Such drugs are referred as \u201canti-cancer\u201d drugs or \u201cantineoplastics.\u201d Today's therapy uses more than 100 drugs to treat cancer. To cure a specific cancer. Chemotherapy is used to control tumor growth when cure is not possible; to shrink tumors before surgery or radiation therapy; to relieve symptoms (such as pain); and to destroy microscopic cancer cells that may be present after the known tumor is removed by surgery (called adjuvant therapy). Adjuvant therapy is given to prevent a possible cancer reoccurrence.","In one embodiment, \u201cRadiotherapy\u201d refers to high energy x-rays and similar rays (such as electrons) to treat disease. Many people with cancer will have radiotherapy as part of their treatment. This can be given either as external radiotherapy from outside the body using x-rays or from within the body as internal radiotherapy. Radiotherapy works by destroying the cancer cells in the treated area. Although normal cells can also be damaged by the radiotherapy, they can usually repair themselves. Radiotherapy treatment can cure some cancers and can also reduce the chance of a cancer coming back after surgery. It may be used to reduce cancer symptoms.","In one embodiment \u201cBiological therapy\u201d refers to substances that occur naturally in the body to destroy cancer cells. There are several types of treatment including: monoclonal antibodies, cancer growth inhibitors, vaccines and gene therapy. Biological therapy is also known as immunotherapy.","In one embodiment, this invention provides a method of treating a subject suffering from prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, resistant prostate cancer or drug-resistant prostate cancer comprising the step of administering to said subject a compound of this invention, or its isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, tautomer, hydrate, N-oxide, polymorph, crystal or any combination thereof, or a composition comprising the same in an amount effective to treat prostate cancer in the subject.

All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, Pa.), AK Scientific (Mountain View, Calif.), Oakwood Products (West Columbia, S.C.), etc. and were used without further purification. Moisture-sensitive reactions were carried under an argon atmosphere. ABT-751 was prepared according methods reported by Yoshino et al.Routine thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on aluminum backed Uniplates (Analtech, Newark, Del.). Melting points were measured with Fisher-Johns melting point apparatus (uncorrected). H NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AX 300 (Billerica, Mass.) spectrometer or Varian Inova-500 (Vernon Hills, Ill.) spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (ppm) relative to TMS in CDCl. Mass spectral data was collected on a Bruker ESQUIRE electrospray\/ion trap instrument in positive and negative ion modes. Elemental analyses were performed by Atlantic Microlab Inc.","Cell Culture and Cytotoxicity Assay of Prostate Cancer and Melanoma. All cell lines were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA), while cell culture supplies were purchased from Cellgro Mediatech (Herndon, Va., USA). We examined the antiproliferative activity of our anti-tubulin compounds in four human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU 145, PC-3, and PPC-1) and two human melanoma cell lines (A375 and WM-164). Human ovarian cell line OVCAR-8 and its resistant cell line that over-expresses P-gp (NCI\/ADR-RES) were used as MDR models. Both ovarian cell lines were obtained from National Cancer Institutes (NCI). All cell lines were tested and authenticated by either ATCC or NCI. All prostate cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Melanoma cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% antibiotic\/antimycotic mixture (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, Mo., USA) and bovine insulin (5 \u03bc\/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). The cytotoxic potential of the anti-tubulin compounds was evaluated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay after 96 h of treatment.","Aqueous Solubility. The solubility of drugs was determined by Multiscreen Solubility Filter Plate (Millipore Corporate, Billerica, Mass.) coupled with LC-MS\/MS. Briefly, 198 \u03bcL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4) was loaded into 96-well plate, and 2 \u03bcL of 10 mM test compounds (in DMSO) was dispensed and mixed with gentle shaking (200-300 rpm) for 1.5 h at RT (N=3). The plate was centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min, and the filtrate was used to determine its concentration and solubility of test compound by LC-MS\/MS as described below.","Pharmacokinetic Study. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=3 or 4; 254\u00b14 g) were purchased from Harlan Inc. (Indianapolis, Ind.). Rat thoracic jugular vein catheters were purchased from Braintree Scientific Inc. (Braintree, Mass.). On arrival at the animal facility, the animals were acclimated for 3 days in a temperature-controlled room (20-22\u00b0 C.) with a 12-h light\/dark cycle before any treatment. Compound 1h was administered intravenously (i.v.) into the jugular vein catheters at a dose of 2.5 mg\/kg (in DMSO\/PEG300, 2\/8), whereas 5Ha and 5Hc were dosed at 5 mg\/kg (in DMSO\/PEG300, 1\/9). An equal volume of heparinized saline was injected to replace the removed blood, and blood samples (250 \u03bcL) were collected via the jugular vein catheters at 10, 20, 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hr. Compounds 1h, 5Ha and 5Hc were given (p.o.) by oral gavage at 10 mg\/kg (in Tween80\/DMSO\/HO, 2\/1\/7). All blood samples (250 \u03bcL) after oral administration were collected via the jugular vein catheters at 30, 60, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min, 180 min, 210 min, 240 min, and 8, 12, 24 h. Heparinized syringes and vials were prepared prior to blood collection. Plasma samples were prepared by centrifuging the blood samples at 8,000 g for 5 min. All plasma samples were stored immediately at \u221280\u00b0 C. until analyzed.","Analytes were extracted from 100 \u03bcL of plasma with 200 \u03bcL of acetonitrile containing 200 nM the internal standard ((3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)(2-phenyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methanone). The samples were thoroughly mixed, centrifuged, and the organic extract was transferred to autosampler for LC-MS\/MS analysis.

Sample solution (10 \u03bcL) was injected into an Agilent series HPLC system (Agilent 1100 Series Agilent 1100 Chemstation, Agilent Technology Co, Ltd). All analytes were separated on a narrow-bore C18 column (Alltech Alltima HP, 2.1\u00d7100 mm, 3 \u03bcm, Fisher, Fair Lawn, N.J.). Two gradient modes were used. Gradient mode was used to achieve the separation of analytes using mixtures of mobile phase A [ACN\/HO (5%\/95%, v\/v) containing 0.1% formic acid] and mobile phase B [ACN\/HO (95%\/5%, v\/v) containing 0.1% formic acid] at a flow rate of 300 \u03bcL\/min. Mobile phase A was used at 15% from 0 to 1 min followed by a linearly programmed gradient to 100% of mobile phase B within 6 min, 100% of mobile phase B was maintained for 0.5 min before a quick ramp to 15% mobile phase A. Mobile phase A was continued for another 12 min towards the end of analysis.","In Vitro Tubulin Polymerization Assay. Bovine brain tubulin (0.4 mg, >97% pure) (Cytoskeleton, Denver, Colo.) was mixed with 10 \u03bcM of the test compounds and incubated in 100 \u03bcl of general tubulin buffer (80 mM PIPES, 2.0 mM MgCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 1 mM GTP) at pH 6.9. The absorbance of wavelength at 340 nm was monitored every 1 min for 20 min by the SYNERGY 4 Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.).

The first series was targeted to alternatives to the thiazole \u201cB\u201d ring. Accordingly, a series of heterocyclic \u201cB\u201d rings were examined. As shown in Table 1, the successful replacements of the thiazole were pyridine 1c, furan 1d and thiophene 1f. The ICs (12 nM\u02dc35 nM against prostate cancer cells) are close to the thiazole compound 1h. Introducing phenyl (1a), oxazoline (35a), and oxazole (36a) maintained activity in the hundreds of nanomolar range. But introducing of pyrimidine (1b, IC: 3.7\u02dc8.3 \u03bcM), a reversed 2,5-thiazole and 3,5-isoxazole (1e and 1i, IC: >10 \u03bcM) caused obvious losses of potency. Modification of \u201cB\u201d ring to the saturated ring of piperidine (1 g) also totally abolished activity (IC>20 \u03bcM).","SAR of Alternative Linkers. In vitro hepatic metabolic stability studies revealed that the carbonyl linker between \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d rings in SMART compounds caused short half lives (5-17 min) primarily due to carbonyl reduction. For the sake of blocking this ketone reduction to the inactive hydroxyl linker compound 2b, the carbonyl linker in the second series of compounds was modified (Table 2). The carbonyl linker was replaced with double bonds (2a, 3a and 3b), amides (2g, 2h), oximes (2e-cis,trans and 2f-cis,trans), hydrazide (2d-cis, 2d-trans), acrylonitriles (2c-trans, 2c-cis), cyanoimine (2j), sulfonyl amide (4d), sulfur ether (4a), sulfonyl and sulfinyl compounds (4b, 4c). A direct link compound 2i without any linker between \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d rings was also prepared. Among these linker modifications, only cyanoimine linkage (2j) showed promising potential (20\u02dc60 nM) compared with carbonyl compound 1h, but an in vitro metabolism study showed that the half life of 2j in human liver microsome was less than 5 min. It is suggested that although the ketone reduction is blocked, it might introduce a new metabolic liability in compound 2j. The isomer pairs of compounds containing double bonds, oximes and hydrazides were separated. Compound 3a was designed to mimic the structure of CA-4, () which contain a cis-C\u2550C between two aryl rings, unfortunately 3a and other isomer pairs lost activity after replacing the C\u2550O linker. One interesting phenomenon is syn-isomer of 2e-cis (0.1\u02dc0.3 \u03bcM) showed 10 fold more activity than its anti-isomer 2e-trans (>10 \u03bcM). The half life of 2e-cis in human liver microsome is extended to 35 min, while half lives of compounds 2d can be prolonged to 55 min. But decreased activity (\u02dc1 \u03bcM) of 2d also reduced their potency.","The solubility of drugs was determined by Multiscreen Solubility Filter Plate (Millipore Corporate, Billerica, Mass.) coupled with LC-MS\/MS. Briefly, 198 \u03bcL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4) was loaded into 96-well plate, and 2 \u03bcL of 10 mM test compounds (in DMSO) was dispensed and mixed with gentle shaking (200-300 rpm) for 1.5 h at RT (N=3). The plate was centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min, and the filtrate was used to determine its concentration and solubility of test compound by LC-MS\/MS as described below.","Introducing polar and ionizable groups into the anti-tubulin agents. One major limitation of the SMART agents is low aqueous solubility. Surfactants such as Tween 80, were used to study in vivo SMART behavior, accordingly favorable results were obtained. But these surfactants are biologically active and are responsible for many side effects. In addition, it was thought that low aqueous solubility of 1 h resulted in low oral bioavailability (3.3%, Table 4). In the third series of compounds, the aqueous solubility was successfully increased without impacting the potency by introducing polar groups like hydroxyl and indolyls. In addition, ionizable groups like amino and alkylamino groups were also introduced into \u201cA\u201d ring para-position. As shown in FIG. 5 and Table 3, introducing indolyl groups to the \u201cA\u201d ring especially 5-indolyl (66a, 7\u02dc25 nM) increased the potency compared with the 4-OH compound 2l (76-116 nM). Aminomethyl \u2014CHNHat the \u201cA\u201d ring para position also maintained potency (2r, 13-80 nM), but p-NHMe (2s) or p-NMe(2u) abrogated activity. As shown in , analytical measurement to estimate aqueous solubility showed that indolyl compound 66a increased solubility in PBS from 1.1 \u03bcg\/mL (compound 1h) to 3.8 \u03bcg\/mL. Aminomethyl compound 2r was converted to the HCl salt, which increased solubility over 35-fold (>35 \u03bcg\/mL). Although compound 2r showed satisfactory aqueous solubility, the pharmacokinetic studies showed this compound still had very poor bioavailability (F %=0.2%). It was thought that compound 2r was ionized in the stomach, and therefore not absorbed into the circulation system.","Pharmacokinetic Study. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=3 or 4; 254\u00b14g) were purchased from Harlan Inc. (Indianapolis, Ind.). Rat thoracic jugular vein catheters were purchased from Braintree Scientific Inc. (Braintree, Mass.). On arrival at the animal facility, the animals were acclimated for 3 days in a temperature-controlled room (20-22\u00b0 C.) with a 12-h light\/dark cycle before any treatment. Compound 1h was administered intravenously (i.v.) into the jugular vein catheters at a dose of 2.5 mg\/kg (in DMSO\/PEG300, 2\/8), whereas 5Ha and 5Hc were dosed at 5 mg\/kg (in DMSO\/PEG300, 1\/9). An equal volume of heparinized saline was injected to replace the removed blood, and blood samples (250 \u03bcL) were collected via the jugular vein catheters at 10, 20, 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hr. Compounds 1h, 5Ha and 5Hc were given (p.o.) by oral gavage at 10 mg\/kg (in Tween80\/DMSO\/HO, 2\/1\/7). All blood samples (250 \u03bcL) after oral administration were collected via the jugular vein catheters at 30, 60, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min, 180 min, 210 min, 240 min, and 8, 12, 24 h. Heparinized syringes and vials were prepared prior to blood collection. Plasma samples were prepared by centrifuging the blood samples at 8,000 g for 5 min. All plasma samples were stored immediately at \u221280\u00b0 C. until analyzed.","Analytes were extracted from 100 \u03bcL of plasma with 200 \u03bcL of acetonitrile containing 200 nM the internal standard ((3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)(2-phenyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methanone). The samples were thoroughly mixed, centrifuged, and the organic extract was transferred to autosampler for LC-MS\/MS analysis. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, scanning m\/z 356\u2192188 (compound 1h), m\/z 371\u2192203 (compound 5Ha), m\/z 389\u2192221 (compound 5Hc), and m\/z 309\u2192171 (the internal standard), was used to obtain the most sensitive signals.

Many established tubulin targeting anticancer drugs like taxanes and vinblastine require intravenous administration because of low oral bioavailability. Oral bioavailability is a complex parameter involving many chemical and physiological processes, such as solubility, permeability, and metabolic stability. The solubility of these tubulin inhibitors was improved by inserting an amino linker between the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d rings as in 5a-c (), Table 3 demonstrates that the NH bridged compounds (5a-c) had similar potency (35\u02dc65 nM) as 1h with increased solubility (15 and 19 \u03bcg\/mL for 5a and 5c, respectively (), but they are over 20 fold more active than ABT-751 (Table 3 and  for the structure of ABT-751).","Rat pharmacokinetic studies were performed to study whether these new compounds exhibited improved bioavailability compared to compound 1h (Table 4). The data clearly showed that 5Hc (HCl salt of 5c) exhibited more than 4.3-fold increased exposure (AUC) by the oral route as compared to 1h, suggesting that improved aqueous solubility by the amino linker successfully improved oral bioavailability. In addition, the maximal concentration (Cmax) of 5Ha and 5Hc by oral administration was 814 and 1262 ng\/mL, respectively. While Cmax of 1h was only 212 ng\/mL. Overall, the bioavailability of 5Ha and 5Hc was increased from 3.3% of 1h to 11% and 21%, respectively (Table 4). Compound 5Hc exhibited moderate clearance, moderate volume of distribution, and acceptable oral bioavailability. This data suggested that these new synthesized amino linked compounds have the potency and PK profile to be developed as a new class of orally bioavailable antitubulin agents.","In Vitro Tubulin Polymerization Assay. Bovine brain tubulin (0.4 mg, >97% pure) (Cytoskeleton, Denver, Colo.) was mixed with 10 \u03bcM of the test compounds and incubated in 100 \u03bcl of general tubulin buffer (80 mM PIPES, 2.0 mM MgCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 1 mM GTP) at pH 6.9. The absorbance of wavelength at 340 nm was monitored every 1 min for 20 min by the SYNERGY 4 Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.). The spectrophotometer was set at 37\u00b0 C. for tubulin polymerization.","Results:","The inhibition of tubulin polymerization by selected potent compounds 1c, 2j, 66a, and 5a was investigated by all three design strategies (alternative B-rings, novel linkers, and solubilizing moieties) and compared with 1h. Bovine brain tubulin (>97% pure) was incubated with the individual compounds (10 \u03bcM) to test their effect on tubulin polymerization (). After 20 min incubation, tubulin polymerization was inhibited 47% by 1h, as compared to vehicle. Both 1c and 2j inhibited 64% of polymerization at 20 min with different inhibition patterns. Compounds 5a and 66a provided greater inhibitions as 78% and 81%, respectively. These data suggest that these compounds exhibit strong antitubulin polymerization activity that corresponds well with their cytotoxicity.","The P-glycoprotein (P-gp) system appears to be a primary physiological mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR) which acts as an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump, actively removing a variety of structurally diverse cytotoxic compounds. Enhanced efflux of these compounds reduces their intracellular accumulation and so reduces their cytotoxicity. Therefore, novel compounds which are not susceptible to drug resistance could be of high therapeutic and economic value. In addition to P-gp, clinically used antitubulin agents have other resistance mechanisms such as changes in microtubule dynamics and mutations in \u03b2-tubulin which are known to limit sensitivity to the taxanes. The anti-tubulin compounds of the invention were tested against an ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-8 (parent) and P-gp over-expressing NCI\/ADR-RES cell line (Table 5).","Results:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0613","num":"0612"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00012","num":"00012"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Antiproliferative Activity of Selected Compounds against"},{"entry":"P-gp over-expressed MDR cell lines."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"IC(nM)","Resistance"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Compound","OVCAR-8","NCI\/ADR-RES","factor"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u20021c","33 \u00b1 3","\u2002\u200913 \u00b1 0.8","0.4"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20022j","34 \u00b1 2","14 \u00b1 1","0.4"]},{"entry":[{},"66a","10 \u00b1 3","\u20024 \u00b1 2","0.4"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20022r","26 \u00b1 2","11 \u00b1 2","0.4"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20025a","46 \u00b1 6","27","0.6"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20025b","28","21","0.8"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20025c","44 \u00b1 3","25 \u00b1 6","0.6"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20021h","35 \u00b1 2","13 \u00b1 1","0.4"]},{"entry":[{},"paclitaxel*","\u20024.7 \u00b1 0.1","6263 \u00b1 634","1333"]},{"entry":[{},"vinblastine","\u20023.9 \u00b1 0.1","582 \u00b1 57","149"]},{"entry":[{},"colchicine","17 \u00b1 1","1113 \u00b1 79\u2002","65"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Notably, the anti-tubulin compounds of the invention demonstrated equipotent anti-proliferative effects against OVCAR-8 and NCI\/ADR-RES cell lines, suggesting that they are not P-gp substrates and that they function in a P-gp-independent manner. This feature is distinct from that of paclitaxel, vinblastine, and colchicine in NCI\/ADR-RES cells.","A new series of tubulin polymerization inhibitors with acceptable oral bioavailability and equi-potent activity in multidrug resistant tumor cell lines has been discovered. Medicinal chemistry efforts starting from optimizing SMART compound 1h. Chemical modifications of different substituted aryl in \u201cB\u201d ring and linkages between \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d rings were investigated based on biological evaluation against cancer cells in vitro. SAR studies revealed that optimal \u201cB\u201d rings include pyridine (1c), thiophene (1f), and furan (1d) which maintain excellent in vitro potency. Replacing carbonyl linker with cyanoimine (2j) between \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d ring will increase the activity. Structure modifications to increase aqueous solubility and bioavailability were performed. Introducing an amino between \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d rings gave us compounds 5a-c, which showed similar in vitro antiproliferative potency against tested cancer cells as well as MDR(+) and MDR(\u2212) cell lines, furthermore, the solubility and in vivo bioavailability were improved greatly over those of the 1h. Therefore, these new anti-tubulin compounds represent a new family of compounds that may be very useful in the treatment of cancer.","The antiproliferative activity of analogs prepared by the methods

PC-3, DU-145, PPC-1, MES-SA, and MES-SA\/DX5 were originally obtained from ATCC (Rockville, Md.). All cells obtained from ATCC were immediately expanded and frozen down such that all cell lines could be restarted every 2-3 months from a frozen vial of the same batch of cells. For the in vivo xenograft studies, PC-3 was authenticated at Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory (Columbia, Mo.) within four months before studies. Inter-species contamination was tested by PCR and the identity of the cell lines was verified by generating a genetic profile. MES-SA and MES-SA\/DX5 were maintained in McCoy's 5A Medium containing 2 mM L-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All other cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium with 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% FBS.","Growth Inhibition Assay.","The cytotoxic or anti-proliferative activity of test compounds was investigated in several cell lines using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Cultured cells were plated into 96-well plates and incubated with medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds for 96 h. Cells were stained with SRB solution. The optical density was determined at 540 nm on a microplate reader (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, Va.). Plots of percent inhibition of cell growth versus drug concentration were constructed, and the concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50% relative to the untreated control (IC) was determined by nonlinear least squares regression using WinNonlin software (Pharsight Corporation, Cary, N.C.).","Cell Cycle Analysis.","Cell cycle distribution was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining. Treated cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol overnight. Fixed cells were then stained with 20 \u03bcg\/mL of PI in the presence of RNase A (300 \u03bcg\/mL) at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis core services at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Tenn.","In Vitro Metabolism Studies.","For both phase I, the incubation mixture, in 65 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), consisted of 1 mg\/mL liver microsomal proteins, 3 mM NADPH, and 0.5 \u03bcM test compound. The concentration of methanol (used for dissolving the substrate) was 1% (v\/v). Total volume of the incubation was 200 \u03bcL and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. To generate the stability curves for test compounds different incubations were stopped at 10, 20, 30, 60, and 90 minutes for analysis of compounds remaining. All reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 \u03bcL ice-cold acetonitrile. Subsequently, the samples were then centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min and supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS\/MS.","Pharmacokinetic Studies in Mice.","Male ICR mice (5-6 weeks, 20-25 g) were used. For 6a, 6b, and 6c, a dose, 5 mg\/kg, was administered via the i.v., i.p., and p.o. route. I.v. doses were administered via the tail vein. Oral doses were administered by gavage. At each time point, three to four mice were euthanized by isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Ill.) and blood samples (up to 600 \u03bcL each) were taken from the posterior vena cava. Plasma samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. prior to analysis. Plasma proteins were precipitated by the addition of acetonitrile (150 \u03bcL, containing the internal standard) to 100 \u03bcL of mouse plasma. Samples were vortexed and then centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean vial for injection into the mass spectrometer for analysis.","In Vivo Antitumor Efficacy Study.","PC-3 cells (2.5\u00d710cells\/site) plus Matrigel (BD biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) were injected subcutaneously into flanks of male nu\/nu mice. Tumor size was measured using calipers every 2-4 days and calculated as V=\u03c0\/6\u00d7(length)\u00d7(width)13]. When tumors reached a volume of approximately 100\u02dc150 mm, drug treatment was initiated. The control group was treated with vehicle (20% Captex200 in Tween80). During the treatment, tumor size and body weights were measured every 2-4 days.","White Blood Cell Counting.","Whole blood was obtained from nude mice at the end of efficacy study. To count white blood cells (WBC) using a hemacytometer, 10 \u03bcL of whole blood sample was diluted with the 190 \u03bcL of 2% acetic acid. With proper light adjustment, the leukocytes appeared as dark dots on the hemacytometer. WBC in each sample was counted twice within one hours following dilution and average was calculated.","Results","7.

All these cell lines were purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va.) except the PPC-1 cell line. MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-435\/LCCMDR1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Clarke at Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, D.C. Melanoma cells were cultured in DMEM (Cellgro Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, Va.) and prostate cancer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, Va.) supplemented with 10% FBS (Cellgro Mediatech). Cultures were maintained at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO. 1000 to 5000 cells were plated into each well of 96-well plates depending on growth rate and exposed to different concentrations of a test compound for 48 h (fast growing melanoma cells) or 96 h (slow growing prostate cancer cells) in three to five replicates. Cell numbers at the end of the drug treatment were measured by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Briefly, the cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid and stained with 0.4% SRB, and the absorbances at 540 nm were measured using a plate reader (DYNEX Technologies, Chantilly, Va.). Percentages of cell survival versus drug concentrations were plotted, and the IC(concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50% of untreated control) values were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.).","Results","The results of the in vitro antiproliferative activities of the compounds of this invention using three melanoma cell lines (one murine melanoma cell line, B16-F1, and two human metastatic melanoma cell lines, A375 and WM-164) and four human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, Du 145, and PPC-1) are summarized in Tables 11-13.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0633","num":"0632"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00019","num":"00019"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"343pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 11"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"In vitro growth inhibitory effects of compounds without A ring substitutions."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"196pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},{},{},"IC(nM)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Structure","ID","R","A375","B16-F1","WM164","LNCaP","PC-3","Du 145","PPC-1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00319","num":"00319"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00319","he":"50.97mm","wi":"16.68mm","file":"US09334242-20160510-C00319.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"12aa 12ab 12ac 12ad 12ae 12af 12ag 12ah 12ai","3,4,5-(OME) 4-OMe 3-OMe 3,5-(OMe) 3,4-(OMe) 4-F 3-F 4-Me 3-Me","160 >10000 >10000 2800 >10000 580 >10000 >10000 >10000","120 >10000 >10000 5400 >10000 930 >10000 >10000 >10000","10 >10000 >10000 2100 >10000 630 >10000 >10000 >10000","152 >10000 >10000 3611 >10000 613 >10000 >10000 >10000","288 >10000 >10000 3274 >10000 2197 >10000 >10000 >10000","196 >10000 >10000 2590 >10000 846 >10000 >10000 >10000","133 >10000 >10000 2129 >10000 575 >10000 >10000 >10000"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00320","num":"00320"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00320","he":"36.49mm","wi":"25.91mm","file":"US09334242-20160510-C00320.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"12aba 12aaa","4-OMe 3,4,5-(OMe)",">10000 >10000",">10000 >10000",">10000 >10000",">10000 >10000",">10000 >10000",">10000 >10000",">10000 >10000"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00321","num":"00321"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00321","he":"32.77mm","wi":"27.01mm","file":"US09334242-20160510-C00321.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"10a 10x 10j","H 4-NO 4-OBn",">10000 >10000 >10000",">10000 >10000 >10000",">10000 >10000 >10000",">10000 >10000 >10000",">10000 >10000 >10000",">10000 >10000 >10000",">10000 >10000 >10000"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"From Table 11, compounds 12aa-12ai showed moderate activity with ICvalues in the \u03bcM range (average of all seven cell lines). The most potent compound of this series was 12aa with an average ICvalue of 160 nM. The removal of one of the methoxy groups from the 3,4,5-trimethoxy on the C ring (12ad, 12ae) led to a significant loss of activity (IC>10 \u03bcM for 12ae and an average ICof 3.1 \u03bcM for 12ad). Compound with 4-fluoro on the C ring (12af) also showed relatively good activity (IC=0.91 \u03bcM), a finding that has an important implication, because replacing the trimethoxy moiety with a 4-fluoro group may provide good activity and improved metabolic stability. The position of the fluorine on the C ring was critical for activity because a shift from 4-fluoro to 3-fluoro resulted in a total loss of activity (IC>10 \u03bcM for 12ag compared with 0.91 \u03bcM for 12af). This result suggested that a potential hydrogen bond donor is present close to the 4-position of this ring.","As clearly indicated in Table 11, the positions of the A and C rings were critical. A simple shift of the C-ring moiety from position 4 to position 1 in the imidazole ring (B ring) resulted in total loss of activity (IC>10 \u03bcM for 12aba, 12aaa, 10a, 10x,

substitutions on the C ring showed good activity with different substitutions on the A ring. These compounds demonstrated excellent antiproliferative activity with ICvalues as low as 8.0 nM on WM164 cell line (12da). In general, compounds incorporating a single substituent on the para-position of the A ring were more potent as can be seen from the activities of 12ca, 12cb, 12da, 12 db, 12fa, 12fb, 12ga, and 12gb (IC=7.9-110 nM). 12 db-HCl salt (IC=172 nM) showed slightly diminished activity compared with the corresponding free base 12 db (IC=109 nM). Compound 12fb (IC=63.7 nM), with a single halogen substituent in the para-position of the A and C rings, demonstrated potent and was devoid of a methoxy moiety. Compounds with 3,4,5-trimethoxy substituents on the A ring lost activity completely (IC>10 \u03bcM for 12ea, 12eb), suggesting very different binding environments near the A ring and C ring. Removal of the 5-methoxy substituent from the A-ring improved activity significantly (IC=330 nM and >10 \u03bcM for 12ha, 12ea respectively). Demethylation of the 3,4,5-trimethoxy decreased activity sharply from 43 nM (12fa) to 3.89 \u03bcM (13fa). Similar results were observed for 13ea, 12ka, 12 kb, and 13ha due to the demethylation of substituents on either the A or C ring. Electron-donating groups (4-methoxy, 4-dimethylamino, 4-methyl) and electron-withdrawing groups (4-chloro, 2-trifluoromethyl) on the A ring did not show substantial differences in activity. The introduction of a trifluoromethyl group at the ortho position of the A ring caused complete loss of activity (IC>10 \u03bcM for 12ia, 12ib). The presence of a benzoyloxy group at the para position of A ring (IC=75 nM for 12jb) resulted in a 440-fold increase in activity when compared with the para-hydroxy compound 12 kb (IC=33 \u03bcM). It is worthwhile to note that compound 12jb, with the 4-fluoro in the C ring, has better activity than does its counterpart 12ja, which has a 3,4,5-trimethoxy group in the C ring (ICis 75 nM for 12jb, and 7.3 \u03bcM for 12ja).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0638","num":"0637"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00021","num":"00021"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"441pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

the imidazole ring (11cb, 11 db, 11fb, 11ga, 11gb, 11ha, 11jb) were also very active with ICin the nM range (Table 13). Generally the activities of these compounds are comparable to their corresponding unprotected counterparts as exemplified by comparing the activities of 11cb (43 nM), 11 db (111 nM), 11fb (72 nM), 11ga (285 nM), 11gb (87 nM), 11ha (268 nM), and 11jb (61 nM) with their corresponding unprotected counterparts 12cb (36 nM), 12 db (109 nM), 12fb (64 nM), 12ga (131 nM), 12gb (72 nM), 12ha (330 nM), and 12jb (75 nM). Other compounds (11ab-11ag, 11ea, 11eb, 11hb, 11ia, and 111b, 1-50 \u03bcM) were generally much less active, also in line with their counterparts (12ab-12ag, 12ea, 12eb, 12hb, 12ia, and 12ib, 1-50 \u03bcM).","P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated drug efflux represents a major mechanism for cancer cells to prevent the build up of effective anticancer intracellular drug concentrations. The activity of the ABI compounds were compared against multidrug-resistant (MDR) melanoma cells (MDA-MB-435\/LCCMDR1) and their parental nonresistant cancer cells (MDA-MB-435). Although MDA-MB-435 was originally designated as a breast cancer cell line, it has been shown definitively to originate from the M14 melanoma cell line. Compounds 12da, 12fb, 12cb, 11cb, and 11fb together with other tubulin-targeting agents including colchicine, paclitaxel, and vinblastine were tested on both the MDR melanoma cell line and its parental melanoma cell line (Table 14). Paclitaxel and vinblastine are clinically used anticancer drugs known to target cell tubulin. Although colchicine is not an FDA-approved drug for cancer treatment, its prodrug, ZD6126, is in clinical trial for solid tumors. Bortezomib is the first therapeutic proteasome inhibitor and was approved in 2003 by the FDA for use in multiple myeloma. ABT-751 is known to target the tubulin colchicine binding site. It is a promising drug candidate in clinical trial for children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. Compounds 12da, 12fb, 12cb, 11cb, 11fb had much better resistance indices (3.0 for 12da, 0.9 for 12fb, 1.3 for 12cb, 0.8 for 11cb, 0.7 for 11fb) than colchicine (65.8), paclitaxel (69.3), and vinblastine (27.5). Although colchicine, paclitaxel, and vinblastine showed excellent activity in nonresistant melanoma cell lines (0.5-10 nM), these compounds were significantly less potent in the MDR melanoma cell line (277-658 nM). In contrast, 12cb, 11cb, 11M had essentially equivalent potency on both MDR (15 nM, 38 nM, 30 nM, 30 nM, 35 nM for 12da, 12fb, 12cb, 11cb and 11M respectively) and nonresistant melanoma cell lines (5 nM, 41 nM, 24 nM, 38 nM, 50 nM for 12da, 12M, 12cb, 11cb and 11M respectively).

But the ABIs of this invention showed equal potency to the drug-resistant cell line and the sensitive parent cell line. This result strongly suggests that ABIs are not substrates for P-gp. Thus, they overcame the multidrug resistance found in MDA-MB-435\/LCCMDR1 cells. The dose response curves are shown in  for 12M, 12da, and 12cb.","Materials and Methods","Bovine brain tubulin (0.4 mg) (Cytoskeleton, Denver, Colo.) was mixed with 10 \u03bcM of the test compound and incubated in 110 \u03bcl of general tubulin buffer (80 mM PIPES, 2.0 mM MgCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 1 mM GTP) at pH 6.9. The absorbance at 340 nm was monitored every 1 min for 15 min by the SYNERGY 4 Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.). The spectrophotometer was set at 37\u00b0 C. for tubulin polymerization.","Results","The inhibition of tublin polymerization by Aryl-Benzoyl-Imidazole (ABI) compounds was examined. Bovine brain tubulin (>97% pure) was incubated with three potent ABI compounds, 12cb, 12da, and 12 db at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM, to determine the effect of these ABI compounds on tubulin polymerization (). Tubulin polymerization was completely inhibited by compound 12da, while \u02dc80% inhibition was observed during incubation with compounds 12cb and 12 db.","This microtubule destabilization effect was similar to that of colchicine and vinblastine but was opposite to that of paclitaxel. The results not only confirmed that ABIs can directly interact with tubulin but also suggested that they may share the same binding site with colchicine (or vinblastine).","Materials and Methods","B16-F1 melanoma cells were plated at a colony-forming density (2000 cells per well on six-well plates) on top of 0.8% base agar. Cells were grown in 0.4% agar together with DMEM medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and an antibiotic-antimycotic solution at 37\u00b0 C. in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO. Cells were treated with compounds 12da, 12cb and 12fb at different concentrations (20, 100, and 500 nM). Compounds were added to the media from 1-mM DMSO stock solutions, and a corresponding dilution of DMSO was used as control. Cells were grown for 14 days. Plates were photographed, and the number of colonies was measured by Artek 880 Automated Colony Counter (Artek Systems Corporation, Farmingdale, N.Y.).","Results","Four representative photos are shown in . After 14 days of incubation, about 130 detectable colonies (diameter larger than 100 \u03bcm) were formed in controls (no treatment).","Compounds 12cb and 12da effectively inhibited B16-F1 melanoma colony formation even at the lowest tested concentration, 20 nM (p<0.05 compared with control). 12fb showed effective inhibition at 100 nM. All three tested compounds showed complete inhibition of colony formation at 0.5 \u03bcM, further proving ABIs' antimelanoma efficacy.","Materials and Methods","Animals: Female C57\/BL mice, age 4-6 weeks, were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis, Ind.). The animal housing met the Association for Assessment and Accreditation and Laboratory Animal Care specifications. All of the procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines of our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.","In vivo evaluation of efficacy. Mouse melanoma B16-F1 cells were prepared in FBS-free DMEM medium (Cellgro Mediatech) at a concentration of 5\u00d710viable cells\/mL. The cell suspension (100 \u03bcL) was injected subcutaneously in the right dorsal flank of each mouse. When tumor size reached about 100-150 mm, about 7 days after cell inoculation, all mice bearing tumors were divided into control and treatment groups based on tumor size (n=5 per group). Each group had similar average tumor size. Mice in control groups (negative control) were injected intraperitoneally with 50 \u03bcL vehicle solution only or DTIC at 60 mg\/kg (positive control) once daily. Tumor volume was measured every 2 days with a traceable electronic digital caliper (Fisher Scientific, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa.) and calculated using the formula a\u00d7b\u00d70.5, where a and b represented the larger and smaller diameters, respectively. Tumor volume was expressed in cubic millimeters. Data were expressed as mean\u00b1SE for each group and plotted as a function of time. Percentage tumor reduction at the conclusion of the experiment (14 days after starting treatment) was calculated with the formula 100\u2212100\u00d7[(T\u2212T)\/(C\u2212C)], where T represents mean tumor volume of a treated group on a specific day, Trepresents mean tumor volume of the same group on the first day of treatment, C represents mean tumor volume of a control on a specific day, and Crepresents mean tumor volume of the same group on the first day of treatment. Animal activity and average body weight of each group were monitored during the entire experiment period to assess compound toxicity. At the end of treatment, all mice were euthanized by COfollowed by cervical dislocation, and tumors were harvested for further studies.","Results","To evaluate efficacy of ABI analogs in vivo, we tested the antitumor activity of compound 12cb on mice melanoma B16-F1 xenograph. against DTIC, the gold standard in malignant melanoma treatment, was used as a positive control (). Twenty female C57\/BL mice were divided into four groups: a vehicle control group, a DTIC (60 mg\/kg) treatment group, a 12cb (10 mg\/kg) treatment group, and a 12cb (30 mg\/kg) treatment group. Each mouse was injected with 0.5 million B16-F1 melanoma cells subcutaneously. Seven days after tumor inoculation, treatment started with each compound injected intraperitoneally daily (). Tumor volume was significantly (p<0.05) reduced 47%, 51%, and 73% for 12cb (10 mg\/kg), DTIC (60 mg\/kg), and 12cb (30 mg\/kg), respectively, after 14 days of treatment. No significant weight loss was observed in any of the treatment groups during the experiment.","Two dose levels, 15 and 45 mg\/kg, were chosen. DTIC at 60 mg\/kg was used as a positive control. B16-F1 melanoma allograft model on C57BL\/6 mice was first chosen for study. After 13 days of treatment. (), compound 12fb inhibited melanoma tumor growth (TGI value) by 32% at 15 mg\/kg and 82% at 45 mg\/kg. Student's t test p value of 12fb at 45 mg\/kg compared with control was less than 0.001, indicating a significant difference. The t test p value of 12fb at 15 mg\/kg compared with control was 0.08, suggesting that this dose was not effective. Comparing 12fb at 45 mg\/kg with DTIC at 60 mg\/kg, which had a TGI of 51%, the t test p value was about 0.001, suggesting that 12fb had substantially better activity than did DTIC. For the control and 12fb 15 mg\/kg treatment groups, average body weight increased slightly throughout the experiment period.","To further confirm ABIs' in vivo activity, A375 human melanoma xenograft model on SHO mice was used, and 12fb at 25 mg\/kg was tested. DTIC at 60 mg\/kg was used as a positive control again. After 31 days of treatment (), 12fb inhibited melanoma tumor growth (TGI value) by 69%, whereas DTIC inhibited growth by 52%. The t test p value of 12fb treatment versus control was less than 0.001, suggesting that 12fb significantly inhibited melanoma tumor growth at 25 mg\/kg. The t test p value of 12fb treatment versus DTIC was less than 0.05, suggesting again that 12fb had better activity than did DTIC. Average body weight of all groups increased slightly throughout the experiment period. Physical activities for the mice also looked normal, suggesting that 25 mg\/kg was a well tolerated dose for SHO mice.","Materials and Methods","Each test compound was prepared at 20\u00d7 concentration in G-PEM buffer (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, Colo.) followed by pipetting 10 \u03bcL of test compound into the 96-well plates. Ten microliters of tritiated labeled colchicine (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, Mass.) was added to each testing well. Subsequently, 180 \u03bcL bead\/tubulin (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, N.J.) suspension was added into each well. The plate was incubated for 45 min at 37\u00b0 C. before it was read by a Topcount NXT plate reader (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, Mass.). Nonradiolabeled \u201ccold\u201d colchicine was included as a positive control and paclitaxel as a negative control because paclitaxel binds to a different site in tubulin and does not compete for the colchicine site binding. Data were processed using GraphPad Prism software.","Cell Cycle Analysis","Flow cytometry analysis was performed to study cell cycle phase distribution. A375 cells were cultured in 10-cm tissue culture dishes until the confluence was about 80%, and then cells were treated with 0, 10, 50, 200, and 1000 nM of colchicine, 12da, 12fb and 12cb, for 24 h in growth media. Cellular DNA was stained with PBS containing 50 \u03bcg\/mL propidium iodide and 100 \u03bcg\/mL RNase A. The cell cycle was determined using a BD LSR-II cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) with 10,000 cells scored. Data were analyzed and graphs were prepared using the Modfit 2.0 program (Verity Software House, Topsham, Me.).","Results","Three ligand binding sites in tubulin \u03b1\/\u03b2-heterodimer have been reported: paclitaxel binding site, vinblastine binding site, and colchicine binding site. The binding affinity of compound 12cb using H-labeled colchicine and a competitive binding scintillation proximity assay (SPA) was measured. The results confirmed the strong binding of 12cb with a binding affinity of 3.4\u00b11.5 \u03bcM (). Colchicine bound tubulin with an ICvalue of 1.8\u00b10.5 \u03bcM under these conditions. These results clearly indicated that ABI compounds effectively inhibit tubulin polymerization.","The binding graph () clearly shows that ABIs can competitively bind to the tubulin colchicine binding site. As the concentration of the three tested compounds increased from 0.03 M to 100 \u03bcM, increased tritiated colchicine was competitively stripped away from tubulin, and emitted lower SPA counts. The negative control, paclitaxel, gave only a flat line, because theoretically it should not bind to the colchicine binding site on tubulin. Second, ABIs have relatively high binding affinity to the tubulin colchicine binding site. GraphPad Prism calculated ICvalues for binding showed that 12da has the highest binding affinity. The binding affinity was positively correlated to in vitro antimelanoma activity; the higher the binding affinity, the higher the antimelanoma activity.","ABIs demonstrated that they arrest cells by cell cycle analysis in the G2\/M phase as indication that they target tubulin. Compounds 12da, 12fb and 12cb were tested together with colchicine as a positive control on A375 cells (). Four different concentrations\u201410, 50, 200, and 1000 nM\u2014of each compound were chosen to show the dose effect (). For controls (no treatment) without interference, about 16% of A375 cells were distributed in the G2\/M phase. For the colchicine treatment group, as concentration increased from 10 nM to 50 nM, the percentage of cells distributed in the G2\/M phase increased from 14% to 85%. ABIs had similar results for A375 cells, in arresting them in the G2\/M phase in a dose-dependent manner. The potency of the different concentrations in arresting cells in the G2\/M phase positively correlated with in vitro activity.","Materials and Methods","Cell culture and cytotoxicity assay of prostate cancer. All prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145, PPC-1) were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA). Human PC-3_T\u00d7R, was resistant to paclitaxel and used a MDR model compared with PC-3. Cell culture supplies were purchased from Cellgro Mediatech (Herndon, Va., USA). All cell lines were used to test the antiproliferative activity of compounds 17ya, 12fa, and 55 by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. All cancer cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 media with 2 mM glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).","In vitro microtubule polymerization assay. Porcine brain tubulin (0.4 mg) (Cytoskeleton, Denver, Colo.) was mixed with 1 and 5 \u03bcM of the test compound or vehicle (DMSO) and incubated in 100 \u03bcl of buffer (80 mM PIPES, 2.0 mM MgCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 6.9 and 1 mM GTP). The absorbance at 340 nm wavelength was monitored every min for 15 min (SYNERGY 4 Microplate Reader, Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.).

The total DMSO concentration in the reaction solution was approximately 0.5% (v\/v). Aliquots (100 \u03bcL) from the reaction mixtures used to determine metabolic stability were sampled at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 90 min. Acetonitrile (150 \u03bcL) containing 200 nM of the internal standard was added to quench the reaction and to precipitate the proteins. Samples were then centrifuged at 4,000 g for 30 min at RT, and the supernatant was analyzed directly by LC-MS\/MS.","Analytical method. Sample solution (10 \u03bcL) was injected into an Agilent series HPLC system (Agilent 1100 Series Agilent 1100 Chemstation, Agilent Technology Co, Ltd). All analytes were separated on a narrow-bore C18 column (Alltech Alltima HP, 2.1\u00d7100 mm, 3 \u03bcm, Fisher, Fair Lawn, N.J.). Two gradient modes were used. For metabolic stability studies, gradient mode was used to achieve the separation of analytes using mixtures of mobile phase A [ACN\/HO (5%\/95%, v\/v) containing 0.1% formic acid] and mobile phase B [ACN\/HO (95%\/5%, v\/v) containing 0.1% formic acid] at a flow rate of 300 \u03bcL\/min. Mobile phase A was used at 10% from 0 to 1 min followed by a linearly programmed gradient to 100% of mobile phase B within 4 min, 100% of mobile phase B was maintained for 0.5 min before a quick ramp to 10% mobile phase A. Mobile phase A was continued for another 10 min towards the end of analysis.","A triple-quadruple mass spectrometer, API Qtrap 4000\u2122 (Applied Biosystems\/MDS SCIEX, Concord, Ontario, Canada), operating with a TurboIonSpray source was used. The spraying needle voltage was set at 5 kV for positive mode. Curtain gas was set at 10; Gas 1 and gas 2 were set 50.

Heparinized syringes and vials were prepared prior to blood collection. Plasma samples were prepared by centrifuging the blood samples at 8,000 g for 5 min. All plasma samples were stored immediately at \u221280\u00b0 C. until analyzed.","Analytes were extracted from 100 \u03bcL of plasma with 200 \u03bcL of acetonitrile containing 200 nM the internal standard. The samples were thoroughly mixed, centrifuged, and the organic extract was transferred to autosampler for LC-MS\/MS analysis.","PC-3_T\u00d7R xenograft studies. PC-3_T\u00d7R cells (10\u00d710per mL) were prepared in RPMI1640 growth media containing 10% FBS, and mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) at 1:1 ratio. Tumors were established by injecting 100 \u03bcL of the mixture (5\u00d710cells per animal) subcutaneously (s.c.) into the flank of 6-8-week-old male athymic nude mice.

PC-3 and A375 cells (5\u00d710per mL) were prepared in phenol red-free growth media containing 10% FBS, and mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) at 1:1 ratio. Tumors were established by injecting 100 \u03bcL of the mixture (2.5\u00d710cells per animal) subcutaneously (s.c.) into the flank of 6-8-week-old male athymic nude mice. Length and width of tumors were measured and the tumor volume (mm) was calculated by the formula, \u03c0\/6\u00d7L\u00d7W, where length (L) and width (W) were determined in mm. When the tumor volumes reached 150 mm, the animals bearing PC-3 tumors were treated with vehicle [Captex200\/Tween80 (1\/4)], 1h (5 and 15 mg\/kg), 2k (5 and 15 mg\/kg) and 2l (50 mg\/kg) intraperitorally for 21 days.

On the other hand, A375 tumor bearing mice were treated for 34 days with vehicle [Captex200\/Tween80 (1\/4)], 1h (20 mg\/kg) or 2k (15 mg\/kg). Doses were selected based on acute toxicity studies of 1h and 2k in ICR mice (n=2\/group) showing that doses up to 30 mg\/kg and 15 mg\/kg, respectively, did not cause greater than 10% loss of body weight after 4 consecutive days of intraperitoneal dosing.","In vivo antitumor activity [tumor growth inhibition (% T\/C), tumor growth delay (T-C value), and tumor cell kill (total log cell kill)]. Evidence of drug effect is described by the following parameters: % T\/C=[\u0394 tumor volume of treated group]\/[\u0394 tumor volume of control group]\u00d7100%. The T-C values (tumor growth delay) were based on the median time (in days), required for the treatment (T) and the control group (C) tumors, to reach a predetermined size (600 mmin this study). These values were then used for the quantitation of the tumor cell kill following the equation: log cell kill=(T-C)\/(3.32\u00d7Td). Td is the tumor volume-doubling time in days. In this study, we defined the doubling time required for the tumor to increase from 300 to 600 mm.","Rotarod test. ICR mice received training three times a day for two days to enable them to stay on the rotating rod for >120 seconds at 12 rpm. Mice were then randomized by the length of time that they could stay on the rotating rod and divided into 7-8 mice per group. 1h at a dose of 5 or 15 mg\/kg in Captex200\/Tween80 (1\/4) was administered by intraperitoneal injection. Vinblastine at a dose of 0.5 mg\/kg\/day was used as a positive control under the same conditions. The rotarod test was performed twice a week. Treatment was stopped on day 31, and post observation was examined on weeks 1, 2, and 4 after termination of the treatment. The rod speed was increased from 59 rpm to 40 rpm over a period of 5 min. Performance was measured as the length of time that a mouse could stay on the rotating rod.","In vivo drug resistance studies. At the end of the PC-3 xenograft studies, solid tumors from control and 1h treated (15 mg\/kg) groups were removed and digested with 0.1% collagenase (Type I) and 50 mg\/mL DNAse (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, N.J.). Dispersed cells were plated in RPMI medium+10% FBS and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% COfor 24 hr to allow attachment. The anti-proliferative effects of 1h were compared to determine whether tumor cells remaining in PC-3 xenografts retained sensitivity to drug. The PC-3 cells obtained from ATCC were used as in vitro control.

While 1h and 2k inhibited tubulin polymerization by 90%, 2l inhibited the polymerization by only 55%. Previous studies demonstrated a concentration-dependent inhibition of tubulin polymerization by 1h. In addition, under the same experimental conditions, the ICfor 1h (4.23 \u03bcM) is similar to that of colchicine (4.91 \u03bcM). These data suggest that the compounds exhibit strong antitubulin polymerization activity that corresponds well with their cytotoxicity (Table 18). The ability of the compounds to compete for known binding sites on tubulin was determined using a novel MS competitive binding assay, which was developed in our laboratory. Three tubulin ligands, corresponding to the three binding sites on tubulin, colchicine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel were used for these competitive binding studies. It was found that, over a concentration range of 0.1-125 \u03bcM, 1h specifically competed with colchicine binding to tubulin, but it did not compete with either vinblastine or paclitaxel binding to tubulin ().","SMART Compounds Inhibit the Growth of Multidrug-Resistant Cancer Cell Lines","The ability of the compounds to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines was evaluated using the SRB assay. As shown in Table 18, the compounds inhibited the growth of several human cancer cell lines, including four prostate cancer cell lines, and two melanoma cell lines, with ICvalues in the low nanomolar range. Out of the three compounds, 2l was the least potent (IC76\u02dc116 nM). 2k exhibited the best anti-proliferative effect with ICvalues between 6 and 43 nM in prostate cancer and melanoma cell lines. In addition, the effect of the compounds in the OVCAR-8 and NCI\/ADR-RES cell lines was also evaluated (Table 18). The compounds were equally potent against MDR cell (NCI-ADR-RES) and the parent cell line (OVCAR-8). Paclitaxel, vinblastine, and colchicine exhibited relative resistance values of 1333, 149, and 65 times, respectively (Table 18). These data indicate that the compounds circumvent P-gp-mediated drug resistance.","SMART compounds arrest PC-3 (Prostate) and A375 (Melanoma) cells in G2\/M phase of cell cycle and induce cell apoptosis. PC-3 and A375 cells were exposed to 10, 50, 200, and 1000 nM of the compounds for 24 h. Treatment with the SMART compounds resulted in concentration-dependent accumulation of both PC-3 and A375 cells in the G2\/M phase with concomitant decreases in the percentage of cells in G0\/G1 phase (). The proportion of cells in G2\/M phase significantly increased when treated with 50 to 200 nM of 1h, 2k, 2l. Apoptosis was then examined by measuring the level of cytoplasmic DNA-histone complexes in PC-3 and A375 cells after 24 h treatment. Increasing concentration of the SMART compounds increased the level of cytoplasmic DNA-histone complexes in PC-3 and A375 cells (). The effect was more pronounced in A375 cells than PC-3 cells, but apoptosis was evident in both cell types. 1h and 2k induced moderate apoptosis at a concentration of 50 nM, while 2l induced apoptosis only at concentrations greater than or equal to 200 nM.","In vivo PK profile of SMART compounds. A single dose bolus of each compound (15 mg\/kg) was administered by tail vein injection to ICR mice to characterize their pharmacokinetics (). 1h and 2k exhibited similar PK properties, but 2l exhibited slightly greater AUC than 1h and 2k indicative of a lower clearance for 2l (Table 19). 2l also had 2-3 times higher Vthan that of 1h and 2k. The clearance values for all three compounds were equal to or higher than 90 mL\/min\/kg, the hepatic blood flow rate in mice, suggesting that in addition to hepatic removal, other degradation routes may be involved in the elimination of the compounds. The pharmacokinetics of 1h and 2k (2.5 mg\/kg) were also examined in rats (). Interestingly, low clearance values and hepatic extraction rates were obtained by both compounds, suggesting that these compounds exhibit species differences in clearance. In rats, 1h exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties, which are low clearance (6 mL\/min\/kg), moderate volume of distribution (7.6 L\/kg), long half-life (24 hr), and high exposure (AUC, 5.8 hr*\u03bcg\/mL) (Table 19) when administered iv.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0701","num":"0700"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00027","num":"00027"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 19"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Pharmacokinetic parameters of SMART compounds."},{"entry":"SMARTs were administrated 15 mg\/kg and 2.5 mg\/kg"},{"entry":"i.v. in mice and rats, respectively."},{"entry":"In vivo, pharmacokinetic parameters of SMART compounds"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"SMART-",{},{}]},{"entry":["Species","Parameter","Unit","H","SMART-F","SMART-OH"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Mice","AUC","hr * \u03bcg\/mL","1.9","2.2","2.6"]},{"entry":[{},"t","min","140","141","740"]},{"entry":[{},"V","L\/kg","4.9","6.6","16.5"]},{"entry":[{},"CL","mL\/min\/kg","130","112","90"]},{"entry":["Rats","AUC","hr * \u03bcg\/mL","5.8","1.6","NA"]},{"entry":[{},"t","min","1431","2410","NA"]},{"entry":[{},"V","L\/kg","7.6","34","NA"]},{"entry":[{},"CL","mL\/min\/kg","6","11","NA"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"NA, not available"},{"entry":"SMART-H in Table 19 is 1h;"},{"entry":"SMART-F in Table 19 is 2k; and"},{"entry":"SMART-OH in Table 19 is 2l."}]}}]}}},"SMART compounds inhibit prostate and melanoma xenografts growth without neurotoxicity.

These data demonstrate that 1h did not induce drug-resistance in PC-3 tumors after 21 days of continuous 1h treatment.","Methods","All molecular modeling studies were performed with Schrodinger Molecular Modeling Suite 2008 (Schrodinger LLC, New York, N.Y.), running on a Dell Linux workstation. Because the size of ABI compounds are much closer to that of ABT-751, rather than DAMA-colchichine, we selected tubulin complex with ABT-751 (PDB code: 3 KHC) as our modeling system. ABIs were built and prepared using the Ligprep module, and they were docked into the ABT-751 site using the Glide module in Schrodinger Suite. The best docking complexes were subject to restricted molecular dynamics to release any strains using Macromodel module with OPLS-2005 forcefield. The ligand and its surrounding residues within 15 \u212b were allowed to move freely, while residues outside the 15 \u212b radius were kept rigid.","Results","Molecular modeling for binding ABI compounds in tubulin was studied. Several crystal structures of the ligand-tubulin complex are available in the PDB databank, with the most recent one from Dorleans et al. In general, the colchicine binding pocket tolerates a variety of molecular structures, which may indicate substantial conformation changes upon ligand binding. In fact, Dorleans et al. solved the crystal structures of both the empty tubulin dimer and the ligand-tubulin complex. They found that, without the presence of ligand, loop 7 (T7, residues 244-251, ) in the beta-monomer folds in to occupy the binding pocket, while it flips out upon ligand binding. The associated helix 7 (H7, residues 224-243) and helix 8 (H8, residues 252-260) were displaced upon ligand binding. It is conceivable that the extent to which 17 is displaced depends on the size of individual ligand. This flexibility presents a significant challenge to understand the precise binding modes for individual ligands without solving actual crystal structures. Nevertheless, careful analysis of the possible binding modes could provide some insights into the binding of different ligands.","The binding modes of 12cb and 11cb (stick model) are shown in . For comparison, the crystal structure complexes of ABT-751 and DAMA-colchicine (wire models) along with ABI-12cb\/tubulin complex in  is displayed. For clarity, only the related secondary structures forming the binding pocket in \u03b2-tubulin are shown in . The overall structures of 12cb, ABT-751 and DAMA-colchicine overlapped very well in the binding pocket. Several potential hydrogen bonding interactions between compound 12cb and tubulin were identified. The carbonyl group in 12cb was in sufficient proximity to form two hydrogen bond interactions with the backbone NH of Leu-252 in H8 and the sidechain of Asp-251 in 17 of the tubulin \u03b2-monomer. The para-fluorine substituent in the C-ring was close to the sidechain of Cys241 in T7 and Tyr202 in S6, possibly forming one or two hydrogen bonds. The imidazole proton is very close and likely to form a hydrogen bond to Thr179 in T5 loop (residues 173-182) of the tubulin \u03b1-monomer (). Together with the hydrophobic interactions provided by the aromatic rings, the likely formation of these hydrogen bonds would contribute to the high binding affinity to the tubulin dimer, resulting in high antiproliferative potency.","The binding mode of 11cb will be conceivably less defined since two of the three aromatic rings may occupy the binding pocket in the \u03b2-monomer while the third ring may extend toward the interface of the \u03b1\/\u03b2-monomers, similar to how the sidechain of DAMA-chochicine binds. Our modeling indicates that the protecting group likely extends to the tubulin dimer interface, while the A, C rings of 11cb occupy similar binding pocket and orientation as 12cb (). This may explain the similar activity between the two compounds, even though 11cb has an extra ring system. From the molecular modeling studies presented in , the hydrogen bond donor is likely to be the thiol group in Cys-241 in loop 7 of the \u03b2-subunit in \u03b1\/\u03b2-tubulin dimer.","The binding mode of ABI 12fb was modeled (not shown) and compared to DAMA-colchicine (see  for structure of colchicine) in the \u03b1\/\u03b2-tubulin heterodimer. The overall structure of 12fb and DAMA-cochicine overlapped very well. The p-fluoro phenyl moiety overlaps with the trimethoxylpheny moiety which is interacting with the T7 loop in the \u03b2-subunit. Similarly, the p-chloro phenyl moiety occupies the other side of the pocket where the seven-member ring of the DAMA-cochicine is, with the chlorine atom occupying the pocket where the methoxy moiety interacts.","Materials and Methods","Cellomics Cytoskeleton rearrangement kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) was used to get a visually appreciable proof of ABIs interacting with tubulin inside the cells. WM-164 melanoma cells were treated with each compound for 18 h in duplicate using a collagen-coated 96-well plate (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, Mass.). Then cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) and permeabilized using permeabilization buffer supply from the kit. Primary antibody for tubulin and fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody were subsequently added to the cells. Cell nuclei were stained by DAPI. Whole Cell Stain Green was also applied to all cells. All images were acquired with an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with overlays from separate","images of tubulin (red), nuclei (blue), and whole cells (green). For comparison, paclitacel, colchicine and ABT-751, along with ABIs are included.","Results","Visual proof of ABIs interacting with tubulin inside the cells was examined. The microtubule arrangement in human melanoma WM-164 cells upon treatment with different compounds is presented in . The microtubule images clearly showed that all five tested compounds resulted in cytoskeleton rearrangement. There was a significant difference between paclitaxel and the other four compounds (colchicine, ABT-751, 12cb, and 12da). Treatment with paclitaxel resulted in a condensation of microtubules orderly lying around the nuclei compared with controls, consistent with its mechanisms of action for stabilizing microtubules. On the contrary, treatment with colchicine, ABT-751, 12cb, and 12da had similar effects on microtubules and resulted in some degree of microtubule fragmentation, consistent with their common mechanism of action for destabilizing microtubules.
