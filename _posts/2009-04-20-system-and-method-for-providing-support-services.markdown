{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Conventional search engines generally use web crawlers and robots to obtain information. After collecting the information, the search engine will generally aggregate the information based on keyword indexing. The mechanisms for aggregating information used by conventional search engines are often based on the wording in the information being aggregated.","Once the information has been indexed, conventional search engines formulate contextual search paradigms based on the indices, and provide users with search results. Upon receiving search engine results, users sift through the results to determine the relevance of the results.","A multi-user environment, such as an enterprise environment, poses several issues with respect to conventional search engines. For example, conventional search engines do not offer the ability to control how information is aggregated and obtained. Additionally, web crawlers and robots merely traverse all the documents on a server without evaluating the context of the information as it is collected.","In a multi-user environment, a user may need to know only certain information that falls within a particular context, and an organization may also limit access to certain information to a subset of users.","Methods and systems for providing support services are provided. Embodiments of the invention may provide a method for providing assistance, including receiving a query from a user via a first mode of interaction; developing a query context using information related to the query and identity information related to the user; searching first data for first results, wherein the searching is limited by the query context; and providing first results to the user via a second mode of interaction that is different than the first mode of interaction. Embodiments of the invention may further provide a computer program product embodied on a computer-usable medium, the medium having stored thereon a sequence of instructions which, when executed by a processor, causes the processor to execute the foregoing method.","Embodiments of the invention may further a system for providing assistance that includes a message bus and an application server communicably coupled to the message bus. The exemplary system may further include one or more interaction systems communicably coupled to the message bus and configured to receive a query via a first mode of interaction and respond to the query via a second mode of interaction. A support application may also be communicably coupled to the message bus and configured to develop a query context using information related to the query and identity information related to the user. Further, the system may include a crawler system communicably coupled to the message bus and configured to produce indexed resources from a plurality of resources. A search engine may also be communicably coupled to the message bus and configured to search first data for first results, wherein the searching is limited by the query context.","Embodiments of the invention may provide a method for providing assistance, including means for receiving a query from a user via a first mode of interaction; means for developing a query context using information related to the query and identity information related to the user; means for searching first data for first results, wherein the searching is limited by the query context; and means for providing first results to the user via a second mode of interaction that is different than the first mode of interaction.","The following disclosure provides many different embodiments or examples. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and\/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and\/or configurations discussed. Moreover, while many of the examples provided below pertain to transactions often conducted in the course of airline industry business, aspects of the present disclosure are applicable and\/or readily adaptable to other industries, including rail, bus, cruise and other travel or shipping industries, rental car industries, hotels and other hospitality industries, entertainment industries, and others.","The present disclosure relates generally to providing multi-modal support services in an enterprise environment. More specifically, an embodiment of the support system in accordance with the present disclosure facilitates locating information for users of the system. The support system receives inquiries from one or more users and responds to user inquiries using one or more modes of interaction. Modes of interaction may include, without limitation, electronic mail, HTML, Interactive Voice Response (IVR), and person-to-person telephone conversations. One embodiment of the support system uses identity information and user interaction via one or more interactive technologies to establish a query context for determining an answer to user inquiries. A query context may include user identity information, keywords, organizational information, or any other information describing the query.","In describing selected embodiments, various objects or components may be implemented as computing modules. These modules may be general purpose modules, or they may have dedicated functions such as memory management, program flow, instruction processing, and object storage. The modules can be implemented in any way known in the art. For example, in one embodiment a module is implemented in a hardware circuit including custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. One or more of the modules may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.","In an exemplary embodiment, one or more of the modules are implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may, for instance, may include one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions that may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Further, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may include disparate instructions stored in different locations that, when joined logically together, include the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module. A \u201cmodule\u201d of executable code could be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated in association with one or more modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices, and may exist, at least partially, as electronic signals on a system or network.","In some embodiments, higher-level components may be used as modules. For example, one module may include an entire computer acting as a network node. Another module may include of an off-the-shelf or custom program, such as a database management system. These higher-level modules may be decomposable into smaller hardware or software modules corresponding to different parts of a software program and identifiable chips (such as memory chips, ASICs, or a CPU) within a computer.","One type of module is a \u201cnetwork.\u201d A network module defines a communications path between endpoints and may include an arbitrary amount of intermediate modules. A network module may encompass various pieces of hardware, such as cables, routers, and modems, as well the software necessary to use that hardware. Another network module may encompass system calls or device-specific mechanisms such as shared memory, pipes, or system messaging services. A third network module may use calling conventions within a computing module, such as a computer language or execution environment. Information transmitted using the network module may be carried upon an underlying protocol, such as HTTP, BXXP, or SMTP, or it may define its own transport over TCP\/IP, IPX\/SPX, Token Ring, ATM, etc. To assure proper transmission, both the underlying protocol as well as the format protocol may split the information into separate pieces, wrap the information in an envelope, or both. Further, a network module may transform the data through the use of one or more computing modules.","Referring to , an enterprise environment is illustrated including an exemplary embodiment of a support system . One embodiment of the support system  may include an application server  having a message bus . Support system  may further include one or more other interface systems that are communicably coupled to the message bus . Interface systems may include one or more sub-interface systems, and may be configured to receive a query via first mode of interaction and respond to the query via a second mode of interaction. Interface systems may include, for example, an Interactive Voice Response (\u201cIVR\u201d) system , a web services system , and a text messaging system ","Each interface system may provide a different form of interface for communicating with support system . This enables interaction between a user and support system  through one or more interfaces. One embodiment of support system  enables a user to interface with the IVR delivery system  using telecommunications technology, such as a telephone . For example, a user may call a phone number that is dedicated to the IVR delivery system . In another embodiment, a user may contact IVR delivery system  using Voice-Over-Internet-Protocol (\u201cVOIP\u201d) technology. Further, in another embodiment, IVR delivery system  may also enable outbound call initiation. In one embodiment, IVR delivery system  may handle inbound and outbound phone calls using text-to-speech technology. According to one embodiment, the IVR delivery system  and the application server  communicate via a protocol that facilitates the exchange of voice XML (\u201cVXML\u201d) documents.","In another embodiment, a user may interface with the web services system  using a computing device , such as a personal computer. For example, according to one embodiment, a user may use a computing device  that is equipped with a browser to navigate to an HTML-based interface hosted by the web services system . The web services system  may also provide an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) to enable communication between web services system  and another system. In a first embodiment, the API is a Simple Object Access Protocol (\u201cSOAP\u201d) interface. In a second embodiment, the API is a Service Oriented Architecture (\u201cSOA\u201d) interface.","In yet another embodiment, a user may contact support system  using a mobile device  that is capable of sending and receiving messages and data. An example type of message would be Short Message Service (\u201cSMS\u201d) text messages. For example, in one embodiment, text messaging system  may receive a standard text message from a user, and then relay the text message to the application server  via the message bus . The text message request may then be handled by support system  in a similar manner as any other support request, except that all communication between application server , the text messaging system , and a user may be in the form of text messages.","A support system  may also include one or more auxiliary systems that are communicably coupled to the message bus . According to one embodiment, a ticket management system , a directory system , and a crawler system  are communicably coupled to the message bus . The ticket management system , according to one embodiment, includes an application interface that may be used by various help desk users to coordinate support ticket tracking information. In one embodiment, a ticket management system  may be configured to establish a record of user requests submitted via one of the interface systems. One embodiment of a record may include a ticket number, a request number or request ID, and other identifying information that may be helpful in tracking a request. A help desk system or a help desk agent may then later update the record by using the identifying information. For example, a help desk agent might update a record to reflect a closed status once a support request has been fulfilled. In another embodiment, a user may query a ticket management system  using identifying information contained in the record.","According to one embodiment, a user might be able to check on the status of a ticket by submitting ticket information to a ticket management system  via an interface system. For example, a user may be able to submit identifying information to a ticket management system  via a first interface system, and then retrieve ticket status information via a second interface system. The first and second interface systems may be the same, or they may be different. Alternatively, according to another embodiment, a user may submit identifying information to a ticket management system  via a first interface system, and the ticket management system  may contact a user to deliver ticket status information at a later time via a second interface system. The first and second interface systems may be the same, or they may be different.","According to one embodiment, a directory system  may provide directory information related to a user. Directory information may include user authentication and attribute details, such as name, phone number, and location. One embodiment of a directory system  may be a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\u201cLDAP\u201d)-based directory. For example, one embodiment of a directory system  may be a MICROSOFT ACTIVE DIRECTORY LDAP directory. A second embodiment may be an implementation of the SUN ONE DIRECTORY SERVER.","According to one embodiment, a crawler system  may be configured to produce indexed resources from one or more resources. For example, a crawler system  may scan the web pages of an intranet server, and may populate a search engine with data. In one embodiment, a crawler system  may scan every page of an intranet. In a second embodiment, a crawler system  may scan only specific servers or specific sites of an intranet. A third embodiment of a crawler system  may scan all (or substantially all) of the documents and files in a network, such as an intranet, an extranet, the Internet, or any portion thereof, and be capable of identifying certain code contained in the documents and files. For example, in one embodiment, a crawler system  scans static HTML and XHTML web pages for meta tags.","According to one embodiment, a crawler system  may be capable of parsing one or more document types. For example, one embodiment may be capable of parsing HTML-based web pages, MICROSOFT WORD documents and ADOBE ACROBAT READER documents. In an embodiment of a crawler system , upon reading the contents of a document, the crawler system  creates a keyword matrix for the document. Information about the document, such as the author, the content, or classification, may be used to develop a document context. In another embodiment, a search engine  may index the document based upon the document's context, role and description as determined by web pages that reference the document on a website.","Referring now to , an embodiment of an application server  is shown in more detail. In one embodiment, the application server  may be a JAVA-based application server, such as the JAVA 2 PLATFORM ENTERPRISE EDITION (\u201cJ2EE\u201d). For example, an embodiment of the application server  may be a BEA WEBLOGIC server. The message bus , according to one embodiment, may be an implementation of the JAVA message service API, such as OPENJMS. According to one embodiment, the message bus  of the application server  is also communicably coupled to a search engine , a voice processor , a rules engine , and a support application .","According to one embodiment, a voice processor  may include an IVR processor. An IVR processor may maintain communications state information for sessions established with the IVR processor. Communication state information may be used to enable dynamic VXML sessions. The IVR processor may also be responsible for dynamically generating the content of VXML and CCXML documents. In one embodiment, the IVR processor interfaces with a search engine  when handling queries and interfaces with the rules engine  when business logic is needed.","In one embodiment, a rules engine  manages business logic conditions. According to one embodiment, depending upon a document or request type, a rules engine  may alter the VXML document, delete a request completely, or return a new VXML document that indicates a transformation or rejection of a specific XML document type.","Referring now to , the support application  is illustrated in more detail. The support application , according to one embodiment, includes the logic that controls the operation of the support system . One function of the support application  may be to route queries and responses received from one or more users. Another function of the support application  may be to process user queries. According to one embodiment, the support application  may include one or more modules that are controlled by the support application .","In one embodiment, as illustrated in , the support application  includes a query module , an identity module , a response module , and a follow-up module . One embodiment of the identity module  determines the identity of a user based on identity information, such as a user's name, a user's profile, a user's department, a user's position within an organization, a user's physical location, or any other information related to the user's identity. Another embodiment of the identity module  retrieves identity information from a directory system  via the message bus .","According to one embodiment, the query module  responds to a user's inquiry, via the IVR delivery system , by asking a user to verbally state a request. After the query module  receives a user's verbal request, the query module  may use voice recognition technology to parse a user's request. According to one exemplary embodiment, parsing the user's request includes identifying keywords in the request. After parsing the user's request, the query module  may determine certain information about the query, such as the subject of the query, the priority of the query, keywords in the query, or any other information related to the query. The query module  may use such information to develop a query context that may be used to limit the amount of information searched.","In one embodiment, based on a user's request, the support application  may generate new VXML documents and send the new VXML documents to the IVR delivery system . The IVR delivery system  may process each new VXML document, and may request more information from the user based upon the VXML document. For example, in one embodiment, each new VXML document may include additional voice prompts that are to be delivered to the user via the IVR delivery system . The additional voice prompts may help the support application  further establish a query context for the user's request.","Further, in one embodiment, a query module  may attempt to more clearly define the query context by generating Call Control XML (\u201cCCXML\u201d) documents, and utilizing the IVR delivery system  to initiate outgoing calls to users based upon the contents of the CCXML documents. For example, based upon the contents of the CCXML documents, the IVR delivery system  may call the user, and when the user answers the call, the IVR delivery system  may deliver a message to the user or ask the user additional questions using text-to-speech technology. The query module  may use the answers to the additional questions to refine the query context.","In one embodiment, after the support application  determines that it has sufficiently developed the query context, a query module  may then seek information from one or more sources, and provide a response to the user's request. In one embodiment, the query module  combines the information from the one or more sources with other information, such as feedback about information retrieved from past requests that were similar to the user's request. For example, the feedback may be related to another user's evaluation of the relevance of the information retrieved in response to a past similar request.","A response module , according to one embodiment, may then deliver the information to the user. The response module  may deliver the information to the user using one or more modes of interaction. In one embodiment, if the user submitted the request via the phone, the response module  automatically routes the user to a phone number that may be helpful to the user. In another embodiment, if the user submitted the request via an Internet-based communication medium, a response module  automatically routes the user to a web page or other Internet resource that may be helpful to the user.","According to another embodiment, a response module  may forward a form to the user. One embodiment of a response module  forwards an electronic form to the user's email address. Another embodiment of a response module  sends an electronic request for a paper-based form to an administrative clerk. Upon receiving the electronic request, the administrator may send the form to the user. In another embodiment, the support application  may deliver web-based content, such as a digital video file, to the user.","Another embodiment of a response module  communicates the response to the user using telecommunications technology. In one embodiment, a response module  transmits a text message, such as an SMS message, to the user's phone. In a second embodiment, a response module  retrieves the user's phone number from a directory system , and places a phone call to the user. When the user answers the call, a response module  uses text-to-speech technology to provide the user with a \u201cverbal\u201d answer. As evidenced by the above embodiments, there are many ways for a user to interact with the support application .","In one embodiment, the follow-up module  enables the user to respond to the response received from a response module . According to one embodiment, a follow-up module  enables a user to speak with an agent if he needs additional information. According to another embodiment, a follow-up module  may recommend another webpage where the user may be able to find additional information.","Referring now to , a portion of HTML code of a web page is illustrated. The HTML code illustrated in  shows several embodiments of meta tags. One embodiment of a meta tag is a W3C-standard meta tag. A second embodiment of a meta tag is a custom meta tag. A custom meta tag may include a \u201cname\u201d element and a \u201ccontent\u201d element. An embodiment of the name element may include a name element that begins with the letter \u201cv\u201d and a descriptive name. For example, one embodiment of a custom meta-tag may have a name element of \u201cvcontext.\u201d Several embodiments of custom meta tags may be embedded within the \u201chead\u201d HTML tags -of HTML code of a web page, as illustrated in .","In the exemplary embodiment of HTML code illustrated in , the \u201cdescription\u201d meta tag  describes the content and may be used by a search engine  to group information. The \u201ckeywords\u201d meta tag  may include a list of keywords that a search engine  may use to index the content of the web page. The \u201cvcontext\u201d meta tag  may logically categorize the content of the web page. In the embodiment of HTML code illustrated in , multiple pieces of content may be grouped in the \u201cEmployee HR Forms\u201d category.","Further, in the foregoing exemplary embodiment, the \u201cvrole\u201d meta tag  may describe what corporate business role(s) may access the information contained in the web page. For example, one embodiment of a business role may include all business roles. Another embodiment of a business role may include only specific employee levels. Yet another embodiment of a business role may include only specific management levels, or certain executives, such as vice presidents. In one embodiment, the definition of business roles may be specific to a particular organization.","The \u201cvdocscan\u201d meta tag  in the foregoing exemplary embodiment of HTML code allows an author of a web page to indicate to a crawler system  that certain references should be included or excluded. In one embodiment, if no \u201cvdocscan\u201d meta tag  is included in a web page, then that is a signal to a crawler system  that it may process every web page it encounters in a directory. However, in the foregoing embodiment, the \u201cvdocscan\u201d meta tag  indicates to a crawler system  that only one document, hrpolicy.doc, should be processed, and all other documents, indicated in the illustrated embodiment by \u201c*.*\u201d, should be excluded from the crawler's activities. One embodiment of a crawler system  does an initial scan of all web pages, and looks only for custom meta tags. According to one embodiment, a crawler system  performs an initial scan that is limited to identifying \u201cvdocscan\u201d meta tags  in the web pages, and then performs a subsequent scan that is limited to the web page files that are identified by any \u201cvdocscan\u201d meta tags .","Referring now to , one exemplary embodiment of a crawler system  may include credentials to access certain password-protected sites or web pages. Further, an embodiment of a definition of such credentials may also specify which documents a crawler system  may access using the credentials. For example, an embodiment of credentials is illustrated in . In the exemplary embodiment of credentials illustrated in , the credentials tag  are included within \u201csite\u201d tags -. In one embodiment, the username \u201creadonlyuser\u201d and password \u201cabcdefg\u201d may be used by a crawler system  to access index.html file at the http:\/\/flightline.aa.com url. The doclist element of the \u201curl\u201d tag in the forgoing embodiment may indicate to a crawler system  that the files listed in the doclist element may include \u201cvdocscan\u201d meta tags that define any additional files on the website that a crawler system  should scan.","Referring to , according to one embodiment, a search engine  utilizes Single Sign-On (\u201cSSO\u201d) credentials. According to one embodiment, the SSO credentials may come from a J2EE Authentication Provider that is communicably coupled to a directory system . One embodiment of a search engine  establishes a role via an organizational unit that impersonates the role defined in a \u201cvrole\u201d meta tag . According to another embodiment of a search engine , the search engine  may filter search results based upon a role. For example, one embodiment of a search engine  does not provide certain search results to a user if the user is not a member of a role designated in a \u201cvrole\u201d meta tag . According to one embodiment, a search engine  returns a document context, as defined by a \u201cvcontext\u201d meta tag , along with any search results. According to one exemplary embodiment, a document context may include document author information, document subject information, document title information, or any other information that may describe a document. A system or a user that receives the search results may use the document context to determine the relevancy of a search result. For example, according to one embodiment, information related to one or more document contexts may be provided to the user, so that the user may choose the most relevant document context. After the user chooses a document context, the search engine  provides only certain search results that are included in the selected document context to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","200","200","200","200","304","601","304","304"]},"In a step , the query module  prompts a user to state his query. The user may then respond with a query via a first mode of interaction. For example, a user might state, \u201cI would like a copy of my W-2 tax form.\u201d Then, at a step , the query module  parses the user's query. According to one exemplary embodiment, parsing the user's request in step  may include identifying keywords in the request and using the keywords to develop a query context. For example, the key words in the foregoing example may be \u201ccopy\u201d and \u201cW-2.\u201d The query module  may also develop a query context using user identity information. For example, once the user has been identified, the user's department or location may be used to develop the query context. Next, at a step  the query module  determines whether the user's query establishes an adequate query context. For example, an inadequate query context may cause the search engine  to return more than a certain number of search results because the query context is too broad. If the query context is not sufficient, then the method  may further prompt the user as shown in a step . The user's input may then be used to narrow the query context. In another embodiment, feedback from other users' previous searches may be used to narrow the query context. Steps  and  may be repeated until the query module  determines that the query context is sufficiently narrow.","Once the context is sufficient, the search engine  searches first data for first results using the query context. At a step , the query module  determines whether the search engine  results are sufficient. For example, according to one exemplary embodiment, if the search engine  returns too many results, then the query module  may determine that the search engine  results are not sufficient. In another exemplary embodiment, user input may be used to determine whether the search engine  results are sufficient.","If the query module  determines that the search results are not sufficient, then the query module  may proceed to an optional step , wherein the query module  develops a refined query context. Each search result may have a search result context that describes the search result. A search result context may be developed using a document context. For example, for a search related to tax documents, a document context may be used to develop a search result context based on a tax year. According to one exemplary embodiment, developing a refined query context may include (a) presenting one or more search result contexts to the user, (b) asking the user to choose a search result context, and (c) modifying the query context using the user's chosen search result context. As an example, the query module  may ask the user which tax year a user is interested in. In a step , the query module  may search second data results for second results, wherein the searching is limited by the refined query context. Continuing with the previous example, the query module  may search only documents specified by a user. In another embodiment, feedback from other users' previous searches may be used to develop a refined query context.","Once the query module  decides that the search results are sufficient, then the query module  may proceed to a step , wherein the response module  provides the search results to the user. Finally, in an optional step , the follow up module  may request feedback from the user by following up with the user. Following up with the user may be performed using any mode of interaction. According to one embodiment, the feedback may be used to improve the context sufficiency determination at step , or the search engine sufficiency determination at step .","An embodiment of a support system  that enables multiple modes of interaction, such as the ones described above with respect to , has several benefits. Conventional support systems are media specific. That is, conventional support systems receive queries and respond to queries using the same form of communication. For example, conventional telephone-based support systems limit a user to calling a support phone number, speaking to a representative, and receiving an answer via the telephone. Using a single form of communication limits the user's experience. Further, conventional web-based support solutions require the user to actively search a web site to find answers. Voice recognition and IVR-based support systems are limited by the limitations of a telephone-based support system. For example, such IVR-based support systems cannot provide video or text support materials to the user.","An embodiment of a support system , such as the ones described above, are capable of using more than one form of communication to receive and respond to queries. One benefit of using multiple forms of communication is that users of the support system  will be able to spend less time looking for information. For example, instead of spending time searching multiple websites for certain information, an embodiment of the present invention allows the user to submit a request via a telecommunications interface, and receive a response via a form of communication of his choice. Further, being able to receive a response via multiple forms of communication allows a user of an embodiment of the support system  to see, hear, and read the response, thereby facilitating the user's ability to understand the response. Embodiments of the present invention present users with a straightforward interface that enables users to receive support in their chosen method of communication.","Cost savings is another advantage of the embodiments described herein. An embodiment of the present invention enables enterprises to limit the number of human support representatives. For example, an enterprise may choose to reduce the number of human support representatives who initially receive support phone calls. These support representatives may be replaced with an IVR delivery system  or other interface system","Further, embodiments of the present invention allow enterprises to fully utilize existing resources such as telephony, desktop and laptop computers, intranets, the Internet, and mobile communication devices. Many enterprises already possess these resources, and embodiments of the present invention allow enterprises to seamlessly integrate each of these various resources into a support process flow.","In view of all of the above and the figures, it should be readily apparent to those skill in the art that the present disclosure introduces a method for providing assistance. An exemplary embodiment of a method for providing assistance in accordance with the present disclosure may include receiving a query from a user via a first mode of interaction; developing a query context using information related to the query and identity information related to the user; searching first data for first results, wherein the searching is limited by the query context; and providing first results to the user via a second mode of interaction that is different than the first mode of interaction.","According to one exemplary embodiment, the method may further include refining the query context. Refining the query context may include presenting one or more search result contexts related to the first results to the user; receiving input from the user regarding a user-chosen search result context; and modifying the query context based on the user-chosen search result context. The exemplary embodiment may also include searching second data for second results, wherein the searching is limited by the refined query context, and providing second results to the user.","In another exemplary embodiment, the second data may be the first results. Further, the second results may be provided to the user via a third mode of interaction.
