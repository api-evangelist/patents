{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to systems and methods for identifying and reporting errors associated with dynamic web content. More particularly, the present invention relates to automated correction and reporting for dynamic web applications.","2. Related Art","Web servers provide web content that may be displayed on a user's computer. The user displays the web content by navigating to a particular website via entry of a uniform resource locator (URL) into a web browser running on the user's computer. The user may then view and read content associated with the website or interact with the website. The user interactions include clicking buttons, entering text, or other activities.","Certain web content is dynamic in nature, such that the content changes based upon the user's interaction with the content. Dynamic changes to web content are facilitated by execution of scripts or other procedures in response to user interactions with the web content. Javascript is an example of a scripting language that has been developed to provide dynamic changes to web content.","The subject matter described herein provides automated runtime checking, correction, and reporting of accessibility problems for dynamic rich web applications. Compliance rules identify proper organization and formatting for web site content. Dynamic changes to the web site content are monitored in runtime as the dynamic changes occur. Noncompliant tags and attributes associated with the dynamic changes are identified based upon the compliance rules. Automated correction of the identified noncompliant tags and attributes facilitates functional correction of the web site content during the present session. Report generation and forwarding to source development servers provides developer feedback for the identified noncompliant tags and attributes. The report identifies the event that triggered the dynamic changes, the identified noncompliant tags and attributes, and the automated correction performed during the present session. Accordingly, accessibility problems are automatically corrected in runtime and future deployments of dynamic web site content may be improved via the feedback reporting generated.","A method includes monitoring changes to dynamic web content for compliance with web content compliance rules, identifying a noncompliant element associated with a change to the dynamic web content based upon the web content compliance rules, performing automated correction of the noncompliant element based upon the web content compliance rules, and reporting the noncompliant element to a server associated with the change to the dynamic web content.","A system includes a memory adapted to store web content compliance rules, and a computing device adapted to monitor changes to dynamic web content for compliance with the web content compliance rules, identify a noncompliant element associated with a change to the dynamic web content based upon the web content compliance rules, perform automated correction of the noncompliant element based upon the web content compliance rules, and report the noncompliant element to a server associated with the change to the dynamic web content.","An alternative system includes a database adapted to store web content compliance rules, a memory adapted to store at least one of a document object model and markup language representing dynamic web content, and a computing device adapted to monitor changes to the dynamic web content for compliance with the web content compliance rules, identify a noncompliant element associated with a change to the dynamic web content based upon the web content compliance rules and a change to the at least one of the document object model and the markup language, determine that an error associated with the noncompliant element comprises at least one of an improper tag, a missing tag, an improper attribute, a missing attribute, an improper attribute value, and a missing attribute value, identify event information associated with the noncompliant element, perform automated correction of the noncompliant element based upon the web content compliance rules to correct the at least one of the document object model representation and the markup language representation of the dynamic web content within the memory, and report the noncompliant element and the event information to a server associated with the change to the dynamic web content.","A computer program product includes a computer useable medium including a computer readable program. The computer readable program when executed on a computer causes the computer to monitor changes to dynamic web content for compliance with web content compliance rules, identify a noncompliant element associated with a change to the dynamic web content based upon the web content compliance rules, perform automated correction of the noncompliant element based upon the web content compliance rules, and report the noncompliant element to a server associated with the change to the dynamic web content.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate the scope of the present invention and realize additional aspects thereof after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments in association with the accompanying drawing figures.","The embodiments set forth below represent the necessary information to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention and illustrate the best mode of practicing the invention. Upon reading the following description in light of the accompanying drawing figures, those skilled in the art will understand the concepts of the invention and will recognize applications of these concepts not particularly addressed herein. It should be understood that these concepts and applications fall within the scope of the disclosure and the accompanying claims.","The subject matter described herein provides automated runtime checking, correction, and reporting of accessibility problems for dynamic rich web applications. Compliance rules identify proper organization and formatting for web site content. Dynamic changes to the web site content are monitored in runtime as the dynamic changes occur. Noncompliant tags and attributes associated with the dynamic changes are identified based upon the compliance rules. Automated correction of the identified noncompliant tags and attributes facilitates functional correction of the web site content during the present session. Report generation and forwarding to source development servers provides developer feedback for the identified noncompliant tags and attributes. The report identifies the event that triggered the dynamic changes, the identified noncompliant tags and attributes, and the automated correction performed during the present session. Accordingly, accessibility problems are automatically corrected in runtime and future deployments of dynamic web site content may be improved via the feedback reporting generated.","For purposes of the present description runtime shall include any time frame of sufficiently short duration as to provide reasonable response time for identification and correction of problems associated with dynamic web site content acceptable to a user of the subject matter described. Additionally, the terms accessibility and web accessibility as used herein refer to capabilities within a web-based system or application that allow people with disabilities to perceive, understand, navigate, interact with, and contribute to the web or other networked infrastructure independent of the reason for the disability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","1","106","108","102","102","1","106","108","102","104"]},"It should be noted that the computing device  may be any computing device capable of processing information as described above and in more detail below. For example, the computing device  may include devices such as a personal computer, a cellular telephone, a personal digital assistance (PDA), an email device, a music recording or playback device, or any other device capable of processing information as described in more detail below. Additionally, the computing device  may be co-located or distributed geographically with respect to the any of the server_  through the server_N , and the network . The network  includes any form of interconnection suitable for the intended purpose, including a private or public network such as an intranet or the Internet, respectively, direct inter-module interconnection, or any other interconnection mechanism capable of interconnecting the devices.","A database  is associated with the computing device  and provides storage capabilities for information associated with the automated correction and reporting for dynamic web applications of the present subject matter. The database  includes a set of compliance rules  that may be stored in the form of a table or other arrangement accessible by the computing device . The compliance rules  include structural, syntactic, formatting, or other requirements for web content presented to a user of a web-based system, such as the system . The compliance rules  may include rules associated with accessibility aspects of dynamic web content in addition to rules associated with functionality of the dynamic web content. Accordingly, the compliance rules  establish a reference against which changes to dynamic web content may be measured for compliance with structural, syntactic, formatting, functionality, accessibility, and other requirements for web content.","As will be described in more detail below, the computing device  monitors changes to dynamic web content in runtime as the changes occur. The computing device  compares changes to dynamic web content with the compliance rules , identifies errors with rendered content, performs automated correction of the rendered content, generates reports including the content error and associated event information (e.g., mouse click on a particular content element), and forwards the report to a server, such as the server_ , that is associated with the dynamic web content. A developer of the dynamic web content may then utilize the report to programmatically correct the dynamic web content and deploy a new revision of the dynamic web content.","The compliance rules  may be updated periodically by any of the server_  through the server_N  to accommodate new measurement criteria for new dynamic web content as dynamic web content evolves over time. As such, developers associated with the server_  through the server_N  may develop new dynamic web content and distribute compliance rules via the network  for runtime monitoring of the new dynamic web content by the computing device . Accordingly, the developers may deploy compliance rules for storage as a portion of the compliance rules  associated with any computing device  accessible on the network . In this manner, developers may utilize computing devices configured as described above and in more detail below as the computing device  to form a distributed compliance checking, error correcting, and reporting infrastructure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","200","102","202","102","204"]},"The input device  may include a computer keyboard, a keypad, a mouse, a pen, a joystick, or any other type of input device by which the user may interact with dynamic web content represented on the display . Events associated with changes to dynamic web content, such as a mouse click to a content element, may be initiated by a user interaction with the input device . These events may be tracked and reported by the computing device  to the associated content developer server, such as the server_ .","A communication module  provides interconnection capabilities that allow the computing device  to communicate with other modules within the system , such as the server_  through the server_N . The communication module  may include any electrical, protocol, and protocol conversion capabilities useable to provide the interconnection capabilities.","A memory  includes a document object model storage area  that stores a representation of the presently-accessed web content. The memory  also includes a markup language error application  and a browser application . The markup language error application  includes capabilities for runtime monitoring of changes to dynamic web content, identification of errors in the changes, correction of the errors, generation of reports, and high-level communication interactions with other nodes within the system , such as the server_ , for reporting the identified and corrected errors. The markup language error application  includes instructions executable by the CPU  for performing these functions.","The markup language error application  may form a portion of an interrupt service routine (ISR), a portion of an operating system, a portion of the browser application , or a portion of a separate application without departure from the scope of the present subject matter. The markup language error application  may also process rules from the compliance rules  to perform these activities. The browser application  accesses and retrieves content from a server, such as the server_ , and presents that content to a user of the computing device  via the display .","It is understood that the memory  may include any combination of volatile and non-volatile memory suitable for the intended purpose, distributed or localized as appropriate, and may include other memory segments not illustrated within the present example for ease of illustration purposes. For example, the memory  may include a code storage area, a code execution area, and a data area suitable for storage of the document object model storage area , and storage and execution of the markup language error application  and the browser application .","The CPU , the display , the input device , the communication module , the memory , and the database  are interconnected via an interconnection . The interconnection  may include a system bus, a network, or any other interconnection capable of providing the respective components with suitable interconnection for the respective purpose.","Furthermore, components within the computing device  may be co-located or distributed within a network without departure from the scope of the present subject matter. For example, the components within the computing device  may be located within a stand-alone device, such as a personal computer (e.g., desktop or laptop) or handheld device (e.g., cellular telephone, personal digital assistant (PDA), email device, music recording or playback device, etc.). For a distributed arrangement, the display  and the input device  may be located at a terminal of a fuel pump, point of sale device, or kiosk, while the CPU  and memory  may be located at a local or remote server. Many other possible arrangements for components of the computing device  are possible and all are considered within the scope of the present subject matter. It should also be understood that, though the compliance rules  are shown within the database , they may also be stored within the memory  without departure from the scope of the present subject matter.","The examples presented below use markup language error identification and correction for ease of illustration purposes. However, it is understood that the present subject matter is not limited to markup language processing and that processing of any other form of rendered content may be performed without departure from the scope of the present subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 through 6","FIGS. 2 through 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["210","210","102","202","214","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","210","208","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<html> <body>"]},{"entry":[{},"<img src=\u201cwelcome.gif\u201d usemap=\u201c#map1\u201d alt=\u201careas in library\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<map id=\u201cmap1\u201d name=\u201cmap1\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"<area shape=\u201crect\u201d coords=\u201c0,0,30,30\u201d href=\u201creference.html\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"alt=\u201cReference\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/map> <\/body> <\/html>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"With reference to , this example markup language pseudo code generated several elements within the document object model . Though distinctions are made between objects, attributes, attribute values, and tags within the following description for purposes of clarity, they may all be considered as elements associated with dynamic web content for purposes of the present description. A document object  represents the highest level element within the hierarchy of the document object model  and is created by the \u201c<html>\u201d and \u201c<\/html>\u201d tag pair within the example markup language pseudo code. A body object  represents the next element within the hierarchy of the document object model  and is created by the \u201c<body>\u201d and \u201c<\/body>\u201d tag pair within the example markup language pseudo code.","An img object  represents the first element within the body hierarchy of the document object model  and is created by the \u201c<img . . . \/>\u201d tag within the example markup language pseudo code. The img object  includes an alt attribute , a src attribute , and a usemap attribute . As can be seen from the example markup language pseudo code above, each of the alt attribute , the src attribute , and the usemap attribute  has an attribute value associated with it. The attribute value of the alt attribute  is a text string \u201careas in library.\u201d The attribute value of the src attribute  is a file name for a graphic file named \u201cwelcome.gif.\u201d The attribute value of the usemap attribute  is a value of \u201c#map1\u201d which is an internal reference as described in more detail below. For ease of illustration, only the value of the alt attribute  is illustrated within . An attribute value  stores the value of the alt attribute .","A map object  represents the second element within the body hierarchy of the document object model  and is created by the \u201c<map>\u201d and \u201c<\/map>\u201d tag pair within the example markup language pseudo code. The map object  includes an id attribute  and a name attribute . The attribute value of the id attribute  and the name attribute  is each set to \u201cmap1\u201d and forms the reference described above in association with the usemap attribute . For ease of illustration, the attribute values for the id attribute  and the name attribute  are not illustrated within .","The markup language pseudo code for the map object  also includes syntax that creates an area object  located between the starting and ending map tags. The area object  includes a shape attribute , a coords attribute , an href attribute , and an alt attribute .","As can be seen from the example markup language pseudo code above, each of the shape attribute , the coords attribute , the href attribute , and the alt attribute  has an attribute value associated with it. The attribute value of the shape attribute  is a value of \u201crect\u201d representing that the area object  is rectangular in shape. The attribute value of the coords attribute  is a value of \u201c0,0,30,30\u201d setting up coordinates for display of content associated with the area object . The attribute value of the href attribute  is a value of \u201creference.html\u201d which identifies a file name associated with the content for the href attribute . The attribute value of the alt attribute  is a value of \u201creference.\u201d For ease of illustration, only the value of the alt attribute  is illustrated within . An attribute value  stores the value of the alt attribute . When the user places a cursor associated with the input device  and the display  over the area object , the text of \u201creference\u201d may be displayed within a pop up dialog.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["300","300","204"]},"For purposes of the present example, it is assumed that a button was present on the web page and was clicked by the user and that this button was associated with an element represented within the document object model .
