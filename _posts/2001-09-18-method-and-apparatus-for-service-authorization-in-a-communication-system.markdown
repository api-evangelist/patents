title: Method and apparatus for service authorization in a communication system
abstract: Methods and apparatus for authorizing an access terminal (AT) requesting a service provided by an entity in an access network are disclosed. After being authorized for a communication session with the access network, the AT addresses an inquiry to a domain name server (DNS) for a contact of a service selector (SS) administering the desired service. A controller in the access network (BSC/PCF) routs the inquiry to and returns a response from the DNS. The AT then addresses a service query containing the AT's capabilities to the SS. The BSC/PCF directs attributes allowing the SS to authorize the service. Upon the SS's acknowledgement of the attributes, the BSC/PCF forwards to the SS the service query. Upon authorization, the SS notifies the BSC/PCF, and if the AT is authorized, selects in accordance with the AT's capabilities an appropriate service provider (SP) to provide the service.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Definitions","Description"],"p":["1. Field","The present invention relates generally to communication systems, and more specifically to a method and an apparatus for service authorization in a communication system.","2. Background","Communication systems have been developed to allow transmission of information signals from an origination station to a physically distinct destination station. In transmitting information signal from the origination station over a communication channel, the information signal is first converted into a form suitable for efficient transmission over the communication channel. Conversion, or modulation, of the information signal involves varying a parameter of a carrier wave in accordance with the information signal in such a way that the spectrum of the resulting modulated carrier is confined within the communication channel bandwidth. At the destination station the original information signal is replicated from the modulated carrier wave received over the communication channel. Such a replication is generally achieved by using an inverse of the modulation process employed by the origination station.","Modulation also facilitates multiple-access, i.e., simultaneous transmission and\/or reception, of several signals over a common communication channel. Multiple-access communication systems often include a plurality of remote subscriber units requiring intermittent service of relatively short duration rather than continuous access to the common communication channel. Several multiple-access techniques are known in the art, such as time division multiple-access (TDMA), frequency division multiple-access (FDMA), and amplitude modulation multiple-access (AM). Another type of a multiple-access technique is a code division multiple-access (CDMA) spread spectrum system that conforms to the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for DualMode Wide-Band Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d hereinafter referred to as the IS-95 standard. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple-access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE-ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS,\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d both assigned to the assignee of the present invention.","A multiple-access communication system may be a wireless or wire-line and may carry voice and\/or data. An example of a communication system carrying both voice and data is a system in accordance with the IS-95 standard, which specifies transmitting voice and data over the communication channel. A method for transmitting data in code channel frames of fixed size is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,773, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE FORMATTING OF DATA FOR TRANSMISSION\u201d, assigned to the assignee of the present invention. In accordance with the IS-95 standard, the data or voice is partitioned into code channel frames that are 20 milliseconds wide with data rates as high as 14.4 Kbps. Additional examples of a communication systems carrying both voice and data comprise communication systems conforming to the \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project\u201d (3GPP), embodied in a set of documents including Document Nos. 3G TS 25.211, 3G TS 25.212, 3G TS 25.213, and 3G TS 25.214 (the W-CDMA standard), or \u201cTR-45.5 Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems\u201d (the IS-2000 standard).","In a multiple-access communication system, communications between users are conducted through one or more base stations. A first user on one subscriber station communicates to a second user on a second subscriber station by transmitting data on a reverse link to a base station. The base station receives the data and can route the data to another base station. The data is transmitted on a forward link of the same base station, or the other base station, to the second subscriber station. The forward link refers to transmission from a base station to a subscriber station and the reverse link refers to transmission from a subscriber station to a base station. Likewise, the communication can be conducted between a first user on one mobile subscriber station and a second user on a landline station. A base station receives the data from the user on a reverse link, and routes the data through a public switched telephone network (PSTN) to the second user. In many communication systems, e.g., IS-95, W-CDMA, IS-2000, the forward link and the reverse link are allocated separate frequencies.","An example of a data only communication system is a high data rate (HDR) communication system that conforms to the TIA\/EIA\/IS-856 industry standard, hereinafter referred to as the IS-856 standard. This HDR system is based on a communication system disclosed in co-pending application Ser. No. 08\/963,386, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGH RATE PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION,\u201d filed Nov. 3, 1997, assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The HDR communication system defines a set of data rates, ranging from 38.4 kbps to 2.4 Mbps, at which an access point (AP) may send data to a subscriber station (access terminal, AT). Because the AP is analogous to a base station, the terminology with respect to cells and sectors is the same as with respect to voice systems.","With the development and increasing sophistication of communications systems, the communications systems offer not only those services for which the communications systems were primarily designed, e.g., voice or data, but also additional services, e.g., position location, broadcast services, group services, and other services known to one of ordinary skills in the art. Addition of such services into existing communications systems poses several challenges. For example, an access network must determine whether an access terminal is authorized to receive requested service. The authorization process should be independent of a particular service because different carriers may choose to implement different services, and adding or removing a service should not require change (hardware or software) to the service independent part of the access network. Furthermore, the service authorization should account for a mobility of the access terminals.","There is, therefore, a need in the art for a method and an apparatus for service authorization in a communication system that can be used for authorization of any service that the access network provides to the access terminal with no changes to the service independent part of the access network.","In one aspect of the invention, the above-stated needs are addressed by receiving at a controller a service query addressed to a service selector; providing from the controller a set of parameters to the service selector in accordance with said service query; and authorizing at the service selector said service in accordance with said set of parameters.","In another aspect of the invention, the above-stated needs are addressed by determining at the subscriber station an address of the service selector, which administers the desired service and transmitting a service query to the controller addressed to the service selector.","In another aspect of the invention, when the service selector authorizes the service, the service selector selects in accordance with the service query received from the controller a service provider capable of providing the service.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used exclusively herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.","The terms broadcast communication or point-to-multipoint communication are used herein to mean a communication wherein a plurality of subscriber stations are receiving communication from one source.","The terms group service or point-to-multipoint communication are used herein to mean a communication wherein a plurality of subscriber stations are receiving communication from generally one subscriber station.","The term packet is used exclusively herein to mean a group of bits, including data (payload) and control elements, arranged into a specific format. The control elements comprise, e.g., a preamble, a quality metric, and others known to one skilled in the art. Quality metric comprises, e.g., a cyclical redundancy check (CRC), a parity bit, and others known to one skilled in the art.","The term access network is used exclusively herein to mean a collection of access points (AP) and one or more access point controllers. The access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals (AT). The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks.","The term base station, referred to herein as an AP in the case of an HDR communication system, is used exclusively herein to mean the hardware with which subscriber stations communicate. Cell refers to the hardware or a geographic coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used. A sector is a partition of a cell. Because a sector has the attributes of a cell, the teachings described in terms of cells are readily extended to sectors.","The term subscriber station, referred to herein as an AT in the case of an HDR communication system, is used exclusively herein to mean the hardware with which an access network communicates. An AT may be mobile or stationary. An AT may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An AT may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. An AT that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with an AP is said to be in a connection setup state. An AT that has established an active traffic channel connection with an AP is called an active AT, and is said to be in a traffic state.","The term communication channel\/link is used exclusively herein to mean a single route over which a signal is transmitted described in terms of modulation characteristics and coding, or a single route within the protocol layers of either the AP or the AT.","The term reverse channel\/link is used exclusively herein to mean a communication channel\/link through which the AT sends signals to the AP.","A forward channel\/link is used exclusively herein to mean a communication channel\/link through which an AP sends signals to an AT.","The term network access identifier is used exclusively here to mean The Network Access Identifier (NAI) which is the AT's identifier submitted by the AT during a point-to-point (PPP) authentication. In roaming, the purpose of the NAI is to identify the AT as well as to assist in the routing of the authentication request.","The term soft hand-off is used exclusively herein to mean a communication between a subscriber station and two or more sectors, wherein each sector belongs to a different cell. In the context of IS-95 standard, the reverse link communication is received by both sectors, and the forward link communication is simultaneously carried on the two or more sectors' forward links. In the context of the IS-856 standard, data transmission on the forward link is non-simultaneously carried out between one of the two or more sectors and the AT.","The term softer hand-off is used exclusively herein to mean a communication between a subscriber station and two or more sectors, wherein each sector belongs to the same cell. In the context of the IS-95 standard, the reverse link communication is received by both sectors, and the forward link communication is simultaneously carried on one of the two or more sectors' forward links. In the context of the IS-856 standard, data transmission on the forward link is non-simultaneously carried out between one of the two or more sectors and the AT.","The term re-pointing is used exclusively herein to mean a selection of a sector that is a member of an ATs' active list, wherein the sector is different than a currently selected sector.","The term soft\/softer hand-off delay is used exclusively herein to indicate the minimum interruption in service that a subscriber station would experience following a handoff to another sector. Soft\/Softer handoff delay is determined based on whether the sector, (currently not serving the subscriber station), (non-serving sector) to which the subscriber station is re-pointing is part of the same cell as the current serving sector. If the non-serving sector is in the same cell as the serving sector then the softer handoff delay is used, and if the non-serving sector is in a cell different from the one that the serving sector is part of then the soft-handoff delay is used.","The term erasure is used exclusively herein to mean failure to recognize a message.","The term outage is used exclusively herein to mean a time interval during which the likelihood that a subscriber station will receive service is reduced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00035","num":"00035"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["112","102","102","104","106","106","108","110","108","110"]},"The AP , e.g., AP () in whose coverage area an Access Terminal (AT) , e.g., AT () for which the packets are destined transmits the packets over a wireless link to the AT (). In accordance with one embodiment, data transmission on the forward link occurs from one AP to one AT at or near the maximum data rate that can be supported by the forward link and the communication system. Other channels of the forward link, e.g., control channel, may be transmitted from multiple APs to one AT. Reverse link data communication may occur from one AT to one or more APs. Although only five AT's and two APs are shown in , one of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that this is for tutorial purposes only, and the communication system can comprise plurality of AT's and AP's. Additionally, one of ordinary skills in the art understands that the choice of an HDR communications system for explanation of concepts of the present invention is for tutorial purposes and will be able to extend the disclosed concepts to other communications systems.","Initially, the AT () and the AP (), establish a communication link using a predetermined access procedure. In accordance with one embodiment, the access procedure is carried out in accordance with the IS-856 standard. In this connected state, the AT () is able to receive data and control messages from the AP () over a forward link , and is able to transmit data and control messages to the AP () over a reverse link . Once the communication link between the AT () and the AP () is established, a communication session between the AT () and the BSC\/PCF () can be established, and the AT () can receive services from the access network. The information flow between various entities in the communication system of  subsequent to establishing a communication link between the AT () and the AP () is illustrated in FIG. . Because the function of the AP () is to maintain the communications link and serve as a conduit of information between the AT () and the BSC\/PCF (), the AP () is not shown in FIG. . However, one of ordinary skills in the art understands that all information flow between the AT () and the BSC\/PCF () passes through the AP ().","Before any AT may receive any services from the access network, the access network must first be satisfied that the AT requesting the service is allowed to use the access network. In accordance with one embodiment, the authorization is carried out by an Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA). Once the AAA authorizes the AT for the communication link use, services provided by the access network are authenticated by service selectors (SS) that use the attributes contained in the AAA to verify that the AT requesting the service is authorized to use the service. If the SS verifies that the AT is authorized to receive the service, the SS selects one service provider (SP) to provide the service. The service provider is selected in accordance with the AT capabilities. Each individual service is authorized by a distinct SS and provided by at least one SP. To facilitate a communication between the AAA server, the SS, and the SP, an AAA , an SS , and an SP server  are coupled to a corresponding BSC\/PCF  via an Intranet . As illustrated in , only one service is offered by each BSC\/PCF . One of ordinary skills in the art recognizes that this is for tutorial purposes only. The method of authorization is illustrated in details in FIG. .","As illustrated in , the AT () and the BSC\/PCF () establish a communication session  using a predetermined access procedure. In one embodiment, the access procedure is carried out in accordance with the IS-856 standard. The AT () and the BSC\/PCF () each establish a link layer session, e.g., a point-to-point (PPP) session, and the BSC\/PCF () assigns the AT () an Internet protocol address (IP_AT),which is valid until the AT () moves to an area served by another BSC\/PCF. The BSC\/PCF () further provides the AT () with an Internet protocol address of a local dynamic name server (DNS) (). One of ordinary skills in the art recognizes that a link layer protocol different from PPP, e.g., SLIP, or other link layer protocol known to one skilled in the art can be utilized without departing from the scope of the present invention. The AT () then sends the BSC\/PCF () a network address identifier (AT_NAI). The AT_NAI is unique for each AT.","As discussed above, the AAA () must authorize the AT () for the communication session . Consequently, once the BSC\/PCF () receives the AT_NAI, the BSC\/PCF () sends an authentication request  to the AAA server () using a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) protocol. One of ordinary skills in the art recognized that other protocols known in the art, e.g., DIAMETER or other protocols known to one skilled in the art can be utilized without departing from the scope of the present invention. In one embodiment, the authorization utilizes a challenge handshake authorization Protocol (CHAP). When the AT () requests the communication session , the AAA () generates a random number, and communicates the random number (sends a \u201cchallenge\u201d message) to the AT (). Both the AT () and the AAA () use the random number as an input into a method (a one-way hash function) yielding a number. The AT () then communicates the number (sends a \u201cresponse\u201d message) to the AAA (). If the number received from the AT () matches the number calculated at the AAA (), the AAA () authorizes the communication session , otherwise the connection should be terminated. Further details about CHAP are disclosed in a request for comment (RFC) No. 1994. The AAA () returns authorization  for the communication session  together with required RADIUS attributes of the AT (). Such required attributes comprise attributes for authorization of additional services. It the AAA () indicates to the BSC\/PCF () that the AT () is authorized to use the communication link resources, the AT () is able to receive data and control messages from the BSC\/PCF (), and is able to transmit data and control messages to the BSC\/PCF (). The BSC\/PCF () stores the received RADIUS attributes of the AT ().","When the AT () desires to utilize an additional service, e.g., a position location service, the AT () generates a dynamic name server (DNS) () query  for a local service by supplying a non-fully qualified name for the local service (e.g., local_ServiceSelector) to the BSC\/PCF (). The term non-fully qualified name is used herein to mean a name that does not include the domain name. For example, a name \u201cLocalServer.company.com\u201d is a fully qualified name, but a name \u201cLocalServer\u201d is a non-qualified name. The BSC\/PCF () receives the query  and generates a query  to the DNS (). The DNS () responds by providing an Internet protocol address of the requested SS () (IP_ServiceSelector) to the BSC\/PCF (), which forwards the response to the AT ().","Once the AT () receives the IP_ServiceSelector of the SS (), the AT () can request the service by generating and sending a service query  addressed to the SS (). The service query is a structure comprising a source address, i.e., the AT () IP_AT, the destination address, i.e., the IP_ServiceSelector of SS (), and capabilities of the AT () necessary for determining which service to is to be provided. Such capabilities comprise, e.g., grade of service, radio configuration\/technology, and other capabilities known to one of ordinary skills in the art.","The BSC\/PCF () receives the service query  and determines whether the AT () with the IP_AT, is attempting to contact the SS () with the IP_ServiceSelector for the first time.","If the determination is positive, the BSC\/PCF () generates a message , which includes IP_AT, AT_NAI, and RADIUS attributes of the AT () and sends the message  to the SS (). The SS () monitors a pre-determined transfer control protocol (TCP) or user datagram protocol (UDP) for the message  and when the message  is correctly received, sends an acknowledgement  back to the BSC\/PCF (). The BSC\/PCF () then forwards the service query  that was sent to the BSC\/PCF () by the AT as a query  to the SS (). The SS () then performs service authorization in accordance with the RADIUS attributes. The SS () sends a response  back to the BSC\/PCF () in accordance with the result of authorization. If the service is authorized, the SS () selects a service provider in accordance with the AT () capabilities. For example if the AT () is a terminal in accordance with the IS-856 standard, a service provider capable of supporting services for such a terminal, e.g., service provider () will be selected. The SS () then forwards a message  comprising the IP_ATtogether with relevant RADIUS attributes of the AT () to the service provider (). The service provider () examines the RADIUS attributes and determines what grade of service should be provided to the AT (). Examples of a grade of service for location service are accuracy of position, rate of update, and other grades of service known to one of ordinary skills in the art. The AT () and the service provider () then exchange the requested service related information (A), (B) via the BSC\/PCF ().","If the BSC\/PCF () determines that the AT () with the IP_AThas already contacted the entity with the IP_ServiceSelector, there is no reason to re-send the message  comprising IP_AT, AT_NAI, and RADIUS attributes of the AT () to the SS (). Consequently, the BSC\/PCF () forwards the service query  that was sent to the BSC\/PCF () by the AT () as query  to the SS (). The information flow then proceeds as described above after the query  has been sent.","As illustrated by the broken line arrow in , while receiving requested services from BSC\/PCF (), the AT () moved form a coverage area of the AT () to a coverage area of an AT (), which is connected to a BSC\/PCF (). To enable the AT () to continue reception of services, first the communication link is transferred from the AP () to the AP (), which results in the communication session being transferred form the BSC\/PCF () to the BSC\/PCF (). The communication link transfer is disclosed in co-pending application Ser. No. 09\/892,378, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SELECTING A SERVING SECTOR IN A DATA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM,\u201d filed Jun. 26, 2001 and co-pending application Ser. No. 09\/915,736, entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ADAPTIVE SERVER SELECTION IN A DATA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, filed Jul. 26, 2001, both assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Then, a new link layer session, (e.g., the PPP session) is established between the AT () and the BSC\/PCF (), which results in an assignment of a new IP address (IP_AT) to the AT () by the BSC\/PCF (). This IP_ATis in general different from the IP_AT. To ensure additional service continuity, the SS () must be notified about the new binding between the IP_ATaddress and AT_NAI.","In one embodiment, the new binding is achieved by repeating the process of authorization as described in FIG. . However, because such approach is wasteful on both computational resources and signaling load, a binding notification in accordance with another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in FIG. .","As illustrated in , after the AT () has established a communication session with the BSC\/PCF () and requested and received an address for a local ServiceSelector (IP_ServiceSelector), i.e., the SS (), the AT () generates a No-Op message  addressed to the SS (). The No-Op message  has the same structure as a service query, comprising a source address, i.e., the AT () IP_AT, and a destination address, i.e., the IP_ServiceSelector of SS (), but the field reserved for the AT's () capabilities necessary for determining which service is to be provided is empty.","As described, the BSC\/PCF examines only a source and destination address of a request addressed form an AT to a SS; therefore, from the BSC\/PCF () perspective, there is no difference between a service query and a No-Op message. Consequently, the BSC\/PCF () examines the service query\/No-Op message  and determines that the AT () with the IP_ATis attempting to contact the SS () with the IP_ServiceSelector for the first time. Therefore, the BSC\/PCF () sends a message  comprising the IP_AT, AT_NAI, and RADIUS Attributes to the SS (). The SS () monitors a predetermined transfer control protocol (TCP) or (UDP) for the message  and when the message  is correctly received, updates the old bindings between the IP_AT, AT_NAI, and RADIUS attributes to the new bindings between the IP_AT, AT_NAI, and RADIUS attributes, and sends an acknowledgement . The BSC\/PCF () then forwards the service query\/No-Op message  that was sent to the BSC\/PCF () by the AT () as service query\/No-Op message  to the SS (). The SS () sends a response  back to the BSC\/PCF (), and forwards a message  comprising the IP_ATof the AT () together with relevant RADIUS attributes to a service provider (). Because the service query\/No-Op message  does not contain the AT () capabilities, it appears that the exchange - is unnecessary because no information is communicated by forwarding the service query\/No-Op message . Recall, however, that adding or removing a service should not require change (hardware or software) to the service independent part of the access network. Consequently, such an arrangement does not require a modification of BSC\/PCF () because the BSC\/PCF does not need to distinguish between a service query and a No-Op message.","If a modification of BSC\/PCF is acceptable, in another embodiment, upon receiving the service query\/No-Op message  addressed to the SS (), the BSC\/PCF () examines not only whether the AT () with the IP_ATis attempting to contact the SS () with the IP_ServiceSelector for the first time, but also whether the service query\/No-Op message  is a No-Op message. If the service query\/No-Op message  is not a No-Op message, the information flow continues as described above. If the service query\/No-Op message  is a No-Op message, the BSC\/PCF () does not forward the No-Op message  that was sent to the BSC\/PCF () by the AT () as service query\/No-Op message  to the SS () after successful receipt of the acknowledgement .","The service provider () examines the attributes and determines what grade of service should be provided to the AT (). The AT () and the service provider () then exchange the requested service related information (A), (B) via the BSC\/PCF ().","One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes, that whether the SS () performs service authorization in accordance with the RADIUS attributes after receiving the No-Op message  depends on an implementation of the SS (). Consequently, if the SS () remembers that an AT with AT_NAI was already authorized, no further authorization is necessary, and the response  indicates that the AT is authorized. Otherwise, the SS () performs service authorization and sends a response  back to the BSC\/PCF () in accordance with the result of authorization.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that although the various embodiments were described in terms of flowcharts and methods, such was done for pedagogical purposes only. The methods can be performed by an apparatus, which in one embodiment comprises a processor interfaced with a transmitter and a receiver or other appropriate blocks at the AT and\/or AP.","Those of skill in the art would understand that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques. For example, data, instructions, commands, information, signals, bits, symbols, and chips that may be referenced throughout the above description may be represented by voltages, currents, electromagnetic waves, magnetic fields or particles, optical fields or particles, or any combination thereof.","Those of skill would further appreciate that the various illustrative logical blocks, modules, circuits, and algorithm steps described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented as electronic hardware, computer software, or combinations of both.
