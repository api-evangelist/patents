{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application relates to a mobile telecommunications network including a core and a radio access network having a device for wireless communication with mobile terminals registered with the network.","Recently, a dramatic rise in sales of both smart-phones and laptop data cards has resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of data communications passing through mobile telecommunications networks. This volumetric increase can also be attributed to enhancements made to the capabilities of the networks. In fact it has been reported that mobile data growth grew 30 percent over the course of the second quarter of 2009. The most popular use for mobile data was HTTP browsing, although usage of HTTP streaming is growing considerably. Other mobile data uses include HTTP downloading and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) activities such as file sharing.","This ability to use the cellular networks for mobile data services, such as Internet browsing is resulting in subscribers treating their mobile networks in much the same way as they treat their fixed networks. That is, users are tending to expect the same service from the Internet, irrespective of their access method. However, mobile networks have a more restricted capacity and are more costly to operate, as compared to fixed networks.","In this regard, from the network operator's viewpoint, as the mobile broadband traffic volume carried over 2G, 3G and HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) networks continues to grow, the cost of supporting this data volume is becoming more and more expensive based on the current network architecture and deployments. In fact, access and data volumes are likely to rise faster than the revenue used to build and maintain the networks. This cost differential is exacerbated by one of the current business models being utilised, whereby operators charge a flat rate for unlimited amounts of data.","The increased usage is also unfortunately likely to result in an increase of data traffic jams, and hence a degradation of service for mobile users if not properly managed.","It has been proposed to control data-heavy users by \u201cchoking\u201d the bandwidth available to them when a maximum data volume limit is exceeded. Whilst this addresses the problem on an individual level, it does not address the network capacity problem as a whole.","It is therefore apparent that mobile broadband is at a crossroads as networks and business models are strained by bandwidth demand that is unmatched by revenue generation.","These problems will only get worse with moves to position mobile data as a replacement for fixed DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) access and with the advent of higher radio access speeds with the proposed 4G LTE\/SAE (Long Term Evolution\/System Architecture Evolution) network. A large percentage of this traffic will consist of data which is destined for the public Internet, a significant proportion of which mobile operators will not be able to add value to, despite carrying the data on their own backhaul transport, core transport or cellular core infrastructure.","In addition to the problems discussed above, conventional mobile telephone communications networks have architectures that are hierarchical and expensive to scale. Many of the network elements, such as the BTS, routers, BSC\/RNC etc are proprietary: devices of one manufacturer often do not interface with devices from another manufacturer. This makes it difficult to introduce new capabilities into the network as a different interface will be required for devices from each manufacturer. Further, conventional base stations are not capable of intelligent local routing or processing. Furthermore, the capacity of existing networks is not always used effectively. For example, many cell sites are under used, whilst others are heavily used.","The current network architecture has the following disadvantages:\n\n","There is therefore a need to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the problems of the prior art. In particular there is a need to address the needs of both the network operators and the users in improving the provision of mobile broadband data services.","In one aspect, the system described herein provides a mobile telecommunications network including a plurality of terminals, a core and a radio access network having a radio device for providing wireless communication resources to the terminals, and further including a processing device for recording information indicative of a movement cycle of one of the terminals through the radio access network and for identifying points within the movement cycle at which there are spare communication resources to provide a list of spare resource points to the terminal to enable the prediction of optimal data transfer points during a subsequent movement cycle of the terminal through the radio access network.","The spare resource points and the optimal data transfer points may include a location element and\/or a time element, and may include both a location element and a time element.","The movement cycle may be a pattern movement that is likely to be repeated. For example, the movement cycle may be the movement of a user's device during a 24 hour period. Often a user (and their mobile device) visit the same locations at the same time on several days of the week. For example, on working days a user (and their device) will be located at the user's home during the night, and will commute to work on the same route and at the same time to and from work, and will be located at the user's workplace during the same hours. Movement patterns for the user may be examined over a longer period for the movement cycle to be established. Once a movement cycle is established, then during subsequent movement cycles of the user optimal data transfer point can be predicted.","The radio access network may include a controller (such as platforms described in the embodiments below) that are operable to control the use of network resources by the terminals, and to measure actual spare resource at the current point within the subsequent movement cycle of the terminal and to provide this measurement to the processing device to enable the processing device to determine whether to approve data transfer. The list of spare resource points provided to the terminal enables a prediction of optimal data transfer points in a subsequent movement cycle to be made. However, even if the point of the terminal in the subsequent movement cycle matches the point in the recorded movement cycle (in time and location), the radio conditions may not be the same\u2014for example, because many other users are occupying the cell occupied by the terminal, resulting in increased interference. By measuring the actual spare resource at the current point, it can be confirmed that the predicted optimal data transfer point is indeed optimal.","Spare communication resources may be available in a cell which is subject to a low load. Spare communication resources may be available in a cell which has a particularly high data capacity or which is in particularly advantageous environmental conditions (for example, without obstructions to radio waves). The embodiment, to be described below, refers to a \u201ccost to carry\u201d data. In a particular cell, the greater the spare communication resource is, the lower the \u201ccost to carry\u201d data. Likewise, in a cell, the greater the load on the cell, the higher the \u201ccost to carry\u201d data. Cells may be characterised as low \u201ccost to carry\u201d and not low \u201ccost to carry\u201d (i.e. higher \u201ccost to carry\u201d).","The list of spare resource points may be processed by a client on the terminal, and the client may be operable to compare the current point in the subsequent movement cycle of the terminal to the points on the list to identify whether optimal data transfer is likely to be available at the current point. For example, if the current point in the subsequent movement cycle is the same as a point on the list (i.e. if the current point on the list matches time and location, for example), the spare resources points on the list can be used to identify whether optimal data transfer is likely to be available at the current point. This represents a prediction of the operable data transfer.","The client may be operable to identify whether a request for data transfer is a low priority request and, for such a low priority request, only allowing the data transfer if the current point in the subsequent movement cycle is predicted to be an optimal data transfer point. The identification of a low priority request may be by any suitable mechanism. In the embodiment to be described below, a low priority request is identified by a flag from the application that originates the request. However, other mechanisms may also be possible, such as determining the identity of the application from which the request originated. By only allowing the data transfer if the current point in the subsequent movement cycle is predicted to be an optimal data transfer point, data transfer for low priority data requests are only performed when it is predicted that radio conditions are optimal. This is highly advantageous, so that in cells subject to high load, a low priority data request will not compete with higher priority services. This advantageously may have the affect of spreading the load across the network. For data transfer requests that are not identified as low priority requests, the client may arrange for these requests to be performed immediately in the conventional manner. That is, these requests will be performed even if the mobile terminal is in a cell that is predicted to be in a high load state. In this way, high priority data transfers can be performed without delay.","The list of spare resource points may be processed by the client in response to a request for data transfer by an application hosted on the terminal. For example, such an application may request the download of data that is indicated to be low priority. The client then processes the list to determine whether the current point in the subsequent movement cycle is predicted to be an optimal data transfer point or not. If the request for data transfer from the application is a low priority request, data transfer is only allowed by the client if it is predicted that the current point in the subsequent movement cycle is an optimal transfer point. However, it should be noted that even if the client allows this data transfer, in the embodiment to be described, data transfer is only performed for such low priority data if the measurement of the actual spare resource at the current point within the subsequent movement cycle confirms that the actual spare resource in the relevant cell is above a threshold value (or, likewise, that the load of the relevant cell is below a threshold value).","The processing device may be operable to record communication activity of the terminal within the movement cycle, and to predicted at what point communication activity will occur in the subsequent movement cycle and to instruct the client to request data transfer to perform the communication activity at a predicted or optimal point within the subsequent movement cycle. For example, when generating the list of spare resource points, this list may also include the points at which communication activity occurs. Often there is a patent to communication activity throughout a movement cycle. For example, a user may access particular websites at a particular time of day. In an example to be described in the embodiment, the user accesses an on-line newspaper at a particular time each day. Advantageously, the communication activity is recorded and can be used to predict that the user is likely to download the on-line news paper at the same time in a subsequent movement cycle. The client can then be instructed to request the download of the on-line news paper at an optimal point within the subsequent movement cycle. For example, if the user request download of the on-line newspaper at 7 am everyday, this may in fact be at a point within the movement cycle when the user in the cell of high congestion\u2014such as at a busy railway station. The client may analyse the list to determine optimal data transfer points before 7 am (at which the user typically accesses the on-line newspaper). The client may determine that optimal data transfer points exist between 2.30 am and 6.30 am, and may automatically request download of the on-line newspaper at such a point. In this way, the user is provided with the on-line newspaper on request and when in a cell subject to high load but without consuming any communication resources in that cell.","The network may include data transfer device operable to adjust the content of the data for transfer, for example, in dependence upon the actual spare resource. For example, the content of the data may be adjusted in dependence upon the bandwidth available.","The system described herein is particularly advantageous for the efficient transfer of low priority data, such as \u201cbackground\u201d data. Such data may be data that a user routinely accesses. Also, such data may allow files to be backed up from the user's mobile terminal. The system described herein is relevant to low downloading and uploading data.","The radio access network may include a plurality of radio access technologies such as 2G, 2.5G, 3G, 4G, femto cells and WiFi.","In another aspect, the system described herein further provides a mobile telecommunications network including a plurality of terminals, a core, a transmission network and a radio access network having a radio device for providing wireless communication resources to the terminals, and further including a processing device for recording information indicative of a movement cycle of one of the terminals through the radio access network and for identifying points within the movement cycle at which there are spare communication resources to provide a list of spare resource points to the terminal to enable the prediction of optimal data transfer points during a subsequent movement cycle of the terminal through the radio access network. The transmission network may be a backhaul connection between the radio access network and the core.","In other aspects, the system described herein also provides a telecommunications method for performing steps of the system described herein and a non-transitory computer readable medium storing software with executable code for carrying out the steps of the system described herein.","In the drawings like elements are generally designated by the same reference numerals.","Certain elements of a 3G mobile telecommunications network, and its operation, will now briefly be described with reference to .","Each base station (e.g. Node B  and Femto ) corresponds to a respective cell of the cellular or mobile telecommunications network and receives calls from and transmits calls to a mobile terminal (not shown) in that cell by wireless radio communication in one or both of the circuit switched or packet switched domains. The mobile terminal may be any portable telecommunications device, including a handheld mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop computer equipped with a network access datacard.","The nodeB  or Femto  can be considered to comprise two main parts: a radio frequency part and a baseband part. The radio frequency part handles the transmission of radio frequency signals between the antenna of the nodeB  or Femto  and the mobile terminal, and for converting radio frequency signals into digital baseband signals (and vice versa). The baseband part is responsible for controlling and managing the transmission of the baseband signals to other components of the mobile telecommunications network.","In a macro 3G network, the Radio Access Network (RAN) comprises Node Bs and Radio Network Controllers (RNCs). The Node B is the function within the 3G network that provides the physical and transport radio link between the mobile terminal (User Equipment, UE) and the network. The Node B performs the transmission and reception of data wirelessly across the radio interface, and also applies the codes that are necessary to describe channels in a CDMA system. The RNC is responsible for control the Node Bs that are connected to it. The RNC performs Radio Resource Management (RRM), some of the mobility management functions and is the point where encryption is done before user data is sent to and from a mobile terminal. The RNC connects to the Circuit Switched Core Network through a Media Gateway (MGW) and to an SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node)  in the Packet Switched Core Network. In , Node B  is controlled by RNC  across the Iub interface. An RNC may control more than one node B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","2","4"]},"The radio link between the Femto  and the mobile terminal uses the same cellular telecommunication transport protocols as Node B  but with a smaller range\u2014for example 25 m. The Femto  appears to the mobile terminal as a conventional base station, so no modification to the mobile terminal is required for it to operate with the Femto . The Femto  performs a role corresponding to that of Node B  in the macro 3G RAN.","The Femto  would typically be configured to serve a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) located in a home or office, in addition to GSM\/UMTS\/LTE networks. The WLAN could belong to the subscriber of the mobile terminal, or be an independently operated WLAN. The owner of Femto  can prescribe whether it is open or closed, whereby an open AP is able to carry communications from any mobile device in the GSM\/UMTS\/LTE network, and a closed AP is only able to carry communications from specific pre-assigned mobile devices.","Conventionally, in a 3G network (macro or Femto), the RANs are controlled by a mobile switching centre (MSC) and an SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node)  of the core network. The MSC supports communications in the circuit switched domain, whilst the SGSN  supports communications in the packet switched domain\u2014such as GPRS data transmissions. The SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the mobile terminals within its geographical service area. It performs packet routing and transfer, mobility management (attach\/detach and location management), logical link management, and authentication and charging functions. A location register of the SGSN stores location information (e.g., current cell, current VLR) and user profiles (e.g., IMSI, address(es) used in the packet data network) of all mobile terminals registered with this SGSN. In , since the embodiment is concerned with data transmission, only the SGSN is illustrated as being in communication with RNC  and AGW , across the Iu interface. The RNC  typically has a dedicated (not shared) connection to its SGSN , such as a cable connection.","Communications between the AGW  and the SGSN  may be IP based communications, and may be, for example, transmitted over a broadband IP network. Further, the connection between the Femto and the AGW  may use the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network). Typically a DSL cable connects the AGW to the PSTN, and data is transmitted there-between by IP transport\/DSL transport. The Femto or AGW converts the cellular telecommunications transport protocols used between the mobile terminal and the Femto  to the appropriate IP based signalling.","The femto  may be connected to the AGW by other than a DSL cable and the PSTN network. For example, the femto  may be connected to the AGW by a dedicated cable connection that is independent of the PSTN, or by a satellite connection.","The SGSN  is in communication with the GGSN  (Gateway GPRS Support Node) across the Gn interface. The GGSN is responsible for the interworking between the GPRS network and external packet switched networks, e.g. the Internet. The GGSN enables the mobility of mobile terminals in the networks. It maintains routing necessary to tunnel the Protocol Data Units (PDUs) to the SGSN that service a particular mobile terminal. The GGSN converts the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN into the appropriate packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or X.25) and sends them out on the corresponding packet data network. In the other direction, PDP addresses of incoming data packets are converted to the mobile network address of the destination user. The readdressed packets are sent to the responsible SGSN. For this purpose, the GGSN stores the current SGSN address of the user and their profile in its location register. The GGSN is responsible for IF address assignment and is the default router for the connected mobile terminal. The GGSN also performs authentication and charging functions. Other functions include IP Pool management and address mapping, QoS and PDP context enforcement.","In turn the GGSN  may route data via any applicable Value Added Service (VAS) equipment , before data is forwarded towards its intended destination via the Internet . As an example of the functionality of the VAS equipment, the traffic may be inspected for adult content before reaching the end-user if this user is under 18 years of age.","For billing purposes in particular, a PCRF (Policy and Charging Rules Function) apparatus  is also provided, in communication with both the SGSN  and the GGSN .","The SGSN , GGSN , VAS  and PCRF apparatus  comprise the core network of the mobile telecommunications network.","Mobile telecommunications networks have an active state of communication with their mobile terminals and an inactive\/idle state of communication with their terminals. When in the active state, as the mobile terminals move between different cells of the network, the communication session is maintained by performing a \u201chandover\u201d operation between the cells. In the inactive\/idle state, as a mobile terminal moves between different cells of the network the mobile terminal performs \u201ccell reselection\u201d to select the most appropriate cell on which to \u201ccamp\u201d in order that the mobile terminal can be paged by the network when mobile terminating data is destined for that mobile terminal.","Conventionally, the mobile terminal or network determines whether a handover\/cell reselection procedure should be triggered in dependence upon measurements of the radio signals of the cells in the region of the mobile terminal. A filter is applied to the signals (either by the network or by the mobile terminal) which calculates an average (e.g. arithmetical mean) value of these signals over a particular time period. This filtered\/average values of the cells are then compared with each other or with a threshold value. In dependence upon these comparisons, cell reselection\/handover related procedures are triggered. This cell reselection\/handover process generally comprises taking radio signal measurements of neighbouring cells and comparing these to each other and to the radio signal of the current cell to determine which cell provides the best signal strength\/quality. Handover\/reselection to the best cell can then occur.","Generally calculations to determine whether to perform a handover from one base station to another base station are performed by the network, whereas calculations whether to perform cell reselection are performed by the mobile terminal.","Data in a mobile telecommunications network can be considered to be separated into \u201ccontrol plane\u201d and \u201cuser plane\u201d. The control plane performs the required signalling, and includes the relevant application protocol and signalling bearer, for transporting the application protocol messages. Among other things, the application protocol is used for setting up the radio access bearer and the radio network layer. The user plane transmits data traffic and includes data streams and data bearers for the data streams. The data streams are characterised by one or more frame protocols specific for a particular interface. Generally speaking, the user plane carries data for use by a receiving terminal\u2014such as data that allow a voice or picture to be reproduced\u2014and the control plane controls how data are transmitted.","In addition to the elements and functions described above, mobile telecommunications networks also include facilities for transmitting SMS messages. SMS messages are transmitted over the control plane only (and not the user plane).","This architecture is what currently is being used to carry all packet data to and from mobile terminals. That is, in today's implementation of the Packet data architecture, user plane traffic traverses across all the network elements shown between the Node B or Femto on which the user is camped and the internet. That is, all data is directed from the applicable RAN through the core network components SGSN, GGSN and VAS before reaching the internet. All PS traffic accordingly follows the same path and therefore has the same network costs. All applications are processed on the client (on the mobile device) or on the server (which is connected to the internet), and the network core therefore acts like a bit-pipe in the current architecture. For data, where the mobile network operator cannot add any value by carrying it on its own backhaul transport, core transport or cellular core infrastructure (the core network), such as data destined for the public internet without required intervention from the core network, there is no benefit to routing this data via the core network.","However, a large percentage of this traffic can be handled in a more intelligent manner for example through content optimisation (Video & Web), content caching, or locally routed or directly routing content to the public Internet. All these techniques reduce the investment required by a mobile operator to carry the data on its own backhaul and core transport or cellular core infrastructure.","In order to offer low cost packet data, to support new services and to manage customer expectation, a step-change reduction in the end-to-end cost per bit is required.","Mobile operators want to reduce their packet data handling costs through alternate network architectures based on commoditised IT platforms, breaking away from the traditional architecture based on their voice legacy. These new network architectures overcome the Access architecture issues of today","In order to successfully offer cheap packet data and be able to compete with the fixed broadband offers (flat fee) a solution is proposed which focuses on the reduction of the end-to-end cost per bit, especially for Internet access service.","This enables mobile operators to reduce packet data handling costs using an alternative network cost model architecture, which breaks out of the traditional network architecture and nodes and utilises lower cost transport networks to optimise the data flow.","In this regard,  shows a high level description of the architecture that may be adopted to deploy this on a 3G network.","According to this arrangement, novel \u201cplatforms\u201d , ,  for performing functions such as caching, routing, optimisation and offload\/return decision functionality are integrated into the network. This decision functionality may be incorporated in the radio architecture. In this regard, the platforms , ,  may be incorporated into the NodeBs  (), RNCs  () or exist as separate physical entities (). It is these platforms , ,  that, for example, determine the path of communications originating from the mobile terminals.","The exact placement of the platform , ,  is not essential, and, for a macro 3G network, it can be placed at or between the Node Bs and the RNCs, and also between the RNCs and the SGSNs (or any combination thereof). It would also be possible to place the platform , ,  at the GGSN (although not the SGSN as this does not control user data, only control data).","In the 3G Macro network, the aim is to offload a high percentage of the macro network traffic from the core and transport (IuPS, Gn, etc) by diverting specific traffic type for certain user(s) class directly to the Internet.","Where the platform ,  is located in the Node Bs (or on the Iub interface), it may be possible to redirect the data from all the remaining mobile network elements (e.g. the RNC, SGSN, GGSN and VAS for macro 3G), and sending the data directly to the Internet . In a similar manner, where the platform  is located at the RNC (or on the Iu interface), it becomes possible to redirect the data from the SGSN , GGSN  and the VAS . The alternative data route may be a DSL using ADSL.","It is also possible to aggregate the alternative data routes for each cell, where applicable. In this regard, each cell will have at least one RNC  and a plurality of Node Bs, so where the decision blocks are situated at or in the vicinity of the Node Bs, for instance, there will be a plurality of links which should ideally be aggregated before being passed to the Internet . At the point of this aggregation , there may be a further decision block which enables data to be returned to the legacy route. For instance, a new policy rule may have been implemented, which requires or enables previously offloaded data to be returned to the core network route. This new policy rule may be communicated to the return decision module by the core network policy module. In , this returning of data is only shown to the VAS , but the data may be returned to one or more of the other core network elements.","Each of the NodeBs  is connected to the mobile network core through a Point of Concentration (PoC) . All traffic from the NodeBs  which is to be routed through the core mobile network is routed to the PoC . This includes both user plane and control plane data. On the control plane level, the PoC  routes data to and from the SGSN  and the GGSN . Control data is also sent to and from other core network components, including the Lawful Interception Database (LI DB) , DNS Server , Policy Server  (including Charging rules and IT Network A) and Home Location Register\/Home Subscriber Server (HLR\/HSS)  (which contains subscriber and device profile and state information).","User plane data is transmitted by the PoC  to the SGSN  and the GGSN . From the GGSN , data is routed across a VAS  node to the Internet . In 3G this is the standard data path from the mobile terminals to the Internet.","To implement an advantageous feature, an alternative path on which to re-route certain data to the internet  is provided, whereby, each NodeB  and Femto  may be connected to a fixed line connection  (e.g xDSL) which is directly connected to the internet . These xDSL connections may be made directly to the NodeB and\/or Femto or made to the NodeB\/Femto via other components, such as the PoC . In , the xDSL Network  may be a third party network or may be a network owned or controlled by the owner of the mobile telecommunications network. By using such an alternative path, radio capacity, backhaul transport resource, core transport resource, cellular core network resources can be saved as well as improving performance and enhancing revenue for the mobile network operator.","As each Node B  and\/or PoC  is associated with a platform , , , for each data packet request originating from a mobile terminal, a decision at the platform , ,  is made as to whether the traffic may bypass the core mobile network entirely or may be passed into the core mobile network. The location at which the traffic is routed towards the internet may beat the platform , , ; however, it may alternatively be routed out from the core network towards the internet at a different component. Traffic offloaded from the macro network is routed by the platform  to the xDSL network  by link  (the decision to offload this traffic may have been made at platform ,  or \u2014although the decision is implemented at platform )","The Offload\/Return decision may be dependent upon the type of data or user. To exemplify this feature of the embodiment,  is a flow diagram showing the steps taken when deciding how to route the traffic in the architecture of . For instance, consider an NodeB receives a request to set up a data call from a user device which is camped on the NodeB at . Once the NodeB has identified the request as a data call and the type of traffic\/user, rather than automatically routing the data traffic to the core network, the data request is held at the NodeB at  until a decision has been made as to how to route the data, in particular whether to offload the traffic directly to the internet or whether to return the data through the core mobile network. The signalling (control plane) for the connection may continue through the normal route but the user data traffic will be held at the NodeB, this is possible by virtue of the separate user and control planes, as shown in .","The decision as to whether or not to use the Core mobile Network to route the data traffic can be based on various aspects, particularly relating to the properties of the data being routed and\/or status of the user routing the data.","The Mobile Network may add value to traffic by providing a number of services, such as compressing the user data to speed-up the data transfer while downloading (if this functionality is not already supported by the platforms , , ). These different services can be broken up into groups and provided by different entities (e.g. this enables greater flexibility in the provision of the services, such as the mandated Internet Watch Foundation\u2014IWF\u2014requirement, which can only be supported by the mobile operator). The platforms , ,  therefore make a decision on whether to service the data locally through caching, fetch the data from other node or from the internet via offload functionally or whether to route the traffic through the core network, based on the applicability of one or more of the services to the traffic. That is, platform , ,  decides when data traffic requires one or more of the services and when it can do without them.","It should also be noted that these services are ones that could be provided without using the core network. These are services that add value to the customer, and which subscribers will pay for (explicitly or implicitly).","Referring again to , the platform , ,  decides at  what to do with the traffic (from coming for the network\/internet or orientated by the device). This decision may be made by interrogating certain servers or databases stored centrally within the core network which can compare the type of service, type of user etc with criteria which identifies the type of action shall be considered, e.g whether the traffic is suitable for offloading directly to the internet (at ) from the NodeB or whether the traffic should be routed through the core (at ). Examples of some of the considerations used in influencing the decision of whether to offload the traffic are discussed below in more detail. The implementation of this data offload technique needs to be carefully considered, as it places additional constraints on the network design.","The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of challenges that have to be considered when implementing the data offload technique:\n\n","Some specific examples of Customer Services that can be taken into account by the offload decision module include:\n\n","The Network Services that can be taken into account by the offload decision module are typically those that the network operator needs to manage its network. Some examples include:\n\n","Regulatory Services are services that are mandated by legislation, and are typically provided to all traffic. Some specific examples of Regulatory Services that can be taken into consideration by the offload decision module include:\n\n","A further criterion that the platform (, , ) module may consider is the priority of the customer. In this regard, a network operator may wish to prioritise traffic across its network based on the priority level of the customer. For example, a high value customer (e.g. a corporate customer or a subscriber with on a high tariff contract) may be given priority over a low value customer. In this situation, a network may decide to offload lower value customers directly to the internet. This is related to the QoS criterion mentioned above, although the QoS criterion is generally linked to traffic management to maintain a balanced network, whereas the priority referred to can be used to ensure subscribers get a level of service commensurate with their service agreement.","The embodiment of  is in relation to a 3G network. Embodiments of the system described herein are equally applicable to 4G (LTE\/SAE) networks.","The LTE\/SAE macro network includes eNode Bs which make up the RAN. The eNode Bs effectively combine the functionality of the node B and the RNC of the 3G network. These eNodeBs are the network components which communicate with the mobile communication devices. It is envisaged that the eNodeBs will be arranged in groups and each group controlled by a Mobility Management Entity (MME) and a User Plane Entity (UPE).","The MME performs many of the mobility functions traditionally provided by the SGSN. The MME terminates the control plane with the mobile device. It is responsible for terminating NAS (Non Access Stratum) Signalling such as MM (Mobility Management) and SM (Session Management) information as well as coordinating Idle Mode procedures. Other responsibilities of the MME include gateway selection inter MME Mobility and authentication of the mobile device.","The UPE manages protocols on the user plane such as, storing mobile terminal contexts, terminating the Idle Mode on the user plane, and PDP context encryption.","The platforms would operate in the same manner as described in relation to the 3G network. The platforms may be located at many different locations in the 4G network.","A more specific example of how the platform , ,  may be implemented is described in relation to .  is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment for a method for deciding whether to offload data traffic to the internet. The decision structure is composed in a hierarchical form in order that certain types of user or data are always directed through the core network. The example of  is described for a 3G network but it will be clear to those skilled in the art that these decisions could be applied to any type of radio access technology.","Once a PS HSPA data call (or other connection) is made and received at the Node B at , a primary consideration by the platform , ,  at  is whether the device is operating on its home network or whether it is roaming. If the device is roaming then all traffic is automatically routed through the core network. The reason for this is that the home network would want to guarantee the security and accurate billing (due to different charging principle between home and visited operator) of the user's traffic. The platform , ,  at  will also consider other factors, such as what application types running on the mobile terminal require connections. If the mobile device is operating on its home network at , or if the applications do not require a connection to the core network, the platform , ,  considers secondary offloading criteria at . Examples of secondary criteria may include the functions required by the device, the radio bearer currently used by the device, the APN, or the priority level of the customer identified, for example, through IMSI, IMEI or the target subscriber. If the offloading criteria are met at , the decision moves to the tertiary criteria, otherwise, the traffic is not offloaded.","At , the system checks the mobility of the user. If the user is moving, he is considered not suitable for offload due to an expected interruption delay of the user data when moving between source and target cell.","Finally, at  the system conducts a contents and policy check to confirm whether the user is suitable for offload. If it is determined that the user is suitable for offload to the internet, the eNodeB offloads the traffic to the internet at . If it is determined that the user is not suitable for offloading to the internet at  then the procedure returns \u201chome\u201d at . A connection is provided by a network core in a conventional way and the tests of the flowchart shown in  are repeated periodically to determine whether offloading directly to the internet becomes possible subsequently.","If the device is determined to be roaming at step , then the device is not offloaded directly to the internet, but remains connected via the network core in a conventional way at . Similarly, if the offloading criteria are not met at steps , the mobile device remains communicating via the network core in the conventional way, again at .","The hierarchical decision method is useful because it reduces the number of challenges across the network. It will be evident to those skilled in the art that different hierarchical structures will be appropriate for different networks, different conditions etc and that the example of  is just one way the decision could be made.","For instance, whilst arrangements have chiefly been described in relation to transmitting data traffic from a mobile terminal to a data network, the principles may also be applied to transmissions from a data network towards a mobile terminal.","In the arrangements described above the decision regarding the route is said to be made at call set-up. However, it should be appreciated that a decision to change the routing of data may be made at the beginning of a communication session (for example establishment of a PDP context), or during a communication session. The routing of data may change several times during a single communication session. For example, when a communication session is initiated it may be detected that the user is not moving, in which case a decision will be made to offload the data over the alternative data route. Subsequently it may be detected that the user is moving, and at this point a decision may be made to beginning routing data for the communication session via the mobile network. During the communication session, the mobile terminal may become stationary for a prolonged period of time again, and at this time a further decision may be made to send subsequent data during the communication session via the alternative data route. Subsequently again, the user may then attempt to access age-restricted content, and it will be detected that parental control is required. In response for the requirement for parental control, a decision may be made to redirect subsequent data during the Communication session via the core network so that core network parental controls can be applied.","It is to be appreciated that the present embodiments of the system described herein are to be distinguished from HSDPA offload, a technique used on the Iub interface between the Node B and the RNC. HSDPA offload which serves to separate data traffic from voice traffic, so that non-real time data traffic is sent down a less expensive backhaul to complement or replace the expensive E1\/T1 TDM backhaul link between the two. Once this diverted traffic reaches the RNC, however, it is returned to the cellular and transport core networks and there is no differentiation made based upon data traffic type.","In the arrangement described above the platform , ,  primarily handles data offload decisions. As will be described below, the platform can perform may other functions.","Embodiments of the system described herein in which the Radio Access Network controls the use of resources by mobile terminals will now be described,","Platform Architecture","As discussed above, a mobile telecommunication network is modified by the introduction of a \u201cplatform\u201d ,,. Such a platform is shown in more detail at  of  and which includes three principal parts: soft nodes  (physical\/transport layer), network functions  and services  (application layer).","The platform  communicates with the radio frequency (RF) part of a base station, such as a NodeB . The soft nodes  of the platform  comprise components such as a soft NodeB , soft BTS , soft eNodeB  and soft RNC  and soft SGSN\/GGSN . The soft nodeB  provides functions equivalent to the baseband part of a conventional NodeB in a 3G telecommunications network. The soft BTS  provides baseband functions equivalent to the baseband functions of a BTS in a conventional 2G mobile telecommunications network. The soft enodeB  provides baseband functions equivalent to the baseband functions provided by a conventional enodeB in a 4G mobile telecommunications network. The platform  may therefore communicate with the radio frequency part of a 2G, 3G or 4G base station and provide appropriate baseband services for 2G, 3G or 4G technologies (or indeed for other technologies). A 3G mobile terminal that wishes to obtain telecommunication services from the mobile telecommunications networks connects wirelessly to the radio frequency part of a NodeB. Baseband functions may be provided either by a baseband part of the conventional NodeB or by the soft NodeB  forming an element of the soft node part of the platform . For example, the soft NodeB  may receive radio measurements from the radio frequency part of the NodeB to which it is connected, and may provide these radio measurements to other elements of the platform .","The network functions part  of the platform  includes modules for performing functions similar to those performed by the core network of a mobile telecommunications network, such as billing , location tracking  and the radio resource management (RRM) . The network functions may further comprise an offload decision module  that performs a function similar to the offload decision modules ,  and  described above. The network functions part  may further comprise a caching function  and Content Delivery Network function .","The network functions parts  of the platform  provides an Application Programming Interface (API) framework to the services part  of the platform . The services part  of the platform supports a plurality of applications ,  etc.","The network functions fall into three main categories, those that enable the network operation (e.g. charging, O&M), those that support service operation (e.g. Location) and those that optimise the usage of the network by certain applications and services (e.g. Caching, Video Optimisation).","The applications supported on the Platform  are the entities that supply or demand the flow of data on the network, akin to a server on the internet, e.g. gaming server, navigation server.","The API is implemented by a software program running on the network function part  which presents a novel standardised interface for the applications ,  etc of the services part . The novel standardised API provides a consistent interface, defining communication protocols, ports etc. Full details of the API may be published to allow a multiplicity of applications to be developed for the platform  by multiple developers. This should be contrasted with prior art arrangements where each component of a mobile telecommunications network (such as BTS, BSC\/RNC, SGSN etc) is proprietary and tends to have a unique interface, meaning that a different application must be written for each node of a conventional network.","The applications ,  etc may provide services to users of the telecommunications network by co-operating with other parts of the platform .","The details of the use of each application used by the a user of the mobile telecommunications network is stored in an application context\/container. The Application context contains application names, protocol used to carry such application, their characteristics that are measured\/reported over period of time and some statistical information about these applications (volume, number of users using these applications, etc.).","As shown in , a platform  may be provided at each base station of the mobile network (where it is connected to the radio frequency part of the base station\u2014NodeB  in ), forming an access node . Platform  may also be provided at the RNC (item  in ) where it forms a gateway . The access node  and the gateway  are both configured to communicate directly with the network core  (for example, comprising the SGSN , GGSN  and VAS  (as shown in )). The access node  and gateway  may also be connected to the internet  for direct internet access via direct links  and , respectively, such that at least a portion of the core network  is bypassed in the manner described above.","The following are examples of access technologies that can be provided within the access node :","3GPP: GSM\/GPRS, UMTS\/HSPA & LTE","IEEE: 802.11 family & 802.16 family","ITU: DSL, ADSL, VDSL, VDSL2","Allocation of Functions to Platforms","The steps performed when a mobile terminal is activated at a NodeB, at the Femto or at the Access Point (AP) of the network which includes the novel platform  will now be described with reference to . At step A the mobile terminal (UE) is activated within the coverage area of a particular NodeB, at the Femto or at the AP. The access part of the NodeB, at the Femto or at the AP communicates information from the mobile terminal to the platform  associated with the NodeB, at the Femto or at the AP. At step B the platform  then allocates the baseband NodeB, at the Femto or at the AP function and the RNC or BRAS (Broadband Remote Access Server) function either at access node  at the NodeB at the Femto or at the AP site or at the gateway  at the RNC or BRAS site of the network or even from neighbouring nodes that have spare resources to pull. The decision as to whether the RNC or BRAS function is allocated at the platform  of access node  or the gateway node  may be made depending on various criteria, including:\n\n","Upon allocating the baseband NodeB at the Femto or at the AP and the RNC or BRAS function, the NodeB at the Femto or at the AP may allocate the mobile terminal to a particular carrier dedicated to the RNC or BRAS function.","Once the RNC or BRAS function is allocated to either the access node  or the gateway  at step C, other functions performed by the platform  at the access node  (or other access node) and the gateway  (or other gateway) are allocated to the mobile device. All other platform functions may be provided by the platform where the RNC or BRAS function is allocated to the mobile terminal. However, a platform at a different location to that which provides the RNC or BRAS function to the mobile terminal may provide some or all other functions.","At step D the platform which is allocated the RNC or BRAS function is provided with a Common ID message from the core network .","At step E, this message is used by the platform  to look up the complete subscription information for the mobile terminal, as well as the resource requirements (QoS) of the services required and negotiated PDP context, this information being provided by the core network .","The subscription information relating to the device that is obtained from the central nodes (e.g, core network)  is used to allocate the other functions at access node  and\/or the gateway  in dependence upon various factors, including:\n\n","As mentioned above, a single mobile terminal may have platform functions\/applications allocated on a plurality of platforms. Generally, when a mobile terminal is near-stationary it is most efficient for its functions\/applications to be served from an access node  (i.e. distributed), whereas mobile terminals with greater mobility (or lower anticipated cell hold times) will be most efficiently served by having fewer or no functions\/applications served from the access Node , and more or all functions\/applications served from a gateway  (i.e. centralised). The assignment of functions\/applications to a mobile terminal between an access node  and a gateway  will also depend upon the characteristics of the service type provided by the application (for example, the average IP session duration, the popularity of the particular application, the average mobility of mobile terminal using the service provided by the application etc).","Traffic management may be performed at the access node , where there is access to real-time radio information from the radio frequency part of the NodeB, the Femto or the AP serving the mobile device.","Centralised Radio Resource Management (RRM) may be provided at the gateway , and maintains performance across different access modes , which may have different radio access technologies, frequency bands, coverage etc. The RRM function  of the platform  of the gateway  may obtain information regarding radio traffic management from each access node  to dynamically position subscribers to particular radio technology. This technique will be used to allocate network resources based on the resource availability, application used and user mobility, For example, the traffic management information may be provided by the soft NodeB , Femto or AP of the platform  at the access node . This soft NodeB  obtains radio information relating to the mobile terminal from the radio frequency part of the NodeB to which the mobile terminal is wirelessly connected.","For a particular mobile terminal, functions provided by an access node  and gateway  may be coordinated to work together in an advantageous manner (i.e. a hybrid or distributed arrangement). For example, the gateway  may set operating limits or ranges within which functions performed by the access node  may be performed, without reference to the gateway . When the functions move outside the ranges set, control of those functions may be passed to the gateway .","Further, the access node  and the gateway  may cooperate to advantageously optimise content delivery to a mobile terminal.","The optimisation of content delivery will now be described with reference to  of the drawings. Content may be optimised at gateway  and at an access node . The gateway  may serve multiple access nodes , and my distribute content to those multiple access nodes , for onward transmissions from each of those access nodes  to a mobile terminal via the radio frequency part of NodeB, the Femto or the AP serving that node. Radio quality measurements are reported by the mobile terminal to the access node  at regular intervals, such as 2 millisecond intervals. Radio quality measurement relating to that mobile terminal are transmitted between the radio frequency part of the NodeB, the Femto or the AP serving the mobile terminal to the access node  at regular intervals, such as between 2 and 10 millisecond intervals. These radio measurements are received at the soft nodes  and are passed to functions  (e.g. to QoS function  for analysis). These radio frequency measurements from the mobile terminal and the NodeB are reported by the access node  to the gateway  (e.g. to QoS function  of the gateway  for analysis) at regular intervals, such as intervals of between 1 and 10 seconds. The gateway  may receive radio information from multiple access nodes . The radio measurements received by the gateway  may be analysed over a relatively long period, such as between 1 and 2 minutes. The radio quality measurements may be averaged (for example, the arithmetical mean of the radio quality maybe determined) over this time period. The transmission of content from the gateway  may then be optimised according to this calculation. Where the content is distributed by the gateway  to a plurality of access nodes , the content distribution will be based on the analysis of the radio quality indicators from all of the access nodes . The analysis may consider the maximum or peak radio performance over the time period of between 1 and 2 minutes.","When the content is received by each access node , the access node  then distributes the content to each mobile terminal. This distribution is optimised based on real-time network mode and mobile terminal specific radio link quality, as determined over a period of, for example, between 1 and 10 milliseconds. That is, content delivered to a mobile terminal that has high radio link quality may be optimised in a different manner to a mobile terminal that had poor radio link quality.","The co-operation between access nodes  and gateways  may further enhance the distribution of content in a manner now to be described with reference to .","When a mobile terminal requests a particular content item, this request is transmitted to the access node  serving that mobile terminal, assuming that this is the first request for this content item to the access node , the access node  passes this request to the gateway  serving the access node . Assuming that this is the first request for this content item from the gateway , the gateway  retrieves the content from a content server. The content is then provided by the content server to the gateway , and from there is distributed to the access node , and onwardly to the requesting mobile terminal. Advantageously, the gateway  maintains a record of content items that are requested frequently. When a content item is determined by the gateway  to be requested frequently, this is stored in a cache  associated with the gateway  (which may be the cache  of the platform ). Subsequent requests for that content item from access nodes  to the gateway  can then be serviced by retrieving the content item from the cache  and distributing the content item to the requesting access node , and thus avoiding the need to request the content from the content server.","The gateway  may be further configured to identify popular content items that are likely to be requested by a large number of access nodes . When it is determined that a content item is popular, the gateway  may push these content items to each of the access nodes  associated therewith (so that this content is hosted at the access node , using Content Delivery Network (CDN) function  of the network functions  of the gateway  and the access node ). The content is then available at the access node  for transmission to any mobile terminal that requests it, without having to retrieve this content from the gateway  or the content server. Advantageously, the distribution of such content items is performed in a manner which takes into account the capacity or the congestion of the link between the mobile terminal and the gateway  and the nature of the content. For example, typically a link between a mobile terminal and the gateway  may experience very little usage and congestion in the early hours of the morning. The content item can be advantageously transmitted in between the gateway  and the access node  at this time, when there is spare capacity. The gateway  will determine whether the content item is suitable for transmission on this basis, for example, by taking into account a number of times that the content item has been requested, the size of the content item and the storage space at the access node . If a content item is relatively small and is time-critical, such as news headlines, then such a content item may be distributed frequently throughout the day, as such content is not suitable for transmission once a day at early hours of the morning, as it becomes quickly out of date.","Relocation of Mobile Terminal","The procedures performed when a mobile terminal moves between cells in the mobile telecommunications network will now be described with reference to . In the conventional manner at step A, when the mobile terminal moves to the edge of its current serving cell, the radio measurements reported from the mobile terminal and the radio frequency part of the NodeB, the Femto or the AP serving that mobile terminal are used by the core network to determine when to perform a handover and to which target cell the handover should be performed. When the best target cell has been identified, handover to that target cell from the serving cell it is performed at B in a conventional manner.","At step C selected platform functions may be relocated from the source access node (that served the old cell) to the destination access node (that serves the new target cell).","When the source and destination access nodes are served by the same gateway, only base station function (such as soft NodeB functions ) may be relocated to the destination access node.","The relocation of functions of the access nodes is performed independently to the radio handover, so for some time after the radio handover, the source access node continues to serve content to the mobile terminal through the destination access node. The routing of data packets for the 3G network between the destination and the source access nodes may be performed using an Iu interface between the RNC or BRAS function  of the destination access node and the SGSN\/GGSN function  of the source access node. Alternatively, the routing of data packets between the destination and the source access nodes can be completed by the SGSN\/GGSN function  of the destination access node connecting directly to functions of the source access node through an IP interface.","After handover has been completed at step B, the access node controlling the mobile terminal may be relocated from the source access node to the destination access node in coordination with the gateway. the standardised handover decisions (mainly based on coverage, quality, power, interference, etc.) for 2G, 3G, LTE & fixed network are used to move the mobile from one node or system to another. However, the platform  introduces new opportunity to make the handover decision based on type or characteristics of the certain application, type of user and the QoS requirements.","The timing of the relocation of access node functions from the source to destination platform may be dependent on the following:\n\n","At step D, optionally, some functions will be reallocated from the access nodes to the gateway. For example, if the destination access node is heavily loaded and is congested, or has a lower capability then the source access node, or the mobile terminal is determined to be very mobile, it may be advantageous to transfer functions to the gateway. Functions are reallocated from the access node to the gateway by, for example, a Serving Radio Network Subsystem (SRNS) relocation between the RNC function  of the access node and the gateway. Alternatively the functions may be reallocated by performing a radio reconfiguration of user connection to the mobile terminal.","The reallocation of functions from an access node to the gateway may be performed at call\/communication sessions set-up. At call\/communication session set-up, further subscriber information will be provided, which may be used by the access node or gateway to be determine whether it would be advantageous to reallocate functions from the access node to the gateway. Reallocation of functions from the access node  to the gateway  may be performed during an active connection when a requirement of the communication sessions has been modified, or where the required resource is not available at the access node .","According to the same principles, applications may be (re)located (or distributed) between access nodes  and for gateways  to provide optimised application delivery\/best use of the communication resources.","As mentioned above, information about each application used by the user at the mobile terminal is stored in an application context. The application context is shared between each access node  and gateway  that control the user connection for that mobile terminal. One of the access nodes \/gateways  will be the \u201cmaster\u201d for that particular application, and that will also be the master of an application specific record in the application context. The application context is advantageously periodically synchronised between the access node  and the gateway .","The application information is the application context specific to a particular mobile terminal, and this is passed between access nodes and gateways during reallocation for a mobile terminal, enabling the application to be seamlessly passed access nodes\/gateways, avoiding impacts to the user experience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0145","num":"0184"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"Tailoring Bandwidth to Application","Radio measurements received from the radio frequency part of the NodeB, the Femto or the AP serving the mobile terminal are passed to the soft nodes  of the platform  (of the access node  or gateway  serving the mobile terminal), and are passed to the network functions  of the platform , which then distributes the measurements to where necessary within the platform . The platform  has access to the subscriber information from the core network, which allows the network functions  to deliver data traffic in a manner that is optimised for radio conditions as indicated by the radio measurements. The data traffic may also be optimised according to the subscription of the user of the mobile terminal available radio resource, mobile terminal capability, and\/or for the class of the terminal (e.g. access technologies used). This optimisation allows bandwidth usage to be balanced with customer experience. The subscriber information may include information about the price plan of the user of the mobile terminal. The mobile network operator may track the type of application used by the user, the total data usage of the user, and may differentially target radio resources the highest data value stream of users.","By hosting applications ,  in the services part  of the platform the access node  (or at least the gateway ), the point of the network that is aware of the application being used by the user of the mobile terminal closer in the link between the mobile terminal and the core network to the NodeB serving the mobile terminal. This enables the sharing of network resources to the most appropriate data streams, such as the most profitable data streams. Such awareness of the application to which a request for data transmission relates allows the use low value data streams, such as peer-to-peer file sharing, to be allocated only limited bandwidth, so that remaining bandwidth can be targeted to particular users. In the uplink, transmission of data can be controlled by the access node  (or gateway ) hosting the application to control data flow appropriately before data is onwardly transmitted towards the core of the network (which was not possible with conventional arrangements).","Application Programming Interface (API)","As mentioned above, a novel API is provided which defines the language that each of the software modules ,  of the platform  use to communicate to coordinate to optimise application delivery to users. The platform  negotiates which each application ,  the specific resource and performance requirements based on the application characteristics, allowing the application to directly communicate the scheduling performance requirements, rather than using a predefined set of quality of service parameters. This negotiation between the platform  and the applications ,  is facilitated by the API.","The API may also facilitate the provision of radio link quality information (e.g. from QoS function ) to applications , .","The API may further enable the platform  to control use of the applications , \u2014e.g. to allow, disallow or adapt the applications.","By way of example, the application  may be a Voice over IP (VoIP) application. The nature of Voice over IP communications is that there is a virtually continuous succession of small data packets in which voice data is communicated. The voice data must be communicated with no or minimal latency in order that a two-way conversation can be performed successfully. The Voice over IP application  is able to compress voice data before transmission using a variety of techniques\/CODECs. The compression techniques\/CODECs may range from a relatively low compression technique, which provides high quality voice reproduction but requires a large bandwidth, to a much higher compression technique which provides reduced voice quality and which requires a much lower bandwidth.","The API is operable to provide details of the application characteristics to the network functions part  of the platform . This makes the network functions part  of the platform aware of the characteristics of the application. In the present example, as the application is a Voice over IP application, the network functions part  may be made aware that the application will tend to transmit continuous successions of small data packets that require transmission with no or low latency. The network function  may then be configured appropriately.","The API may further be operable to allow the network functions part  to communicate radio link quality information to the application . For example, when the network functions part  received information regarding the application characteristics (via the API), it may allocate radio link resources to that application . This allocation of radio link resources may be communicated by the network functions part  to the application  (via the API). The application  may then select an appropriate compression technique\/CODEC in dependence upon the radio link quality available. During a Voice over IP call, the available radio link quality may be communicated regularly from the network functions part  to the application  (via the API) to allow the application  to vary the compression technique\/CODEC used in accordance with changes to the radio link quality.","The network functions part  may control how the applications ,  work (via the API). The network functions part  may allow, disallow or adapt the applications ,  hosted in the services part  of the platform . For example, the network functions part  may require the Voice over IP application  to use a particular compression technique\/CODEC if radio link bandwidth is restricted.","Another example of how the network functions part  may advantageously provide radio link quality information to an application (via the API) is when the application  is a gaming application used by several users. If the radio link quality information received by the application  indicates that bandwidth is restricted, the application  may adapt is communications to the users such that latency of the communications is increased uniformly for all of the users (so that they all experience the same delay), in order that each of the users is provided with the same gaming experience.","In the embodiments described, the devices that connect to the platforms  are mobile devices that connect to the platforms via the radio access network of a mobile\/cellular telecommunications network. It should be appreciated that non-mobile (fixed) devices may be connected to the platforms , for example by a wired or cable connection.","Allocation of Services","The controller is responsible for allocating the service instance for each UE, based on the UE locations and the controller capacity, capability and available resources to host another instance of a service.","For certain low popularity services or where the available serving controller capacity or capability is limited, the service can be hosted from a central controller, or from a neighbouring distributed controller.","For some services\/functions, where the source and destination client applications are in the same geographical region, being served by the same site (e.g. BTS location) or site cluster (e.g. finite number of sites), the access node \/gateway  ensures that the server for the service is located close to both users, and the traffic is routed between the users within the site.","Smart Client","The cost to carry data between a particular mobile device and a particular cell depends on many factors. This \u201ccost to carry\u201d data is an indicator of the value of total resources required to convey the data. For example, it will usually cost more to convey data via a 2.5GPRS base station than via a WiFi access point because data transmission via a 2.5G base station is slow and relatively inefficient and must be transmitted via a complex and therefore expensive backhaul network to the core network and then for onward reception\/transmission. This is true, although to a lesser extent, even when a platform  is provided which allows data traffic to bypass the core network in a manner described above. In contrast, WiFi access points operate over a much shorter range and with a higher data capacity whilst also having a much simpler and therefore less expensive backhaul by which data can be offloaded directly to the internet from the access point via an appropriate direct link (such as an xDSL network).","Further, macro or femto base stations and mobile devices that operate in accordance with cellular telecommunications Standards\/transport protocols vary the power of radio transmissions in dependence upon the characteristics of the link between the base station and the device. For example, power is increased if the distance between the base station and the device is greater, or if the radio conditions are poor (which may be caused by environmental factors or by obstacles, such as buildings) between the base station and the device. Such an increase in power increases interference, and therefore reduces the overall capacity of the base station to convey data between itself and other devices. From the above discussion, it should be appreciated that the \u201ccost to carry\u201d data between a device and a WiFi access point is relatively low. The \u201ccost to carry\u201d data between a base station operating in accordance with mobile telecommunications Standard and a device located close to the base station, and without obstructions, is higher, whereas the cost to transmit data between such a base station and a device at the edge of the coverage area of the cell is higher still.","The \u201ccost to carry\u201d data between a device and a 3G (UMTS) or a 4G (LTE) base station is generally lower than the 2.5G base station because base stations operate in accordance with more modern Standard and make more efficient use of the available radio spectrum. Even within a single cell at a single moment in time, the cost of carry data may vary dramatically depending upon the radio conditions and locations of different devices associated with that base station.","The overall load on a mobile telecommunications network varies dramatically by geography and by time. Generally, a small percentage of cells of the network may be fully loaded, whilst many of the other cells have a low load. The \u201ccost to carry\u201d data in geographical areas and at times when cells are fully loaded is high, because it drives technology upgrades\u2014that is, new infrastructure, such as new base stations, are introduced to cope with the traffic. In contrast the \u201ccost to carry\u201d data in geographical locations, and at times where network traffic is low, is low. Network operators design their network architecture with sufficient capacity to be able to meet the demands of its customers on the busiest cells at the busiest times. This capacity is very expensive in terms of base stations and power. This expensive architecture, although used intensively for a particular busy time of the day, may be underused for large, non busy portions of the day.","Conventionally, a mobile telecommunications network has no control over when or where data is transmitted between a mobile device and base station or other access point, and will simply enable transmission of the data on demand.","The present embodiment seeks to overcome some of the problems associated with conventional mobile telecommunications networks. The embodiments seeks to allow mobile device users to send and receive data at times that are appropriate for the user whilst managing and making best use of the radio capacity across a telecommunications network.","An embodiment that manages the delivery of data to users will now be described with reference to  of the drawings.","Referring initially to , the mobile device  includes a service part  (application layer) which hosts application  and . A cache  and  is associated with each of the applications  and , respectively. The applications may require the periodic reception and transmission of data. Such data requests are sent to a client .","The client  controls access between the applications ,  and the radio access network of a telecommunications network, of which one base station  is shown. Here, the term \u201cbase station\u201d should be interpreted in its broader sense. The base station may be a cellular communications base station, such as a 2G, 2.5G, 3G or 4G \u201cmacro\u201d base station. Alternatively, the base station may be a femto cell or may be an access point of a WiFi or other type of radio access network.","The network further comprises a network core . The network may be provided with platforms  of the type described above, and a platform  may be associated with the base station , for example to form an access node  (see ). A data managing server  is linked to the core network  and includes a respective memory for each user's mobile device (such as device ) associated with the network. The memory for the mobile device  is designated .","Data collection operations performed by the client  on the mobile device  will now be described with reference to the flow chart of .","As described above, the mobile terminal  measures the radio signals of the cell on which it is registered and the neighbouring cells when in both the idle and active state. These measurements are conventionally used for determining when to perform handover or cell reselection. According to this embodiment of the system described herein, at step A, the client  is operable to record the signal measurements data from the current cell and neighbouring cells in a radio measurement store  on the device . Radio measurement may be recorded at predetermined time intervals, such as every five minutes, or over any other suitable time interval. The average (arithmetical mean) of the radio signal measurement of each cell may be calculated over the time interval and stored, or instantaneous values may be used. The recorded data may include radio access technology of each of the cells, for example whether they operate using 2G, 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi, a femto cell or other communication technologies, and the radio conditions of the cells. The identity of the cells is also recorded (for example their cell ID or SSID).","The location of the device  at which the measurements are made is also stored in the radio store  at step B. The location may be determined by GPS, cell triangulation or any other method. Also stored is the time the measurement was made, at step C. Further, any data communications between the mobile terminal  and the base station  are recorded at step D. The rate of data usage is measured and recorded. This applies to both downlink and uplink data communication activity. The device experiences in the cell may also be recorded\u2014e.g. whether the connection is unreliable. The data are stored in a radio data store  of the mobile device .","At step E the data from the radio data store  is uploaded by the client , via the base station  and core network , to the store  of the server .","At step F it is determined whether the profile for the user of mobile of terminal  (with which the store  on the server  is associated) is complete. If the profile is complete, then the procedure of  may be terminated for a predetermined time period; however, the procedure may be reactivated periodically in order to update the profile.","On the other hand, if it is determined at step F that the profile of the store  of the server  is incomplete then the procedure returns to step A and radio data continues to be recorded by the client  and uploaded to the server .","Advantageously, the client  records radio measurement data when the mobile terminal is in the idle communication state as well as in the active communication state. In a conventional arrangement, radio measurements made when the mobile terminal is in the idle communication stage are never reported from the mobile terminal to elsewhere in the network, so this information cannot be used elsewhere.","Although step E (and step F) are shown as immediately succeeding the data collection and recording steps A, B, C and D, in the flowchart, it may be advantageous to accumulate recorded radio data over a plurality of the predetermined time intervals, and to subsequently upload the radio measurement data for a plurality of the predetermined time intervals in one data communication session. For example, the radio measurement data may be uploaded every hour or at any other regular time period. Alternatively, the radio data may be uploaded when the client  detects that the radio conditions are optimal, so that the data may be uploaded in the most efficient manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0178","num":"0217"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1218","13"]},"At step A the server  receives from the core network  radio measurement data from the client  of the mobile terminal .","At step B the server  updates the profile for the mobile terminal  in the store  on the server  with the received information from the core network .","The server  uses the information provided by the client  of the mobile terminal  to identify trends throughout a particular time period, such as one day, of device movement, performance and cells which could provide data connectivity to the device . Often over a predetermined time period, such as a day, a user follows the same movement pattern (that is, the user visits the same locations at the same or a similar time each day). This is referred to as a user \u201cmovement cycle\u201d. For example, many mobile terminal users will travel the same route at the same time to the same work location every weekday, and may pursue leisure activities at the same location and same time at weekends. The data recorded and reported by the client  of the mobile device  may be used by the server  to identify likely opportunities during the day for advantageously performing data communication with the device \u2014typically, when the device is likely to be in a cell which has significant spare radio capacity and therefore low \u201ccost to carry\u201d.","The analysis steps performed by the server  will now be described with reference to the flow chart of .","At step A the server  analyses radio measurement data stored in the store  for the user of the mobile terminal .","At step B the types of cell visited are identified, such as 2G, 3G, 4G, open femto, closed femto, dedicated office coverage systems, private Wi-Fi, public Wi-Fi etc. As will be appreciated, at a particular location and time a plurality of different cells may be available to provide radio coverage to a mobile terminal. Each of these cells is characterised in step B.","At step C the performance of each cell at a relevant time (for example, at each five minute time interval over a 24 hour period in which the device  occupies the cell) is calculated. The spare data capacity of each cell at the relevant time is determined from the measurements provided by the client , and also data from platforms  and the network core . The spare data capacity will depend upon the demands of other users for data communication with the cell at the same time, the environmental conditions, the distance between the mobile terminal and the cell base station etc.","At step D the server  calculates the \u201ccost to carry\u201d data over each cell at each relevant time interval throughout the measurement period. The \u201ccost to carry\u201d is generally inversely proportioned to the spare data capacity of a cell. It may also be dependent upon the number of carriers\/quantity of spectrum allocated, the backhaul capacity\/load, the backhaul type, the average QoE\/QoS of the cell, output power of the base station and the interference environment. The \u201ccost to carry\u201d will also depend upon the type of cell, generally being longer for macro cells than for femto cells or WiFi.","At step E the server  uploads the cell \u201ccost to carry\u201d data to the mobile terminal  where it is received by the client  and stored on cell information store .","After the client is provided with the \u201ccost to carry\u201d data, the client  is then able to predict, at a particular time in a user a movement cycle, when the mobile terminal  is at a point in the movement cycle, when the mobile terminal will be in radio coverage of a cell which has low cost to deliver data.","This process will now be described with reference to the flow chart of .","At step A the client  of the mobile terminal  receives cell information from the server  and stores it in cell information store .","At step B the client  monitors the cell with which the mobile device  is currently registered and also the neighbouring cells.","At step C the client , for the relevant time\/point in the user movement cycle, compares the current cell with \u201ccost to carry\u201d data in the store  to determine whether the current cell is predicted to be \u201clow cost\u201d cell. This may be done by comparing the cell ID of the current cell with the cell's ID in the store . If at step C it is determined that the current cell is not a \u201clow cost\u201d cell, then the procedure returns to step B. Optionally, if other cell IDs in the store  for the relevant time period\/point in the movement cycle are identified as \u201clow cost\u201d cells, the client  may instruct the device  to handover to that cell if in the active state or to select that cell if in the idle state. On the other hand, if it is predicted at step C that the current cell is a \u201clow cost\u201d cell, then at step D the client  contacts the server  (via the base station  and core network ) to seek approval of data transfer.","At step E the server  determines if the actual cell load of the \u201clow cost\u201d cell is below a predetermined threshold. As will be appreciated from the preceding discussion, the information stored in the store  of the mobile terminal  is used by the client  to predict whether a particular cell may be a \u201clow cost\u201d cell at a particular time of day\/point in the movement cycle. This is based on analysis of past measurements of cell load at that time\/point, but may not reflect the true position at the cell at the current time. Conventionally, cell load information is not available to the core network , and so could not be provided to the server . However, because, according to the present embodiment, the platform  is provided, it is possible for the core network  to obtain cell load information from the platform  (which, as described above, has access to real-time or regularly updated radio information from the radio frequency part of the base stations with which it is associated and may be reported by the QoS function \u2014see ) and to pass this to the server  in order to determine the actual cell load at a particular time in step E.","The platform  is able to provide to the server  information in relation to all 7 layers of the OSI model, i.e. the physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer and application layer. The server  is therefore able to accurately determine the real radio conditions.","In contrast conventionally, as mentioned above, real radio information is not available to the core network  and so cannot be provided to the server . In such a conventioned arrangement the radio capacity is estimated at the application layer of the OSI model using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). According to the TCP, the receiving device is required to respond with an acknowledgement message when it receives a data packet. The sending device records each packet that it sends, and waits for acknowledgement of receipt before sending the next packet. The sending device times from when each packet was sent, and retransmits a maximum packet if the time expires. The TCP uses a sliding window flow control arrangement for the purpose of sending data at a speed at which it can be safely transmitted and processed by the receiver. In each TCP segment, the receiver specifies in a \u201creceive window\u201d field the amount of additional received data that it is able to buffer for the connection. The sender sends only up to this amount of data before it waits for acknowledgement and window update from the receiver.","TCP is optimised for wired networks. Accordingly, any packet loss is considered to be the result of network congestion, and consequently the window size is reduced dramatically as a precaution by the receiver automatically when packet loss occurs. However, wireless links, such as those of solar telecommunications networks, experience sporadic and often temporary losses of data due to intercell handovers and other radio effects. These temporary losses are not due to congestion (which tends to be long term) but rather due to short term effects, such as radio effects. However, because TCP was designed for wired networks, it assumes that the data loss is due to congestion and significantly decreases the window size for the purpose of congestion avoidance. The window size is only increased again gradually. Whilst this is suitable for wired networks where, as mentioned above, congestion is relatively long term, it results in significant under utilisation of radio link capacity because any data loss is usually short term, the capacity if therefore wasted once the radio effects that resulted in data loss disappear whilst the TCP slowly increases the window size.","The present embodiment, by using actual radio measurements from the platform  avoids the disadvantages of TCP with wireless networks.","If at step E it is determined that the cell load is not below the predetermined threshold, then the procedure returns to step B.","On the other hand if at step E it is determined that the cell load is below the threshold, then at step F the server  approves the data transfer.","At step G the server  notifies the client  of the mobile terminal  of approval of the data transfer by sending a message via the core network  and base station . The actual cell load information and the radio access technology (2G, 2.5G, 3G, 4G, WiFi, etc) the cell may also be passed to the client .","At step H the client  determines if data transfer is actually required by any of the applications  or  of the mobile terminal. If no data transfer is required, then the procedure returns to step A.","On the other hand if it is determined at step H that one or more of the applications  or  requires data transfer then at step I the client  controls contact with content servers ,  to perform data transfer. The client may pass the actual cell load information and the radio access technology information to the servers ,  so that they may optimise the data according to the conditions\u2014e.g. to choose an appropriate compression scheme that is suitable for the bandwidth available.","Alternatively, or additionally, a procedure may be provided that determines whether data transfer should be performed on initiation of one of the applications ,  of the mobile terminal . This procedure will now be described with reference to the flow chart of .","At step A, the application , for example, issues a request for data transfer. For example, the application  may be a news provider application which displays to the user current news headlines. Upon selection of a headline by the user, a more detailed news storey is displayed, including relevant photographs. The application  may be configured to periodically update the detailed news stories and to store these for display immediately that the user selects a particular headline. This updating of detailed news stories is done in the \u201cbackground\u201d. The user does not initiate the updating and is generally not aware of it occurring. This allows the detailed news storey to be displayed without delay (avoiding data transmission delays) and also when the mobile terminal is out of radio coverage. However, this \u201cbackground\u201d downloading of detailed news stories may be regarded as \u201clow priority\u201d data because it is not obtained in direct response to a user request but rather is obtained simply in preparation for the eventuality that the user may wish to view the data.","In this example, the application  issues a request to update the detailed news stories every 30 minutes. This will be in the form of a request for data transfer which is passed from the application  to the client  at step A.","At step B it is determined whether the requested data is already present in the cache  associated with the application . If it is determined that the data is in the cache , then the procedure ends. On the other hand if it is determined at step B that the data is not in the cache , then step C is performed.","At step C the client  determines whether the request is a \u201clow priority\u201d request for data transfer. This may be determined may any suitable mechanism, such as a \u201clow priority\u201d data transfer request having a \u201clow priority\u201d flag associated therewith when it is issued by an application. If at step C it is determined that the transfer request is not a low priority request, then an appropriate data connection may be initiated immediately and the requested data may be transmitted in the conventional manner at step D. Such a higher priority request may be a direct request from a user via a web browser (application ) for train time information. Optionally, the client  may be configured to prompt the user via the graphical user interface of the mobile terminal  to approve this higher priority data transfer. Such a prompt may be given selectively. For example if the device  is predicted to be in a \u201chigh cost\u201d cell, then the prompt may be given, whereas if the device  is predicted to be in a \u201clow cost\u201d cell, then the data connection may be initiated without the confirmatory prompt (the \u201chigh cost\u201d\/\u201clow cost\u201d determination is made using data in the store ).","On the other hand if at step C it is determined that the data transfer request is \u201clow priority\u201d (such as the background downloading of data like the detailed news stories for application  described above) then at step E the client  consults the store  to determine whether the current cell is a \u201clow cost\u201d cell at the particular time the request is made. If it is determined at step E that the current cell is not a \u201clow cost\u201d cell, then the procedure returns to step A, and the background downloading is delayed.","On the other hand if at step E it is determined that the current cell is predicted to be a \u201clow cost\u201d cell than at step F the client  contacts the server  (via the base station  and core network ) to approve the data transfer.","At step G the server  determines if the actual cell load of the predicted \u201clow cost\u201d cell is below a predetermined threshold, in a similar manner to step E.","If at step G it is determined that the cell load is not below the predetermined threshold, then the procedure returns to step A, and the background downloading is delayed.","On the other hand if at step G it is determined that the cell load is below the threshold, then at step H the server  approves the data transfer.","At step I the server  notifies the client  of the mobile terminal  of approval of the data transfer by sending a message via the core network  and base station .","At step J the client  controls contact with content servers , , which contain the detailed news stories, to perform data transfer to the cache  so that the data is ready for use by the application .","A further example of the type of application that can be included in the service part  of the device  is an email application. The email application may frequently poll an email server to obtain the text of any emails for the user of the device . This polling may be performed at regular time intervals, such as every five minutes. This polling may be performed by a conventional data transfer performed immediately irrespective of the \u201ccost to carry\u201d. Such polling requests may be transmitted via the client  but without the \u201clow priority\u201d flag mentioned above, so that the request for data are handled immediately (e.g. at step C). The email application determines whether each email as an \u201cattachment\u201d (i.e. an associated data file such as a spreadsheet document or photograph). The email application sends requests to download these attachments to the client  but with the \u201clow priority\u201d flag. In accordance with the procedure of the flow chart of , after the client  has received the data transfer request (step A) and has determined that the required data is not stored in the cache associated with the email application (step B) it is determined at step C whether the data transfer request is \u201clow priority\u201d or not. As indicated above, if the transfer request does not include the \u201clow priority\u201d flag (in this example data request is for the text of the email), at step D immediate data transfer of the email text is performed. However, if the request for data transfer is an attachment, then it will include a \u201clow priority\u201d flag. This will be detected at step C.","For this \u201clow priority\u201d data the cell information store  is consulted at step E to determine whether the current cell is predicted to be \u201clow cost\u201d cell. If the current is predicted to be a low cost cell then at step F the client  contacts the server  to seek approval for the data transfer. At step G the server determines if the actual cell load is below a threshold. Only if the actual cell load is below the threshold is the data transfer approved by the server at step H, and the client notified of this approval at step I. At step J the client  controls contact with the server to perform the data transfer in the low cost cell. The attachments are therefore downloaded by the client  when the device  is in a \u201clow cost\u201d cell. This downloading of the attachments occurs in the background and the user of the mobile device  is not aware of it. However, when the user attempts to open an attachment to an email that has been downloaded in the background, the attachment is available immediately. The usual experience is therefore enhanced but without using high cost network resources.","If an email text is obtained in the manner discussed above and with which there is an attachment associated it is possible that the user would wish to consume the attachment before it has been obtained by the background downloading process described above. In response to a request from the device user, the email application will issue a request to download the attachment to the client  but without the \u201clow cost\u201d flag. In the procedure of , this will result in the attachment being downloaded immediately in step D.","In addition to calculating the \u201ccost to carry\u201d in step D, and sending this to the client  in step E, the server  may analyse the data usage measurement information recorded at step D to identify periodic requests for data transmission to\/from the device . This analysis resulted in the creation of a \u201crules and policy file\u201d which may be sent from the server  to the client  of the device, and which instructs the client  to download data at a particular point in the movement cycle or provide it to the caches , , and by also instructing the client  to perform upload of data at a particular point in the movement cycle. For example, if the device  requests download of an on-line newspaper at 7 am every morning this will be determined by the server . The download of the newspaper will be a considerable amount of data. If this download is performed when not in a \u201clow cost\u201d cell, the cost to carry the data will be significant. Advantageously, the server , on identifying such a download pattern, analyses the \u201ccost to carry\u201d data for cells that the device  occupies in a period before the download is requested (i.e. in the period before 7 am). The server may identify that the device  is usually located in a \u201clow cost\u201d cell between 2 am and 6.30 am (for example, while at home) on a regular basis but in higher cost cell between 6.30 am and 8.00 am (for example while commuting to work) on a regular basis. The server  identifies that a low cost download is available from between 2.30 am and 6.30 am and that a request for a specific URL download is expected at 7 am. The server  includes in the \u201crules and policy\u201d for the client  of the device  an instruction that, if the device  was located in a \u201clow cost\u201d cell between 2.30 am and 6.30 am, it should request download of data from the URL. The downloaded data is then stored in an appropriate cache for immediate retrieval by the appropriate newspaper application on request by the user.","The downloaded data according to the \u201crules and policy\u201d file by the client  may be subject to step of confirming with the server  that the predicted low cost cell actually has a load below a threshold in the manner described above with reference to step G of the process of .","Data transmission request patterns my be observed by the server  for a multiplicity of data types associated with different applications. The \u201crules and policy\u201d file will include data for the data transmission types and applications. By operating in accordance with the \u201crules and policy\u201d file provided by the server , the client  may perform background downloading of data to the relevant cache associated with each application. The applications are configured to consult the cache (in the manner described in step A and B of the flowchart of ) before requesting a data transfer from the client . If the requested application is stored in the cache associated with the application, the data is available for immediate use by the application, so the user experiences no delay and can access the data even when the device  is not in coverage of any base station.","The user of the mobile device  may be able to interact with the client  using a user interface. This allows the user to set their preferences for data transmission. For example, the user may choose to prioritise the download of some content or files, and to add web pages or applications to the \u201crules and policy\u201d file, so that these are automatically downloaded to be ready for consumption at a particular time.","A differential charging structure may be applied to data downloaded in the background in accordance with this embodiment. For example, the user may not be charged for such background downloading of data but may only be charged when the data is actually consumed. The caches described above (included caches  and ) may be securely associated with the client  such that data in the caches cannot be accessed by the applications (including applications  and ) without the approval and knowledge of the client . The client  then records the amount of data that is actually consumed by the applications. This consumption data is provided to the network core  so that the billing records held centrally within the network can be updated to reflect the data consumed, rather than the data transmitted.","Optionally, security of this process may be improved by received data being sent in encrypted form and stored in the caches ,  in encrypted form. In order for the client  to allow consumption of the data, the client must request a key to unlock the content. The request for a key is sent by the client  to the core network . When the core network  issues the key to the client  for consumption of the encrypted data, the billing record is updated so an appropriate charge can be made. Such an arrangement provides that it is difficult or impossible to bypass the notification of the core network  if it is desired to consume the downloaded data.","Other examples of applications in the service part  of the device  include a software update application which may, for example, periodically check with a remote server for updates to the device operating system. If it is determined that an update to the operating system is required, then the application issues a request to the client in the manner described in relation to step A of the flowchart of . The subsequent steps of flowchart of  are then performed. As the updated operating system is generally a low priority, such a request is typically given a \u201clow priority\u201d flag by the application (although it may not have such a flag if it is an urgent update). According to the process of , the software update will only be downloaded when the device is predicted to be in a \u201clow cost\u201d cell, and when the server  determines that the actual cell load is below the predetermined threshold.","Another example of an application in the service part  of the device  is a backup application. For example, such a backup application may backup the contacts and photographs stored on the device . Such backing up of data is a low priority activity, and therefore request to backup data sent by the backup application to the client  include the \u201clow priority\u201d flag. This is sent in step A of the process of . The other steps of the process of  are followed so that the data to be backed up is transmitted (uploaded) to a remote backup store only when it is predicted that the device  is in a low cost cell, and when the server determines that the cell load is actually below the predetermined threshold.","Various embodiments discussed herein may be combined with each other in appropriate combinations in connection with the system described herein.
