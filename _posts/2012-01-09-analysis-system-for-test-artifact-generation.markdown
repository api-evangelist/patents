title: Analysis system for test artifact generation
abstract: A requirements testing system facilitates the review and analysis of requirement statements for software applications. The requirements testing system generates test artifacts from the requirement statements. The test artifacts characterize the requirements statements to provide valuable analysis information that aids understanding whether the requirement statements are testable, what the intentions of the requirement statements are, and other useful analysis information. Because the system generates the analysis information from the requirement statements, the system provides benefits in terms of early feedback along the software application development timeline.

As examples, the network  may include Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), Internet connections, Ethernet networks, or Fiber Distributed Data Interconnect (FDDI) packet switched networks that may communicate Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) packets, or any data following any other communication protocol. The network  provides a transport mechanism or interconnection of multiple transport mechanisms supporting data exchange between the system  and any source of documents to analyze, including the requirement documents .","An analysis engine  in the system  analyzes the requirement statements to determine the test artifacts. A requirement statement may, for example, be implemented as a single sentence or other sequence of one or more words. The requirement statement may, for example, be in unconstrained natural language, structured formats, or model based formats. An example of a requirement statement in a structured format may be a requirement statement limited to subject, action and object (denoted by SAO in Link Grammar notation). Such a restriction may exclude requirement statements with multiple objects, or requirement statements with nouns which are neither subjects nor objects. Other examples are possible.","In some instances, the requirement statements may include data that is not intended for processing. Such data may be marked, e.g. the data not intended for processing may be enclosed in brackets. The requirement statements may first be processed by the preprocessor  as described in more detail below. Among other things, the preprocessor  may remove data enclosed in brackets as well as the brackets themselves. The analysis engine  may generate, e.g., on the display , an analysis report . The analysis report  may specify the test artifacts or any other analysis details that the system  determines.","An artifact may be a tangible by-product produced during the development of software (e.g. a use case or a class diagram). Artifacts of a software project may be or resemble deliverables of the software project, though the software itself (i.e. the released end-product) may not be an artifact. A test artifact may be a tangible by-product produced during software testing. Test artifacts may relate to a characteristic of a requirement statement. Examples of test artifacts may include an indication of one or more of the following: requirement testability, requirement intent, requirement category, requirement data and requirement ambiguity. Testability artifacts, intent artifacts, category artifacts, and data artifacts may be examples of test artifacts, as well as or alternatively an ambiguous phrase identified in a requirement statement. For example, the test artifacts may include: Testability , specifying, for example, whether the requirement statement is testable; Intent , specifying, for example, the intent or purpose of the requirement statement; Category , specifying, for example, what type of requirement the requirement statement establishes; Data , specifying, for example, the data that the requirement statement operates on; and Ambiguity , specifying whether all or parts of a requirement statement are ambiguous with regard to its testability. The system  may determine additional, fewer, or different artifacts, including grammatical correctness of the requirement statement in whole or in part.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 2-9","b":["102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","102"]},"(1) Modal verbs connect to the subject and object, as in the requirement statement : \u201cThe system should display the numbers in ascending order.\u201d (2) Modal verbs connect to the subject and a preposition or participle, as in the requirement statement : \u201cThe numbers displayed should be in ascending order.\u201d (3) The modal verb connects to the subject through a participle and in turn connects to an object\/preposition\/participle, as in the requirement statement : \u201cThe numbers are required to be displayed in ascending order.\u201d","Not all requirement statements are testable. For example, \u201cProject staffing report is defined as a report containing information about the project name, project description, total employee count, staffing status.\u201d The system  determines that this statement is not testable because none of the testability rules fire. One reason is that this requirement statement gives the definition of the report, but does not tell how the report can be generated. As such, the requirement statement fits better into the assumptions section of the requirement document. Another example is, \u201cResource allocation request is associated with only one role.\u201d This requirement statement is not clearly a requirement to be coded or a logical association made by the requirement writer. If it is to be encoded, it is better phrased included a modal verb, such as, \u201cThe resource allocation request should be associated with only one role.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 2 and 3"],"b":["300","102","302","102","304","102","306","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","404","402","404","102","406","408","102","410"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","504","502","504","102","506","508","102","510"]},"A compound sentence or statement may be a sentence or statement that has multiple subjects.

The intent may be the most atomic unit that conveys enough information for a test to be made. In some cases, the intent may be a set of words along a path of links bounded by noun phrases. The intents of a requirement statement may be represented by an intent artifact. The links of the requirement statement identified by a grammatical parser may be traversed in order to identify the intents. A grammatical parser may, for example, be implemented as a syntactic parser or a dependency parser, such as a dependency parser with an extensible dictionary. Static text may be added to each intent through an intent template, i.e. action, (discussed in more detail below) in order to maintain the meaning of the intent. Identifying test intents may increase the comprehensibility of the requirement statement by breaking the requirement statement into individual testable components, such as test steps corresponding to the requirement statement. Intents may be useful when analyzing long requirement statements and\/or may be used to remove syntactic ambiguity (such as ambiguity arising from the structure of the requirement statement). Intents may also act as a proxy to estimate the amount of testing effort needed to test a requirement statement. Other uses may be possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"800"},"In the first requirement statement , the system  determines that two applicable categories are Input and Security. The Input category is applicable due to the noun\/verb construct \u201cuser enters,\u201d while the Security category is applicable due to the presence of the word \u201cpassword.\u201d In the requirement statement , the system  determines that the applicable category is Non-Functional Requirement (NFR), due to the presence of the non-functional requirement \u201cwithin 3 seconds.\u201d A NFR may define characteristics such as performance, availability, or other non-functional aspects, as opposed to functional or behavioral aspects.","In some systems, it may be useful or necessary to determine whether the requirement statement can be categorized as NFR, Input\/Output, or Intermodule. Syntactic patterns and semantic rules may be used to determine whether the requirement statement is in the \u2018Input\/Output\u2019 or \u2018Intermodule\u2019 category. For example, a requirement statement in one of these two categories may be characterized by two noun phrases connected by either a verb or an adverb. According to a more specific example, if both the noun phrases are \u201csystem\u201d nouns, the category may be \u2018Intermodule\u2019. If one of the nouns is a \u201cperson noun\u201d, the requirement statement may be categorized as \u2018Input\/Output\u2019. Semantic rules may be used with a category glossary  to determine what constitutes \u201csystem nouns\u201d, and \u201cperson nouns\u201d.","In some systems and methods, a requirement statement may be categorized as Security if any phrase from a security glossary is present in the requirement statement. Other examples are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","902","904","906","908","102","902","906","102","904"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["102","102","102"]},"The system  may also include a set of pattern matching rules which identify link structure patterns, referred to as primary structures, that determine test artifacts including the initial intents of the requirement statement. In addition, a set of extended rules identify extensions to the initial intents to provide secondary intents. The extended rules may analyze noun, verb modifiers, gerunds and other modifiers, as examples. A set of entity mapping rules maps noun phrases and verb phrases to a keyword list or glossary to categorize requirements into test categories. The system  may also include a set of quantifier constraints (and other modifiers) that identify test data and logic to generate a test data range. Example implementations of the rulesets are provided in the tables below. The system  may implement additional, fewer, or different rulesets to analyze requirements statements for additional, fewer, or different test artifacts.","In some systems and methods, the rules in a ruleset may specify a contiguous set of links that must be present in a requirement statement. For example, the testability ruleset may specify a contiguous set of links that must be present in a requirement statement in order for the requirement statement to be classified as testable.

To address this situation, the system  may modify the parser logic dictionary to treat all unknown words as a noun, and associate with the unknown words with the links given to recognized nouns. The system  may also handle verbs used as nouns, as with the word \u201cupdate\u201d in the example \u201cThe system should disable the update button.\u201d In one implementation, the system  identifies as dual use words those words that may be used both as a verb and as a noun, updates the parser logic dictionary to indicate that the dual use words may be used as both a verb and a noun, and associates the links given to verbs and nouns with the dual use words. Words may be identified as dual use words in many ways, such as by scanning a dictionary or other grammatical database such as the Word Net\u2122 database (wordnet.princeton.edu). Identifying dual use words in the parser logic dictionary may be advantageous in some instances, such as where a requirement statement might not otherwise be properly parsed, like where a noun may be incorrectly identified as a verb.","The pre-processed requirement statement is passed onto the parser logic . If no linkages are found by the parser logic  (null count>0), the system  highlights the requirement statement as grammatically incorrect. If the parser logic  has found a complete linkage, then the parser output, including grammatical links between words and phrases, the constituent tree and the classification of words into the parts of speech (which may be based on the suffix put after the input words) are saved in memory . The constituent tree may classify the words in the requirement statement into parts of speech and arranges words into phrases. The parser output may be evaluated by the analysis logic , including, for example, by submission of the parser output and requirement statement  as input data to one or more analysis rulesets . The rules within the analysis rulesets that fire on the input data indicate the test artifacts  for the requirement statements.","Furthermore, the analysis logic  may reference one or more glossaries, such as, for example, the ambiguity glossary , conformance glossary , usability glossary , entity glossary , and category glossary  as noted in the rules below to facilitate processing the requirement statement . The glossaries may be leveraged from the document commenting and analysis applications (DARAs) identified below and incorporated by reference.","The example analysis rulesets given below show the condition to be checked on the parser outputs  of the parser logic , the corresponding action to be taken, and whether a specific test artifact  is determined.

As examples, time data, date data, numeric data, and Boolean data may be present. The system  may recognize test data associated with a numeral, a unit, a condition (such as a relational symbol like <, >, =, <=, >=), a variable that takes values. Furthermore, the system  may recognize that a requirement statement includes multiple instances of test data, linked by conjunctions or a range, as examples. The system  may identify units of data by pulling out the immediate post nominal link from the identified data. Particular links may be analyzed for time and date. Similarly, the system  finds units when the data is in a range (e.g., The password should be between 8 and 10 characters). The system  may further identify the condition (such as a relational symbol like <, >, etc). To that end, the system  may identify the pronominal modifier to the data (e.g., The password should be less than 10 characters).","With regard to numerals, the system  may recognize natural numbers, fractions, and decimals, time (e.g., 5:35), date (e.g., first, 1st).

The parser logic  may include a dictionary that lists the various numerals and other parts of speech that may occur in an English sentence (e.g., 1, first 2011, and so on). The system  may employ a modified dictionary for the parser logic  to supply a suffix of \u201c.#\u201d to each occurrence of such a numeral, similar to the way in which the parser logical may apply of suffix of \u201c.v\u201d to verbs, \u201c.a\u201d to adjectives, \u201c.ti\u201d to time or date.","The parser logic  may output tags for time units that include a suffix of .ti\u2192for am, pm, a.m., p.m., o'clock & o-clock, with the numeral connected with an ND link.

Given a resulting simplified sentence, the analysis logic  may apply any other desired rulesets, such as the ambiguity ruleset (), the intent ruleset (), the category ruleset (), or the data ruleset () to determine any desired test artifacts for the requirement statement. Each resulting simplified sentence may include the modal verb of the compound sentence from which it is derived. Simplifying a compound sentence and applying the rulesets to simple sentences derived from the compound sentence may resolve ambiguity in the compound sentence and improve the accuracy and utility of test artifacts. The analysis logic  may store the determined test artifacts in memory (). A reporting module running in the system  may then read the test artifact results and generate and display an analysis report  ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0137","num":"0136"},"figref":["FIGS. 12-39","FIG. 36"],"b":["3602","1014","3602","3604","3606","3608","3610","3604","3612","3614","3616"]},"The constituent tree  shows how the requirement statement  is composed by individual grammatical units.

For any software project and in particular for large-sized software implementation projects, it is critical to identify and analyze if the functional requirement specifications, written in natural language (e.g., the English language), are testable in terms of business and user acceptance criteria. For example, a business analyst, test architect, or other personnel may benefit from knowing whether a functional requirement is un-ambiguously testable, what would be the intents of such tests (e.g., what functional\/non-functional needs would those requirements be tested for), what category of test would the requirement belong to, and if there are any test data embedded in the requirement. These are significant test artifacts to identify and understand because in absence of such an exercise early in the test analysis and design phase, many ambiguous requirements may propagate downstream.","This gives rise to improper, ambiguous, or un-defined test specifications. Test case generation and test coverage may suffer as well. Also, from such imprecise test specifications, one cannot prepare a valid testing plan and estimate the testing effort required, and determine whether the functional coverage will be adequately achieved through testing. Although test cases can be generated automatically from properly specified and elaborate requirements and models, the activity of testability checking and generation of early testing artifacts from high-level functional requirements has been in the past mainly manual, subjective and error-prone. In contrast, the system  provides a novel automated framework for identification and analysis for early testing artifacts from functional requirement sentences. The framework leverages natural language processing techniques to obtain structural dependencies in the sentence (e.g., a requirement statement) and parts-of-speech phrase tagging. The system  employs a set of pattern matching rules to identify syntactic structure(s) of possible test intents, and a set of entity\/keyword mapping rules to identify and tag test category and data from the phrases and mark ambiguity, if any.","Requirements testing systems and methods may be used for testing a requirement statement. Requirements testing systems may gather and analyze sentences to determine if the sentence is testable, invoke sentence simplifier rules to simplify the sentence, and extract test artifacts about the sentence. For example, in gathering and analyzing sentences to determine testability, some systems may execute pre-processing rulesets on the gathered sentences. The pre-processed sentences may be submitted to a parser logic which may be used to determine if the sentence is valid. Where the sentence is valid, the outputs from the parser logic may be stored and a testability ruleset may be applied to the sentence. Where the sentence is testable, the simplifier rules, such as compound sentence rules and conditional statement rules, may be applied to the sentence to simplify the sentence. Then, the various test artifact rules, such as ambiguity rules, test data rules, intent rules, and\/or category rules may be applied to the sentence. The test artifacts obtained from the application of these rules may be stored. Such test artifacts may be used in reports or other analysis or processing as discussed.","In some requirements testing systems and methods, a requirement statement is obtained and stored in a memory. The requirement statement is submitted to a grammatical parser executed by a processor to obtain parser outputs characterizing the requirement statement. A test artifact ruleset is applied with the processor to the parser outputs to determine a test artifact applicable to the requirement statement.","These and other requirements testing systems and methods allow for developers to check for testability and various features of statements and documents. Another benefit of the requirements testing system is that it facilitates creation of test artifacts from requirement statements. The test artifacts reduce testing cycle time, effort, and expense, and improve test quality. As a result, the resulting software application is more reliable, less expensive, and is more timely delivered. This allows developers to implement complex statements and documents in less time and with fewer mistakes or ambiguities, increasing efficiency and effectiveness of the requirements statements. Requirements testing systems also result in various other advantages and effects.","The methods, systems, and logic described above may be implemented in many different ways in many different combinations of hardware, software or both hardware and software. For example, the logic executed by the system  may be circuitry in a controller, a microprocessor, or an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or may be implemented with discrete logic, or a combination of other types of circuitry. The logic may be encoded or stored in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium such as a compact disc read only memory (CDROM), magnetic or optical disk, flash memory, random access memory (RAM) or read only memory (ROM), erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM) or other machine-readable medium as, for example, instructions for execution by a processor, controller, or other processing device. Similarly, the memory in the system may be volatile memory, such as Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) or Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), or non-volatile memory such as NAND Flash or other types of non-volatile memory, or may be combinations of different types of volatile and non-volatile memory. When instructions implement the logic, the instructions may be part of a single program, separate programs, implemented in an application programming interface (API), in libraries such as Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), or distributed across multiple memories and processors. The system  may test input sentences other than requirement statements.","While various embodiments have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible. For example, a method for testing a requirement statement may be provided. The method may include obtaining a requirement statement and storing the requirement statement in a memory. The method may further include submitting the requirement statement to a grammatical parser executed by a processor to obtain parser outputs characterizing the requirement statement. The method may further include applying a test artifact ruleset with the processor to the parser outputs to determine a test artifact applicable to the requirement statement.","In some cases, applying the test artifact ruleset includes applying a testability ruleset with the processor to the parser outputs to determine a test artifact that indicates whether the requirement statement is testable. Additionally or alternatively, it may be that applying the test artifact ruleset includes applying an ambiguity ruleset with the processor to the parser outputs to determine a test artifact that indicates whether the requirement statement is ambiguous with respect to testability. Additionally or alternatively, applying the test artifact ruleset may include applying an intent ruleset with the processor to the parser outputs to determine a test artifact that indicates an intent characteristic of the requirement statement. Additionally or alternatively, applying the test artifact ruleset may include applying a category ruleset with the processor to the parser outputs to determine a test artifact that indicates a category characteristic of the requirement statement. Additionally or alternatively, applying the test artifact ruleset may include applying a data ruleset with the processor to the parser outputs to determine a test artifact that indicates a data characteristic of the requirement statement. Additionally or alternatively, the method may further include executing a pre-processor on the requirement statement prior to submitting the requirement statement to the grammatical parser.","According to another aspect, a computer program product including computer-readable instructions may be provided. The instructions, when loaded and executed on a computer system, may cause the computer system to perform operations according to the steps (aspect and\/or embodiments) discussed above.","According to yet another aspect, a requirement statement analysis system may be provided. The system may include a processor and a memory in communication with the processor. The memory may include a requirement statement and grammatical parser logic. The memory may further include analysis logic operable to, when executed by the processor obtain the requirement statement and store the requirement statement in the memory. When executed, the analysis logic may be further operable to submit the requirement statement to the grammatical parser logic and obtain parser outputs characterizing the requirement statement. The analysis logic may be further operable to apply a test artifact ruleset to the parser outputs to determine a test artifact applicable to the requirement statement.","In some cases the test artifact ruleset may include a testability ruleset configured to determine, as the test artifact, whether the requirement statement is testable. Additionally or alternatively, the test artifact ruleset may include an ambiguity ruleset configured to determine, as the test artifact, whether the requirement statement is ambiguous with regard to testability. Additionally or alternatively, the test artifact ruleset may include an intent ruleset configured to determine, as the test artifact, an intent characteristic of the requirement statement. Additionally or alternatively, the test artifact ruleset may include a category ruleset configured to determine, as the test artifact, a category characteristic of the requirement statement.
