{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under contract no. DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates generally to sample pretreatment for microanalytical systems and, more particularly, to a biological preconcentrator for selective absorption and desorption of proteins from a fluid stream.","Micrototal analysis systems (\u03bcTAS), which have also been termed \u201cchemical laboratories on a chip,\u201d are being developed to enable the rapid and sensitive detection of particular chemicals and biochemicals, including pollutants, high explosives, chemical and biological warfare agents, and genomic and proteomic materials. Micrototal analysis systems enable vast improvements in cost, speed, sample and reagent usage, and sample throughput by the integration of fluid manipulation and the different steps of an analytical process into a single microfluidic device. In particular, the microfluidic device seeks to integrate the analytical steps of sample injection, pretreatment, separation, and detection on a single microchip.","A sample to be analyzed generally undergoes sample preparation or pretreatment prior to an actual analysis. Sample pretreatment may involve extracting the sample from a matrix, purification of the sample to remove interferents, derivatization to make the sample more detectable, or analyte preconcentration. In particular, a sample preconcentrator can serve the important function of collecting, purifying, and boosting the concentration of a target analyte to improve detection capability and to discriminate against interferents. Especially for trace analysis, preconcentration of target analytes may enable orders-of-magnitude concentration enhancements, thereby easing separation and detector sensitivity requirements. However, the integration of sample pretreatment into microfluidic devices remains one of the major hurdles to the miniaturization of \u03bcTAS. Integration of the sample pretreatment with the microfluidic device is particularly challenging due to the requirement to localize specific analytes from an open flow system and the wide variation and complexity of the samples that need to be analyzed. See e.g., Lichtenberg et al., \u201cSample pretreatment on microfabricated devices,\u201d 56, 233 (2002).","Preconcentrators for \u03bcTAS have typically used a passive stationary phase or sorptive medium to retain the analyte for subsequent elution in a more concentrated form. Preferably, the sorptive medium can selectively extract and isolate the target analyte while having a low affinity for other compounds and interferents in the sample stream. Microfluidic systems for manipulating biological fluids have consisted of passive chromatographic media that selectively adsorb solution species, such as proteins, to promote preconcentration or other functions. However, such passive preconcentrators may not provide sufficiently rapid switching to keep up with the fluid flow rate requirements of the separation and detection steps of the \u03bcTAS.","The present invention comprises a biological preconcentrator in which the adsorption and desorption processes are actively switched in response to external stimulation. The critical components required to perform the active switching include an active film whose surface properties can be made to change in response to controlled external stimulation and an integrated platform that can provide the appropriate stimulus to the active film within a fluidic environment.","A biological preconcentrator comprises a platform having a substrate, a suspended membrane formed thereon, and a means for heating the membrane; and an active polymer film disposed on a flow-channel-side of the membrane capable of absorbing at least one protein from a fluidic sample in a flow channel of the platform when the active polymer film is heated above a critical transition temperature. The biological preconcentrator can further comprise a means for cooling the membrane to desorb the at least one protein when the active polymer film is cooled below the critical transition temperature. The active polymer film can comprise a hydrogel-type polymer that is hydrophobic above and hydrophilic below the critical transition temperature.","A biological preconcentrator comprises a stimulus-responsive active film on a stimulus-producing microfabricated platform. Such active films can comprise stimulus-responsive or \u2018smart\u2019 polymers that undergo strong, nonlinear conformation changes in response to small environmental stimuli (e.g., changes in pH, temperature, ionic strength, or electrical field). A particular class of stimulus-responsive polymers include hydrogels that exhibit reversible swelling behavior and switchable hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties when exposed to small temperature changes about a critical transition temperature. The stimulus-producing platform can comprise a low-power heater (or cooler) on an integrated membrane upon which the thermally responsive polymer is grown. The integrated platform can be configured with fluidic channels to transport analyte-containing fluids over the active polymer film. The temperature control system can preferably provide high heating and\/or cooling rates to enable rapid switching of the active polymer film. The active polymer film can thereby rapidly absorb and desorb analytes to keep up with fluid flow rates and separation and detection requirements. This rapid switching can be achieved with the thermally isolated, low mass membrane upon which the heating and\/or cooling elements are fabricated.","A suitable platform comprises a low-heat capacity, low-loss microhotplate to thermally stimulate an active film on the microhotplate.  is a schematic illustration of an exemplary biological preconcentrator  of the present invention that uses a microhotplate platform. The biological preconcentrator  comprises an active film  disposed on a flow-channel-side of a membrane  suspended from a substrate  and a resistive heater  disposed on the membrane  for heating the membrane  and the active film  attached thereto. The biological preconcentrator  can be made of semiconductor-based materials, such as silicon, silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride. Many of the candidate active films  of the present invention selectively attach to semiconductor-based materials. If the active film  cannot be attached to the membrane material directly, the biological preconcentrator  can further comprise a support coating  for attachment of the active film . The biological preconcentrator  can further comprise a sealed lid , a fluidic inlet and outlet  for flow of the biological mixture into and out a flow channel , and a temperature control system  to provide electrical current to the resistive heater  and control the temperature of the membrane  and the active film . The biological preconcentrator  can be fabricated by material deposition, photolithography, masking, and etching techniques well-known in the semiconductor industry and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,378 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/035,537, which are incorporated herein by reference.","The suspended membrane  can be a thin, edge-supported dielectric membrane fabricated on the substrate . The substrate  can be a silicon wafer. The membrane  can be a silicon nitride membrane with thickness of about 1 micron. The thin silicon nitride membrane  provides both physical support and electrical insulation for the resistive heater  while maintaining good thermal isolation between the resistive heater  and the substrate . For example, the heat capacity per area of a 0.5 \u03bcm-thickness silicon nitride membrane  is only 3\u00d710J\/K and the thermal conductivity is only 6\u00d710W\/cmK, enabling extremely rapid heating and cooling. The lateral dimensions of the membrane  can range from microns to centimeters. A silicon nitride membrane  that is 2 mm on a side can attain a temperature of 200\u00b0 C. in 6 msec with only 100 mW of electrical heating power.","The resistive heater  can be formed by depositing one or more layers of an electrically conductive material on one or both sides of the membrane . To facilitate temperature measurement and control, the electrically conductive material preferably comprises a metal with a high temperature coefficient of resistance, such as platinum or tungsten. Separate temperature measurement devices can also be used, such as thermoelectrics, diodes, and thermistors. The resistive heater  can comprise a single heating element or multiple heating elements electrically connected in series or in parallel to the power source and temperature controller . The resistive heater  can be patterned to form a circuitous metal trace, which generally has a serpentine or boustrophedon shape. Alternatively, the resistive heater  can be one or more heating elements running the length of the flow channel . Alternatively, the resistive heater  can be one or more resistive heating elements aligned transverse to the flow direction of the fluid sample.","The active film  can comprise a sorptive medium with surface properties that can be made to change in response to controlled external stimulation. The stimulus-responsive sorptive medium can comprise a \u2018smart\u2019 polymer that undergoes strong, nonlinear conformation changes in response to small environmental stimuli (e.g., changes in pH, temperature, ionic strength, or electrical field). For example, the stimulus-responsive polymer can be a hydrogel that exhibits reversible swelling behavior and switchable hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties when exposed to small temperature changes about a critical transition temperature.","Alternative platforms for switching the active film, comprising a thermally isolating low mass support with integral heaters and\/or coolers, can be microfabricated with semiconductor industry technologies. For example, a microbridge can be formed by patterning a thin filament of the resistive heater material on a silicon wafer and underetching the filament to leave a microbridge. The switchable active film can be placed in proximity to the thermally isolated microbridge and integrated fluidic channels can be provided for fluid flow of the sample over the active film on the microbridge. See R. P Manginell et al., \u201cIn-Situ Monitoring of Micro-Chemical Vapor Deposition (\u03bc-CVD): Experimental Results and SPICE Modeling,\u201d 1998 371 (1998) and R. P Manginell et al., \u201cSelective, pulsed CVD of platinum on microfilament gas sensors,\u201d 1996 23 (1996), both of which are incorporated by reference.","Efficient electrical heating and cooling can be used to trap or release analytes in short duration cycles. With the low-heat capacity, low-thermal-loss biological preconcentrator , rapid temperature cycling of the active film  can be obtained without active cooling of the membrane . Temperature gradients on the membrane  can be further controlled by the selective placement of the one or more resistive heaters  and peripheral heat sinks to conduct heat locally from the membrane .","Alternatively, the biological preconcentrator  can further comprise an active cooler. Active cooling may be needed for thermal switching of active films  having a critical transition temperature below ambient. For a below-ambient transition temperature, active or passive heating can then be used to heat the actively cooled film above the critical transition temperature. Active cooling also enables an even higher temperature gradient and greater control of the local temperature. Although other types of cooling means can be used with the present invention, thermoelectric cooling is preferable, because it requires no moving parts or refrigerants and the cooling elements can be easily fabricated with the same semiconductor industry technologies used to fabricate the other components of the biological preconcentrator .","The thermoelectric cooler can comprise one or more junctions of two different conducting materials, one containing positive charge carriers (p-type) and the other negative charge carriers (n-type). When the p-n junction is reverse-biased (i.e., current flows from the n-type material to the p-type material), the dominant charge carriers move away from the junction and carry away heat, thereby cooling the junction. For high efficiency, the junction materials preferably have a low thermal conductivity, to reduce heat conduction from the substrate to the membrane; small electrical resistivity, to minimize Joule heating; and a high Peltier coefficient (or large Seebeck coefficient), to maximize the heat absorbed. For example, the thermoelectrical junction materials can comprise metallic or semiconductor alloys, such as CuNi, NiCr, or BiSb alloys. The junction materials can be vacuum deposited by evaporation or sputtering and can be patterned to form junctions on one or both sides of the membrane, as is known in the semiconductor industry art. See Wunsch et al., \u201cRecent Advances in AC-DC Transfer Measurements using Thin-Film Thermal Converters,\u201d in , October 2000, and Wunsch et al., \u201cA New Fabrication Process for Planar Thin-Film Multijunction Thermal Converters,\u201d presented at the Measurement Science Conference, Anaheim, Calif., January 2001, both of which are incorporated by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["12","14","20","12","14","20","21","12","22","23","20","21","12"]},"Finite element modeling of the biological preconcentrator  indicates that temperature gradients of greater than 0.1\u00b0 C.\/micron can be attained with the thermally isolated membrane  using localized resistive heating. Even higher local temperature gradients can be achieved by placing the hot junction  of a thermoelectric converter  adjacent to the cold junction  on the membrane . Therefore, a thermal zone with a temperature above the transition temperature of the active film  can be maintained on the membrane  only a few microns from a neighboring thermal zone with a temperature that is below the transition temperature. Excellent temperature localization and resolution of thermal zones can therefore be obtained. Consequently, highly localized concentrations of selected analytes can be achieved with the biological preconcentrator  by patterning distinct regions of analyte-adsorbing active film side-by-side in different thermal zones on the same membrane . Each thermal zone can be individually temperature programmed due to the thermal isolation obtainable with the biological preconcentrator .","A matrix of active zones can thereby be created on a membrane  in which both the temperature and active film type are separately controlled. The matrix can comprise a one-dimensional matrix of thermal zones arrayed in the flow direction of a linear membrane. Alternatively, a two-dimensional matrix of thermal zones can be similarly created on a planar membrane, making it possible to separate out many more analytes from a fluid flow. Alternatively, individual membranes can be fabricated adjacent to one-another on the same chip. For example, such a thermally zoned biological preconcentrator enables the collection and detection of multiple proteins from a single sample comprising a mixture of proteins. The selected proteins can then be analyzed directly on the biological preconcentrator with a spatially discriminating detector, such as by fluorescence detection of tagged proteins, or by temperature-programmed release of the proteins to a separator and\/or detector.","In  is shown a biological preconcentrator  with separately controlled thermal zones along the flow direction of the linear membrane . The separate thermal zones are achieved by individual resistive heating elements  aligned transverse to the flow direction (in the example shown, the resistive heating elements  are disposed on the side of the membrane  opposite the flow channel ). The conductive traces  from the resistive heating elements  can run out to bond pads  for electrical connection to a temperature control system (not shown). Individual current control of the resistive heating elements  can thereby provide localized thermal zones of the active film  disposed on the opposite, flow-channel-side of the membrane .","The active film  can comprise a hydrogel-type polymer that undergoes a swelling transition in water that is activated by changes in temperature. Temperature-induced changes in the polymer conformation alter the chemistry of the surface to promote adsorption or desorption of analytes contained in fluids in contact with the polymer film. In particular, a temperature-programmed active film  containing such a polymer can be used to concentrate target proteins in a dilute protein-containing sample stream for subsequent protein separation and\/or analysis.","Hydrogel-type polymers suitable for reversible protein adsorption by the active film  include poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) that exhibit an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) in water. Below the UCST (e.g., 35\u00b0 C. for PNIPAM), the polymer swells in water to create a hydrophilic surface. Above the UCST, the polymer undergoes a conformation change that collapses the polymer, expels water, and creates a more hydrophobic surface. Globular proteins, such as myoglobin, adhere more strongly to hydrophobic surfaces than hydrophilic ones. Therefore, proteins can be selectively trapped from dilute solutions of proteins mixtures by heating the active polymer film above the UCST. Conversely, the target proteins can be released by cooling the active polymer film below the UCST.","For a practical biological preconcentrator , the polymers having an UCST are preferably tethered to the membrane  or support coating . Otherwise, polymers that are soluble in water below their UCST, such as PNIPAM, would be swept away by fluid in the flow channel . A tethered active polymer film  can be created on a silicon surface using a surface-initiated polymerization that yields a high graft-density, defect-free polymer monolayer. The surface-initiated polymerization comprises attaching a silane coupling agent containing an initiating pendant group to an oxide layer on the silicon surface and supplying monomer to the initiating pendant group, thereby growing a polymer in situ. The initiating pendant group can comprise any free radical producing moiety, such as an azo or peroxide group. Alternatively, the free radical can be generated from an initiator compound in solution and transferred to a surface-attached silane coupling agent to initiate the polymerization.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["11","41","42","43","12"]},"Due to the extremely high chain transfer constant of the mercapto group and the locally high concentration if the silane coupling agent at the silicon surface, the polymerization can be viewed as a surface-bound telomerization that produces a large number of relatively low molecular weight polymers. A pinhole-free active film is preferable to prevent uncontrolled adsorption of protein. The surface telomerization produces an active film with no pinhole defects that would allow protein access to uncoated surface. The reagents are not limited to mercapto group agents, but can include other chain transfer agents on the surface such as halide, amine, carboxylic acid, carbonyl, or hydroxyl groups. Alternative solution-based free-radical generators can include azo, peroxide, persulfate, or other thermal or redox initiators.","Protein is rapidly adsorbed by the active PolyNIPAM film, formed by the above surface telomerization process, when the active PolyPINAM film is locally heated above the UCST of 35\u00b0 C. The active PolyNIPAM film can be held on the silicon surface for long periods of time without deleterious effects to the protein or the polymer by maintaining the elevated temperature. The absorbed proteins can be analyzed in-situ by fluorescence detection or other means. Alternatively, the underlying membrane can be cooled, swelling the active PolyPINAM film and rapidly releasing the protein in a response time of less than 1 second. The absorbed and preconcentrated protein can thereby be rapidly released to a separation and\/or detection element of a \u03bcTAS.","The embodiments of the present invention have been described as a biological preconcentrator with a switchable active film layer. It will be understood that the above description is merely illustrative of the applications of the principles of the present invention, the scope of which is to be determined by the claims viewed in light of the specification. Other variants and modifications of the invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art. In particular, the silicon micromachined microhotplate-based biological preconcentrator is just an example of a thermal platform that is suitable for the present invention. Other methods, materials and fabrication technologies can be used to fabricate the biological preconcentrator. For example, conventional machining, plastic fabrication and ceramic technology can also be used. The biological preconcentrator need only to provide a platform to generate localized temperature zones where an active polymer film, such as PolyNIPAM, can trap and release the desired proteins."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and form part of the specification, illustrate the present invention and, together with the description, describe the invention.
