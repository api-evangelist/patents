In one or more embodiments of the invention, settings include one or more parameters that define the operation of the page skipping application (). For example, a setting may be that the page skipping feature is enabled when the mobile device is moved and\/or rotated from side to side. As another example, a setting may be that the mobile device must be held vertically to be properly oriented for the page skipping feature. As a further example, a different movement or set of movements may cause the page skipping feature to skip to the first or last page of the user application. The settings () stored in the storage repository () may be associated with a page skipping feature involving the user or a number of users.","Continuing with , the storage repository () is a persistent storage device (or set of devices) that stores software and data used to skip a number of pages of a user application. The storage repository () may also store one or more applications with multi-page support. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the storage repository () is configured to store the settings () in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.

In one or more embodiments of the invention, the page skipping application () includes functionality to skip pages of a user application displayed on the mobile device (). More specifically, the page skipping application () may be configured to receive, for example, a user application with multi-page support, multi-page content, user preferences, and settings from the application interface () and store the settings in the storage repository (). The functions of the page skipping application () may be performed on a single computing device or on multiple computing devices. When the functions of the page skipping application () are performed on multiple computing devices, a number of configurations and\/or frameworks may be used.

Specifically, the page skipping engine () may be configured to coordinate the transfer of, for example, a user application with multi-page support, multi-page content, user preferences, settings, requests, and payment information between the application interface (), the storage repository (), and the other components of the page skipping application ().","Further, the page skipping engine () may be configured to retrieve the settings () from, and send settings to, the storage repository () for use by the page skipping engine () or by other components of the page skipping application (). The page skipping engine () may also be configured to retrieve settings () from the storage repository () to be sent to the user () and\/or one or more content services ().","Continuing with , the page skipping engine () is configured to receive notification of a user application displayed on the mobile device (). In one or more embodiments of the invention, a user application is a software program with multi-page support displayed on the mobile device (). A page may be any division or portion of the content displayed in the user application, where the collection of pages displayed in a user application creates the entire content displayed in the user application. A page may include, but is not limited to, a page (as in a page of a book), a tab (as in a spreadsheet), a section, a chapter, and a sheet.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the page skipping engine () is further configured to determine whether the user application displayed on the mobile device () can use the page skipping feature of the page skipping application (). The page skipping engine () may make such a determination by evaluating the user application. For example, the page skipping engine () may determine that the user application supports multiple pages, and so the user application can use the page skipping feature of the page skipping application (). The page skipping engine () may also receive information about the user application displayed on the mobile device (). Examples of such information may include, but is not limited to, a current page displayed in the user application and a total number of pages loaded in the user application.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the page skipping engine () is further configured to process a movement of the mobile device (). Specifically, the page skipping engine () may be configured to use information provided by the accelerometer module () and the calculating module () to determine and present, based on skipping a number of pages from a current page, a target page of the user application on the mobile device (). For example, if a current page is page 2 of a 200 page document displayed in a user application, and if the number of pages to skip (as calculated by the calculating module (), described below) is 155, then the page skipping engine () determines that the target page is page 157 of the document. As a result, the page skipping engine () sends a notification to the user application to display page 157 of the document on the mobile device ().","The page skipping engine () may also be configured to determine whether the user application has been exited in embodiments of the invention. Specifically, the page skipping engine () may be configured to determine whether the user application is active on the mobile device (). The page skipping engine () may also be configured to determine whether the page skipping feature has been disabled, as from a change in the settings.","Continuing with , the accelerometer module () is configured to detect a movement of the mobile device (). The accelerometer module () may use an accelerometer () and\/or a gyroscope () to detect the movement of the mobile device (). In one or more embodiments of the invention, the accelerometer () is one or more devices (real or virtual) that measure the acceleration (and in some cases the orientation) of the mobile device (). The optional gyroscope () may be one or more devices that measure the orientation of the mobile device (). The accelerometer () and\/or gyroscope () may be part of the accelerometer module (). Alternatively, the accelerometer () and\/or gyroscope () may be located on a different portion of the mobile device (). Devices (e.g., accelerometer (), gyroscope ()) used to measure acceleration and\/or orientation are known to those skilled in the art.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the orientation of the mobile device () is a description of how the mobile device () is placed at a point (i.e., location) in space. The orientation of the mobile device () is made with reference to one or more locations on the mobile device (). For example, the mobile device () may have a top, a bottom, a front, a back, a left side, a right side, a number of corners, and a number of sides. Orientation and\/or movement of the mobile device () may be measured at one or more of such locations on the mobile device (). For example, a movement of the mobile device () may be made such that the middle (horizontally) of the mobile device merely rotates while the top and bottom of the mobile device accelerate in opposite directions (i.e., the user holds the middle of the mobile device, one hand on each side, and jerks the top portion of the mobile device downward (and the bottom portion upward) in a rotational motion).","The orientation of the mobile device (), as measured by the accelerometer () and\/or the gyroscope (), may be measured before, during, and\/or after a movement of the mobile device (). For example, the orientation of the mobile device () may be measured before a movement to determine that the mobile device () is properly oriented for skipping pages (i.e., to use the page skipping feature). The orientation of the mobile device () may be used in conjunction with the settings to enable the page skipping feature. For example, the settings may require that the mobile device () is oriented within +\/\u221230\u00b0 of horizontal to enable the page skipping feature.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the accelerometer module () is configured to determine, using the accelerometer () and\/or gyroscope (), that the orientation of the mobile device () triggers the page skipping feature. For example, the accelerometer module () may determine that the mobile device (), when oriented in a horizontal position, is oriented to enable the page skipping feature.","The acceleration of the mobile device (), as measured by the accelerometer (), may be a maximum acceleration at any location on the mobile device () during a movement, an average acceleration at one location on the mobile device () during a movement, an average acceleration at all locations on the mobile device () during a movement, or some other acceleration associated with a movement of the mobile device (). The acceleration of the mobile device () may be measured regardless of the orientation of the mobile device (). Further, the acceleration of the mobile device () may include a magnitude and a direction. The magnitude may be measured on a scale (e.g., 5 out of 10), as a percentage (e.g., 20%), or using some other suitable measure of the magnitude of the movement. The direction may be one of a pair of designations (e.g., back\/forward, positive\/negative) to indicate whether the target page is prior to or after the current page. The direction of the acceleration, in some cases combined with the settings, may determine whether the acceleration is positive or negative.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the accelerometer module () determines, using the accelerometer (), that the movement of the mobile device () triggers the page skipping feature. For example, the accelerometer module () may determine that a slow tilt of the mobile device () is insufficient to trigger the page skipping feature. As another example, the accelerometer module () may determine that a quick, jerking motion of the mobile device (), tilting the top portion of the mobile device downward, is sufficient to trigger the page skipping feature. The accelerator module () may also determine the magnitude and\/or direction of the movement.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the settings are used by the accelerometer module () to determine whether the movement triggers the page skipping feature. For example, a setting may require that the accelerometer () detect a minimum acceleration before the page skipping feature is triggered. A movement of the mobile device () that fails to meet the minimum acceleration requirement of the settings will result in the current page continuing to be displayed on the mobile device ().","Continuing with , the calculating module () is configured to calculate the number of pages to skip in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. The calculating module () may receive the magnitude and direction of the movement, as determined by the accelerometer module (). The calculating module () may use the magnitude and direction of the movement, as well as the settings, to calculate the number of pages to skip. For example, the magnitude may be 8 out of 10, the direction may be forward, and the settings may require that the magnitude of the movement be directly and linearly proportional to the total number of pages in the user application, up to the number of pages between the last page and the current page of the user application. As such, when the current page is 1 and the total number of pages in the user application is 100, the calculating module () calculates that the number of pages to skip as a result of the movement to be 80.","Continuing with , the processor () within the mobile device () is configured to execute software in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. Specifically, the processor () may be configured to execute instructions for the mobile device () or any of the engines, modules, and repositories described above and shown in , as well as software used by the user () and\/or one or more content services (). The processor () may be an integrated circuit, a central processing unit, a multi-core processing chip, a multi-chip module including multiple multi-core processing chips, or other hardware processor. The processor () may be known by other names, including but not limited to a computer processor, a microprocessor, a hardware processor, and a multi-core processor. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the processor () is configured to execute software instructions stored in memory (). The memory () may include one or more cache memories, main memory, and\/or any other suitable type of memory. The memory () may be discretely located on the mobile device () relative to the processor (). In certain configurations, the memory () may also be integrated with the processor ().","Optionally, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the security module () is configured to secure interactions between the mobile device () and the user () and\/or a content service (). More specifically, the security module () may be configured to authenticate communication from software based on security keys verifying the identity of the source of the communication. For example, user software may be associated with a security key enabling the user software to interact with the mobile device (). Further, the security module () may be configured to restrict requests for information (e.g., activation of a user application, settings), as well as access to information. For example, the user software may be restricted to only access multi-page content purchased by a specific user. Further, the user software may be restricted to provide only particular settings associated with a user.","As discussed above, the user and content service may use a user system and content service system, respectively. One or more of the user system and content service system may be, or may contain a form of, an Internet-based or an intranet-based mobile computer (e.g., laptop computer) that is capable of communicating with the user software. A mobile computer may include any type of computing device and\/or communication device, including but not limited to mobile device (). Examples of the user system and content service system may include, but are not limited to, a desktop computer with Internet or intranet access, a laptop computer with Internet or intranet access, a smart phone, a server, a server farm, and a personal digital assistant (PDA). The user system and\/or content service system may correspond to a mobile computer as described below with regard to .","Further, as discussed above, the user system and\/or content service system may each have corresponding software (e.g., user software and content service software, respectively). The user software and content service software, may execute on a separate device (e.g., a server, mainframe, desktop personal computer (PC), laptop, personal desktop assistant (PDA), television, cable box, satellite box, kiosk, telephone, mobile phone, or other computing devices) from the mobile device (), the user () and\/or the one or more content services (), and may be coupled by a network (e.g., Internet, Intranet, Extranet, Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), or other network communication methods), with wire and\/or wireless segments. The user software may also be part of, or operate separately but in conjunction with, the mobile device () and\/or the one or more content services ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 2A and 2B"]},"Referring to , in Step , settings are received. The settings may be received from a user, and\/or some or all of the settings may be set by default.

In one or more embodiments of the invention, a particular computing device, as described, for example, in  below, is used to receive the notification of the user application on the mobile device.","In Step , a determination is made as to whether the user application can use the page skipping feature. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user application is configured to use the page skipping feature when the user application is displaying content with multiple pages, tabs, sections, or other suitable division of portions of the user application. The determination as to whether the user application can use the page skipping feature may rely, at least in part, on the settings. For example, the setting may require that the page skipping feature only apply to a user application displaying at least 15 pages of content. In such a case, if a user application is displaying 20 pages, then the user application can use the page skipping feature. In one or more embodiments of the invention, a particular computing device, as described, for example, in  below, is used to determine whether the user application can use the page skipping feature. If the user application can use the page skipping feature, then the process proceeds to Step . If the user application cannot use the page skipping feature, then the process ends.","In Step , information about the user application is received. In one or more embodiments of the invention, information is any data about the user application that is needed for the page skipping feature. Examples of information may include, but are not limited to, a total number of pages of the user application and a current page of the user application displayed on the mobile device. In one or more embodiments of the invention, a particular computing device, as described, for example, in  below, is used to receive the information about the user application.","In Step , a movement of the mobile device is processed. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the movement may be any movement or combination of movements of the mobile device. For example, the mobile device may be lifted, bumped, turned, tilted, rotated, flipped, jerked, or moved in any other manner. Further, the movement may be in any direction in three-dimensional space. Details of how the movement of the mobile device is processed are described below with respect to . In one or more embodiments of the invention, a particular computing device, as described, for example, in  below, is used to process the movement of the mobile device. After Step  is completed, the process ends.","Referring to , in Step , movement of the mobile device is detected. The movement of the mobile device may be any movement as described above with respect to Step  of . Specifically, the movement may be detected using one or more instruments located on the mobile device. Examples of such instruments may include, but are not limited to, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a compass. In one or more embodiments of the invention, a particular computing device, as described, for example, in  below, is used to detect the movement of the mobile device.","In Step , a determination is made as to whether the mobile device is properly oriented. In one or more embodiments, proper orientation of the mobile device enables the page skipping feature. Proper orientation of the mobile device may be associated with one or more settings, as described above with respect to . For example, a setting may specify the one or more ways that the mobile device must be oriented (e.g., horizontal +\/\u221230\u00b0) for a movement to trigger the page skipping feature. The orientation of the mobile device may be determined by one or more instruments, as described above with respect to Step , located on the mobile device.

For example, the movement required to trigger the page skipping feature may be associated with a particular movement (e.g., a sudden motion) in a particular direction (e.g., horizontally). Specifically, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the movement required to trigger the page skipping feature is based on an acceleration of the mobile device as measured by an accelerometer. Certain movements may also be excluded from triggering the page skipping feature. For example, merely tilting the mobile device may be recognized as failing to trigger the page skipping feature. In one or more embodiments of the invention, a particular computing device, as described, for example, in  below, is used to determine whether the movement triggers the page skipping feature. If the movement triggers the page skipping feature, then the process proceeds to Step . If the movement fails to trigger the page skipping feature, then the process proceeds to Step .","In Step , the number of pages displayed in the user application to skip is calculated based on the movement and the settings. In one or more embodiments of the invention, a magnitude of the movement, combined with the settings, is used to determine the number of pages of content displayed in the user application to skip. The magnitude of the movement may be measured by one or more instruments. Such instruments may include, but are not limited to, the instruments described above with respect to Step . The magnitude of the movement may correspond to the number of pages of content displayed in the user application to skip. For example, if the magnitude of the movement is large, then the number of pages of content displayed in the user application to skip may be large. Specifically, if the magnitude of a movement using an accelerometer is 20 on a scale of 20, then the number of pages of content displayed the user application to skip may be the maximum allowed, according to the settings.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the movement also includes a direction used to determine whether pages displayed in the user application are skipped forward or backward. The direction of the movement may determine whether pages are skipped forward or backward based on the settings. For example, the settings may determine that a movement of the mobile device from left to right skips pages displayed in the user application backward (i.e., toward the beginning of the user application).","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the settings translate the movement into a number of pages of content in the user application to be skipped. Specifically, the settings may set parameters for each movement of the mobile device. For example, the settings may determine the maximum number of pages that may be skipped for a single movement. The settings may also determine whether a movement of the mobile device from right to left skips pages of the user application forward or backward. In one or more embodiments of the invention, a particular computing device, as described, for example, in  below, is used to calculate, based on the movement and the settings, the number of pages of the user application to skip.","In Step , a target page of the user application is presented based on skipping the number of pages from a current page displayed in the user application. The current page displayed in the user application may be the page displayed at the time the movement of the mobile device is detected. For example, if the current page displayed in the user application at the time the movement of the mobile device is detected is page 31, and if the number of pages of content displayed in the user application to skip is calculated to be 72 pages forward, then page 103 (i.e., the target page) of the content is presented on the mobile device. In one or more embodiments of the invention, a particular computing device, as described, for example, in  below, is used to present, based on skipping the number of pages from a current page of the user application, a target page of the user application. After completing Step , the process reverts to Step .","In Step , a determination is made as to whether execution of the user application is terminated. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the execution of the user application is terminated when the user application is no longer active on the mobile device. The user application may be terminated by the user (e.g., closing the user application, activating a different application) and\/or by the occurrence of an event (e.g., the passage of time, the end of a subscription to the content). In one or more embodiments of the invention, a particular computing device, as described, for example, in  below, is used to determine whether the user application is exited. If the user application is not exited, then the process proceeds to Step . If the user application is exited, then the process ends.","In Step , a determination is made as to whether the page skipping feature is disabled. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the page skipping feature is disabled when any movement of the mobile device fails to trigger the page skipping feature. The page skipping feature may be disabled by the user and\/or by the occurrence of an event (e.g., passage of time triggering a sleep timer based on the settings). In one or more embodiments of the invention, a particular computing device, as described, for example, in  below, is used to determine whether the page skipping feature is disabled. If the page skipping feature is not disabled, then the process reverts to Step . If the page skipping feature is disabled, then the process ends.","The following description (in conjunction with ) describes an example in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. The example is for explanatory purposes only and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Terminology used in  may be used in the example without further reference to .","Consider the following example, shown in , which describes skipping pages in a user application displayed on a mobile device in accordance with one or more embodiments described above. In the example, consider the scenario in which Mike Mohler () is a user (e.g., an individual reading an electronic book on a mobile device ()). As shown in , Mike Mohler () uses the mobile device () to access content from a content service (). The content may have multiple pages, and so Mike Mohler () decides to use embodiments of the invention to more quickly navigate portions of the content. Mike Mohler () enters one or more settings for embodiments of the invention into the mobile device ().","After receiving the settings, as shown in , the content is shown on the mobile device () to Mike Mohler (). Page 1 of the content is the current page shown on the mobile device (). Further, information about the content is received by the mobile device (). For example, the mobile device () may determine that the content starts on page 1 and that the content has a total of 176 pages. After page 1 of the content is displayed on the mobile device (), Mike Mohler () wants to skip to page 105. To skip pages of the content, Mike Mohler () moves the device from the left side to the right side of the mobile device ().","When the movement of the mobile device () is detected, the accelerometer module (), found in embodiments of the invention, processes the movement. In this example, as shown in , the accelerometer module () determines that, while the mobile device () was properly oriented during the movement, the movement itself did not trigger the page skipping feature because the direction of the movement was improper. In this case, the proper orientation is holding the mobile device () on the left and right side while the mobile device () lies in a plane that is within +\/\u221270\u00b0 of horizontal. Also, in this example, the movement of the mobile device () should be top to bottom or bottom to top to trigger the page skipping feature. Since the movement was side to side, the orientation module () determined that the movement was improper to trigger the page skipping feature. As a result, the accelerometer module () notifies the page skipping engine () that no pages of the content should be skipped. Consequently, the page skipping engine () maintains page 1 as the current page displayed on the mobile device.","As shown in , Mike Mohler () causes a different movement of the mobile device () to trigger the page skipping feature. The mobile device () is displaying page 1 of the content. The movement of the mobile device () that Mike Mohler () creates is a forceful bottom to top movement. The movement is caused while Mike Mohler () holds the mobile device () by the sides as the mobile device () is positioned horizontally.","When the movement shown in  is complete, the process proceeds to , where the accelerometer module () determines that the mobile device () was properly oriented during the movement and that the movement itself triggers the page skipping feature. Because the mobile device is properly oriented during the movement and the movement triggers the page skipping feature, the calculating module () calculates the number of pages to skip based on the movement. In this example, the calculating module () calculates that 157 pages should be skipped forward. The calculating module () notifies the page skipping engine () that 157 pages should be skipped forward. As a result, the page skipping engine () skips forward 157 pages in the content so that page 158 (i.e., the target page) of the content is displayed on the mobile device.","As shown in , the mobile device () presents page 158 (now the current page) of the content to Mike Mohler (). Because Mike Mohler () wants to view page 105 of the content, Mike Mohler () realizes that he has skipped too far forward. Consequently, Mike Mohler () causes a movement to the mobile device () to skip pages of the content backward. In this example, Mike Mohler () holds the mobile device () by the sides as the mobile device () is positioned 30\u00b0 above horizontal. The movement is a slightly forceful top to bottom movement of the mobile device ().","When the movement shown in  is complete, the process proceeds to , where the accelerometer module () determines that the mobile device () was properly oriented during the movement and that the movement itself triggers the page skipping feature. Because the mobile device is properly oriented during the movement and the movement triggers the page skipping feature, the calculating module () calculates the number of pages to skip based on the movement. In this example, the calculating module () calculates that 50 pages should be skipped backward. The calculating module () notifies the page skipping engine () that 50 pages should be skipped backward. As a result, the page skipping engine () skips backward 50 pages in the content so that page 108 (the target page) of the content is displayed on the mobile device, as shown in .","To navigate to page 105 of the content, Mike Mohler () may further use the page skipping feature by making a very slight top to bottom movement of the mobile device () while the mobile device () is properly oriented. Alternatively, Mike Mohler () may use a page turning feature on the mobile device () known in the art, where each page is turned individually.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","400","402","404","406","400","408","410","400","412","400","414","400"]},"Further, one or more elements of the aforementioned computer system () may be located at a remote location and connected to the other elements over a network. Further, embodiments of the invention may be implemented on a distributed system having a plurality of nodes, where each portion of the invention (e.g., page-skipping engine, accelerometer module, calculating module) may be located on a different node within the distributed system. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the node corresponds to a computer system. Alternatively, the node may correspond to a processor with associated physical memory. The node may alternatively correspond to a processor with shared memory and\/or resources. Further, software instructions to perform embodiments of the invention may be stored on a non-transitory computer readable storage medium such as a compact disc (CD), a diskette, a tape, or any other physical computer readable storage device.","One or more embodiments of the invention provide for skipping pages of content displayed by a user application on a mobile device. Specifically, embodiments of the invention allow a user to skip pages of content on a mobile device based on a movement of the mobile device. The process of navigating through pages of content on a mobile device typically involves turning individual pages on the mobile device, as by swiping a finger horizontally across the screen of the mobile device. Embodiments of the invention may reduce the amount of time spent by the user in navigating a number of pages of content on a mobile device.","In embodiments of the invention, a proper movement and orientation of the mobile device is required to enable the page skipping feature. As a result, pages displayed on the mobile device are not skipped due to inadvertent movements (e.g., bumping the mobile device, dropping the mobile device, tilting the mobile device). Further, embodiments of the invention may allow a user, by moving the mobile device in a particular way, to skip to the last page or first page of content displayed by the user application.","Embodiments of the invention may allow the user to customize settings so that certain movements and orientations, familiar to the user and how the user uses the mobile device, are used to trigger the page skipping feature. The settings may also be configured to allow a user to use different movements to skip to the last page and\/or first page of content displayed by a user application on the mobile device. The settings may also be calibrated using embodiments of the invention, so that a particular movement and\/or a particular acceleration may be used to set a minimum and\/or maximum movement and\/or acceleration to trigger the page skipping feature.","Embodiments of the invention may be used with one of a number of different applications. In one instance, a user application may be an electronic book viewer with multi-page support, where embodiments of the invention may be used to skip pages in an electronic book. In another instance, a user application may be an accounting or financial software application capable of displaying a number of entries (e.g., accounts, transactions), where embodiments of the invention maybe used to skip from one entry to another entry in the software application. In another instance, a user application may be a spreadsheet viewer displaying a number of tabs, where embodiments of the invention maybe used to skip tabs in a spreadsheet.","While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention as disclosed herein.
