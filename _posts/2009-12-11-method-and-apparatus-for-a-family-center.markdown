No. 7,975,011 filed 5 Jul. 2005, which claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/585,375, filed 2 Jul. 2004, each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference thereto.","1. Technical Field","The invention relates to a communications architecture. More particularly, the invention relates to services provided in connection with a proxy-based communications architecture.","2. Description of the Prior Art","In today's world, personal computers, cell phones, smart phones, even televisions, and the like, provide services and content beyond the original purposes of these devices. For example, a personal computer doesn't simply compute, but opens browsers to remotes web sites for users to browse. As another example, as well as talking on cell phones, users can send Short Message Service (SMS) messages across mobile networks or browse the Internet. It is not uncommon for a single user to own or have access to a variety of such devices. However, when the single user desires to use any of the devices, the single user is required to become familiar with the particular platforms and run-time applications associated with each of the devices. Such requirement is a direct result of the limitations of the hardware and software of each of the devices. For example, if a user desires to open an address book from his or her PC, the user must be familiar with the particular address book application on the PC. If the user desires to open an address book on his or her smart phone, the user must be familiar with the particular address book application on the smart phone, that is most likely different from the address book application on the user's PC. Further, if the user needs to receive a message from a family member, the family member has to guess the location of the user and\/or which device the user is likely to use. For example, suppose the user is a parent and the family member is the parent's child. Suppose further that at some later point in time, the child will call the parent to request that the parent pick him or her up from a friend's house. As in a typical family, the child does not know the exact location of the parent. The parent may be at home, may be outside gardening, or may even be grocery shopping. Typically, then, the child has to guess the location of the parent and then guess to which device the parent is likely to have access. For example, the child may send an SMS message to the parent's cell phone. Thus, the parent may or may not view the message in a timely manner depending on whether the parent has access to his or her cell phone at that time. The parent may have gone upstairs to a different part of the house to read his or her email on a PC and left his or her cell phone in the kitchen downstairs. Thus, the parent, reading emails on the PC, will not receive the message that requests pick up from the child in a timely manner, that is, until the parent learns that a message has been sent to his or her cell phone. Thus, it is a disadvantage to both the parent and child that the parent, sitting at the PC, was not able to receive some type of notification on the PC, as well as the cell phone, that his or her child needs to be picked up. It would be advantageous for a message sender to send a single message from one device and have that message be delivered to many devices, regardless of the different types of platforms of the devices and regardless of the different networks over which the content of the message needs to be sent. It further would be advantageous for the receiver of the message to get notification of the message at any of his or her devices and in a view that is independent of the particular type of device at which the receiver views the message, that is, in a unified view across the different types of devices.","A family center system and method is provided that allows receiving from a registered family member a family message that is intended for other registered family members and determines, based on a set of rules, to which of the other registered family members to push the family message, the mode of transport by which to push the family message, and the schedule according to which to push the family message. In addition, a technique involving a tile is provided that allows displaying a unified view of information, including family message information, onto any of a plurality of registered devices, regardless of device platform and\/or communications network. In addition, the family center system and method provides a variety of family center services to registered family members as well as allows third party application plug-in for offering third party services to registered family members. In addition, the family center system and method allows receiving a SMS message and storing the SMS message as a family message for subsequent access, such as, for example, for subsequent pushing to the appropriate device according to the appropriate mode of transport and schedule.","The following definitions are provided to clarify particular terminology used within the discussion hereinbelow and are not meant to be limiting. It should be clear to one skilled in the art that other terms could be used to convey the same understanding and can be considered within the scope and spirit of the claimed subject matter.","fcMember or member: A configured member of the family in the Family Center system or application;","fcMessage, Family Message (FM), or message: The basic type of message that gets sent between fcMembers through the Family Center;","FC: \u201cFamily Center\u201d or, alternatively, a Family Center solution including hosted component;","fcApplication or FC Application: fcApplication is a component or process that runs on a particular device. fcApplication may be recognized as one or more client components that work in conjunction with FC, which may be recognized as one or more core server components. fcApplication may be delivered via web, client, DECT, smart phone, and the like. In an embodiment, fcApplication provides the user interface to the outside world.\n\nfcTile or Tile: A consistent display element that provides user actionable data that can be presented on the fcApplication home screen;\n\nUser: Any entity, e.g. person, who interacts with the fcApplication;\n\nFamilyID: The identifier (id) that uniquely identifies the family instance;\n\nServiceID: The id assigned\/given to a specific web service to identify that service and associated privileges;\n\nNotifications: Event notifications are sent for event creation, updates, and cancellations; and\n\nReminders: Event reminders are sent to remind family members than an upcoming event is arriving.\n\nOverview\n","A family center system and method is provided that allows receiving from a registered family member a family message that is intended for other registered family members and determines, based on a set of rules, to which of the other registered family members to push the family message, the mode of transport by which to push the family message, and the schedule according to which to push the family message. In addition, a technique involving a tile is provided that allows displaying a unified view of information, including family message information, onto any of a plurality of registered devices, regardless of device platform and\/or communications network. In addition, the family center system and method provides a variety of family center services to registered family members as well as allows third party application plug-in for offering third party services to registered family members. In addition, the family center system and method allows receiving a SMS message and storing the SMS message as a family message for subsequent access, such as, for example, for subsequent pushing to the appropriate device according to the appropriate mode of transport and schedule.","An embodiment of a family center system and method can be described with reference to , a functional block diagram showing a proxy-based family center communications architecture according to an embodiment. It should be appreciated that the particular details referred to hereinbelow are illustrative and are not meant, to be limiting. One skilled in the art could readily contemplate other elements or steps and still remain within the scope and spirit of the claimed subject matter.","Thus, referring to  and in accordance with an embodiment, a family center system  is provided and allows receiving from a registered family member, for example from a PC Web Client , a family message that is intended for other registered family members. Family center system  determines, based on a set of rules, to which of the other registered family members, e.g. a television (TV)  and a smart phone , to push the family message. The determination takes into consideration the mode of transport required by TV , e.g. over a carrier network , and smart phone , e.g. over a mobile network , by which to push the family message. The determination also takes scheduling into consideration. For example, family center system  may determine to send the family message to TV  first and then after a specific time, family center system  sends the family message to smart phone .","In an embodiment, family center system  may determine to send the family message in the form of a tile to both smart phone  and TV . For an example of received tile, refer to .  is a screen shot of a family center application home screen  showing twelve displayed tiles according to an embodiment. A tile  positioned in the top row and in the upper left corner originated from an iPhone. Tile  displays a family message that originated from the iPhone. In this example, the content of tile  says, \u201cFamily message sent from iPhone client. What's up doc?\u201d As well, tile  displays in a title bar a date and time at which the family message was sent. Tile  also shows that this particular family message is the second out of two (2\/2) for this particular user or family member.","As the name suggests, tiles can be manipulated in a variety of ways, such as, for example, reordering tiles on the screen by drag and drop, causing an individual tile to disappear and effectively move to a next page, and so on. The multitude of features of tiles is discussed in further details throughout and, in particular, hereinbelow in the section, Tiles.","In an embodiment, family center system  may receive a request from one of the registered devices, e.g. PC Web client , for a family center service, e.g. Calendar . For an example of a family center calendar service, refer to .  is a screen shot of a family center application  showing a family center calendar page.","As well, family center system  may receive a request from one of the registered devices, e.g. PC Web Client , to deliver content from an external source, e.g. from one of the third party applications . In this example, at PC Web Client , control goes to a designated URL and content that is associated with the designated URL is presented in a separate window on PC Web Client .","As well, in an embodiment, family center system  may receive a family message from an SMS Mobile Phone  in the form of an SMS message and store the SMS message as a first family message  for subsequent access, such as, for example, for subsequent pushing to the appropriate device according to the appropriate mode of transport and schedule.","At a high level, family center system  provides a hosted solution to users to receive complete communications and services. However, in an embodiment, family center system  contains a plurality of components or processes to achieve providing a hosted solution to users. Particular components or processes of family center system  according to an embodiment are described hereinbelow. It should be appreciated that any of such particular components or processes can be implemented purely in hardware, e.g. as special-purpose hardwired circuitry, or in software. It should be appreciated that the use of the terms, component or process, herein may refer to either hardware or software and is not limited to referring only to hardware or to software.","Interface APIs","In , family center system  contains one or more interface APIs . Interface APIs  allow other components or processes within family center system  to communicate with a variety of entities. In an embodiment and as shown in , interface APIs  communicate with the following external entities: third party applications , carrier applications , and carrier resources . Such interface APIs  enable external entities (, , ) to define and address tiles through family center system  such that family center system  is able to deliver such tiles to specific registered families within family center system . A tile is a consistent display element that provides user actionable data that can be presented on a family center application (\u201cfcApplication\u201d) home screen and is discussed in detail hereinbelow. Interface APIs  also contain APIs that define an interface between an fcApplication and family center system . Such interface APIs may also be used to define a tile.","In an embodiment and also as shown in , Interface APIs  interface with the following devices: smart phone , an enhanced media terminal adapter (eMTA) , TV , a custom device , and PC Web Client . For example, interface APIs  allows any of devices (, , , , , ) that are registered with family center system  to send a family message to family center system  such that family center system  ensures the family message is propagated to one or more registered family members.","Interface APIs  allows the family message to propagate in the form of a tile to any configured registered device. In an embodiment, a configured registered device contains part or all of a family center application, e.g. fcApplication.","It should be appreciated that when the SMS mobile phone  does not host an fcApplication but is registered with family center system , family center system  may send information reflecting a family message to SMS mobile phone in SMS message format. In addition, family center system  may still send information reflecting the family message to any of devices (, , , , , ) in the form of a tile.","Further details about the use of interface APIs  between family center system  and external devices (, , ) as well as devices registered with family center system  (, , , , , ) can be found in the appropriate sections hereinbelow. For example, further details can be found in the Tiles section.","Communications Networks and Devices","Interface APIs  allow family center system  to communicate with external entities (, , ) and the registered devices (, , , , , ) over a variety of networks. It should be appreciated that in an embodiment such communication is bi-directional. As an example, interface APIs  allow communication with smart phone  and SMS mobile phone  over a mobile network . Interface APIs allow communication with eMTA  and TV  over a carrier network . Interface APIs  allow communication with custom device  and PC Web Client  over the Internet . An example of custom device  is a tablet, e.g. an eight-inch screen that sits on a kitchen counter, that contains a copy of fcApplication, or part of such application, that is associated with the tablet so that customer device  is in communication with family center system . Another example of custom device  is a digital picture frame.","It should be appreciated that fcApplication may also run natively on a PC (not shown). For example, fcApplication may be implemented using Adobe\u00ae AIR\u00ae. Thus, in this example, fcApplication may be referred to as an AIR client. The look and feel of fcApplication as an AIR client may be similar to fcApplication as the web client, however, as an AIR client, fcApplication is present on the PC desktop without need for a browser.","It should be appreciated that in an embodiment, a DECT phone connects to eMTA  that is in communication with family center system  over carrier network . An exemplary DECT phone is a particular handset to which communications services are brought to individuals and is discussed in the instant application's co-pending parent U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/745,888, filed 8 May 2007. As well, any other type of voice service that is able to be in communication with eMTA  may also be in communication with family center system  over carrier network .","Similarly, TV  is in communication with family center system  by TV  being in communication with its set-top box that is in communication with carrier network  that is in communication with family center system . Thus, family center system  can push content to the screen of TV  through the path described hereinabove and a television viewer can communicate with family center system  via the same path, as the path is bi-directional.","In an embodiment, smart phone  communicates with family center system  by first communicating over mobile network , which then communicates with Internet  back to family center system , e.g. over-the-top application. Thus, smart phone  communicates with family center system  using Internet . It should be appreciated that interface APIs  may communicate directly with SMS mobile phone  over mobile network .","It should be appreciated that the types of devices and communications networks discussed above are illustrative and are not meant to be limiting. One skilled in the art can readily understand that other types of devices and communications networks can be employed and still be within the scope and spirit of the claimed subject matter.","Family Center Services","Family center system  provides a variety of services to users. For example, family center system  provides voice mail, SMS, an address book, local directory search, email, a calendar, task or To-Do's lists, and the like. In an embodiment and referring to , family center system  contains the following components or processes: Voice Mail , SMS , Address Book , Local Search , Email , and Calendar .","An exemplary Voice Mail service, Address Book service, Local Search service, and SMS or Instant Message service can be found in the instant application's co-pending parent U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/745,888, filed 8 May 2007.","Further detailed descriptions of Address Book , Local Search , and Calendar  can be found hereinbelow in individual sections under the title of the same name.","It should be appreciated that the types of services discussed above are illustrative and are not meant to be limiting. One skilled in the art can readily understand that additional or different services may be provided and be within the scope and spirit of the claimed subject matter.","Tile Handling","Family center system  contains a tile handler component . Tile handler  allows the placement of tiles on the home screen of an fcApplication as follows. For example, tile handler  allows the placement of tiles on the home screen of fcApplication on PC Web client . In an embodiment, tile handler  receives a particular API from a source, such as a third party application , and based on information contained in the API, creates a particular JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document that is associated with the API, and pushes the JSON document to PC Web Client . In another embodiment, tile handler  creates an XML data structure that reflects the information contained in the API and pushes the XML data structure to the particular registered device, such as PC Web Client . It should be appreciated that one skilled in the art can use any other data structure format with which to send the information contained in the API and that the JSON document and XML data structure are by way of example and are not meant to be limiting.","Further details about tiles and tile handling can be found hereinbelow in the section, Tiles.","DECT Phone","In an embodiment, family center system  provides one or more components that manage a registered DECT phone A. In an embodiment, family center system  contains the following components for managing DECT phone A: a DECT phone manager , a session border controller (SBC) , and a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) soft switch , where SBC  is a standard third party system that manages connections to generic SIP devices. In an embodiment, the functionality of DECT phone A is simple, such as displaying screens or determining when a key on DECT phone A is pressed. For example, such components may control the user interface on DECT phone A. In an embodiment, SIP soft switch  allows voice calls to be placed between one or more DECT phones that are registered to a same family. Exemplary DECT phone functionality is discussed in the instant application's co-pending parent U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/745,888, filed 8 May 2007.","Voice to Text Converter","In an embodiment, family center system  contains a voice to text converter component . Voice to text converter  converts voice input stream to text output. Third party voice to text converters are readily available on the market and may be used within family center system . As an example, a family member may pick up DECT phone A and as he or she is getting ready to leave the house, sends a family message from DECT phone A intended for delivery to the other family members. The family message, which is in the form of a voice message, is sent through eMTA  over carrier network  to family center system . At family center system , voice to text converter  converts the voice stream from the family message to text. Then family center system  stores the converted family message (FM2) in a family center component , which is discussed in further detail hereinbelow, for subsequent processing, such as being propagated to the other family members. Thus, as illustrated in this example, a user can talk into a device to leave a message that is intended for the family and doesn't have to take the time to type out the message or select or type in the names or addresses of all the intended recipients.","Media Server","In an embodiment, a media server  is provided that can convert input media of a variety of formats into a different type of media, also of a variety of formats. For example, suppose a family member creates a family message in a media that DECT phone A cannot interpret. Family system  determines that such family message needs to be converted to a format that DECT phone A can interpret, before pushing the family message to DECT phone A. Family center system  gives control to media server , which converts the family message to a format that DECT phone A can interpret, such that the converted family message subsequently gets pushed or streamed directly to DECT phone A.","In another example, in an embodiment, voice mail messages are recorded and played back in mp3. However, such voice mail messages are stored in family center  in a format that is different from mp3. Thus, when a family member, while connected to PC Web Client , for example, desires to listen to a voice mail message from the family center application, media server converts the voice mail message that was stored to mp3 and delivers the mp3 content to PC Web Client for the family member.","It should be appreciated that an example media server  is described in the instant application's co-pending parent U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/745,888, filed 8 May 2007.","It should further be appreciated that the particular details described above are illustrative and are not meant to be limiting. It is readily apparent that one skilled in the art can contemplate adding a wide variety of devices and third party applications that can communicate with family center system  and still be within the scope and spirit of the claimed subject matter.","Family Center and Database","In an embodiment, family center system  contains a family center  application component that is in communication with a database  component. It should be appreciated that family center  and database  may be an application and repository that work together in such a way that one skilled in the art can understand that referring to family center  may imply referring to database  and that referring to database  may imply referring to family center . One skilled in the art can understand that in an embodiment, database  may be any third party database on the market and is used as a tool.","Family center  contains and handles data that embodies the notion of a family and all the attributes of a family according to an embodiment. As well, family center  contains and handles data that embodies the notion of a group and all the attributes of a group according to an embodiment. In an embodiment, the family is a type of group.","For example and referring to , family center  contains a data structure that represents a registered family and contains informational data about the family, family instance . In the example, family instance  is a member of a group instance , which is also a data structure. Also in this example and in accordance with an embodiment, family center  contains data reflecting two registered family members, family member A and family member B. Family member A and family member B are members of family instance data .","An example of an attribute of family instance  is a list of one or more devices that are registered to the particular family. For example,  smart phone, SMS mobile phone , DECT phone A, TV , custom device , and PC Web Client  may each be a registered device of family instance .","It should be appreciated that certain functionality of Group according to an embodiment are described hereinbelow in particular detail. For example, Group functionality is described in detail in the context of Address Book and Family Calendar. However, one skilled in the art can readily appreciate that the particular details are not meant to be limiting and are for illustrative purposes. Thus, while not described in particular detail, the notion of group can be used in other applications, such as, for example, group messaging through SMS or other means. As an example, a particular fcMember may create a group of individual members labeled \u201cSoccer team\u201d and then send an SMS message to the entire group by sending the SMS message to Soccer team as opposed to sending a particular SMS message to each individual member of Soccer team.","Family Message Handler","In an embodiment, family center system  contains a family message handler  that handles family messages. In an embodiment, family message handler  handles scheduling, routing, and transporting of family messages and a data definition of the family message. In an embodiment, the particular definition of family message is stored in database . A particular family message is associated with a family and is independent of any type of transport. Family message handler  handles a family message based on attributes of family instance  and specific rules (not shown). Such rules may reside in database , for example, and may be retrieved by family message handler  whenever needed by family message handler . For example, family message handler  determines, based on rules and family attributes, which devices, e.g. which devices are registered to the family, to push the particular family message. Continuing with the example above, family message handler  determines to send the family message to smart phone, SMS mobile phone , DECT phone A, TV , custom device , and PC Web Client , because each of such devices are registered with family center system .","In an embodiment, family message handler  determines when to send a particular family message to a particular registered device based on a particular family member's configurations. For example, family member A may contain data reflecting that smart phone  is not to receive any family messages after 10 pm and to resume receiving family messages at 7 am. Thus, when family message handler  receives a family message at 10:30 pm, family message handler  determines not to send family message to smart phone .","An example of family message handler  determining transport is as follows. Continuing with the example above, family message handler  receives a family message. Family message handler  determines the family message is to be sent to SMS mobile phone , which does not host any processes, such as fcApplication, for example, that is associated with family center system . SMS mobile phone  contains standard mobile phone functionality. Thus, family message handler  determines to send the family message to SMS mobile phone  using SMS .","It should be appreciated that in an embodiment, lists, e.g. a list of family messages or a list of tasks, can be sent via SMS to family members. As well, in an embodiment, when a task is added to a list, such task that is associated with the list is sent via SMS to family members having the list.","As well, family message handler  determines that the family message is to be sent to smart phone . In this example, smart phone  contains a copy of or part of a copy of fcApplication, which allows, for example, tiles to be displayed on the screen. Thus, in this situation, family message handler  determines to use a different transport mechanism to deliver the family message to smart phone  than SMS . Family message handler  determines to send the family message to smart phone  using a particular protocol that fcApplication can interpret.","In an embodiment, family message handler  uses family message protocol  as a transport scheme by which to send family messages to registered devices that contain fcApplication or part of fcApplication. In an embodiment, family message protocol  contains a list of family messages that are intended to be displayed by fcApplication. In the embodiment, such list of family messages are provided to fcApplication in a JSON document or other data structure format, such as XML.","Thus, in an embodiment, sending a family message depends on the device. When the family message is sent to a standard phone that is not configured with any part of the family center application, family message handler  causes the family message to be sent over SMS. When the family message is sent to a DECT phone, family message handler  causes the family message to be sent over SIP. When the family message is sent to a device running fcApplication, family message handler  causes the family message to be sent using family message protocol .","In an embodiment, family message handler  may send notifications of a new family message to a registered device and not deliver the family message to the registered device. In this case, the particular device may have access to the family message that is stored in the family center such that the family message can be viewed by a user at the registered device.","An example of a screen shot of a family message according to an embodiment can be found in .  shows the user interface  of the running fcApplication and an opened tile that contains a family message. In this example, the family message was sent by Jon and the content says, \u201ccan I get\u201d.","An Example User Flow","A mother sits down at PC Web Client  and opens up the family center application thereon, e.g. the copy of fcApplication residing on PC Web Client .","The mother desires to send a family message from PC Web Client . An example screen shot of a window for entering a new message can be found in .  shows the input object  on top of the family center application . In the example and according to an embodiment, the mother can type in her family message or record her family message and send it along. Referring to , in response to the mother creating the family message at PC Web Client , family center  generates and stores a copy of the family message . Family message handler  detects family message  is newly created and stored in family center . Family message handler  determines to whom and how to propagate family message . Family message handler  checks family members and family member devices that are registered with the family. In this example, family message handler  determines that family member A has registered SMS mobile phone . Thus, family message handler  packages data that is associated with family message  into an SMS message (not shown). Family message handler  then passes the SMS message to SMS , which then causes the SMS message to be sent over mobile network  to SMS mobile phone . Also in the example, another family member, e.g. family member B, has registered his or her smart phone, e.g. smart phone . Family message handler  packages data that is associated with family message  as an over-the-top smart phone application and sends the over-the-top smart phone application over Internet  to mobile network  to smart phone . Also in the example, a third family member is sitting in front of a television, such as TV . The third family member (not shown) created configuration data that indicates to family message handler  to show received family messages on the screen of TV . Thus, family message handler  packages data that is associated with family message  into a format that TV  can interpret and present on the screen. Then family message handler  sends the packaged family message through an API at interface APIs  over carrier network  to TV .","Thus, this example demonstrates how family messaging according to an embodiment can be a one-to-many messaging scheme.","Also in this example, a receiver of the family message decides to reply to the family message. For example, the family member at SMS mobile device  replies to the family message. SMS mobile device  generates an SMS message that gets sent over mobile network  through the appropriate APIs at interface APIs  to family center  and is stored as family message .","In an embodiment, family message handler  does not send a family message back to the sender. Thus, in the example, family message handler  determines not to send family message  to SMS mobile phone  because family message  was sent from SMS mobile phone . However, family message handler  packages and sends family message  to the remaining family members as specified.","Home Screen and Login","This section describes a home screen, login screen, and registration process of the FC application according to an embodiment. It should be appreciated that the particular details referred to hereinbelow are illustrative and are not meant to be limiting. One skilled in the art could readily contemplate other elements or steps and still remain within the scope and spirit of the claimed subject matter.","Overview","In an embodiment, the Home Screen is the home page for the FC and displays tile notifications and alerts, provides access to core FC applications, also referred to herein as processes or components, and quick access to key core FC application views. The Home Screen includes the Login Screen, which provides security to protect user access to a family's FC account.","Home Screen View","In an embodiment, the display time, day of week, and date are displayed in the upper right hand corner and are persistent in all views.","In an embodiment, branding is displayed in the upper left hand corner and is persistent in all views. The display may be customizable for carrier-branding.","An example screen shot of an implementation of a Home view can be seen in .

One skilled in the art could readily contemplate other elements or steps and still remain within the scope and spirit of the claimed subject matter.","Overview","In an embodiment, fcTiles are displayed within the home screen of the fcApplication. fcTiles are either locally generated by the fcApplication based on information associated with message types or they are generated based on a specific fcTile packet being pushed to the client.","fcTiles provide interaction with other fcApplication data, e.g. voicemail playback, or provide interaction with third party web services, e.g. home security.","The fcTile defines both graphical information and functional information. The complete definition of an fcTile is encapsulated within a data structure, such as a JSON document or XML, for example, and pushed to the fcApplication. The fcApplication displays the fcTile, manages background functions on behalf of the fcTile, e.g. auto-update, and handles the user interaction and display of information.","The third party applications can place, or cause the placement of, fcTiles on the home screen of the fcApplication through an API into the FC system (\u201cFC\u201d), e.g. into a hosted component in the FC system. That is, a third party application may post a tile to the FC system. Such API contains information that describes a particular tile in detail and also particular delivery options of the tile, such as to which clients, time of day, and so forth.","Then, based on the information contained in the first API, FC creates a data structure element, such as an associated JSON document or XML structure reflecting or containing information in the API and pushes the data structure, such as a JSON document to the fcApplication through a second API. Put another way, the second API delivers the tile to fcApplication.","It should be appreciated that particular detailed descriptions herein of the first API and the second API are illustrative and are not meant to be limiting. One skilled in the art can readily appreciate that a wide variety of particular functions, parameters, attributes, and elements of such APIs can be contemplated or used and still be within the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter.","It should further be appreciated that while the use of JSON document used hereinbelow is for illustrative purposes and is not meant to be limiting. One skilled in the art can appreciate that any other data structure, such as an XML data structure, can be used and be within the spirit and scope of the subject matter as claimed.","A user interacts with an fcTile by clicking it. The type of tile defines the subsequent interaction options.","There are multiple types of fcTiles. Each type has a specific set of feature capabilities. The fcApplication manages how those capabilities are presented to the user.","As mentioned hereinabove, there are two main but separate APIs that control or manage fcTile operation. The first API provides the external interface, e.g. from third party applications, to FC for defining fcTiles and addressing fcTiles to specific registered families within FC. The second API defines the interface between the fcApplication and FC that is used to define the fcTile. In an embodiment, the first and second APIs have the same structure but their respective individual elements may vary. An example embodiment of the first API can be found hereinbelow.","Information elements that are pushed to the fcApplication through other features e.g. through a core FC Application, such as messaging, may include some fcTile attributes. Including some fcTile attributes is desirable to inform the fcApplication how to treat specific elements. For example, a family message may have a fcTile option and priority option. When fcTile=Yes and a priority is given, the fcApplication creates a custom fcTile specific to the family message and display it in the appropriate priority location.","fcTiles are \u201cpushed\u201d to a family instance within FC. Pushing fcTiles to family instances insures that the fcTile is \u201cdelivered\u201d to the associated family account. If the fcApplication is running then the fcTile is subsequently pushed to the fcApplication and an ACK is generated in return. If the fcApplication is not running then when it starts, all relevant fcTiles are sent to the fcApplication.","fcTile JSON Definition","The following parameters and\/or functions define an fcTile, according to an embodiment. Such particular parameters and functions are meant to be illustrative and are not meant to be limiting.

In an embodiment, this entry is created by FC and need not be filled in by the registered application.\n\nCreate Date *: The date the fcTile was created. This entry is created by FC and need not be filled in by the registered application.\n\nRemove Option: In an embodiment, there are three possible ways an fcTile can be removed from the home screen:\n","Manual: For example, an \u201cX\u201d is presented in the top right corner of the header. If a user clicks on the X the option is removed. Communicates to FC that the fcTile was removed.","Date: The fcApplication automatically removes the fcTile on a date certain.","Network: The fcTile remains on the home screen until a subsequent remove command is received from FC.\n\nRefresh Timer: The fcTile can be configured to send a refresh request to FC based on a configured timer. The request causes FC to query the source of the fcTile for an update and then push the update back to fcTile and possibly to other registered devices according to family settings and device configurations. Below are example settings for an example time:\n","Min update timer: 1 min","Max update timer: 24 hrs\n\nClick Function: When a user clicks the fcTile, a click event is reported back to FC to be tracked. Other subsequent actions may take place depending on configuration. The options may include:\n","None: No other action is taken. No change is made to the presentation on the home screen.","Display page local frame: In an embodiment, this option uses the Click URL to access a HTML page.

The page is displayed within a separate browser popup.","Stream video: Uses the click URL to access a streaming video feed. The feed is displayed within a local video player frame."]}}}},"In an embodiment, a tile can include an executable program, such as, for example, a .swf file. When such tile is clicked, the tile opens the program within a frame of the fcApplication and runs the program. The program may pull whatever data is needed or desired to which it has access. For example, the program may pull data that reflects user click events. This feature allows third party partners to easily push or publish a running application and open the application within the fcApplication.","An example screen shot of a playing video stream can be found in .  shows a movie , \u201cHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,\u201d in a local frame of the right pane of the client application . In this example, the playing of the video stream is a result of a user clicking a tile representing the movie causing a click event, e.g. click URL, and the click event causing the streaming video feed to play within the frame. An example of a tile representing the Harry Potter movie can be found in .  shows the tile for playing the Harry Potter movie  in the third row and first column of tiles.","Click URL: The URL accessed when the user clicks a fcTile.","Append FamilyID: When this flag is set the fcApplication appends the FamilyID to the Click URL when Click URL is posted.","Impression Flag: When this flag is set the fcApplication sends an impression event to FC each time the fcTile is displayed on the home screen. This allows FC to keep track of each time the tile is presented in such a way that a user can see it. If the fcTile priority causes the fcTile to be located on the second page of the home screen, for example, or some other page of the home screen, then the fcTile generates an impression when it is moved to the home screen.\n\nGenerating and Interacting with fcTiles Through Third Party API\n","The following section outlines the functionality available to generate fcTiles and receive input back according to an embodiment. The API from a third party communicates directly with the FC itself. FC then communicates with fcApplication on behalf of the third party application. There are instances as defined in the JSON Document wherein the fcApplication communicates directly with third party servers bypassing FC, e.g. to receive video streaming and or an HTML web page.","Once FC receives the fcTile API request, FC creates the fcTile, saves it locally with the FC database and then sends a fcTile JSON Document that is associated with the particular fcTile to all relevant fcApplications.","It should be appreciated that SMS messages are sent to FC either from the network through SMS API or are newly created within the fcApplication. Thus, in an embodiment, FC receives an SMS message from the network, creates an fcTile to send the content of the message within the tile to fcApplication, and also sends the SMS message directly to standard mobile phones that do not run fcApplication.","In an embodiment, a complete API includes the following components:","Type: Defines the type of fcTile request, such as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0024","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0024-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0025","list-style":"none"},"li":["New: Create a new fcTile.","Refresh: Refresh the contents of an existing fcTile.

One skilled in the art can readily appreciate that such methods are by means of illustration and are not meant to be limiting. Other methods may be used that are within the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter. The methods are described in further detail hereinbelow.\n\n","Users can enter the details of an event by filling out a form with predefined field designations. The user is not required to fill out all the fields of the event form. The date and time are pre-populated, as defined by the context above, and defaults to <all family> members as participants. If no fields are populated other than the date and time and the default <all family> members, then no event is created.\n\n","A user can \u201csync\u201d events between his Family Calendar and his Outlook account. This \u201csync\u201d functionality allows the user to keep both his personal\/professional calendar and his family calendar coordinated and separate.","When a user is on his Family Calendar account, he can configure his Calendar settings to automatically add family events to which he is invited, both individual and family events, to his personal calendar. Similarly, when a user is using his personal calendar and creates an event, he has the option to include the event and populate his individual family member calendar within the Family Calendar.","Any changes to an event, such as edits and deletion or cancellation of an event, appears in both calendars that are updated in real-time, e.g. after the edit is made in one calendar and saved, the other calendar is notified and makes the appropriate changes in its calendar. The goal is to have the events designated to be shared on the family calendar be coordinated with the user's Outlook calendar. It should be appreciated that based on technical implementation, the features\/UI may change.\n\n","A user can populate his Family Calendar with events from his personal calendar or calendars from other sources such as schools, sports teams, clubs, and other organizations. This feature is a one-way import.","According to an embodiment, there are two ways to import a file. A user can click on \u2018import\u2019 from the calendar view and be prompted to either (a) select a third party provider, e.g. Outlook, Plaxo, Google, Yahoo! or (b) select a file to import. It is contemplated that different formats are supported as support becomes available for ensuring growth and scalability.\n\n","To help family members coordinate and stay updated, the calendar sends notifications to configured family members via text message upon the creation, modification, and deletion of an event. No tile is created.\n\n","The Family Calendar pushes a \u2018tile\u2019 notification to the home screen before the event, as defined by the event notification configuration hereinabove, and sends a text to participating family member(s).\n\n","The Family Calendar provides an added feature in notification and support for special events such as birthdays and anniversaries. For example, a user can designate an event as a special event within the event details as a checkbox and the application sends a countdown tile notification to the home screen and sends a text message and email at one or more defined time periods to periodically remind the family of the upcoming event. It should be appreciated that special events can be edited the same as a regular event, but the user sees additional configuration options for special events.\n\n","In an embodiment, the family calendar stores event information for each family calendar for three (3) years past and three (3) years forward from the present year.","Calendar Personalized View","In an embodiment, Calendar can create a personalized calendar view for an individual within the family. For example, Dad can register a third party application, e.g. his iPhone, with FC system and indicate that he desires to have a personalized calendar view. For example, he may select a box that then causes the personalized calendar view functionality to apply his calendar-related events. Thus, after registering the iPhone with personalized calendar view turned on, Dad then receives only those calendar events that are marked for the family or for Dad. It should be appreciated that choosing a personalized calendar view may appear as the opposite feature of a user publishing events from his or her personal calendar to FC system. It should be appreciated that by way of personalized calendar view, the user, e.g. Dad, can manage his or her calendar from his or her device, e.g. from third party iPhone application, and FC system synchronizes such third party calendar application with his or her personalized view of the FC calendar.","Local Directory Search","This section describes Local Directory Search (LDS) Features and Functionality according to an embodiment.
