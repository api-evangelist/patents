title: Systems and methods for removing point of sale processing from PCI scope
abstract: The methods and systems described herein provide for processing payments at a retail location whose infrastructure has been significantly removed from PCI scope. A request for processing payments may be sent from a point of sale lane to a back office server in communication with a credit card terminal. A user may use the credit card terminal to enter in secure payment information which is securely transmitted to a remote authorization service for authorization. Through this method, the credit card terminal and sensitive payment information may be securely isolated from the remaining infrastructure at the retail location.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Retailers, such as grocery stores, department stores, and restaurants, process thousands of credit card, debit card, and gift card transactions per day. One requirement for doing so is compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, also known as \u201cPCI DSS,\u201d or simply \u201cPCI\u201d. Ensuring that a retailer's payment processing computers, cash registers, back office servers, and credit card terminals comply with PCI can be time consuming and expensive. Various technical and non-technical standards and practices must be abided by for PCI compliance, and the retail location can be subject to frequent assessments and auditing.","Components of a retail system which handle secure payment information, also known as \u201ccardholder data\u201d, must meet the requirements of PCI. These components may be referred to as \u201cwithin PCI Scope\u201d. Components that do not handle secure payment information may be referred to as \u201coutside PCI scope\u201d. Similarly information whose processing and transmission would mandate that the hardware and software infrastructure handling said information fall within PCI scope may be referred to a \u201cPCI scope information\u201d, whereas information whose processing would not subject the underlying infrastructure to PCI scope may be referred to as \u201cnon-PCI scope information\u201d.","Typically, a retail location which has more than one point of sale location, such as numerous check-out lanes at a department store or grocery store, generally has the following payment processing infrastructure: a cash register which provides a user the ability to sum the total amount of purchases for the transaction; a credit cart terminal for inputting payment card information; and a back office server that manages the various cash registers and credit card terminals, and which is relied upon for the processing of payment transactions.","Restaurants may also similarly have multiple point of sale locations for effectuating the processing of payment transactions. Rather than a check-out lane, a waiter may take your payment card to a kiosk for processing the transaction. Said kiosks may similarly have a computer that may act as an electronic cash register and a credit card terminal. Sometimes, rather than a kiosk, a restaurant may have mobile wireless credit card terminals which a user may use to process a payment transaction.","In standard setups, the entirety of the retail location's payment system infrastructure must be within PCI scope, including the cash registers, the credit card terminals, and the back office computer systems. Often, the back office computer systems track transaction processing and are responsible for communicating with a remote authorization service in order to authorize the transaction. Since in traditional setups all of these items fall within PCI Scope, a retailer can be expected to spend substantial amounts of resources, time, and money in assuring PCI compliance across the entire system.","Applicant has appreciated that available technology for processing payment transactions requires that retailers spend valuable resources and time on PCI compliance. Traditional systems and methods for processing payment transactions focus on securing and monitoring every aspect of a retailer's payment processing infrastructure, from the credit card terminals, to the cash registers, to the back office servers, and the network itself. Applicant has further appreciated that no available technology exists for transitioning existing multiple lane (\u201cmulti-lane\u201d) payment processing infrastructure into setups which remove the majority of the payment processing infrastructure from PCI scope; thereby substantially reducing costs and overhead on PCI compliance. Applicant has discovered that by effectively isolating a credit card terminal at a retail location, and substantially managing payment processing by a server at a location remote to a retail location in direct contact with a credit card terminal, substantial reductions in PCI compliance costs may be obtained.","Applicant has further appreciated that sensitive data, including information typically stored on payment cards, should be securely transmitted, stored, and processed.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a back office server at a retail location may be in communication with a plurality of point of sale lanes and credit card terminals to effectuate the processing of payment transactions. The back office server may also communicate with a remotely located customer relationship management server to facilitate the use of customer loyalty programs, analytics, and receipt storage, tracking, and access. The plurality of credit card terminals are in direct communication with a remotely located payment processing server. The connection allowing communication between the credit card terminals and the back office server may be limited to a single port, such as a single isolated TCP\/IP or UDP port. The remotely located payment processing server is responsible for communicating with an authorization server which may authorize or decline a particular payment processing transaction. The credit card terminal may communicate with the payment processing server over the public Internet, over a Virtual Private Network, or any form of wide area network. Communications may be additionally secured by firewalls disposed at either the retail location or remote location, or both. Additional security mechanisms, such as hardware monitoring devices which assure and prevent network tampering, may also be disposed at either the retail location, remote location, or both.","In some embodiments of the invention, a back office server at a retail location may be in communication with a single point of sale lane and a single credit card terminal to effectuate the processing of payment transactions. The single credit card terminal may be in direct communication with a remotely located payment processing server.","In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, a method for processing payments is provided, the method comprising: receiving a request to process a payment transaction; determining that the request is associated with one of a plurality of credit card terminals at a retail location; receiving, by the determined credit card terminal, secure payment information; sending, by the determined credit card terminal, secure payment information to a remotely located server for authorization; and receiving, by the credit card terminal, an authorization from a remotely located server.","In some embodiments, a method for processing payments is provided, the method comprising: receiving a request to process a payment transaction; determining that the request is associated with a credit card terminal at a retail location; receiving, by the determined credit card terminal, secure payment information; sending, by the determined credit card terminal, secure payment information to a remotely located server for authorization; and receiving, by the credit card terminal, an authorization from a remotely located server.
