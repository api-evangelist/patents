abstract: A method of determining complete sensor requirements for autonomous mobility of an autonomous system includes computing a time variation of each behavior of a set of behaviors of the autonomous system, determining mobility sensitivity to each behavior of the autonomous system, and computing a change in mobility based upon the mobility sensitivity to each behavior and the time variation of each behavior. The method further includes determining the complete sensor requirements of the autonomous system through analysis of the relative magnitude of the change in mobility, the mobility sensitivity to each behavior, and the time variation of each behavior, wherein the relative magnitude of the change in mobility, the mobility sensitivity to each behavior, and the time variation of each behavior are characteristic of the stability of the autonomous system.

Generally, current approaches to sensor balance include a trial-and-error approach. It is readily apparent that as Synthetic Skeletal Muscular Systems (SSMS) increase in complexity, the computational bandwidth of trial-and-error approaches increases dramatically and hence mathematical solutions for the trial-and-error approaches suffer from geometrically increasing complexity.","Thus, there is a need to overcome these shortcomings.","An example embodiment of the present invention includes a method of determining complete sensor requirements for autonomous mobility of an autonomous system. The method includes computing a time variation of each behavior of a set of behaviors of the autonomous system, determining mobility sensitivity to each behavior of the autonomous system, and computing a change in mobility based upon the mobility sensitivity to each behavior and the time variation of each behavior. The method further includes determining the complete sensor requirements of the autonomous system through analysis of the relative magnitude of the change in mobility, the mobility sensitivity to each behavior, and the time variation of each behavior, wherein the relative magnitude of the change in mobility, the mobility sensitivity to each behavior, and the time variation of each behavior are characteristic of the stability of the autonomous system.","An example embodiment of the present invention includes a computer readable storage medium including computer-executable instructions that, when executed on a computer processor, direct the computer processor to perform a method of determining complete sensor requirements for autonomous mobility of an autonomous system. The method includes computing a time variation of each behavior of a set of behaviors of the autonomous system, determining mobility sensitivity to each behavior of the autonomous system, and computing a change in mobility based upon the mobility sensitivity to each behavior and the time variation of each behavior. The method further includes determining the complete sensor requirements of the autonomous system through analysis of the relative magnitude of the change in mobility, the mobility sensitivity to each behavior, and the time variation of each behavior, wherein the relative magnitude of the change in mobility, the mobility sensitivity to each behavior, and the time variation of each behavior are characteristic of the stability of the autonomous system.","Additional features are realized through the techniques of the present exemplary embodiment. Other embodiments are described in detail herein and are considered a part of what is claimed. For a better understanding of the features of the exemplary embodiment, refer to the description and to the drawings.","Detailed illustrative embodiments are disclosed herein. However, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are merely representative for purposes of describing example embodiments.","Accordingly, while example embodiments are capable of various modifications and alternative forms, embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit example embodiments to the particular forms disclosed, but to the contrary, example embodiments are to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of example embodiments. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the description of the figures.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of example embodiments.

For example, two figures shown in succession may in fact be executed substantially concurrently or may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality\/acts involved. Furthermore, some steps, acts, and\/or functions of any methodology may be implemented in alternating order depending upon the function\/acts involved.","Hereinafter, example embodiments will be described with reference to the attached drawings. Example embodiments of the present invention may include methods of determining complete sensor requirements for autonomous mobility. These methods provide a Sensor Completeness Requirements Algorithm for Autonomous Mobility (SCRAAM) which provide the basis for selecting which environmental changes produce the greatest mobility-related changes, and hence, provide the basis for determining sensor capabilities which are greatly critical for autonomous mobility.","Synthetic systems may be comprised of a neural system, a skeletal muscular system, and sensory input system. The sensory input system may include a variety of sensors of different types\/forms tied into or fed into the neural system as sensory input. The sensors may be centrally located on the skeletal muscular system as \u201cremote\u201d sensors, or may be located at different point\/portions of the skeletal muscular system providing more defined sensing.","The neural system, or synthetic neural system (SNS), may be a tiered neural system, for example, as mapped in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"Similar synthetic neural systems are described in detail in U.S. Pat.

The heuristic portion includes core heuristic genetic code (CHGC)  and heuristic neural system (HNS) . The autonomous portion includes autonomous neural system (ANS)  and core autonomous genetic code (CAGC) .","According to at least one example embodiment, NBF  includes a self-assessment loop (SAL) at each interface between components of the bi-level system. Each SAL continuously gauges efficiency of operations of the combined HNS  and ANS . The standards and criteria of the efficiency are set or defined by objectives of the NBF .","According to at least one example embodiment, NBF  also includes genetic algorithms (GA) at each interface between components. The GAs modify an evolvable interface  to satisfy requirements of the SALs during learning, task execution or impairment of other subsystems.","Similarly, the HNS  includes a SAL interface and a GA interface to the core heuristic genetic code (CHGC) , and the ANS  includes a SAL interface and a GA interface to the core autonomic genetic code (CAGC) . The CHGC  and CAGC  allow modifications to functionality in response to new objectives or injury. The CHGC  and the CAGC  elements are not part of an operational neural system, but rather store architectural constraints on the operating neural system for both portions of the bi-level system. The CHGC  and the CAGC  are both modifiable depending on variations in sensory inputs via the GAs. Sensory inputs may be sensory inputs from a suite of sensors, which are described more fully below.","According to at least one example embodiment, the CHGC  and the CAGC  in conjunction with SALs and GAs are generalized within this self-similar neural system (e.g. entire synthetic neural system) to reconfigure the relationship between a plurality of NBFs as well as to permit the instantiation of new NBFs to increase the overall fitness of the entire synthetic neural system. Thus, NBF  provides a form of evolution possible only over generations synthetic neural systems.","According to at least one example embodiment, HNS  and ANS  receive sensory input from a sensory suite, process the sensory input and generate high level actions. Hereinafter, a complete autonomous system is described with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","201"]},"The SSMS  may be embodied as a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical evolvable synthetic system. The SSMS  may include a plurality of subsystems (e.g., ruler subsystem, worker subsystems, etc).","The system  further includes synthetic neural system (SNS)  in communication with SSMS . The SNS  may include NBFs tied to form an entire synthetic neural system through GA interfaces as described with reference to . Further, SNS  may be in communication with SSMS  through action interfaces of the bi-level NBF  as described with reference to . Therefore, exhaustive description of these similar features will be omitted herein for the sake of brevity.","The system  further includes sensor suite  in communication with the SNS . The sensor suite  may include a plurality of sensors suited to balance the mobility of system  and to tie the SNS  to the environment. For example, typical sensors may include electromagnetic sensors, acoustic sensors, gravity sensors, chemical sensors, or any other suitable form of sensor. Additionally, each sensor may have an associated power spectrum. For example, an electromagnetic sensor may include a power spectrum from Direct Current (infinite wavelength) to gamma rays, an acoustic sensor may have a power spectrum from touch to remote (sonar), et cetera.","Depending upon any particular environment for which the system  may interact, different sensor capabilities may be necessary for true autonomous mobility. Furthermore, the three-dimensional nature of SSMS  provides a three-dimensional complexity to the placement of each sensor. Additionally, the SNS  necessitates sensory input for environmental ties, and action output to the SSMS  for actual changes in motion, position, etc. Therefore, methods of determining complete sensor requirements of the system  are provided below to reduce the complexity of determining said complete sensor requirements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"sub":["k","k"],"b":["301","302","303","301","303"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"sub":["k","k"],"b":"401"},"Thus, Equations 1-3 produce the entire set of mobility sensitivities to be monitored in developing the autonomous mobility of an autonomous system in a given behavioral context, taking into consideration a complete set of available sensors\/power spectra. Further, Equations 1-3 provide the basis for selecting which environmental changes produce the greatest mobility-related behavioral changes and hence which sensor capabilities are most critical for autonomous mobility. Equations 1-3 may optimize sensor selection subject to resource limitations for near optimal performance by sorting through a large set of candidate environments, and thus determining sensor needs through an examination of the relative magnitude of the terms in Equation 3.

The methods consider the relative magnitude of the changes in mobility of the autonomous system, the changes in behavior of the autonomous system, and the mobility sensitivity, which are further determined through analysis of behavioral sensitivity, absolute time variability, and changes caused by movement of the autonomous system.
