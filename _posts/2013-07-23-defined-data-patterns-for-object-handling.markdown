title: Defined data patterns for object handling
abstract: A method of defining data patterns for object handling includes obtaining an image of an input data area, processing the image to obtain image data, and comparing the image data with a pattern, wherein the pattern identifies spatial information of corresponding pattern fields of the pattern. The method further includes determining a confidence level of the comparison of the image data according to a success in matching the image data with the pattern fields, comparing the confidence level with a confidence threshold associated with the pattern, and selecting the pattern. A pattern output associated with the selected pattern is identified, wherein the pattern output corresponds to a canonical return format, and the pattern output is applied to the image data.

No. 12\/917,371, filed Nov. 1, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","\u00a9 2013 RAF Technology, Inc. A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. 37 CFR \u00a71.71(d).","This invention pertains to methods and apparatus for identifying, sorting, delivering, or classifying objects, such as mail pieces and parts, including addresses, identifications, and labels.","On average 20% of the overall mail stream is unrecognizable due to misspelling, abbreviated street & city names, and\/or improperly addressed or structured. Current directories require a tradeoff in adaptability & record volume vs. performance by forcing the user to incorporate stringent data management policies to achieve high address assignment rates.","The following is a summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not intended to identify key\/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In one embodiment, a system presents a set of images of mail pieces or other input with each one parsed into lines and regions and each component labeled with what the component is (e.g. STATE, ZIP, ADDRESSEE NAME). After such parsing and labeling, the system then takes the parsed and labeled set of images and deduces the allowed patterns in the addresses for that country (or incoming application). The system provides the ability to extract the patterns automatically from such a labeled set of images.","In another embodiment, a system utilizes an optical character recognition OCR Engine to assign matched and verified addresses to more outgoing or incoming mail by accurately adapting and correcting various degrees of address corruption. The system reduces the level of character noise, extracts all relevant envelope data, and then uses fuzzy logic, sophisticated pattern matching algorithms, and flexible search rules to maximize the number of assignments.","The system may be configured to identify or categorize information associated with part labels or mail addresses for purposes of routing the object (e.g. mail), monitoring inventory or parts usage, identifying or selecting a common canonical format compatible with a plurality of different labeling formats, identifying missing or ambiguous information, and associating related or corresponding information in a database.","In another embodiment, a system comprises an device configured to obtain an image of a mail piece being sorted, delivered, or classified. An image recognition device is configured to process the image into image data, and a processor is configured to compare the image data with a pattern, wherein the pattern identifies spatial information of corresponding pattern field elements. The processor may further be configured to determine a confidence level of the comparison of the image data according to a success in matching the image data with the pattern fields and compare the confidence level with a confidence threshold associated with the pattern. If the confidence threshold is met, the pattern is selected. The processor identifies a pattern output associated with the selected pattern, wherein the pattern output corresponds to a standardized mail address format. The system may further comprise an output device configured to apply the pattern output to the mail piece according to the selected pattern.","Additional aspects and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["130","130","140","150","136","152","158","154","156"]},"A directory system  is illustrated as including a parser , patterns , address records , data files and tables , and one or more logs . An image processing system  is illustrated as including a database , image capture block , and an OCR system , that includes a block field line locator . An interface system  is illustrated as including a visual display  and operator console . A network  may operatively connect the directory system , image processing system , and interface system . A sortation device may be used to physically move, deliver, or sort the objects through the system .","The system  may be configured to present a set of images of mail pieces, each one to be parsed into regions of interest and then lines of text with each identified component ultimately to be matched with what the component is (e.g. STATE, ZIP, ADDRESSEE NAME). The customer has provided an address block description or pattern , Address Records  and other Data Files and Tables . The OCR system , uses the Block-Field-Line Locator  to identify a region of interest or Address Block and subsequently the individual lines within that Address Block data. This line data is passed on to the Directory System , which is then uses the customer supplied patterns , data files , address records  and parser  to identify individual address components and addresses in each image. The individual components found on the images are identified. This identification is not with what they say, but with what they are or what they were meant to be. For example, the label labels the entity that says \u201cWashington\u201d with \u201cSTATE\u201d.","Included in such parsing, the system  takes the parsed image data and deduces the allowed patterns in the addresses for that area (or category). For example, it can be determined that the bottom-most line (the parser detects lines) has the rightward-most entity labeled \u201cZIP-5\u201d, the one to the right of that labeled \u201cSTATE\u201d and the remaining, leftward-most entity labeled \u201cCITY\u201d. It can therefore be deduced that CITY\u2192STATE\u2192ZIP on the bottom-most line is an allowed pattern that may be matched.","The Physical Object",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["25","20","10"]},"A mail piece has on it one or more addresses. For discussion purposes, assume the intent of the system is to determine where that mail piece should be routed, using the destination address printed on the address block  of the mail piece. A typical mail piece might contain an addressee, a street number and name, a city, a neighborhood, a sub-neighborhood (barrio in Mexico, for example), and other information. The goal of the mail piece processing is to route the mail piece along a particular set of intermediate destinations (e.g. sorting tables) until it reaches the intended addressee. For details on how the mail piece may be routed, see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/711,202, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.","As previously discussed, there are at least two kinds of information that may be extracted from the object , including the object information and the categorizing information. This information may be other than positional. A simple example would be finding a ZIP code by the fact that it matches the NNNNN or the NNNNN-NNNN patterns regardless of where it appears on the mail piece. For non-mail piece objects this categorization information may be arbitrarily complex and, indeed, may require several rounds of parsing, database consulting, and rejection to determine even what this categorization information actually is.","In one example, the object information obtained from a mail piece may contain one or more strings of characters (possibly with alternatives and confidences). The categorizing information may include or identify where those characters appear on the mail piece (e.g. spatial, location, or positional information).","Categorizing information may identify what line the object information is on, and how far from a reference point the object information is located (e.g. the left-hand edge of the address block), etc. This information may be used to enable the parser to determine what to do with the object data (i.e. to determine to what category it belongs). This actual category of this data may not appear explicitly on the object, but be deduced from, for example, positional information on object data obtained by the parser.","The Defined Pattern Set","How and where various address components appears on the mail piece and what those components represent is combined with other elements of the directory system  () to produce a novel object handling system.","How and where various address components appears on the mail piece and what those components represent may be combined with other elements of the pattern generation system  (as shown in ) to produce a further embodiment of a novel object handling system.","A defined pattern may exist in a previously existing form or it may be created by a user for a particular application. As an example of the former case, the Universal Postal Union (UPU) often provides guidance as to where on a mail piece the addressee name, the city name, etc. may appear for various countries. Such definition is almost always descriptive rather than proscriptive and often very approximate. In the latter case, a customer may establish a set of patterns for use in his application. Incoming mail and a country just establishing its addressing standards would be examples of the latter, as would use of the system for handling parts on a Boeing aircraft.","A typical address defined pattern  () might identify:\n\n","The pattern  may associate two principle kinds of information: a designator for information type (city name, addressee name, etc.) and categorizing information that allows the parser to determine what kind of object information it has found on the object. An example of categorizing information might be where a ZIP code can be located on a mail piece. Location can be either absolute (say from the leading edge of an envelope) or relative (with reference, say, to the left-hand edge of the address block or to another element on the envelope). The four-digit extension of the ZIP Code may be located to the right of the five-digit ZIP Code in the US. In addition, the pattern  may contain information on whether each of the pattern elements must appear or are optional.","Because the system  can apply fuzzy matching throughout the parsing process (see below), the matches to names may be inexact or exact, their placement may be inexact or exact, and even a \u201crequired\u201d item may be missing and the object handled provided the remaining information allows unique classification via one or more of the patterns.","Often a single defined pattern is not sufficient for a broad set of objects. There are two reasons for this. Consider the case of an address. First, there might be multiple allowed or commonly used address forms, each of which has its own defined pattern. Second, the address on the envelope may be sufficiently incomplete, inaccurate, or ambiguous that it must be approached from several different perspectives before proper confidence in how to handle it can be achieved. Third, user-specific business rules may impose additional constraints or order of precedence that is reflected in the patterns. For example, a user may require that the result of a pattern for which city and province elements match exactly be preferred over the result of a pattern with only a postcode match.","A pattern can provide a description of the expected address and a description of the output that is to be returned with a match on a particular pattern. The output data may be described using meta-tags, constant data, spatial relationships, and constant strings like \u201cRecipient:\u201d. Meta-tags in the patterns may be ordered so as to instruct which tag to attempt to match on first. If no match value is found for the higher priority tag values, the system moves on to the next pattern. Meta-tag values also may have qualifiers, like, \u2018require exact match\u2019 or \u2018allow abbreviation match\u2019. The system can use the ordering of each element in the pattern to predetermine and pre-limit possible candidate values for subsequent data elements.","The output description is associated with a match on the particular pattern, including a result weighting. There may be from one to N patterns used to match on a given set of inputs. These are checked against the input data in an ordered manner until a match is made. The result is weighted (ie. for the confidence in the result) and qualified as a finalization or non-finalization. The output is pulled from the data base row that this pattern matches to so may include any data in that data base row.","There may be a defined order to the patterns to be applied to a particular object, with the intention that some be executed first and others later, perhaps conditionally. A pattern may be set early in the order of processing because it allows a more complete classification of the data from the object, because it is more likely to provide unambiguous results, is more likely to occur, or for many other reasons.","Based on a given object  () such as a mail piece, the directory system may have several predefined patterns that include different sets of categories or different spatial associations with one or more of the categories. A first pattern may be selected that is a preferred format or template, or one that simply includes a more complete address or larger number of categories. The directory system may analyze the image of the object  by sequentially comparing the object information with the category information of the selected pattern. If the first object information (or first field) of the object  matches the first category information of the selected pattern, than the directory system may proceed to a next object information (or second field) for comparison with the category information.","A successful matching of one or more of the object information may assist the directory system in interpreting or identifying object information in a subsequent field. For example, if a first object information identifies a state of an address, the directory system may utilize the state information to determine which city is included in the address based on a narrowed database search associated with the city(ies) which reside in that state.","Accordingly, analyzing the object information can be instructive in identifying a process associated with a corresponding pattern. Furthermore, the selected pattern can be instructive in identifying or interpreting specific fields of object information that otherwise may not be clear absent correlation with the category information of the pattern both for the field in question and based on the other fields of the object. The order that the fields are examined or processed may be defined in the pattern.","If all, or a sufficient number, of the object information correlates with the category information, then the directory system may determine that the selected pattern provides a good match with the mail piece. The directory system may process the object  according to instructions associated with the selected pattern. On the other hand, if the object information does not sufficiently correlate with the category information, the directory system selects a next pattern for comparison.","Confidence in a match made with a specific pattern is also a consideration. There is, not only, a defined order to which patterns are applied to an object, but also, patterns are assigned a confidence level that is reported upon a match. For instance, a match for a mail piece may be attempted with a pattern that requires an exact match on the City, State and Zip code, and if this fails a subsequent pattern may only require a match on the Zip code. A match on the later pattern while instructive may also include a lesser confidence code.","Source code for a sample address pattern is provided as

instructions on what to do with the object when an instance of a defined pattern is found. The components of the defined patterns are listed in the database in such a way that the parser can tell which defined pattern(s) they apply to. This linkage may be as direct as database elements that assign the components to a particular pattern or patterns (pattern numbers or names, for example) or it may be implied by the database structure. A column may be headed by a header \u201cProvince Name\u201d, for example, with specific province names repeated for all the cities in the province, neighborhoods in the cities, etc. (which appear in subsequent columns), and any pattern requiring that information about an address would use the data in those columns.","Entries (typically rows) in the database may relate to one or more defined patterns. That is, the parser may use the same set of database entries to attempt to match more than one pattern. This is particularly true when two patterns differ only by an optional item. For example, if the \u201cNeighborhood\u201d is an optional address element, one pattern may direct the parser to look for it in a particular place on the mail piece while another ignores the neighborhood and looks for a city name in the same location on the object. The parser would in this circumstance use the same database row to try to match the data from the object to the two different patterns, and would follow the instructions associated with that row once a match was found.","A typical simple example of a mail piece database would have one row for each delivery point in the country. The row might contain all the elements that would be present were the address complete and in this case the entire database would be applicable to all patterns. A more complex database might have regions of the database applicable to specific patterns and not applicable to others. The database would then have an indicator, useable by the parser, of which part of the database to use for a particular pattern. Different patterns may be associated with different databases and different pattern sets may use apply to a single database.","The database may contain additional information to improve the parser's ability to match text strings contained in the object information. Non-standard abbreviations, transliterations, aliases, and numeric transformations (e.g. \u201c1\u201d to \u201cONE\u201d or \u201cSIETE\u201d to \u201cVII\u201d) specific to the pattern domain may be included. Word translation lists may be defined for multilingual applications. Mappings may be specified between characters with accent marks or non-Latin characters and their typographic or OCR equivalent. For example, the user may want to treat TV and \u2018n\u2019 as equivalent, or \u2018\u00fc\u2019 and \u2018ue\u2019 as equivalent.","The database allows the parser to determine whether the address block object data  found on the object matches one of the defined patterns. The parser\/database combination may allow matching of more than one pattern and a module for resolving the ambiguity. For example, a neighborhood and a city might have the same name (in Mexico, for example, it is quite possible to have a delivery point for which the district, city, and neighborhood all have the same name, only some of which appear on the mail piece).","If there are different routing instructions if the pattern matches that duplicated name to the city or if it matches it to the neighborhood, the parser may attempt to match both patterns and, getting a match to both, pass the results to a module that resolves the ambiguity by only routing the item to the deepest place in the sort that matches both patterns (in this case, the city level). The database may also be configured to automatically provide such decisions by putting the routing code for the city level of sort as the routing instructions for every city\/neighborhood pairing that is duplicated.","Once a match to a defined pattern has been made, the database provides instructions on what to do with the object. For a mail piece, the database might include and return a bar code to be sprayed or printed on the mail piece. Typically, each row in the database is unique and each one has one set of instructions to be implemented. In many cases the instructions may be the same for many database rows. For example, a country that automatically sorts only to neighborhood level and leaves it up to the courier to determine the final delivery may provide a database that contains street names and numbers but provides the same routing instructions for all streets and number ranges within a particular neighborhood. Multiple matches may be returned.","The instructions provided by the database may be code numbers that the rest of the system (e.g. the mail sorting system) knows how to interpret to properly handle the object. The instructions in the directory system may include a tracking code for a matched object, Latitude and Longitude coordinates () that may be used to further qualify a destination address, or instructions in plain text to a user on what to do with the object.","The Parser",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"40"},"The parser  is illustrated as comprising several components, including a controller , configuration manager , pattern matcher , component matcher , and arbitrator . The parser  combines the other three components\u2014the data from the object, the defined patterns, and the database elements\u2014and passes on to the rest of the system the instructions for handling the object. A primary purpose of the parser is to handle all the inaccuracies and errors that occur in the real world. Thus, in every step of what is described below as the functioning of the parser, it should be understood that the parser may be correcting errors in the object data or in the database and providing leeway in determining how well the data from the object matches a given defined pattern.","The parser may supply to the rest of the system not only handling instructions, but how confident it is that those instructions are correct. The uncertainty measurement by the parser may be used by the system (whether for a single information element or for the entire data extracted from the object) to modify the handling of the object, to request a new image from the object, to try a different pattern, to call for manual intervention, or to otherwise modify the handling of the object.","The parser receives object data  from the object, which data is intended by the system to provide information sufficient for determining how to handle the object, and which in turn identifies categorizing information. In a mail piece, the object data comprises a string of character data that might comprise an address element, whereas the category data comprises the X-Y coordinates of each of those characters. Stated another way, the object data provides the directory system with raw data while the category data provides information that allows the parser to determine what kind of information the raw data contains.","The parser has access to the defined patterns and instructions  on how to apply them. These instructions  may be to apply them sequentially until a match above a certain confidence is found, to apply them until all possible matches are found, or almost anything else. In particular, the instructions  may tell the order in which to apply the patterns (and under what circumstances to cease applying them) for determining handling instructions for a given object.","The parser also has access to the database and uses the information in the database to attempt to fill in the defined patterns with information extracted from the object. It can fulfill this function in many ways, but the following describes one possible application to a mail piece. The parser has received categorizing information as well as object data from the object. It uses this categorizing information  to determine what pattern data element a piece of object data might represent. Thus a five digit number on a mail piece may be a ZIP code if it appears in the last line, but a street number if it appears in the second.","One goal of the parser is to fill in all the required elements of a defined pattern with data extracted from the object whose characterizing information is within the tolerances specified by the defined pattern. It fills in the elements by determining from the characterizing information which data elements the object data might be and determining from the database what specific data element in an actual address (or object data row) is matched, and how well.","If the parser is able to satisfactorily fill in a defined pattern with database objects of the proper type using object and characterizing information from the object, it reads the instructions  in the database on what to do with the object and makes that information available to the system. If it is unable to do so (or if its instructions tell it to keep working until all possible patterns are exhausted), it goes on to the next pattern and continues until no patterns remain. If it finds no satisfactory match it has default instructions that it outputs telling the system that no defined pattern was matched satisfactorily.","Smart Matching",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["50","52","51","65","59","58","54","52","54"]},"The directory data compiler  is provided to ensure that the configuration files  are well-formed. The directory data compiler system  validates two aspects of the configuration files : structure and data content. The configuration file  is said to be structurally invalid if, for example, it contains improper elements or is missing a closing tag. The configuration file  is said to have invalid data content if element or attribute data does not match the type specified in the schema. For example, a positive integer value is expected for searchOrder; a content error would result if the attribute had the string value \u201cbunny.\u201d","Note that some kinds of logic errors may not be readily detected. For example, an address pattern  may have used a component name that does not match a corresponding address data field name. Additional checking may be performed by the directory system ()  at run-time to notify the user of such errors.","Runtime character matching allows for the specification of the name of the file that contains mappings to allow the directory system to match common character alternates. For example, \u2018\u00d6\u2019 could exist in the directory data , but it will likely be recognized using OCR without the umlaut, so the mapping \u2018\u00d6\u2019\u2192\u2018O\u2019 can be made to improve fuzzy matching performance. In one embodiment, only one CharacterMatchTable 55 element is allowed. The character match table file  may include a UTF-8 encoded text file, with one mapping per line. A mapping is declared with the character found in the directory data  on the left, followed by a dash-greater than style arrow sign (\u201c\u2192\u201d), followed by the mapped character. The dash-greater than style arrow sign is also illustrated herein as a simple right-directional arrow for convenience.","More than one mapping may be declared for the same directory data character, with each character appearing on a separate line. For example:","\u00d6\u2192O","\u00d6\u21928","Note that the character match table  may be case-sensitive. Therefore character mappings that are meant to apply to non case-sensitive fields have upper case values on both sides of the \u201c\u2192\u201d.","Word matching allows for the specification of the name of the file that contains mappings to allow the directory system to match common word alternates. For example, \u201cMOUNT\u201d could exist in the directory data  as part of a field value, but it is commonly abbreviated as \u201cMT\u201d, so the mapping \u201cMOUNT\u201d \u201cMT\u201d should be made to improve fuzzy matching performance. In one embodiment, only one <WordMatchTable> element is allowed.","The word match table file  may be a UTF-8 encoded text file, with one mapping per line.

More than one mapping may be declared for the same directory data word, with each character appearing on a separate line.

For example:","20TH\u2192TWENTIETH","TWENTY\u219220","An ignorable word option specifies the name of the file that contains words such as articles and prepositions which the directory system can ignore in the input string or directory string while fuzzy matching. For example, if the ignorable words table contains \u201cOF\u201d and \u201cTHE\u201d, then the input string \u201cAVENUE AMERICAS\u201d will fuzzy match the directory string \u201cAVENUE OF THE AMERICAS\u201d. Similarly, the input string \u201cAVENUE OF THE AMERICAS\u201d will fuzzy match the directory string \u201cAVENUE AMERICAS\u201d. A small penalty may be applied to the match score for each ignored word so that a better score is achieved if the ignorable words are present and matched. In one embodiment, ignorable words must match exactly; \u201cTHF\u201d would not be ignorable if the table only contained \u201cTHE\u201d.","The ignorable words table  file may be a UTF-8 encoded text file with one ignorable word per line. Leading and trailing whitespace may be trimmed. In one embodiment whitespace is not allowed within the word.","Customer address data  consists of address records  and alias tables . Customer address data  can be imported into the directory system from a text file that contains either delimited or fixed-width fields. An XML configuration file is used to define the fields to be loaded along with properties of those fields, and specify the locations of the fields in the data file. Whether fixed-width or delimited, a customer address data file  is expected to have one record per line, with a line feed character (\u2018\\n\u2019) at the end of each line.","A customer address data configuration file , which contains at least one address file definition and may contain one or more optional alias file definitions, is used by the directory data compiler  to create the directory data file . Note that the example uses only delimited address and alias files, but both delimited and fixed width files can be mixed in the same configuration.","For fields that are not case-sensitive, values (including aliases) are converted to all upper case. If an upper case equivalent does not exist for a character then it is not modified. For example:","\u201cRedmond Woodinville\u201d\u2192\u201cREDMOND WOODINVILLE\u201d","\u201c90th\u201d\u2192\u201c90TH\u201d","Character match, word match, and ignorable words may be provided in one or more tables. In one embodiment, character match, word match, and ignorable words are not converted and are always case-sensitive. Therefore values that are meant to apply to non case-sensitive fields are given in upper case.","Field aliases can be defined to improve address pattern matching. An alias is an alternate but equivalent representation of data for a specific field value. For example, \u201cCalif\u201d and \u201cCalifornia\u201d are sometimes used as aliases for the preferred, canonical two-letter state code \u201cCA\u201d. If either \u201cCalif\u201d or \u201cCalifornia\u201d is found in an address block it may be considered a match to a record that contains the canonical field value \u201cCA\u201d. Each alias table is tied to a specific field. So while \u201cMontana\u201d may be an alias for the state field value \u201cMT\u201d, it is not an alias for the word \u201cMT\u201d in the street field value \u201cMT SHASTA\u201d.","Consider the following sample of a delimited table of two-letter state code aliases. An alias may consist of a single value or a list of values. For example, there might be multiple aliases for a city name.

The Pattern file  () contains one or more patterns, each identified by a customer-defined name. The directory system attempts to match each pattern in the order in which it appears in the file. In one embodiment, a pattern  defines a single configuration of an address block  and the fields  that will be returned to the caller for each address record that successfully matches the pattern .","A line represents a single line of an address as it appears on a piece of mail. In one embodiment, a line must contain at least one component, and can also contain noise. The position of each <Line> element in the AddressBlock  is important since the pattern matcher utilizes the same relative positions in the input data.","A component is a piece of an address, such as postcode or street name, which is represented by a field in the directory data. <Component> elements are defined for a line in the same order in which they are expected to appear in the input data.","The pattern matcher can determine in what order it should search the input data for matching component values. Some components are considered optional and an address record will not be rejected if it has a component value that was not found in the input. For example, if street suffix is optional, then the input \u201cMAIN\u201d will match the record \u201cMAIN ST\u201d. Given two records that are identical except one has a matching optional component and the other does not, the one with the matching optional component is preferred. For example, given the input \u201cMAIN ST\u201d, the record \u201cMAIN ST\u201d is preferred over \u201cMAIN RD\u201d and simply \u201cMAIN\u201d if street suffix is optional.","The component matcher can scan each line from right to left looking for the component instead of left to right. This can improve matching performance for components that are typically found on the right side of the line, such as postcode.","Each character in the directory data string must be represented by a character in each possibility set of the text or OCR string. If all values for the field have one word and the same number of characters, the matcher is able to handle a limited number of split\/merge cases (i.e. directory data string is split into two or is merged with another string in the input). A single missing, leading zero digit is allowed for fields that are all numeric. For example, the directory data string \u201c08010\u201d matches the input string \u201c8010\u201d.","A fuzzy logic matching confidence threshold can be set for the component.

A better match may be required for \u201cHigh\u201d than for \u201cLow\u201d.

For example, with this feature enabled the directory string \u201cSalt Lake City\u201d would match the input \u201cSLC\u201d. Similarly, the directory string \u201cMLK\u201d would match the input \u201cMartin Luther King\u201d.

For example, with this feature enabled the directory string \u201cComte d'Urgell\u201d would match the input \u201cComte de Urgell\u201d.

In the example provided, the information shown in the address result box  matches, or nearly matches, the last line of the address block . The abbreviation for Mexico is provided as MEX in the address block , whereas it is fully identified as \u201cMexico\u201d in the address result box .","Database Optimization","The directory system may be used in applications such as high-speed mail sorting where response time is critical. The directory system is also designed to accommodate user data consisting of an arbitrary collection of fields, so database optimization must be able to automatically adapt to the data and patterns related to a specific application.","The directory system optimizes database access at compile time, when user data is normalized, analyzed, and loaded into a binary file format, and at initialization time, when software using the directory system is started. At compile time the directory system performs adaptive indexing to improve database query speed. By analyzing the data, patterns, and user configuration, the directory system determines which fields should be indexed to balance performance with database size. Indexes can significantly increase the database size, so it is not practical to create indexes for all combinations of fields. For example, consider a data set consisting of US addresses. The following pattern could be defined to match a complete address:\n\n","An index is created for state since the pattern matcher will need the list of city values associated with the parsed state. Similarly, a two-field index for state-city is created because the pattern matcher will retrieve a list of streets associated with the previously parsed state-city combination. A three-field index, state-city-street, is also created, but since the number of records associated with a specific state-city-street combination is relatively small this will be the last index created for this pattern. At this point entire records would be fetched instead of values for a single field.","At initialization the directory system analyzes the patterns and preemptively caches data that will be queried frequently or may be too expensive to access at parse-time. Given the US address pattern described above, for example, the directory system knows to query the database to generate a static list of all state values to be used by the pattern matcher. The directory system then analyzes the size of the list of state values. If the list is not too long, the directory system queries the database to create a static, associative table of city values for each state value. These static data structures can be orders of magnitude faster to access and manipulate compared the same operations with a SQL query.","A Specific Address Use Case may include a single data base and a set of patterns to correlate a result with context information. Iceland mail is formatted as follows.\n\n","For routing in smaller cities you typically need \u201cPostcode\u201d and \u201cCity Name\u201d (cities with only one Postcode) and for larger cities you need \u201cStreet Name\u201d and sometimes \u201cHouse Number\u201d (where a street could be in multiple nine digit postcode areas), \u201cPostcode\u201d and\/or \u201cCity Name\u201d. In either case, the return is a nine digit \u201cPost code\u201d. Addresses only have three digit \u201cPostcodes\u201d. For Example, when considering this Icelandic address:\n\n","This routes to 10500250000 if you route it with postcode, city, and street name. However if you specify a route based only on \u201cPostcode\u201d and \u201cCity\u201d, this address may not be verifiable because it is a \u201cLarge\u201d city where street and house number may be required by the Directory. However, when considering this one:\n\n","This address will finalize and route by \u201cPostcode\u201d and \u201cCity\u201d because it's from a smaller city and this routes to 235000000.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0158"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["86","92"]},"The third line of text may be understood to be a short-hand or abbreviated form of the street address that may not be identical with a directory entry. The directory system may initially query the directory to locate partial matches to one or more of the words \u201cPAU\u201d or \u201cCLARIS\u201d or that include the number \u201c161\u201d.","The zip code and country (e.g. 080307 BARCELONA) on the other hand, may provide an exact match in the directory. Upon finding one or more matches with the street address, the directory system may then compare those records with valid street addresses that are associated with the validated zip code and country. In the directory result box  of the example provided, the directory system has validated \u201cCALLE DE PAU CLARIS 161\u201d as being associated with the third line in the address block.","Validation of the street address may be accomplished by comparing stored street addresses for the validated zip code and country, and by verifying a confidence level of the match of the scanned street address with the stored street addresses. In one embodiment, the zip code and country is validated before searching for the street address match to further narrow the number of initial directory results prior to performing the fuzzy logic match.","Canonical Address Translation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0144","num":"0162"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["102","102"],"img":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002","he":"3.56mm","wi":"1.78mm","file":"US09058543-20150616-P00002.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003","he":"3.56mm","wi":"1.78mm","file":"US09058543-20150616-P00002.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}]},"In the illustrated example, the relationship between the proper name and the aliases of the names may be stored or referenced via shared information on the Internet as provided in OCR box . Upon identifying the standardized version of the town's name, the directory system may then revise the address of the mail piece to replace the older or local version of the name of the town in order to generate the canonical address .","This same concept may be utilized, for example, for sorting and delivery of international mail pieces. In additional to historical reasons where the names of cities may be different from one another, names of cities and countries may be spelled quite differently simply as a result of the various languages involved. An alias table which identifies all of the different variations for the various languages can thereby associate the variations with a canonical version of the name. For example, the canonical version of the name of a country may be the version that is native to the country in question, whereby all other deviations of that name that are typically used in other countries are associated as aliases. In another embodiment, the canonical version of all the names are those associated with the versions adopted by a particular accepted language, such as French.","In the European Union, a name of a city or country may be spelled quite differently depending on the language of choice. By way of example, The Netherlands is commonly referred to by a number of different names including Holland and Les Pays-Bas, to name a few. By associating these names with a canonical version of the address, whether a letter addressed to Amsterdam originated in France or in the U.K. a standardized address or label may be sprayed, printed, or otherwise applied to the letter which would identify the same canonical name for the destination country. By extension, a single canonical address can be applied for all of the different variations that exist either by convention or due to differences in languages.","By way of a further example, a mail piece from the United States comes into China, written in English. It is written to correspond to one of several possible Chinese address templates where the components are all in English. The canonical output format, however, is not in English at all, but in Chinese. The directory system templates and translation to canonical address formats can be used to automatically translate the address from one language (and is associated templates) to another language, including the canonical template for that country. In operation, a sequence of English-language templates are applied to the mail piece and once the template components are filled in, the address code for delivery is extracted from the database. The delivery code may then be sprayed, printed, or otherwise applied to the mail piece for routing using bar code readers.","A format translation database derives a delivery code by applying templates which point to the canonical form of the address. The process may work for part of an address or the entire address. For example, the mail piece may identify a city but not a state. The template can identify a unique city without any reference to the state, and output both the city name and the state as the official format for application on the mail piece. Similarly, the directory system can identify the canonical address written in a different language from that identified on the mail piece as originally received.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0168"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["118","112","113","118","112","116","118","118","114","112","115"]},"Handwriting Recognition","A handwriting engine is highly reliant on contextual information in order to properly read text. Contextual information allows the engine to be able to resolve ambiguous words by being able to apply a dictionary of possible words to a written word. The directory system may be used as the contextual system for a handwriting engine. The directory system allows the user to create a parsable structure for text and an associated dictionary for each of the fields in that block of text. For example, a US address block contains different fields that need to be read (city name, ZIP code, street name, etc.) and those text fields are in a small set of possible locations. As another example, a personal check has a set of fields that are to be read (date, amount, recipient, etc.) with those fields in a specific set of locations.","Handwriting applications would normally be written for a specific usage scenario without the ability to easily reuse the handwriting engine in a new situation. With the directory system a handwriting engine can easily be used in new situations by changing the configuration and\/or changing the data dictionary. Effectively, this makes the handwriting engine the parser described above, using the patterns and the database to read the handwritten text.","A configuration is created that specifies the set of possible layouts of text elements that are to be read by the handwriting engine. Each text element in the configuration is associated with a data dictionary. The dictionary for each element may be dependent on previous elements (for example, list of streets in a particular city). The dictionary may also be a regular expression (for example, a date field on a check). The handwriting engine reads the configuration.","Given an input image containing handwritten text, the engine iterates through the words in the text block and while reading, determines which of the set of configured layouts this input text best matches. As it reads each input text element, it uses the dictionary for that element in a given text layout to determine how well that layout matches the input text block.","Automatic Pattern Generation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0173"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIGS. 2"],"b":["205","3","8","11"]},"Each input data image will contain input data corresponding to the Input Image Description in a specific defined area of interest. The area of interest is meant to represent a standard area of interest that may be encountered in the processing of like input data images.","At operation , descriptions of the images are entered or loaded to the directory system. The descriptions may, but is not required to, identify a location of specific fields or components to provide a set of spatial identifiers. For example, one location of an address block may be described as \u201ccountry\u201d, whereas another location of the address block may be described as \u201cstreet address\u201d. Different patterns are associated with a different set of descriptions or spatial identifiers.","The sample input data identifies the pattern name that is associated with a specific input image, the priority and\/or confidence level of this pattern, the pattern field element names, the corresponding data found in each pattern field element on the image area and in the area of interest, and the specific outputs that should be associated with a match on a given image pattern.","At operation , a number of patterns are generated based on the images and associated descriptions. A different pattern may be generated for each image and image description combination. The patterns correlate the image data with the associated description and optional spatial identifiers. The patterns may be associated with one or more aliases for certain of the address fields or components.","For example, the customer creates N images, where each image shows a single representative example of a typical image to be processed including an example of a typical data format with data in the typical locations. When the set of N images are taken together they represent the entire collection of data formats that the customer system processes using the patterns to be created. These N images have specific data on them. This data would be identified in an accompanying text image data description file. The data description file includes the image name, the data that should be found on that image and the \u2018meta-tag\u2019 that this specific data item is associated with.

The pattern output may identify what information will be sprayed, printed, or otherwise applied to the mail piece if the associated pattern provides a match. In one embodiment, the pattern output identifies a canonical address.","At operation , the patterns are weighted. For example, a first pattern may be weighted higher than a second pattern. The pattern weighting may indicate a preferred or standard format for the addresses. In one embodiment, the pattern weighting relates to a confidence level in how complete the information associated with the pattern is. For example, a pattern which identifies both city and state may have a higher weighting, or confidence, than a pattern which only identifies the city.","At operation , confidence thresholds are specified for the patterns. The confidence threshold may identify to what degree the image data of the scanned mail piece must match a particular pattern before a match is determined or verified. If the confidence threshold for a pattern is not met, then the directory system moves on to the next lower weighted pattern to determine if a match with the next pattern can be met. In one embodiment, the directory system stops comparing the image data with the patterns once the confidence threshold for a corresponding pattern is met. In this way, the highest weighted pattern which is validated for the mail piece is selected as a match, or as a best match with the image data. Different patterns may have different confidence thresholds.","This system takes the loaded information and generates a plurality or deck of patterns based on the set of sample input data images and the sample input data image descriptions described above. This includes generating a single pattern based on each image and its corresponding description and specifying a confidence matching threshold for each pattern.
