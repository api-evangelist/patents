{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application generally relates to RF communications and cables for transmitting RF signals and, in particular, to a flexible cable capable of transmitting RF signals and methods of manufacturing such cable.","As consumer electronics devices become more compact and achieve greater functionality, it has become increasingly difficult to arrange the interior components to realize higher density. This is especially so with wireless communications devices, including handheld devices, personal digital assistants, mobile smartphones, etc., where the devices are increasingly compact, yet include a greater number of components and features than ever before. Many such devices now include keyboards, cameras, trackballs, display screens (ordinary or touchscreen), memory cards, speakers, microphones, I\/O jacks, and multiple antennas, for cellular, IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth\u00ae, GPS, and other radio frequency communications. This has made the configuration of the components challenging and puts circuit board space at a premium.","The shrinking size of mobile communication devices and the inclusion of multiple RF antennas within the devices lead to difficulty with issues of interference and isolation. In order to improve isolation and minimize interference, some mobile communication devices will locate antennas at opposite ends of the device so as to try to maximize the physical distance between the two antennas. This technique is limited by the size of the device and by the fact that the antennas are typically connected to common circuitry or ground planes, which can lead to problems in achieving adequate isolation between the antennas. The need to place antennas in different parts of the device can lead to situations in which RF signals need to be transmitted from one portion of the device to another.","In a two-piece device, such as a slider or flip-phone, a flex cable is often used to send signals between two different pieces of the device. Existing flex cables are typically designed to support transmission of low frequency or digital signals and are too lousy and noisy for use in transmitting RF-level signals.","It would advantageous to provide for a flexible cable capable of transporting RF-level signals.","Similar reference numerals may have been used in different figures to denote similar components.","In one aspect, the present application discloses flexible cable for communicating RF signals. The cable includes an elongate base substrate including a dielectric layer with an upper metal layer deposited on one side and a lower metal layer deposited on its other side; and two parallel spaced-apart series of vias formed along the length of the base substrate, each via electrically interconnecting the upper metal layer and the lower metal layer, whereby a rectangular cross-sectional waveguide is provided between the upper metal layer, the lower metal layer and the two series of vias.","In another aspect, the present application discloses a method of manufacturing a flexible cable. The method includes providing an elongate base substrate including a dielectric layer with an upper metal layer deposited on one side and a lower metal layer deposited on its other side; and forming two parallel spaced-apart series of vias along the length of the base substrate, each via electrically interconnecting the upper metal layer and the lower metal layer, whereby a rectangular cross-sectional waveguide is provided between the upper metal layer, the lower metal layer and the two series of vias.","Current mobile communication devices come in a number of form factors. For example, many devices adopt a \u201ccandy bar\u201d form factor in which the device has a single rigid casing in which all components are housed. Other mobile communication devices use two-piece form factors, such as \u201cflip-phones\u201d and \u201csliders\u201d and \u201cswivel phones\u201d. A flip-phone is a two-piece device in which the two pieces are interconnected by a pivoting mechanism. A base portion of the flip-phone is connected to a second portion of the flip-phone by way of a hinge. In a closed position, the second portion substantially overlays the base portion. In a slider phone, the base portion and second portion (or \u201cslider portion\u201d) are connected together by way of a sliding mechanism that allows the slider portion to move relative to the base portion between a closed position, in which the slider portion substantially overlaps the base portion, and an extended position, in which the slider portion is parallel to but substantially offset from the base portion. The sliding mechanism often includes grooves, tracks or rails linking the two portions and permitting the slider portion to move linearly into its extended position.","To the extent that the present application describes or relates to slider phones, the present application is not limited to any particular slider mechanism or method of interconnecting a base portion and slider portion. In some cases, the present application may be applicable to other two-piece form factors, including flip-phones and swivel phones, as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art after reviewing the following disclosure.","Mobile communication devices that employ a two-piece form factor, such as a slider phone, a flip phone, or swivel phone, typically need a way of communicating data between the base portion and the second (e.g. slider) portion. For example, the base portion may include the processor, memory, and various other components, whereas the second portion may include the display or keypad or other components of the phone. In many devices, multiple data lines are used to communicate data between components in the second portion and components in the base portion. Because the second portion moves relative to the base portion, flexible communication lines are used to interconnect the components and circuitry (if any) in the second portion with the circuitry in the base portion. For these purposes, many devices employ a flex cable.","Reference is now made to , which diagrammatically shows an example mobile communication device . The mobile communication device  in this example is configured as a slider phone having a base portion  and a slider portion , although it will be appreciated that the present application is applicable to two-piece form factors more generally. The slider portion  includes a display  and buttons or user navigation features . The base portion  includes a keypad or keyboard . When in a closed position, in which the base portion  and slider portion  substantially overlap, the keyboard  is not accessible. When the slider portion  is pulled into the extended position, the keyboard  becomes accessible and usable.","Although in this example the features of the slider portion  are visible when the device  is in a closed position and the features of the base portion  are inaccessible when the device  is in the closed position, in other examples the features of the base portion  may be visible when the device  is in the closed position and the features of the slider portion  may be inaccessible when the device  is a closed position. In such an embodiment, the slider portion  may be \u201cunderneath\u201d the base portion , and is pulled out to make it accessible.","Reference is now made to , which diagrammatically illustrate the slider-type mobile communications device  in partly closed and fully extended positions, respectively. The base portion  and slider portion  are electrically interconnected by way of a flex cable . The flex cable  permits data communication between components within the base portion  and the slider portion .","The flex cable  is structured such that it is capable of folding upon itself, which permits the slider portion  and base portion  to move relative to each other even while interconnected by the flex cable . As will be see in , when the slider portion  and base portion  substantially overlap, the flex cable  folds over upon itself as its end points or connection points (labeled  and ) are brought closer together. When the slider portion  is moved linearly into the extended position, as illustrated in , the connection points ,  are drawn apart from one another, pulling the flex cable  into a substantially flat or extended position.","The flex cable  is visible in  for ease of illustration. It will be appreciated that typical mobile communication devices will not have an exposed flex cable; rather, the flex cable will be generally housed within the structure of the slider portion , base portion , or slider mechanism connecting the two. In general, the device  is structured so as to provide sufficient space within its casing(s) for the folding and extension of the flex cable . Due to the limited volume available in a typical device, the flex cable is usually a single layer flex and the folding action of the flex is limited spatially in the x direction.","Existing slider phones typically house all RF-related components within the base portion . The RF-related components include RF antennas, such as for Bluetooth\u00ae, WiFi, cellular, GPS, or other such communications, and their corresponding transceivers. A typical transceiver generates RF-level signals for driving the antenna during transmissions, and receives RF signals induced in the antenna during reception. The received analog RF signals may be filtered, conditioned, or otherwise shaped, before being sampled and digitized. The digitized signal is then stored in memory or supplied to other digital components within the device , such as a processor, which may include a digital signal processor or a microprocessor or any other such digital processing element.","The antennas used in the device  may have any of a number of different configurations, depending on the specific frequency and application for which they are intended. Example antennas may be monopole, dipole, inverted-F, patch, microstrip, slot antennas, chip antennas, or any of a variety of other types. In some cases, multiple antenna configurations are combined to realize a particular antennas, such as, for example, a folded meander-line inverted-F antenna, or a patch antenna with slots and parasitic elements. The range of possible antenna configurations will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.","In some cases, the device  may include a diversity antenna. In the context of the present application, the term \u201cdiversity antenna\u201d refers to two antennas placed a distance apart to achieve spatial\/polarization\/pattern diversity. In some cases, one antenna is intended for transmission and the other for reception (transmit\/receive diversity). In other cases, the two antennas may both be intended for reception, transmission, or both (spatial\/polarization\/pattern diversity). In the latter case, the device  may select one of the antennas for transmitting or receiving a particular signal based upon a comparison of measurements such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As the device  changes position, one of the antennas may be exposed to a stronger signal and the device  may begin to use it instead. In yet another embodiment, the signals received by the two antennas may be jointly used to improve the quality of the reconstructed received signal (for example, a time-domain convolution of the two signals together to improve the signal-to-noise ratio).","Reference is now made to , which shows a simplified block diagram of an example embodiment of a slider-type mobile communications device . The device  includes a base portion  and a slider portion . The base portion  and slider portion  are mechanically connected though a slider mechanism (not illustrated), which permits the slider portion  to slide between a closed position and an extended position.","The device  includes a first antenna  located in the base portion , and a second antenna  located in the slider portion . It will be understood that the base portion  further includes a processor, memory and other circuitry and components not specifically illustrated in . In particular, the base portion  includes a transceiver (not shown) for the first antenna .","The transceiver (not shown) for the second antenna  may, in some embodiments, be located within the slider portion . In other embodiments, the transceiver for the second antenna  may be located in the base portion .","In this particular embodiment, the first antenna  is located proximate to an end of the base portion  furthest from the slider portion  when in its extended position, and the second antenna  is located in proximate to an end of the slider portion  furthest from the base portion  when in the extended position. In this configuration, the antennas ,  are able to achieve a large spatial separation when the device  is in the extended position. Moreover, the antennas ,  may experience fewer attenuation and interference problems when in these locations.","Referring still to , the base portion  includes a base ground plane . The operation and radiation pattern of first antenna  is influenced by the base ground plane . This is especially true in low frequency operation where the device chassis becomes part of the radiating element.","The slider portion  includes a slider ground plane . The slider ground plane  impacts the operation and radiation pattern of the second antenna . In the present embodiment, the slider ground plane  is electrically connected to the base ground plane  at low frequencies (DC to kHz) but becomes open circuit in high frequencies (MHz to GHz). The use of an RF separated ground plane for the second antenna  reduces destructive current flows between the two antennas ,  that may occur when they share a common ground plane. This may be advantageous for antennas ,  that are intended for diversity applications, such as CDMA or Edge Evolution.","Reference is now made to , which diagrammatically shows a second example embodiment of the device .  shows, in block diagram form, a processor  and a first transceiver  in the base portion . The processor  communications with and is configured to control the first transceiver . The first transceiver  receives RF level signals from the first antenna  when receiving signals and drives the first antenna  with RF level signals when transmitting. Among its functions, the first transceiver  demodulates the received RF level signals and modulates transmit signals. It will be understood that the device  includes many other components, including memory, I\/O devices, etc., that communicate with and operate under the control of the processor .","The slider portion  includes a second transceiver  for receiving signals from the second antenna  and for driving the second antenna  with RF level signals during transmission. The second transceiver  operates under control of the processor . Accordingly, the processor  or related components (under control of the processor ) within the base portion  provide the second transceiver  with a data signal or other information with which to modulate an RF level signal for transmission. Additionally, the second transceiver  provides a demodulated data signal to the processor  upon demodulating a received RF level signal. The communication of data or information signals between the second transceiver  and the processor  occurs over data path .","Data path  is a digital serial or parallel link (or combination of both) between the second transceiver  within the slider portion  and the processor  or related components within the base portion . In other words, the data path  provides for digital communications between base portion  and the slider portion . In one embodiment, the data path  includes a flex cable, such as flex cable  from . In one example, additional signal lines are added to the flex cable  to provide for the data path  enabling communications between the second transceiver  and the processor . To reduce the number of signal lines necessary, the communications between the processor  and the transceiver  may, at least partly, be serial communications. In one example, the second antenna  and the second transceiver  are for GPS communications. The GPS communication protocol employs a serial link, meaning it requires fewer signal lines in the data path  than some other digital applications, such as the LCD display.","Reference is now made to , which diagrammatically shows a third example embodiment of the device . In addition to having the processor  and the first transceiver  in the base portion , in this embodiment the second transceiver  is located in the base portion  instead of the slider portion . Accordingly, the device  includes an RF link  between the second antenna  and the second transceiver .","The RF link  carries RF level signals between the second antenna  in the slider portion  and the second transceiver  in the base portion . The RF link  may, in some embodiments, include a flex cable, a coaxial cable, or any other medium capable of propagating RF level signals between the base portion  and the slider portion  without significant degradation of the signal.","Given that the slider portion  is arranged to move relative to the base portion , the RF Link  is configured to accommodate this movement. For example, the RF link  may be implemented by way of flex cable, as illustrated in ; however, flex cable may be excessively lousy at radio frequencies for some implementations. The use of flex cable may result in interference and signal distortions that would materially degrade the RF signal quality.","Coaxial cable may be used as the RF link  provided it is configured to permit movement of the slider portion  between its closed and extended positions. Reference is now made to , which illustrate an example configuration of such a cable.  diagrammatically shows an example slider-type mobile communications device  in a closed position.  shows the device  in an extended position. The device  is shown in a transparent planar view with all internal components omitted except for the RF link . In this example, the RF link  is a cable , such as a coaxial cable.","The cable  has a first end  fixed in position with respect to the base portion . The first end  may be connected, for example, to an RF port of the second transceiver (not shown). The cable  also has a second end  fixed in position with respect to the slider portion . The second end  may be connected, for example, to an RF signal port of the second antenna (not illustrated). The cable  is physically positioned to be coiled or looped within the horizontal plane of the device . In other words, the cable  forms a loop within either the base portion  or the slider portion  casings. The loop, when the device  is in the closed position, is of radius r. In one embodiment the radius ris approximately half the interior width of the device  casing so as to maximize the size of the loop. It will be understood that the cable  may, in some embodiments, have a minimum radius that must be maintained to ensure proper signal transmission. To form the loop, the cable  is arranged such that the first end  within the base portion  is fixed such that the cable  extends from the first end  towards the direction in which the slider portion  moves into the extended position. Similarly, the second end  within the slider portion  is fixed such that the cable  extends from the second end  away from the direction in which the slider portion  moves into the extended position.","Referring still to , it will be noted that when the device  is in a closed position, the two ends ,  are brought relatively close together. When the slider portion  is moved into the extended position, the second end  is drawn away from the first end , pulling the loop of the cable  smaller. When in the extended position, the loop has a radius r, which is smaller than the radius r. The distance that the slider portion  (and thus the second end ) translates is shown as d in . This distance d and the length of cable  may be selected to ensure that the radius rdoes not fall below a minimum radius for the cable .","Reference is now made to , which diagrammatically illustrate one example embodiment of the device .  illustrates the device  in a closed position, while  illustrates the device  in an open position. In this embodiment, the slider portion  includes a slot  in its casing between the slider portion  and the base portion . The slot  is arranged longitudinally with respect to the direction of translation of the slider portion . This allows the cable  freedom of movement in the longitudinal direction when its coil is tightening or loosening with movement of the slider portion .","In this embodiment, the second end  is attached to the slider portion  near, but just off axis from the slot . The first end  is attached to the base portion  near or along the axis of the slot . When in a closed position, as shown in , the ends ,  are brought close together, and the cable  is coiled with a large radius. It will be noted that the cable  is coiled substantially within the slider portion . Accordingly, the slider portion  in this embodiment includes a cavity or spacing within its casing, likely behind its display screen, for accommodating the cable .","As the slider portion  is moved into the open position, as shown in , the ends ,  of the cable  are drawn apart, causing the coil to tighten. The slot  allows the cable  the flexibility to coil in such a manner that it maintains as large a radius as possible.","In this embodiment, the slot  is formed in a wall of the casing of the slider portion  facing the base portion . In another embodiment, the slot  may be formed in that portion of the casing or housing of the base portion  that faces the slider portion .","It will be appreciated that the slider portion  and base portion  of the device  have separate housing or casings connected together by a slider mechanism. The housing or casing of each of the portions is generally \u201cflat\u201d, meaning it is relatively thin compared with its x- and y-dimensions, wherein the x- and y-dimensions are the dimensions illustrated in , , , and . The x- and y-dimensions may be referred to as the \u201chorizontal plane\u201d of the device or housing or casing. The cable  lies generally flat in the horizontal plane within the casings. In other words, it is coiled in the horizontal plane within the casings, and is afforded room within at least one of the casings to draw into a tighter (smaller radius) coil as the casings are slid apart (as illustrated in ).","Reference is now made to , which shows a cross-sectional view of a typical flex cable . The flex cable  is manufactured by providing a relatively thin flexible substrate  and depositing conductive material, such as copper, lengthwise along the substrate to form signal lines . A laminate  is then applied atop the signal lines .","If used for carrying RF signals, the flex cable  tends to be fairly lousy. For example, an RF signal carried by one of the signal lines  will radiate an electromagentic wave that will couple with adjacent signal lines , . Attenuation and interference may seriously degrade the quality of the RF signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIGS. 10 and 11","b":"170"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"],"b":["170","170","170","172","174","174","176","174","176","178","176","179","178"]},"In practice, substrate may often be obtained with a copper layer already attached to a dielectric (e.g. polyimide) material. A pattern may be etched into the copper layer, for example if making multiple flex cables in parallel. Subsequent dielectric layers or metallic layers may be bonded, a layer at a time, to the substrate material. Vias are then formed by drilling holes into the assembled layers and electroplating the vertical walls of the holes. A protective laminate may then be deposited on top or bottom of the assembled layers forming the flex cable. If shielding is required, a conductive laminate may be used instead of a dielectric laminate. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the range of manufacturing techniques that may be employed depending upon the specific materials being used for each layer of the flex cable.","The layered cable shown in  includes two strips of conductive material, , , with a dielectric layer  between them. The conductive metal layers ,  are then interconnected by two rows of vias  running the length of the flex cable . The two rows of vias  are placed down either longitudinal side of the two conductive layers , , to enclose an approximately rectangular dielectric-filled space . The vias  in each row are spaced sufficiently closely adjacent to each other (e.g. distance d) so as to appear as a solid wall to an RF signal having a particular wavelength. In one embodiment, the spacing between adjacent vias  is less than 1\/10of the operating wavelength. Practically, from a manufacturing point of view, there is little or no additional cost associated with adding more vias, so the limitation on the number of closely spaced vias is the mechanical integrity of the flex cable .","The space  surrounded by the conductive layers , , and vias  acts as a rectangular waveguide for a propagating wave. Thus the cable  is capable of carrying electromagnetic waves having particular properties, such as a wavelength within certain ranges dependent upon the dimensions of the cable  cross section, without significant energy loss to the ambient surrounding as compared to conventional flex cable.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the flex cable  may be operative connected to components for transmitting RF waves using a low profile coaxial connector. One example of such a connector is a Hirose\u2122 FL-series low profile coaxial connector. Other types or brands of suitable connectors will be understood by those ordinarily skilled in the art having regard to the description herein.","Provided the substrate , conductive layers , , dielectric , and any laminates  are sufficiently flexible and thin, then the cable  may be used to carry RF signals in slider phones and other applications in which the cable  needs to flex, bend or curve.","Yet a further embodiment is illustrated in .  shows a cross-sectional view of another example RF-capable flex cable . This example RF-capable flex cable  includes a thin stripline  within the dielectric layer  (shown as , ). The stripline  is created by constructing the dielectric layer  in two parts: first, using a thin bottom dielectric layer the strip line  is deposited atop the bottom dielectric layer . Then a top dielectric layer is applied to cover the stripline .","The stripline  plays a role somewhat similar to the center conductor of a coaxial cable. It serves to transport RF signals within the range of 1 MHz to 3 GHz.","Reference is now made to  which illustrate example embodiments of an assembly  of layered materials for forming a flex cable in accordance with the present application. Beginning with , the assembly  in this embodiment includes a base laminate . The base laminate is a dielectric layer  with an upper metal layer  and a lower metal layer  deposited on either side. The dielectric layer  may be manufactured from any suitable dielectric material having appropriate electromagnetic and material strength properties. In one embodiment, the dielectric layer  is formed using polyimide. The upper and lower metal layers ,  are then deposited upon the dielectric layer . The base laminate  may be obtained as a single product layer from a suitable manufacturer. For example, the base laminate  may be formed using Dupont\u2122 product no. AK-125012EM.","An upper coverlay  and a lower coverlay  are then applied to the upper and lower surfaces of the base laminate . The upper coverlay  includes an adhesive layer  and a protective upper dielectric layer . Similarly, the lower coverlay  includes an adhesive layer  and a protective lower dielectric layer . The dielectric layers ,  may be polyimide in some example embodiments. For example, the upper and lower coverlays ,  may be formed using Arisawa\u2122 product no. CJA0525KA.","Referring now to , it will be noted that the assembly  in this embodiment excludes the lower coverlay . Instead, in its place is a lower shielding film  applied to the outer surface of the lower metal layer . The lower shielding film  may include internal layers including adhesion layer(s), an anisotropic conductive adhesion layer, a metallic layer, insulation layer(s), etc. An example lower shielding film  is SF-PC5500 manufactured and sold by Tatsuta System Electronics Co., Ltd. The lower shielding film  may assist in preventing electromagnetic interference.","In another embodiment, illustrated in , an upper shielding film  may be applied atop the upper coverlay . The upper shielding film  may be designed to prevent electromagnetic interference.","In yet another embodiment, illustrated in , the assembly  may exclude the lower coverlay  but may include both the upper shielding film  and lower shielding film .","Other variations and modifications in the layers included in the assembly  will be appreciated by those ordinarily skilled in the art having regard to the description herein.","It will also be appreciated that the metal layers ,  may be solid metal layers. Alternatively, either or both of the metal layers ,  may be etched with a pattern. The etching of the metal layers ,  may introduce a patterned removal of the metal intended to increase the flexibility of the layers ,  without compromising their ability to act as an effective metal surface for containing wave propagation within the dielectric layer . In one example, the metal layers ,  may be etched to create a cross-hatch pattern, with small diamonds or squares etched out of the metal. Other etching patterns may be used.","It will also be appreciated that the assembly  is used to form the flex cable  of  by forming vias joining the upper and lower metal layers , . In some instances, the vias may be formed in the base laminate  before application of the other layers of the assembly . In other instances the vias may be formed after the assembly  has be fully assembled.","Referring again to , in one example implementation the bottom dielectric layer may be a polyimide and the stripline  may be constructed with copper. In one example, the bottom dielectric layer and stripline  may be obtained as a single product layer from a suitable manufacturer such as Dupont\u2122 product no. AP 7163E. Other suitable construction materials and processes will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the description herein.","Reference is now made to , which shows an example embodiment of a mobile communication device  which may incorporate multiple RF antennas, as described above. The mobile communication device  is a two-way communication device having voice and possibly data communication capabilities; for example, the capability to communicate with other computer systems, e.g., via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile communication device , in various embodiments the device may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system with a wireless modem.","The mobile communication device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the mobile communication device , and a wireless communication subsystem  for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network . The processor  interacts with the communication subsystem  which performs communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems. In some embodiments, the device  may include a touchscreen display  which includes a display (screen) , such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, with a touch-sensitive input surface or overlay  connected to an electronic controller . The touch-sensitive overlay  and the electronic controller  provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay  via the electronic controller . In other embodiments, the display  may not be a touchscreen display. Instead, the device  may simply include a non-touch display and one or more input mechanisms, such as, for example, a depressible scroll wheel.","The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, speaker , microphone , input mechanism , switch , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The communication subsystem  may include a receiver, a transmitter, and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements , local oscillators (LOs), and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP). The antenna  may be embedded or internal to the mobile communication device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which the mobile communication device  is intended to operate. As described above, the antenna  may include multiple RF antennas, at least one of which is located in a second portion of the device , such as a slider portion.","The mobile communication device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of a wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile communication device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after a network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver, which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP. In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP. These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna .","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  comprise operating system software  and software applications .","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","The software applications  may include a range of other applications, including, for example, a messaging application, a calendar application, and\/or a notepad application. In some embodiments, the software applications  include an email message application, a push content viewing application, a voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, a map application, and a media player application. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display device ) according to the application.","In some embodiments, the auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile communication device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the mobile communication device  such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some embodiments, the mobile communication device  also includes a removable memory card  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory card interface . Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile communication device  via the memory card , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the mobile communication device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The mobile communication device  stores data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory .

The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile communication device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","In some embodiments, the mobile communication device  is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth\u00ae (Bluetooth\u00ae is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile communication device  to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network  is automatically routed to the mobile communication device  using the USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network  is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth\u00ae connection to the host computer system for processing.","The mobile communication device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile communication device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile communication device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile communication device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile communication device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile communication device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem  other wireless communication interfaces. The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile communication device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile communication device .","The wireless network  may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments, the mobile communication device  is configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN, and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments, the wireless network  may comprise multiple WWANs and WLANs. In some embodiments, the mobile device  includes the communication subsystem  for WWAN communications and a separate communication subsystem for WLAN communications. In most embodiments, communications with the WLAN employ a different antenna than communications with the WWAN. Accordingly, the antenna  may be configured for WWAN communications or WLAN communications depending on the embodiment and desired application.","In some embodiments, the WWAN conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types: Mobitex Radio Network, DataTAC, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network), EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized) CDMA2000, EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems), HSPDA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX), or various other networks. Although WWAN is described as a \u201cWide-Area\u201d network, that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.","The WLAN comprises a wireless network which, in some embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11 g standard.
