A message is transmitted from the second user to the first user via the external chat service.","In various embodiments, determining that the first description matches the second description may comprise determining that a first word in the first description is the same as a second word in the second description. For example, the first description may be \u201csailing vessel\u201d and the second description may be \u201cwater vessel\u201d. Accordingly, the two descriptions may be deemed a match because of the common word \u201cvessel\u201d.","In various embodiments, determining that the first description matches the second description may comprise: determining a first geographic region based on the first description; determining a second geographic region based on the second description; and determining that the first geographic region is proximate to the second geographic region. Geographic regions may be determined from a description in various ways, including determining latitude and longitude coordinates, determining a city, determining GPS coordinates, determining a zip code, determining a state, determining a street address, determining a street intersection, determining a highway exit, determining a landmark, determining a subset of a large region (e.g., \u201cSouthern New Jersey\u201d is a subset of \u201cNew Jersey\u201d), and in various other ways, as will be appreciated. In various embodiments, a first geographic region may be deemed proximate to a second geographic region if the two regions are the same, if the two regions are within a predetermined distance of one another (e.g., if the two regions are within 10 miles of one another), if the two regions are on the same landmass (e.g., on the same island; e.g., on the same continent), if the two regions are accessible to one another (e.g., accessible by foot; e.g., accessible by car; e.g., accessible by bus), if the two regions are within the same city, if the two regions are within the same country, or if the two regions together satisfy one or more other criteria.","In various embodiments, a first alias is received from the first user, the first alias serving to identify the first user on the external chat service. It may then be determined whether the first user is logged onto the external chat service by checking the status of the first alias with the external chat service. For example, the first alias may be \u201cjoe1999\u201d. It may be determined whether the first user is logged on by checking the status of \u201cjoe1999\u201d with the external chat service (e.g., via an API).","In various embodiments, even if a first user has a first alias on an external chat service, the first user may designate a second alias on an internal chat service or other communication system. For example, even if the first user is known as \u201cjoe1999\u201d on an external chat service, the user may provide an alias \u201csam555\u201d on an internal chat service. In this way, a second user may have the option of communicating with the first user internally, but may be unable to identify the first user outside of the system. E.g., the second user may know the alias \u201csam555\u201d, but may remain ignorant of the alias \u201cjoe1999\u201d. In this way, the privacy and\/or anonymity of the first user may be maintained.","In various embodiments, a first and second user may communicate via a combination of external and internal chat services. For example, a second user may use an internal chat service to send a message to a first user who is logged onto an external chat service. The system, according to some embodiments, may then relay the message to the external chat service, so that it reaches the first user. The message may be relayed using an API to the external chat service, for example.","In various embodiments, a user who posts an \u2018I want\u2019 or \u2018I have\u2019 message may receive multiple matches. The matches may then be presented to the user in a particular order (e.g., in an order defined by a top-to-bottom arrangement, a left-to-right arrangement, or any other arrangement). In some embodiments, the matches may be ordered according to one or more criteria. In some embodiments for two or more matches, a geographic distance is determined between locations indicated in the matched descriptions. For example, if message  is matched with message , and message  describes location A, and message  describes location B, then a distance may be determined between location A and location B. With distances among matched descriptions determined, the matches may be sorted according to distance. In some embodiments, matches that correspond to shorter distances may be displayed before (e.g., above; e.g., to the left of) matches corresponding to longer distances.","In some embodiments, a user may provide a description that receives multiple matched descriptions. Two matched descriptions may match on different keywords, however. For example a user may enter \u201cTennis racket Brooklyn\u201d. The user may receive two matches, with the following descriptions: \u201ctennis racket\u201d and \u201cBrooklyn racket\u201d. In some embodiments, multiple matched descriptions may be presented to a user in a certain order based on which key words have matched. In determining the order of matches presented, certain key words or categories of key words may be given more weight or higher priority than others. For example, key words that indicate or correspond to geography may be given higher priority than other key words. Thus, \u201cBrooklyn racket\u201d may be given the higher priority among the two matches described above, since the matched word of \u201cBrooklyn\u201d has a geographic connotation, whereas the matched word of \u201ctennis\u201d does not. Note that both of the above descriptions have matched on the word \u201cracket\u201d, so this word may not favor either match in terms of priority.","Categories of key words may include words that pertain to geography, words that pertain to product age, words that pertain to product quality, words that pertain to product price, and other categories.","For example, in some embodiments, matches based on key words relating to geography may be given priority over matches relating to words based on product age.","It will be appreciated that, in some embodiments, matches need not only be made based on key words, and that other factors leading to matches may be used in determining the order of matches. For example, pairs of matched descriptions may be ordered based on the degree of similarity in price between each of the two matched descriptions.","In various embodiments, various rules may be used for alerting a user to a match. Rules may specify how frequently a user is to be alerted about new matches, at what address a user is to be alerted (e.g., which of multiple addresses a user has provided is to be used to alert the user), which mode of communication is to be used to alert a user (e.g., email versus short messaging service), for which types of matches a user is to be alerted (e.g., a user is to be alerted for matches on all key words, but not for matches on only one key word), and any other criteria.","A rule may specify a frequency with which a user is to be alerted about new matches. For example, a rule may specify that a user is to be alerted immediately about a new match, that a user is to be alerted once a day about all his new matches, that a user is to be alerted once a week about all his new matches, or any other frequency. In some embodiments, a user may be alerted with different frequencies on different modes of communication. For example, a user may be alerted after every match on his cell phone, but only once per day at his email address.","In some embodiments, an alert may alternately be sent to one of two different addresses, depending on the type or nature of a match. For example, a user may be sent an alert for a match on his cell phone (e.g., via SMS) if there is a match on price, but an alert at his email address if there is a match on geography. For instance, a user may consider certain types of matches more urgent than others, and may therefore wish to be alerted e.g., on a cell phone for more urgent matches, and on email for less urgent matches.","In some embodiments, a first user may receive a match substantially immediately (e.g., within a very short period; e.g., within a few seconds) after entering a first description. For example, the first description entered by the first user may match a second description previously entered by a second user. In some embodiments, the first user may later receive another match on the first description. The new match may be with a third description that was entered by a third user after the first user had entered the first description. Thus, the first user may receive a second match significantly after having received the first match (e.g., an hour later; e.g., a day later; e.g., a week later). Thus, in various embodiments, matches may be sought for a given description long after the description has been entered.","In various embodiments, a user posting an \u2018I have\u2019 message may enter a network address indicating a location where more information can be found about the product being described. The network address may be a uniform resource locater (URL), for example.","In various embodiments, communication among users employing different modes of communication may be facilitated. For example, through the system, a user on a chat client (internal or external) may communicate with a user employing a cellular phone (e.g., using SMS). In various embodiments, the system may receive a first message from a first user via an Internet chat client and transmit the first message to a cellular phone belonging to a second user via Short Messaging Service. The system may also perform the reverse process. Namely, the system may receive an SMS message and transmit the message to the Internet chat client.","In various embodiments, a first user who has posted an \u2018I have\u2019 message can view the search criterion used to find the product he has posted. Thus, in some embodiments, if a second user has entered search criterion (e.g., has entered key words) that have matched the product posted by the first user, then the first user will have the opportunity to view the search criterion (e.g., the keywords) entered by the second user. In some embodiments, the first user may further view other information about the second user, such as an identifier or alias of the second user.","In some embodiments, a search criterion entered by the second user may include an indication of a geographic region.","It will be understood that while various embodiments have been illustrated and discussed, these are not to be construed as limiting. Various alterations may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the various contemplated embodiments. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS","Various Embodiments"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 5G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 5H"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5I"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5J"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
