{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","This disclosure relates to hand grenades. More particularly, this disclosure relates to primers used in hand grenade fuzes.","Hand grenades are small explosive, incendiary, or smoke producing devices thrown by military or law enforcement personnel in the course of military or law enforcement operations. Hand grenades typically have a body that contains an explosive or chemical filler and a fuze that ignites or detonates the filler in the grenade. The fuze contains a powder train that provides a time delay between the arming of the grenade by a soldier or policeman and the actual detonation of the grenade. The fuze is lit by the action of a spring loaded striker mechanism impacting a primer which ignites a delay element that burns for a predetermined time and then detonates the filler. The grenade is prevented from being armed by a safety handle that blocks the striker mechanism from impacting the primer from a primer. A safety pin locks the safety handle to prevent the arming of the grenade. When the safety pin is withdrawn, the safety lever is free to release from the body of the grenade. When the safety lever is released, the striker spring unwinds and the striker rotates on axis to impact the primer, which then creates a flash of heat that ignites one end of the delay element. The delay element burns down to an igniter at the other end of delay element, which then sets off the main charge or filler of the grenade.","The M201A1 hand grenade fuze had been in use since World War II, mainly in smoke grenades and the like. Variations of the M201A1 fuze are also used in smoke pots, less than lethal grenades and some lethal grenades. The M201A1 fuze is a pyrotechnic delay igniting fuze. The fuze is equipped with a steel safety pin and pull ring. To arm the grenade, the safety pin is removed while holding the lever tight to the grenade body. When the lever is released, a spring-loaded striker rotates and impacts a primer. The impact with the primer ignites a delay element, which initiates the igniter. The igniter then activates a smoke mix in the grenade achieving the desired signal and\/or screening effect.","In the recent past, various different configurations of this fuze have been developed. It would be desirable, however, to standardize the parts used in as many grenades as possible, and the U.S. Army has recently started a program to standardize grenade fuzes as much as possible. One of the components that is desirable to standardize is the primer. The M201A1 normally uses an M39A1 primer which in the last several years has caused some failures during production. It would be desirable to replace the unreliable M39A1 primer with the M42 primer which is currently being used on the M228 and M213 fuzes. This primer is less expensive than the M39A1, and the M42 primer has a better history of reliability based on production testing. The M42 primer, however, does not fit the M201A1 fuze. To use the M42 primer in the M201A1 fuze, an adapter disclosed herein was designed to hold the primer securely in the M201A1 fuze by making its diameter fit the size of the M201A1 cartridge. The primer adapter allows the use of the M42 primer with no changes to the current hardware configuration of the M201A1 fuze. It also gives the M201A1 increased reliability compared to the current configuration with the M39A1 primer. The primer adapter also supports commonality among the active hand grenade fuzes such as the M201A1, M213, and M228, by allowing all active hand grenade fuzes to use the same primer for the ignition of their explosive trains.","The following merely illustrates the principles of the disclosure. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which, although not explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles of the disclosure and are included within its spirit and scope.","Furthermore, all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the disclosure and the concepts contributed by the inventor(s) to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.","Moreover, all statements herein reciting principles, aspects, and embodiments of the disclosure, as well as specific examples thereof, are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally, it is intended that such equivalents include both currently-known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future, i.e., any elements developed that perform the same function, regardless of structure.","Thus, for example, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the diagrams herein represent conceptual views of illustrative structures embodying the principles of the disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIGS. 1","i":["a ","b "],"b":["1","10","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIGS. 2","FIGS. 2","FIGS. 3","FIGS. 3","FIGS. 4"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b","a ","b ","a ","b ","a ","b "],"b":["2","2","22","201","3","3","24","4","26"]},"The grenade  shown in and comprises a cylindrical body  made of sheet steel and containing a chemical filler material  that produces colored smoke when it is ignited by the operation of an M201A1 igniting fuze  screwed into an opening in the top of the grenade body . The fuze  ignites a chemical starter material  that fills the top of the grenade body , which in turn ignites the filler material  in the main compartment of the body . Ignition of the filler material  produces an expanding cloud of colored smoke which is expelled from the grenade  through a normally taped opening  in the bottom of the body , and shown most clearly in ","Igniting fuzes like the M201A1 fuze  in and are pyrotechnic delay-igniting fuzes designed for use with a variety of chemical hand grenades. They burn at high temperatures to ignite a chemical filler in the grenade. In addition to the M18 smoke grenades, the M201A1 fuze  is also designed for use with the AN-M83HC white smoke grenade and the AN-M14 TH3 incendiary grenade.","The fuze  provides a time delay between the actuation of the grenade and the ignition of the filler material . In one illustrative embodiment, the time delay element is a powder train requiring 1.2 to 2 seconds to burn to the starting mixture. In all cases, the starting mixture ignites the explosive or pyrotechnic and expels the desired output from the grenade body.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIGS. 2","FIG. 1","FIGS. 2","FIGS. 3","FIG. 2","FIGS. 4"],"i":["a ","b ","a","a ","b ","a ","b ","b ","a ","b"],"b":["2","16","16","2","22","3","24","16","16","26","28","16","26","4","26","205","201","211","26","26","26","209","24","24","24","26","207","209","24"]},"The grenade , in the example of the invention depicted in and , is a burning-type smoke grenade fitted with an M201A1 igniting fuze  which functions with a 1.2 to 2-second delay. Functioning of the fuze  ignites a starting mixture , which ignites the filler .","The burning of the filler  creates sufficient pressure to blow out a tape  that normally covers one or more emission holes or gas ports  in the body of the grenade. Blow out of the tape  over the emission hole  allows a chemical agent, such as riot control gas or smoke, produced by the combustion of the filler material  in the grenade, to escape from the body  of the grenade  through the emission hole .","The fuze  in the grenade  includes a pull ring and safety pin  inserted through a hole . The safety pin  in the hole  holds a safety lever  against the side of the grenade body . The safety lever  in position against the body  of the grenade  holds a striker  away from a primer  against the force of a striker spring  that urges the striker  towards the primer .","Removal of the safety pin  permits release of the safety lever , which then has to be held against the body  of the grenade  to prevent detonation. Once the grenade  is thrown, the pressure on the safety lever  is released, and the striker  is forced to rotate on its axis by the striker spring , throwing off the safety lever . The striker  then impacts the primer  with a force that detonates the primer , which then explodes and ignites one end of a delay element . The delay element  burns for the prescribed amount of time and then activates the starter mixture . The activation of the starter mixture  acts to either explode or burn the filler substance .","At this point, while we have discussed and described the invention using some specific examples, those skilled in the art will recognize that our teachings are not so limited. For example, the fuze adapters may be used with pyrotechnic and\/or explosive devices which are modified variants of those explicitly disclosed herein. Accordingly, the invention should be only limited by the scope of the claims attached hereto."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":["b ","a.
