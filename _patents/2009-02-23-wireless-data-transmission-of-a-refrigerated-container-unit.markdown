title: Wireless data transmission of a refrigerated container unit
abstract: A system and method for monitoring data associated with a temperature controlled container with a Reefer Unit. The monitored data retrieved from the Reefer Unit is wirelessly transmitted to an evaluation unit via at least one transponder. The transponder is connected via a wireless interface of an antenna with a reader/transmitter. The wireless interface transmits the monitored data via a bus from the reader/transmitter to a converter which then transmits the converted monitored data via a communication interface to the evaluation unit. Aside from retrieving monitored data remotely, the system can also issue remote forward commands to provide full automation and control of such containers.

Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to temperature controlled containers, and in particular, to two way wireless monitoring and controlling of Reefer Units associated with temperature controlled containers.","2. Description of Related Art","Temperature controlled containers are used to ship or transport assets requiring temperature controlled environments such as, but not limited to, perishable food. Such temperature controlled containers are typically mobile, for example, being transported via road, railroad or water.","Due to the need for accurate control of the temperature sensitive environment any change in temperature, regardless how small, may have a deleterious effect on the state of the cargo or assets contained therein. It is therefore desirable to develop a system for receiving time sensitive information transmitted wirelessly to software analysis programming that generates displays and reports. In addition to receiving such information from the containers it is desirable to develop a system for issuing remote forward commands to provide full automation and control of such containers. Such an improved system and method would provide efficient detection and troubleshooting of problems.","The present invention concerns a \u201cReefer Tag\u201d, which will connect to temperature controlled containers via a serial device such as an RS232 interface. Periodically and\/or on command from an RFID Reader\/Transmitter, the Reefer Tag establishes communications with a Reefer Unit and retrieves reefer or container information about a corresponding temperature controlled container. Each Reefer Unit has an associated controller or microprocessor (, , ). Accordingly, the Reefer Tag and controller or microprocessor of the associated Reefer Unit communicates with one another. The Reefer Tag is preferably compatible with multiple protocols and different baud rates that are used with existing and\/or future controllers or microprocessors of the Reefer Units. In such a situation, the Reefer Tag preferably automatically detects the proper baud rate from a group of predetermined speeds, for example, a group of baud rates including approximately 1200 Baud, 2400 Baud, 4800 Baud, 9600 Baud, or 19.2 kilo Baud or higher.","One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a system for monitoring data associated with a temperature controlled container with a Reefer Unit. The monitored data retrieved from the Reefer Unit is wirelessly transmitted to an evaluation unit via at least one transponder. The transponder is connected via a wireless interface of an antenna with a reader\/transmitter. The wireless interface transmits the monitored data via a bus from the reader\/transmitter to a converter which then transmits the converted monitored data via a communication interface to the evaluation unit. Aside from retrieving monitored data remotely, the system can also issue remote forward commands to provide full automation and control of such containers.","Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method for evaluating information associated with and control of at least one Reefer Unit for at least one temperature controlled container. Data associated with at least one temperature controlled container with the at least one Reefer Unit is retrieved and transmitted wirelessly from at least one transponder to at least one reader\/transmitter. The received data is transmitted to a host computer via the at least one reader\/transmitter. Host software is used to evaluate the data received by the host computer and display the evaluated data.","The invention further relates to the generation by the host software at the host computer of at least one of a command, control and programming signal which is transmitted from the host computer to the at least one reader\/transmitter. This at least one command, control and programming signal is passed from the at least one reader\/transmitter to the at least one Reefer Unit, with or without the at least one transponder interpreting the data. The at least one transponder will preferably receive the response from the at least one Reefer Unit to this at least one command, control and programming signal and transmit it to the host computer using the at least one reader\/transmitter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","2","3","1","2","3","1","2","3","4","5","6","4","5","6","1","0","7","8","9","10","11","12","10","11","12","4","5","6","7","8","9","23","10","11","12","4","5","6","10","11","12","10","11","12"],"i":["a","a","a","a","a","a","b","b","b","c","c","c"]},"Each Reefer Tag is programmed to: (i) identify and communicate with the Reefer Unit; (ii) detect if a Reefer Unit or other serial device is connected to the Reefer Tag and, if so, determine whether the Reefer Unit or other serial device is powered ON; (iii) monitor information associated with the Reefer Unit without requiring continuous communication between the Reefer Unit and Host Computer (such monitoring is flexibly configured by the Host Computer (e.g., set monitoring interval and\/or specify data to be monitored); (iv) establish bidirectional communication between the Reefer Unit and Host Computer. Since the Reefer Tag is self-powered, even if the Reefer Unit is powered OFF and communication is disabled, the Reefer Tag is still able to detect whether a Reefer Unit is connected to the Reefer Tag and, if so, its power status. In addition, any previously reported information prior to powering OFF of the Reefer Unit will be able to be obtained by the Reefer Tag.","Reefer Tags , ,  send data to and receive data from a corresponding RFID antenna  via bidirectional wireless interfaces , , . Each antenna  is electrically connected with a corresponding RFID reader\/transmitter , ,  such as an i-Port M350. A Compact flash reader\/transmitter may be used in integration with a handheld RFID reader\/transmitter. The Reefer Tag and the corresponding antenna are preferably separated by up to approximately 500 m. The number of RFID readers\/transmitters used per site will depend on the site size and configuration of the RFID readers\/transmitters. In the example provided in , three RFID readers\/transmitters , ,  are daisy chained via bus  and connected to the host computer or server  via a single converter  (e.g., RS422 converter) and interface  (e.g., Ethernet, LAN, WLAN, USB, or wireless interface). Although only a single converter  is shown more than one may be provided, one per each reader\/transmitter. Evaluation host software such as a web based software application in a computer readable medium and stored in a memory device associated with the host computer or server  collects, analyzes, disseminates & displays (e.g., in the form of graphs and\/or reports) the received reefer information. The final data may be pushed through to be accessible by user interfaces.","Associated application programming interface (API)  is provided for the host software  stored in an internal memory and run on a processor associated with the host computer . The host software  uses the API  to access all functionalities of the system thereby simplifying implementation of the host software. Those API provide a high level of interface and abstraction for all available features. For example, the host software automatically receives an event if something has changed, while a command sent to a Reefer Unit even if composed of multiple data exchange between Reefer Tag and RFID transmitter\/reader will be a simple command for the host software.","In a preferred embodiment, the API implements all functionalities including, but not limited to:\n\n","The reefer or container information may include, for example, set temperature, detected temperature, alarm conditions, door status, asset location, gate movements, preventative maintenance, and fuel levels. In addition, the host software may be used to wirelessly transmit forward command, programming or control signals back to the Reefer Unit to adjust one or more physical parameters based on the received reefer information thereby providing full automation and control. Some functions that may be controlled by the host computer  include, but are not limited to: (i) alarm clearing; (ii) pre-trip start\/stop, and (iii) set point changes to a physical parameter. Such adjustment may be controlled either automatically based on preset physical condition threshold parameters, or alternatively may be controlled based on operator or user input. Thus, the RFID reader\/transmitter , ,  receives broadcast messages from Reefer Tags , , , and process command, control and\/or programming signals generated by the host software using the API and circuitry associated with the host computer . The daisy chain of RFID readers\/transmitters can be connected via cables (e.g., CAT 5 cable) with the power to the RFID readers\/transmitters transmitted over the communication cable. Some limitations apply based on the cable length, number of readers\/transmitters per bus and power supply used to power the RFID readers\/transmitters.","Each Reefer Tag , ,  preferably has an associated audible and\/or visual display (e.g., one or more LEDs) for identifying the status of one or more functions of the Reefer Tag. For example, such function is not limited to but may include: (i) battery life status; (ii) power status (e.g., ON\/OFF) of the Reefer Tag, and (iii) whether the Reefer Tag is physically connected to a serial port and communication has been established with a Reefer Unit. The status of one or more Reefer Tag functions is preferably checked either periodically or continuously while the Reefer Tag is connected to a Reefer Unit , , . In addition, the status of one or more Reefer Tag functions may also be checked upon receiving a request from an operator such as by pushing a button associated with the Reefer Tag.","By way of illustrative example, each Reefer Tag , ,  may have three LEDs that will blink for a predetermined period of time, e.g., approximately 5 seconds. The three exemplary LEDs are programmed as follows:\n\n","This example is not intended to limit in scope any other visual indication configuration or design of the status of the functionality of the Reefer Tag.","Reefer Tag , ,  broadcasts to the host computer  on a predetermined configurable interval (e.g., approximately every 20 to 60 seconds) a message including, but not restricted to:\n\n","Each Reefer Tag , ,  is programmed to operate in one of five modes including: (i) standby mode; (ii) standard mode; (iii) monitoring mode; (iv) connecting mode, and (v) transparent or pass-through mode.  is an exemplary flow diagram representing the transition conditions between Reefer Tag modes.","In the standby mode , Reefer Tag , ,  is not connected to a corresponding Reefer Unit , , . When entering the standby mode represented by block  the Reefer Tag , ,  clears from memory all information regarding the Reefer Unit , ,  to which it was previously connected. Reefer Tag , ,  remains in standby mode  as long as it does not detect any serial device (e.g., RS232) connection to the serial port depicted by step . A connection of a serial device to the serial port is determined by checking the Reefer Tag RX pin and\/or power pin state. If The RX pin is active, then a device is connected and powered ON. But if RX pin is not active then the state of the power pin is checked. If the power pin state is active this means a device is connected but not powered, and if the power pin state is not active this indicates that no device is connected.","As soon as connection of a serial device has been detected, at step , Reefer Tag , ,  is placed in connecting mode in step . The connecting mode is only a transition state while an operator physically connects the Reefer Tag , ,  to the corresponding Reefer Unit , , . If the connection to the serial device is lost while in connecting mode, at step , the Reefer Tag , ,  is again disconnected and returns to standby mode in block . Otherwise, while in the connecting mode depicted by block  with the serial device connection in place the Reefer Tag , ,  attempts to establish communication and retrieve container or reefer information, at step . Specifically, the Reefer Tag , ,  sends a signal identifying the type of Reefer Unit controller\/microprocessor (e.g., Carrier\u2122, Thermo King\u2122) and its unique serial number at the proper baud rate for that particular controller\/microprocessor. In a preferred embodiment, the Reefer Tag is preferably compatible with multiple types of controllers\/microprocessors having different protocols and baud rates. In such a situation, the Reefer Tag preferably automatically detects the proper baud rate, typically, from among approximately 1200 Baud, 2400 Baud, 4800 Baud, 9600 Baud, 19.2 kilo Baud, for the particular type of Reefer Unit controller\/microprocessor. Specifically, a unique serial number and associated information of the Reefer Unit controller is stored in memory at the time of manufacture. This information is retrieved by the Reefer Tag using the controller specific command. To retrieve the correct controller type\/baud rate the Reefer Tag attempts to communicate with the controller using all known type\/baud rate configurations. Once communication is successful and the baud rate has been found, the Reefer Tag retrieves the unique serial number and information using the command or set of commands specific to the controller type connected to the Reefer Tag.","The Reefer Tag , ,  attempts all supported baud rates for a particular type of controller\/microprocessor and if communication fails it will again try all supported controller type\/baud rates, reattempting preferably approximately every 5 minutes. The reefer or container information once it has been successfully read, at step , is stored in an internal or associated memory and the Reefer Tag , ,  is placed into standard mode, at step . While in the standard mode (block ), the Reefer Tag , ,  is connected to and retrieves from the Reefer Unit , ,  information regarding its type of controller\/microprocessor and unique serial number.","To transition into the monitoring mode represented by block , the host software configures the Reefer Tag to monitor the Reefer Unit. Monitoring includes reading on a predetermined configurable time interval one or more specific tables and blocks from the memory associated with the Reefer Unit. Some Reefer Units may not have their memory configured as tables and blocks so monitoring may be done by other mechanism. The beacon message is configured so that one or more specified monitored bytes based on its position is transmitted in the message. In a preferred embodiment, a maximum of 32 bytes may be monitored. Successfully monitored data is always included in the beacon message, the monitoring mode only updates the monitored data with new data read from the Reefer Unit in order to be later broadcasted.","An illustrated example of bytes to be monitored is provided in the Table below. For the purpose of the example illustrated below, the monitoring interval is set to 15 minutes, however, as previously noted the monitoring interval is freely configurable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Table","Block","Starting Byte","# of",{}]},{"entry":["#","#","Position","Bytes","Comment"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["15","1","0","2","The Reefer Tag reads table 15"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"block 1 of the Reefer Unit controller"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"memory and adds to the broadcast"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"monitoring message 2 bytes"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"starting from position 0"]},{"entry":["15","1","10","5","Identical to that in the first row but"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"adds to the broadcast monitoring"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"message 5 bytes starting from"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"position 10"]},{"entry":["11","2","5","1","The Reefer Tag reads table 11"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"block 2 of the Reefer Unit controller"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"memory and adds to the broadcast"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"monitoring message 1 byte starting"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"from position 5"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The beacon message reported to the host computer  is composed of 8 bytes including:\n\n","If the Reefer Tag cannot read all the data specified to be monitored only that data successfully read will be returned. If the connection to the serial device, which is checked continuously or periodically, for example at step , is lost the Reefer Tag will disconnect at step  and return to standby mode . While monitoring the Reefer Unit, additional errors can be reported, for example, if a requested byte position is out of range. While in monitoring mode, if the Reefer Tag detects a disconnected RS232 interface (by checking the connection at the RX and power pin of the Reefer Tag) (step ), it will disconnect, at step , and return to standby mode . Furthermore, if there is a communication failure with the Reefer Unit while in monitoring mode the Reefer Tag will revert back to standard mode .","When a Reefer Tag detects a disconnected serial port, it will clear all internal information regarding the Reefer Unit it was connected to and return to standby mode .","In addition to receiving container information from the Reefer Unit the host computer or server  is programmed to transmit back to the Reefer Unit command, control and\/or programming signals during a transparent or pass-through mode (block ). The transition from transparent mode to standard mode occurs at the end of execution of a transparent command. The end is either when the Reefer Tag has sent the transparent command it received from the host to the controller or when a response to the transparent command has been received by the Reefer Tag from the controller or when a timeout occurs.","In this transparent or pass-through mode the command, control and\/or programming signal generated by the host software of the host computer  is transmitted to the Reefer Unit, with or without the Reefer Tag interpreting the data. While in the transparent or pass-through mode the Reefer Tag will preferably only retransmit messages received with a destination address other than the Reefer Tag without interpreting the data. This does not preclude some type of protocol translation, for example, adding a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) or other error detection scheme if the translation is common to all types of Reefer Units. The transparent or pass-through mode thereby allows the host computer  to issue any specific command, control and\/or programming signal back to the Reefer Unit. Preferably, only a single command, control and\/or programming signal such as to read or write a single table block is issued via this transparent mode, not a time sequenced or complex command representing a succession of commands with a time restriction between commands. The reason for preferably restricting command, control and\/or programming signals to a single command is because a predetermined maximum time restriction is set between 2 consecutive commands that may not be adhered to if the time between 2 consecutive commands is too short (which is usually the case with complex commands). Accordingly, single rather than complex commands are preferred.","Regardless of the mode, the preferred maximum message length of all communications is 255 Byte+Header.","An illustrative example of the system component specifications is provided.

The Application Programming Interface will provide a method to be called by the host software at a predetermined interval of preferably approximately 2 seconds. This call will poll all RFID readers\/transmitters for all Reefer Tag broadcast events received and process all events to report such events back to the host software. This tag event collection method is preferably not called simultaneously with any other commands. In addition to collecting tag events, upon reception of events the application programming interface will define if the status of the Reefer Tag has changed and report any changes to the host computer.","On the one hand, in the event that the Reefer Tag is connected to a Reefer Unit, the reefer\/container information will be read and reported to the host software. The Reefer Tag will broadcast on a predefined interval this information but the event will only be reported once to the host software. On the other hand, in the event that the Reefer Tag is disconnected to a Reefer Unit, the Reefer Tag reports such disconnected status to the host software.

A brief explanation of the RFID reader discovery process is provided. A reader has at least 2 connections, e.g., a master bus and a slave bus. Communication is received on the master bus and can be forwarded to the slave bus. The slave bus can be connected or disconnected by sending a configuration command. When the slave port is disconnected, data received on the master bus will not be forwarded to the slave bus. A device is given a configurable address, a special address is reserved for the device with the slave port disconnected. When using the special address for the device with disconnected slave port, no device or only 1 device will respond to the communication. Another special address is reserved for broadcasting so all readers will process the command but they will not acknowledge it. By default when a device starts it connects the slave port. The discovery process consists of:\n\n","A configured bus is defined as a communication interface configured by the host software.
