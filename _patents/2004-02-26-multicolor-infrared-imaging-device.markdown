title: Multi-color infrared imaging device
abstract: A multi-color IR imaging device includes optics that direct mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) radiation onto a focal plane array having LWIR and MWIR detection layers. Pixel groups that include at least one first pixel and one second pixel are defined on the focal plane array, and a first filter and a second filter which form part of an inhomogeneous filter is placed over the respective first and second pixels in a checkerboard pattern, in close proximity to the detection layers. This allows MWIR radiation in M band, and LWIR radiation in an Lband to pass therethrough and illuminate the first pixels, and M, L, and a separate LWIR band designated Lto pass therethrough and illuminate the second pixels. To simultaneously image both MWIR and LWIR, the focal plane array is placed at a predetermined distance from the optics so that the MWIR spot size covers a single pixel and the LWIR spot size is about the same area as the area of a group of two first pixels and two second pixels. Since all pixels receive the M band, half of the pixels in the group receive the Lband, and the other half receives the Lband, three bands can be generated. This allows simultaneous imaging of MWIR and two sub-bands of the LWIR from the same point in space.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, sold, imported, and\/or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America.","The present invention applies generally to infrared (IR) imaging systems. More particularly, the present invention applies to an IR imaging system that provides for simultaneous collection of IR image data in two long-wave infrared (LWIR) bands and one mid-wave infrared (MWIR) band without significant loss of spatial resolution of the received image.","Infrared (IR) imaging sensors for displaying information are well known in the prior art. For some applications, IR sensors are used to distinguish an object from its background, and image data from several spectral bands is often useful for this application. The IR spectrum can be divided into mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) bands, and prior art IR imaging systems typically are capable of displaying IR radiation in only one spectral band at any given time. For some applications, it is desirable to be able to simultaneously observe IR data in two LWIR bands and one MWIR band with the same sensor.","One way to observe multiple bands with the same sensor is to use a filter wheel. For this structure, a filter having sequential frame filters is provided. As the wheel is rotated, the different filter frames pass over the substrate, and different bands of IR radiation pass through and illuminate the substrate. Sequential frames can therefore collect image data in different bands. The disadvantage of this method, however, is that the IR image cannot be collected simultaneously in more than one band. Because of this, if there is a large relative motion between the imaged IR object and the sensor platform, this method causes a \u201cblending\u201d or \u201cblurring\u201d of the different IR bands. Thus, this method of providing a multi-color IR display is not particularly useful if either the imaged object or platform sensor, or both, is in motion.","Another way to collect IR information in a multi-band format is to provide an IR focal plane array (FPA) having multiple detector layers with multiple outputs at each pixel that correspond to the desired bands. U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,603, which issued to Burnham Stokes for an invention entitled \u201cBias And Readout For Multicolor Quantum Well Detectors\u201d, discloses a device with this type of structure. For the invention as described by Stokes, three separate outputs are generated by assigning a detector layer to each desired band output and then electronically biasing each detector layer through a plurality of conductive layers that are interleaved among the three detector layers to be biased.","The result of the invention of Stokes, however, is an unnecessarily complex structure with three detection layers, each one optimized for a different band. Stated differently, and as mentioned above, the device recited by Stokes requires the deposition of extra detector and deposition layers and does not solve the ease of manufacturing question, in that it would also be very difficult and expensive to build. What is desired is an IR sensor that can simultaneously detect and display multiple \u201ccolors\u201d (two from the LWIR and one from the MWIR band) from the same point in space without the complexity of a three detection layer structure. A focal plane array with two detection layers is much easier to fabricate than one with three layers.","In light of the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide an IR imaging device that can collect multi-band images. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an IR imaging device that can simultaneously collect images in three distinct spectral bands. Another object of the present invention is to provide an IR imaging sensor that collects one band in the MWIR and two bands in the LWIR without loss of spatial resolution of the imaged object. It is another object of the present invention to use the diffraction effects of the LWIR in combination with two detection layers and an inhomogeneous (checker board or striped) filter to provide a three-color IR system. It is another object of the present invention to provide an IR imaging device that is relatively easy to manufacture in a cost-effective manner.","A multi-color infrared (IR) imaging device in accordance with the present invention includes a focal plane array with a mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and a long-wave infrared (LWIR) detection layer. The focal plane array includes plurality of pixels formed on the surface, and the device includes optics for receiving MWIR and LWIR radiation and directing the MWIR and LWIR radiation simultaneously in focus onto the focal plane array.","A special inhomogeneous filter is placed in close proximity to the detection layer over the focal plane array such that all pixels receive the MWIR radiation (M) but neighboring pixels receive different portions of the LWIR band (Lor L). The inhomogeneous filter can be in a checkerboard or striped pattern and, for practical reasons, Lmay be totally separate from Lor just be a wider band that includes L(in which case a differencing amplifier can be used to extract L\u2212Lfrom the electrical output from neighboring pixels).","To simultaneously image both MWIR and two bands in the LWIR, the focal plane array is placed at the focal point of the optics. The optics must be designed such that the focal length of the optics is the same for MWIR and LWIR radiation. Specifically, the predetermined distance is chosen such that the diffraction limited spot size for MWIR radiation matches the pixel size. Because of diffraction effects, even for well designed optics, the LWIR diffraction limited spot size will be larger and cover a group of 4 pixels while the MWIR spot size only covers one pixel.","Since each pixel receives the M band and two of the four pixels in the group receive the Lband, and two other pixels in the same group receive the Lband, three bands can be imaged simultaneously. The result is a device that collects IR images in two LWIR bands and one MWIR band from the same point in space and at the same time, without any sacrifice in spatial resolution of the MWIR image or the LWIR image.","Throughout this specification, the terms IR, MWIR, LWIR, as well as the M, Land Lare used. The term IR refers to infrared radiation, or that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum having a wavelength between 0.8 and 100 microns (\u03bb=0.8\u2013100 \u03bcm). The term MWIR refers to mid-wave infrared radiation, or that portion of the IR spectrum between three to seven micrometers (\u03bb=3\u20137 \u03bcm), and the M band refers to MWIR between three to five micrometers (\u03bb=3\u20135 \u03bcm). The term LWIR refers to long-wave infrared radiation LWIR radiation in the range of seven to ten microns (\u03bb=7\u201312 \u03bcm). Within the LWIR range, two bands are defined, the Lband (\u03bb=7\u20139 \u03bcm) and the Lband (\u03bb=9\u201310 \u03bcm). Within the respective MWIR and LWIR ranges, other M, Land Lbands can also be defined to practice the invention as hereinafter described.","Referring initially to the , the multi-color IR imaging device of the present invention is shown and is generally designated by reference character . The device  includes optics  for receiving IR radiation energy, designated by arrows . The optics receives the IR radiation and directs the energy onto an inhomogeneous filter  and then onto focal plane array  of detector elements, or pixels . The pixels create a very detailed map or \u201cpicture\u201d of the radiation received from the scene. The map created by the detector elements is translated into electric impulses by a read only integrated circuit board (ROIC) . ROIC  sends the information to a display , where it appears as an image of various shades of gray depending on the intensity of the received infrared radiation. The combination of all the impulses from all of the pixels creates the image.","As shown in , the pixels  in focal plane array  are arranged in a grid. The pixels can be grouped so that they define a plurality of pixel groups  (the pixel group is indicated by the pixels in  that have dashed lines), with each pixel group  further including at least a first pixel  and a second pixel .","The inhomogeneous filter  shown in  includes a first pixel filter  that will pass IR in the M and Lbands, and a second filter pixel  that will pass M, Land Lbands. The size and shape of both the first pixel filter  and second pixel filter  both correspond to the size and shape of the pixels in the FPA. With this structure, when the inhomogeneous filter is placed on top of focal plane array  in close proximity, there is alignment between both patterns of pixel filters and pixels.","In an alternative embodiment of the invention, and as shown in , inhomogeneous filter \u2032 can have a striped pattern comprising alternating first stripe filter \u2032 and second stripe filter \u2032. The stripes are chosen so that each strip corresponds to a row  of pixels  in focal plane array  when inhomogeneous filter \u2032 is placed in closed proximity to the focal plane array. With this configuration, alternate stripes pass M and L, and M, Land Lbands to the focal plane array.","Referring primarily now to , the structure of the first and second pixels in an exemplary pixel group is shown in greater detail. Specifically, each first pixel  and second pixel  in the group includes a mid-wave detection layer  and a long-wave detection layer . Preferably, the mid-wave detector layer can detect MWIR while long-wave detection layer  can detect LWIR in a manner known in the art. Within the pixel groups, each pixel is electronically connected and provides an output to the read only integrated circuit (ROIC) . Each pixel also includes a substrate stratum  upon which the mid-wave detection layer and the long wavelength detection layer are grown by epitaxial techniques. This substrate layer must be thinned to allow the first and second pixel filters ,  and the detection layers to be in close proximity.","In the preferred embodiment, the mid-wave detection layer and long-wave detection layer are manufactured from a Mercury\/Cadmium\/Telluride (MCT) material combination. It is to be appreciated, however, that other materials could be used, provided the layers detect IR radiation within the desired MWIR and LWIR ranges. The substrate stratum  is preferably made of a Cadmium\/Zinc\/Telluride (CZT) material combination, although an Aluminum\/Gallium\/Arsenic combination or silicon material could also be used. Additionally, and as shown in , the mid-wave detector layer  is located between the stratum  and the long-wave detection layer .","The aforementioned first pixel filter  is located right over the first pixel . The first filter allows passage of IR radiation up to nine microns (\u03bb=9 \u03bcm) to pass through and illuminate first pixel . Since the mid-wave detection layer  absorbs radiation out to 7 \u03bcm, the first pixel LWIR output is between seven and nine microns, \u03bb=7\u20139 \u03bcm. Thus, the mid-wave detector layer and first filter cooperate to provide a first pixel output in the Lband, as represented by line , to the ROIC .","The device of the present invention also includes the above described second pixel filter , which is positioned over second pixel . The second pixel filter allows passage of certain IR radiation therethrough, including IR radiation having a wavelength up to ten microns (\u03bb=10 \u03bcm). Stated differently, the second filter allows the Lband and the Lband to pass therethrough and illuminate second pixel . As LWIR radiation in the L+Lband passes therethrough, it is detected by the long-wave detection layer . The long-wave detector layer provides an intermediate output from the second pixel , designated by line , to ROIC . A differencing amplifier (not shown) in the ROIC electronically differences the L+Lintermediate output from the second pixel from the Loutput from the first pixel (in a manner known in the art) to yield a second LWIR output that is entirely within in the Lband (\u03bb=9\u201310 \u03bcm).","As described above, the differencing amplifier provides a second pixel output in the Lband by subtracting the first pixel output from the intermediate output (depicted by reference character  in ) of the second pixel, or by differencing output of adjacent pixels. It should be appreciated, however, that when the pixels in the substrate are considered together as a focal plane array (FPA), a single differencing amplifier could receive the total intermediate input of all the second pixels in the FPA and subtract the aggregate first input from the first pixels to yield a second pixel output with one differencing amplifier. In fact, this configuration would allow for electronic differencing as described above by a differencing amplifier which is separate from the focal plane array (FPA) that is defined by the pixels. This \u201coff-FPA\u201d differencing would obviate the complex timing and routing considerations that are inherent for a configuration wherein a differencing amplifier is provided for each pixel group.","By cross-reference of , , A and , it can be seen the first filter and second filter (along with the respective first and second pixels that they are positioned over) are arranged on focal plane array in a checkerboard pattern. Keeping this structure in mind, and referring now to , the positioning of the substrate relative to optics  is now described. Specifically, the focal plane array is spaced-apart from the optics by a predetermined distance \u201cd\u201d, that is chosen according to the focal length for MWIR radiation. The optics should be designed such that the size (area) of the MWIR spot  resulting from a point source in space matches the area of a pixel , either of first pixel  or second pixel  (first pixels  and second pixels  have the same dimensions and are of equal area). If the focal length for LWIR radiation is designed to be the same, the size of the resulting LWIR spot  will be larger and cover approximately four pixels for a diffractive limited system. If the area of the LWIR spot  is about the same as the area of a pixel group , then LWIR radiation can be detected and processed as described above. Moreover, two separate LWIR bands, the Land Lband, can be generated with the above-described structure.","With this structure a MWIR image and a LWIR Limage and a LWIR Limage can be simultaneously obtained with the maximum resolution permitted by the optics. The LWIR images will have lower resolution than the MWIR image, but that is inevitable due to diffraction effects.","While the multi-color IR imaging device of the present invention, as herein shown and disclosed in detail, is fully capable of obtaining the objects and providing the advantages above stated, it is to be understood that the presently preferred embodiments are merely illustrative of the invention. As such, no limitations are intended other than as defined in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The novel features of this invention will be best understood from the accompanying drawings, taken in conjunction with the accompanying description, in which similar characters refer to similar parts, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
