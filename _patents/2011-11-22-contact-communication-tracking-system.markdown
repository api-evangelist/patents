For example, the user may set user preferences pertaining to which type of communications communication gaps are calculated, for which contacts, etc.","According to an exemplary embodiment, contact manager  may permit the user to sort communication gaps based on duration (e.g., longest to shortest, shortest to longest, etc.). The user may sort communication gaps for a particular entity, selected entities, all entities (e.g., all contacts in the user's address book, etc.), based on different categories (e.g., family, friends, business, personal, etc.), based on time gaps (e.g., hours, days, months, etc.), and\/or based on communication types. In this way, the user may be motivated to initiate a communication with one or more contacts based on communication gap information displayed.","According to an exemplary embodiment, contact manager  automatically generates a communication to a particular entity. For example, contact manager  may generate the communication when a communication gap exists (e.g., a user-configured length of time lapses) with respect to a contact. As an example, a user (e.g., a college student) tends to forget to call or text his parents due to his busy schedule. The user may set a user preference, via communication tracking system portal , to automatically generate a text message (e.g., an e-mail message, an SMS message) to be sent to his parents after 2 weeks, if no communication between the user and his parents has occurred.","According to an exemplary embodiment, contact manager  permits a user to selectively pick which forms of communication should be tracked, which contacts would be subject to tracking, set time periods pertaining to communication gaps, set auto-communication preferences, and\/or manage other services provided by communication tracking system portal , as described herein. For example, the user may turn-on or turn-off, via communication tracking system portal , the tracking of communications relative to a particular contact, a group of contacts (e.g., friends, family, business, personal, etc.), etc.","According to an exemplary embodiment, contact manager  generates an alert to a user after a communication gap transpires. For example, if a user uses his\/her user device (e.g., a smartphone) to pay his\/her utility bill, when a communication gap goes beyond a particular time period (e.g., 25 days), contact manager  generates an alert to prompt the user to communicate with his\/her utility company and\/or pay a bill. According to an exemplary implementation, the user may set, via communication tracking system portal , to automatically pay his\/her bill.","According to an exemplary embodiment, contact manager  generates contact recommendations based on calculated communication gaps and\/or limit and usage information. As described further below, usage aggregator  analyzes a service limit (e.g., a maximum number of allowable mobile telephone minutes) and a current usage (e.g., a total number of mobile telephone minutes currently used by the user) and stores limit and usage information in user database . As an example, contact manager  may alert the user that the user has 20 allowable mobile telephone minutes to use within the next two days, and provide the user with a list of one or more contacts to call based on one or more communication gaps associated with the one or more contacts.","According to an exemplary embodiment, contact manager  may generate user interfaces that provide the user with communication gap information. According to an exemplary implementation, the user interface includes a solar system representation of communication gaps, in which the user is the center of the solar system and contacts are displayed as entities orbiting the user. The distance from the user to a contact represents a communication gap and\/or an affinity level relative to the user. This exemplary user interface is described and depicted further below.","User database  includes a database that stores communication tracking information, user preferences and settings pertaining to users, and other information that may be used by contact manager .  is a diagram illustrating exemplary data and\/or information fields stored by user database .

For example, information\/data may be stored in some other manner.","User field  includes an identifier that indicates a user or a group of users. User devices field  includes information pertaining to user devices associated with the user(s). For example, the information may include the type of user device  (e.g., iPad 2\u00ae device, etc.), type of communications used by the user on a particular user device  (e.g., IM, SMS, telephone, etc.), and software used by the user (e.g., Google Talk\u2122, Skype\u2122, etc.). User devices field  may include an equipment identifier associated with user device . Communication tracking field  includes communication tracking information, as described herein. Preferences\/settings field  includes user preferences and setting information. The user preferences and setting information may include one or more preferences and\/or settings configured by a user via communication tracking portal . Preferences\/settings field  may also store default preferences and\/or settings. Usage\/limit field  includes limit and usage information, as described herein. Communication gaps field  includes a time period that elapsed since a last communication (e.g., an e-mail, an SMS message, a telephone call, etc.) between a user and another entity.","Referring back to , usage aggregator  includes a network device that aggregates a user's usage of a particular service or form of communication. For example, with reference to mobile service, a user may have a limit on their account pertaining to the number of text messages that can be sent and received within a month before overage charges are applied. According to another example, a user may have a limit on their account pertaining to the number of peak minutes for telephone calls. According to an exemplary implementation, usage aggregator  receives usage limits associated with a user's account pertaining to various services (e.g., mobile service, Internet service, etc.), for example, from the user or the user's service provider, and the user's current usage (e.g., from a billing device associated with the service provider). Usage aggregator  provides limit and usage information to user database . Contact manager  may use the limit and usage information to generate contact recommendations, as described herein.","According to an exemplary embodiment, e-mail tracker , IM tracker , telephone tracker , SMS tracker , MMS tracker , and\/or video call tracker  is\/are implemented by user device . According to another exemplary embodiment, e-mail tracker , IM tracker , telephone tracker , SMS tracker , MMS tracker , and\/or video call tracker  is\/are implemented by one or multiple network devices.","The method of tracking e-mails, instant messages, telephone calls, SMS messages, MMS messages, and\/or video calls may depend on various factors. For example, a service provider that provides Internet service, landline telephone service, television service, and mobile service to a user may have more options to track the user's communication than a third party service provider. Additionally, there are a variety of software (e.g., Google Talk\u2122, Yahoo! Messenger\u2122, Microsoft Outlook\u2122, Skype\u2122, browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer\u2122, Mozilla Firefox\u2122, etc.), etc.) that permits a user to communicate with others. Furthermore, communication tracking may be performed on the user device side, on the network side, or some combination, and involves various types of user devices , protocols, etc. User permission may be obtained and communication tracking information may be supplemented from the user. For example, the user may supplement communication tracking information via communication tracking system portal , as described herein.","Described below are exemplary methods that may be used to track communications of a user. This description is not intended to provide an exhaustive treatment of communication tracking. Accordingly, other methods (e.g., as are well known, etc.) for tracking communications, which have not been specifically described, may be implemented.","E-mail tracker  tracks e-mails destined to user device  and originating from user device . According to an exemplary embodiment, e-mail tracker  captures and stores e-mail information from e-mails including sender information (e.g., e-mail address of sender, name of sender, etc.), recipient information (e.g., e-mail address of recipient(s), name(s) of recipient(s), etc.), date, and time. E-mail tracker  may capture other types of e-mail information, such as, information in the subject line. According to an exemplary implementation, e-mail tracker  includes a keylogger that records keystrokes inputted via user device . For example, some e-mail services (e.g., Web-based e-mail or webmail, etc.) may encrypt e-mails, which prevent packet sniffing. According to another exemplary implementation, e-mail tracker  includes software having an application programming interface (API) with, for example, an e-mail client, to capture e-mail information. By way of example, e-mail information may be obtained via e-mails stored in an inbox folder and a sent mail folder.

MMS tracker  tracks multimedia messaging service messages destined to user device  and originating from user device . According to an exemplary embodiment, MMS tracker  captures and stores multimedia messaging service information including sender information (e.g., telephone number, name of sender), recipient information (e.g., telephone number, name of recipient, etc.), date, and time.","Telephone tracker  tracks telephone calls (e.g., mobile calls, landline calls, VoIP calls, etc.) destined to user device  and originating from user device . In cases when telephone calls are received via a landline telephone, the user may designate himself\/herself as the recipient via communication tracking system portal . For example, in a household with multiple members, the caller may be a contact for one or more of the members in the household. According to other examples, when there is a single member in the household, this issue is rendered moot. Additionally, as described herein, communication tracking aggregator  may include an intelligence to ascertain telephone information associated with a landline telephone call based on other communication tracking information (e.g., e-mail information, etc.) and\/or user\/subscriber information, if available.","According to an exemplary embodiment, telephone tracker  captures and stores telephone information including sender information (e.g., a telephone number associated with the calling party), recipient information (e.g., a telephone number associated with the called party), date, time, and duration of the telephone call. Telephone information may include caller identification (ID) information, such as name of the calling party, calls associated with call waiting, three-way calling, etc. According to an exemplary embodiment, telephone tracker  is implemented by user device . For example, a mobile telephone or a VoIP telephone may include software that permits the capture and storing of telephone information. Alternatively, according to another exemplary embodiment, telephone tracker  is implemented by a network device.

For example, graphical element - may indicate an orbit in which contacts in the orbit are considered high infinity level contacts, graphical element - may indicate an orbit in which contacts in the orbit are considered medium infinity level contacts, and graphical element - may indicate an orbit in which contacts in the orbit are considered low infinity level contacts.","According to an exemplary embodiment, communication tracking system portal  (e.g., contact manager ) calculates affinity levels based on an active communication variable, a passive communication variable, a communication gap variable, and an allowed communication gap variable.","The active communication (AC) variable indicates that the user makes or receives an active form of a communication, such as a telephone call or a video call, with respect to a contact. The passive communication (PC) variable indicates that the user makes or receives a passive form of a communication, such as IM, SMS messaging, MMS messaging, e-mail, tweeting, etc., with respect to a contact. The communication gap (CG) variable indicates a total elapsed time (e.g., minutes, hours, days, months, years, etc.) since the last communication between the user and a contact. The allowed communication gap (ACG) variable indicates a maximum allowed elapsed time since the last communication between the user and a contact.","Based on the above variables, affinity levels may be calculated, such as, for example, a high affinity level (HAL), a medium affinity level (MAL), and a low affinity level (LAL).

A (MAL) contact is a contact in which active communication is more often used than passive communication. A (LAL) contact is a contact in which passive communication is preferred and active communication is rarely used. In equations (1)-(3), the variable X and Y may be assigned any numeric value that reflects the affinity level. For example, for a (HAL), the variable X may be a small number (e.g., 5-15) or other suitable value. In such a case, a small percentage of the (ACG) is greater than the (CG). Additionally, for example, for a (HAL), the variable Y may be a small number (e.g., 5-15) or other suitable value. In such a case, a small percentage of the number of active communications is greater than the number of passive communications. The variables X and Y may be predefined or user-configurable.\n","According to an exemplary embodiment, the affinity level of a contact may be applied to the user interface depicted in . For example, contacts orbiting within graphical element - (orbit -) may be of a high affinity level with respect to the user. Similarly, contacts orbiting within graphical element - (orbit -) may be of a medium affinity level, and contacts orbiting within graphical element - (orbit -) may be of a low affinity level. The calculated affinity levels may be applied to other processes, such as generating contact recommendations.","Described below are exemplary processes pertaining to some of the processes described herein.

Contact manager  calculates a communication gap pertaining to the user and the contact. As previously described, contact manager  may calculate one or multiple communication gaps depending on, for example, the user's preference. By way of example, contact manager  may calculate a communication gap for each form of communication. For example, assume contact manager  calculates a communication gap in view of e-mails, SMS messages, and telephone calls. Contact manager  calculates a communication gap for e-mails, a communication gap for SMS messages, and a communication gap for telephone calls.","Alternatively, contact manager  may calculate a communication gap based on all communications collectively. For example, assume the communication gap for e-mails is 20 days, the communication gap for SMS messages is 18 days, and the communication gap for telephone calls is 7 days.

According to an exemplary implementation, the user interface may categorize the contact (e.g., as a family member, friend, etc.). According to an exemplary implementation, the user interface may sort the communication gap based on a time period (e.g., less than 48 hours, etc.), the type of communication (e-mail, SMS message, etc.), the affinity level of the contact, and\/or communication category (e.g., passive communication, active communication).","Although  illustrates an exemplary process  for providing communication gap information, according to other embodiments, process  may include additional operations, fewer operations, and\/or different operations than those illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"800"},"Blocks - may performed in a manner similar to that previously described in process  for blocks -.","In block , an allowed communication gap is stored. For example, communication tracking system portal  (e.g., user database ) may store the allowed communication gap. The allowed communication gap specifies a time period in which a lapse of communication between the user and a contact is permitted. According to an exemplary implementation, the allowed communication gap may pertain to all communications. According to another exemplary implementation, the allowed communication gap may pertain to a specific form of communication.","In block , the calculated communication gap is compared to the allowed communication gap. For example, communication tracking system portal  (e.g., contact manager ) compares the numerical values representative of a time period associated with the communication gap and the numerical values representative of a time period associated with the allowed communication gap are compared. As previously described, the time period may be expressed in terms of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, etc.","In block , it is determined whether the calculated communication gap exceeds the allowed communication gap based on the comparison. If it is determined that the calculated communication gap does not exceed the allowed communication gap (block -NO), then process continues to block . If it is determined that the calculated communication gap exceeds the allowed communication gap (block -YES), then a communication is generated (block ).","According to an exemplary implementation, the type of communication generated is based on a user preference. For example, the user may wish to have an SMS message generated. Alternatively, the user may wish to have an MMS message, an e-mail message, or even a telephone call generated.","According to an exemplary implementation, the user may also set preferences pertaining to the content of the communication. For example, assume the user selected a telephone call as the type of communication. The user may record a voice message to be used for the automated telephone call. According to other examples, the user may store a message to be used for the automated e-mail, SMS message, etc.","In block , the communication is sent to the contact. For example, communication tracking system portal  sends the communication to the contact.","Although  illustrates an exemplary process  for generating automated communications, according to other embodiments, process  may include additional operations, fewer operations, and\/or different operations than those illustrated in . For example, according to other embodiments, in response to determining that the communication gap exceeds the allowed communication gap, an alert is generated and provided to the user. The alert may indicate that, for this contact, the current communication gap exceeds the allowed communication gap. The alert may also include a prompt to the user requesting whether he\/she would like to initiate a communication now. According to an exemplary implementation, the alert may be displayed to the user via user device . Alternatively, the alert may be transmitted to the user via a communication (e.g., an e-mail, an SMS message, a voice message, etc.). Additionally, for example, when the contact is a utility company or other institution (e.g., a bank, a credit card company, etc.), process  may include making a payment. The user may set preferences (e.g., amount of payment, etc.) and other information (e.g., user login information for user's bank, etc.) to permit such a transaction.","According to another exemplary implementation, process  may include considering usage limits. For example, suppose the user has 10 minutes left to use within the next two days. Communication tracking system portal  may not generate and place a telephone call to the contact because there are so few minutes available minutes left. According to an exemplary implementation, communication tracking system portal  may make this decision based on a user preference (e.g., a block-out time period for automated communications). Additionally, or alternatively, under such circumstances, communication tracking system portal system  may generate and send the communication provided the contact is of a particular affinity level (e.g., a high affinity level).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"900"},"Process  may begin with storing total usage information (block ). For example, communication tracking system portal  (e.g., usage aggregator ) stores total usage information associated with a user (e.g., in database ). For example, based on communication tracking information pertaining to a user, usage aggregator  determines that the user has used 700 mobile telephone minutes by way of either receiving telephone calls or placing telephone calls via user device  (e.g., the user's mobile phone).","In block , limit information is stored. For example, communication tracking system portal  (e.g., usage aggregator ) stores limit information that pertains to one or more types of communication (e.g., in database ). In continuation of the example described for block , the limit information pertains to the user's limit of mobile telephone minutes. For example, the user's mobile telephone limit is 750 minutes.","In block , total usage information is compared with limit information. For example, communication tracking system portal  (e.g., contact manager ) compares the total usage limit information with the limit information. For example, the total usage information includes a numeric value of 700 minutes and the limit information includes a numeric value of 750 minutes. Contact manager  may calculate a difference between the used minutes and allowable minutes. According to this example, the difference equates to 50 minutes.","In block , it is determined whether a threshold for generating recommendations is met. Contact manager  identifies a user preference pertaining to generating contact recommendations. According to an exemplary implementation, the user preference includes a threshold value, that if satisfied, permits contact manager  to generate recommendations. According to this example, assume the threshold value is 50 minutes or less.","If it is determined that the threshold is not met (block -NO), process  continues to block . If it is determined that the threshold is met (block -YES), then a contact recommendation is generated (block ). According to an exemplary implementation, contact manager  selects one or more contacts to recommend to the user with which to communicate based on communication gap information. For example, contact manager  may select a contact associated with the largest communication gap. Additionally, or alternatively, contact manager  may select a contact that the user typically communicates via mobile telephone. According to another implementation, contact manager  may consider other factors, such as affinity level, total number of mobile telephone calls and\/or total number of mobile minutes used for a contact, etc.","In block , the contact recommendation is provided to the user. For example, contact manager  displays or makes available to the user one or more contact recommendations.","Although  illustrates an exemplary process  for generating contact recommendations, according to other embodiments, process  may include additional operations, fewer operations, and\/or different operations than those illustrated in . For example, according to another exemplary embodiment, process  may include generating an alert to inform the user that the threshold has been met and\/or indicate a balance of minutes, etc., left before overage charges may apply. The user may then have the option to request contact recommendations.","The foregoing description of embodiments provides illustration, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the embodiments to the precise form disclosed.
