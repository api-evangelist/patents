title: Authentication for social networking messages
abstract: A tool for verifying that a message received by a social networking service was sent by a bona fide owner of a social networking account who purportedly sent the message. The tool receives a message and it locates in the message a string that was entered into a message text field of the message. The string is compared with a registered authentication string for the bona fide owner of the account. If the string in the message matches the registered authentication string, the string is removed from the message and the message is forwarded to the social networking service. If the string in the message does not match the registered authentication string, the message is blocked from being forwarded to the social networking service.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to social networking and more specifically to the authentication of the sender of a social networking message.","Social networking is the interaction between people to share information, ideas, resources and interests. A popular form of social networking uses social networking services over the Internet. A social networking service allows a person to become a \u201cuser,\u201d create a profile (description of the user) for the user's web page, communicate with other users, or utilize a range of other services available through the social network service. Examples of popular social networking services are Facebook\u00ae (Registered trademark of Facebook, Inc.) social networking services and Twitter\u00ae (Registered trademark of Twitter, Inc.) social networking services.","Users of Facebook social networking services and Twitter social networking services communicate with other users of the service through \u201csocial networking messages,\u201d which are messages sent to the social networking service that can be made available to the general public, all users of the service, or to a select set of friends or followers.","For example, Facebook \u201cfriends\u201d are pairs of Facebook users who have mutually agreed to be able to view each other's messages. A Facebook user can post a message on his or her \u201cFacebook wall.\u201d A \u201cFacebook wall\u201d is a user's virtual wall displayed when a user is logged in to the Facebook service. This wall is where a user can post messages for viewing by his or her friends, and where he or she can view messages posted by his or her friends on their walls. Users can also post messages directly on a friend's wall. In another example, a Twitter user can post a \u201cTweet\u00ae\u201d message which is a message posted to a Twitter account. These Tweet messages can either be public or protected. A public Tweet message can be viewed by anyone while a protected Tweet message can only be seen by approved \u201cfollowers.\u201d Followers are other users of Twitter social networking service that have subscribed to a user's Twitter updates. In either of the examples above, once a social networking message is posted, it is disseminated to others.","Facebook social networking service operates on a network of servers including web servers, Memcached servers (generic high-performance, distributed memory object caching systems) and database servers. The servers receive and store data that users send when creating their profile. This data typically includes photos, lists of interests, contact information, and other information. The servers disseminate this data to other computing devices when users access the created profile. The servers communicate over the Internet with users on computing devices, such as computers or smart phones.","The servers receive messages from Facebook users attempting to communicate with others. These messages are sent from a computing device logged on to the Facebook service. The servers process and send the messages to the appropriate location (e.g., Facebook wall) for viewing by the appropriate users (e.g., friends). The messages can then be viewed on the computing device of the recipient user.","Twitter social networking service, similar to Facebook social networking service, operates on a network of servers including web servers, Memcached servers and database servers. The servers communicate over the Internet with users on computing devices, such as computers or smart phones. Twitter has a limited profile feature but is more focused on communication with the public and between users.","The servers receive Tweet messages from Twitter users wishing to share the Tweet message with others. The servers process and send the Tweet message to the Twitter profile of the sender and to the \u201ctimeline\u201d (a list of all the Tweet messages from people a user follows) of the sender's followers.","When using a social networking service, security is a concern. Messages may be sent from someone pretending to be a specific user (spoofing) or from someone who has gained unauthorized access to a user's account (hacking). The messages may be embarrassing to the real\/spoofed user. Also, users receiving these messages may respond with the release of personal information.","Authentication of a social network service user is typically limited to login authentication before access to the service is granted. A user typically enters a userID and password on the service home page to gain access. The userID and password are created when the user initially joins the service. Normally, after the initial login authentication, a user can utilize all the functionality of the social networking service.","Aspects of an embodiment of the present invention disclose a method, system, and a program product for verifying that a message received by a social networking service was sent by a bona fide owner of a social networking account who purportedly sent the message. A network server computer receives the message and locates in the message a string that was entered into a message text field of the message by a person who authored the message, the string comprising first and second portions, the first portion comprising a combination of alpha numeric characters which identifies the second portion as containing purported authentication information for the bona fide owner of the account. The network server computer compares the second portion of the string in the message to a registered authentication string for the bona fide owner of the account. If the second portion of the string in the message matches the registered authentication string, the network server computer removes the string from the message and permits the message to be forwarded to the social networking service. If the second portion of the string in the message does not match the registered authentication string, the network server computer blocks the message from being forwarded to the social networking service.","The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"10"},"In the depicted embodiment, system  includes user computing device  and social networking server  interconnected over network .

Social networking message authentication program  removes the string and passes the social networking message to social networking service program  to post to a \u201clocation\u201d on the social networking service if the string contains the proper authentication string. In various embodiments a location may be a user's Facebook wall or a user's Twitter account.","In a preferred embodiment, social networking message authentication program  is a program residing on social networking server . In another embodiment, social networking message authentication program  may reside on another server or another computing device provided it is accessible to social networking service program  and has access to authentication string store .","In a preferred embodiment, social networking message authentication program  receives from social networking service program  a social networking message that includes a string used to determine if the social networking message was sent by the user who purportedly sent it. Social networking message authentication program  verifies that the string included in the social networking message contains the authentication string previously registered by the user and stored on authentication string store . If the authentication string is verified, social networking message authentication program  then removes the string from the social networking message and sends the social networking message to social networking service program  to be posted to a location on the social networking service. If the authentication string contained in the message does not match the authentication string previously registered by the user or if the message does not include any authentication string, then social networking message authentication program  blocks the message so it is not sent to social networking service program  and not posted on a social networking site.","In other embodiments, social networking message authentication program  may receive a social networking message over network  directly from social networking interface program  on user computing device . Social networking message authentication program  then follows the same process outlined in the paragraph above.","Social networking service program  operates as the main social networking program, such as Facebook social networking service or Twitter social networking service, to receive social networking messages from social networking interface program  on user computing device  and to send those messages to social networking message authentication program . Social networking service program  also posts social networking messages social networking service program  receives from social networking message authentication program  to a location on the social networking service. In a preferred embodiment, social networking service program  is a program residing on social networking server . In another embodiment, social networking service program  may reside on another server or another computing device, provided social networking service program  is accessible to social networking interface program  and social networking message authentication program .","Authentication string setup program  operates to allow a user to define an authentication string for use by social networking message authentication program .

In general, authentication string setup program  may reside on another network server, on user computing device , or on any computing device, provided it is can communicate with user computing device , and authentication string store  where the authentication string is stored.","In a preferred embodiment, authentication string setup program  receives an initial authentication string from user computing device  over network  and stores the authentication string on authentication string store .","In various embodiments, authentication string setup program  may permit a user to setup multiple authentication strings. For example, one authentication string may be used for a desktop computer and another for a smart phone. Also, different authentication strings can be used for different social networking services. These computing devices are capable of utilizing different types of authentication strings as illustrated below in the description of ,  and .","Authentication string setup program  also operates to allow a user to edit a previously stored authentication string. Authentication string setup program  receives the edited authentication string from user computing device  over network  and stores the authentication string on authentication string store .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"50"},"Social networking interface program  sends the social networking message with a string from user computing device  over network  to social networking service program  on social networking server .","In a preferred embodiment, the string has two portions and is located in the body of the social networking message in the message text field. Thus, the authentication string is entered into the same field as the actual message text. The first portion is a predetermined combination of alpha numeric characters that indicates that the following characters are the second portion which contains the authentication sting.","In an alternative embodiment, social networking interface program  accesses data from biometric data sensors of user computing device  and inserts the data in to the social networking message as a string. User computing device  is an electronic device including one or more sensors such as an accelerometer or a gyroscope, and social networking interface program  is an application on user computing device . Social networking interface program  calls an Application Programming Interface (API) or a Standard Development Kit (SDK) of user computing device  to begin updating sensor data from the sensors of user computing device , and social networking interface program  prompts the user to make a series of motions or actions that would utilize the sensors of user computing device . Social networking interface program  calls the API or the SDK of user computing device  to access the sensor data collected while the user makes the series of motions or actions with user computing device . Social networking interface program  calls the API or the SDK or user computing device  to stop updating sensor data.","In step , social networking message authentication program  sends to social networking interface program  a message text field to display for a social networking service in response to a user accessing the social networking service web site and supplying a known userID and password to the social networking service. In response, the user enters into the message text field, actual message text and the symbol indicative of the authentication string, followed by the authentication string.","In step , social networking message authentication program  receives the social networking message with the string from social networking service program .","In step , social networking message authentication program  identifies the authentication string from the predetermined keyboard symbol and verifies that the string in the social networking message contains the authentication string previously registered by the user and stored on authentication string store . In a preferred embodiment, social networking message authentication program  queries authentication string store , to fetch the registered authentication string of the user and compares the registered authentication string to the second portion of the string included in the social networking message. The form of the query matches the form of the authentication string store , i.e., relational or non-relational.","If social networking message authentication program  verifies that the string in the social networking message contains the authentication string defined by the user and stored on authentication string store  (decision , yes branch), then social networking message authentication program  removes the string from the social networking message (step ) and sends the social networking message to social networking service program  to be posted to a location on the social networking service (step ).","If social networking message authentication program  cannot verify that the social networking message contains the authentication string defined by the user and stored on authentication string store  (i.e., either the message text field contains no authentication string or contains an authentication string that does not match the registered authentication string for the user) (decision , no branch), then social networking message authentication program  will return an error to the sender of the second message and not forward the message to the social networking service (step ).","If activated by an owner of the social networking account to which the message was intended to be sent, social networking message authentication program  sends an alert to the owner of the social networking account when an error is returned to the sender of the second message, as follows (step ). Social networking message authentication program  calls social networking service program  to obtain contact preferences set by the owner and sends the owner an alert using the contact preferences. The alert may be sent to an electronic device of the owner of the social networking account.
