{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a U.S. National Phase of International Application No. PCT\/US2009\/041817, filed Apr. 27, 2009 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/109,458, filed Apr. 25, 2008, entitled \u201cREAL-TIME COMMUNICATIONS OVER DATA FORWARDING FRAMEWORK,\u201d each of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present disclosure relates to data processing by digital computer, and more particularly to real-time communications over data forwarding framework.","Instant Messaging (IM) is a form of real-time communication between two or more people based on typed text. The text is conveyed using computers connected over a network such as the Internet. IM enables instantaneous communication between a number of parties simultaneously, by transmitting information quickly. Some IM systems enable users to use webcams and microphones for real-time conversations. In addition IM has additional features such as the immediate receipt of acknowledgment or reply, group chatting, conference services (including voice and video), conversation logging and file transfer. For example, it is possible to save a conversation for later reference. Instant messages are typically logged in a local message history that closes the gap to the persistent nature of E-mails and facilitates quick exchange of information like universal resource locators (URLs) or document snippets (which can be unwieldy when communicated via telephone).","The present invention provides methods and apparatus, including computer program products, for real-time communications over data forwarding framework.","In general, in one aspect, the invention features A method including receiving a request from a first user system linked to a network of interconnected computer system nodes to retrieve data being continuously forwarded from node memory to node memory in the network, the first user system executing a real-time communications client program that establishes a real-time communications session with a second user system executing a real-time communications client program, retrieving the data from node memory in response to the request from the first user system to retrieve data, and forwarding the retrieved data to the second user system.","In another aspect, the invention features a framework including a group of interconnected computer system nodes each adapted to receive data and continuously forward the data from computer memory to computer memory without storing on any physical storage device in response to a request from a client system to store data from a requesting system and retrieve data being continuously forwarded from computer memory to computer memory in response to a request to retrieve data from the requesting system, and at least two client systems linked to the group, each of the client systems executing a real-time communications client program.","Other features and advantages of the disclosure are apparent from the following description, and from the claims.","Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.","Unlike peer to peer networks, which use data forwarding in a transient fashion so that data is eventually stored on a physical medium such as a disk drive, the present invention enables social networking applications such as instant messaging to be supported by a continuously data forwarding framework, i.e., data is stored by continuously forwarding it from one node memory to another node memory in a network of nodes.","As shown in , an exemplary continuously data forwarding framework  includes two user systems ,  (also referred to as client systems) coupled to a number of network systems , , ,  (also referred to as servers). Each of the network systems , , ,  is considered to be a node in a network  and one such network system may be designated as a host or central server, such as network system . As such, network system  may assume a control position in network . Each of the nodes , , ,  can be established as a privately controlled network of peers under direct control of the central server . Peered nodes can also be a mix of private and public nodes (e.g., the Internet), and thus not under the direct physical control of the central server . The network  can also be wholly public where the central server  (or servers) has no direct ownership or direct physical control of any of the peered nodes.","The continuously data forwarding framework  supports communications between computer users, such as users on user systems ,. Computer users on user systems ,  are distributed geographically and communicate using one or more of the network systems , , ,  in network . User systems ,  are connected to network  through various communication mediums, such as a modem connected to a telephone line (using, for example, serial line internet protocol (SLIP) or point-to-point protocol (PPP)) or a direct internetwork connection (using, for example, transmission control protocol\/internet protocol (TCP\/IP)).","Each of the user systems ,  may be implemented using, for example, a general-purpose computer capable of responding to and executing instructions in a defined manner, a personal computer, a special-purpose computer, a workstation, a server, a device, a component, or other equipment or some combination thereof capable of responding to and executing instructions. User systems ,  may receive instructions from, for example, a software application, a program, a piece of code, a device, a computer, a computer system, or a combination thereof, which independently or collectively direct operations, as described herein. These instructions may take the form of one or more communications programs that facilitate communications between the users of client systems , . For instance, such communications programs may include E-mail programs, Instant Messaging (IM) programs, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) programs, Voice-over-Internet (VoIP) programs, as so forth. The instructions may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, equipment, storage medium, or propagated signal that is capable of being delivered to the client systems , .","Clients systems ,  include a communications interface (not shown) used by the communications programs to send communications through network . The communications may include E-mail, audio data, video data, general binary data, or text data (e.g., encoded in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format).","The network  can include a series of portals interconnected through a coherent system. Examples of the network  include the Internet, Wide Area Networks (WANs), Local Area Networks (LANs), analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks (e.g. a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)), an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), a Digital Subscriber Line (xDSL)), or any other wired or wireless network. The network  may include multiple networks or sub-networks, each of which may include, for example, a wired or wireless data pathway.","A host server  may be connected to network  and may be used to facilitate some direct or indirect communications between the client systems , . As with the client systems , , host server  may be implemented using, for example, a general-purpose computer capable of responding to and executing instructions in a defined manner, a personal computer, a special-purpose computer, a workstation, a server, a device, a component, or other equipment or some combination thereof capable of responding to and executing instructions. Host server  may receive instructions from, for example, a software application, a program, a piece of code, a device, a computer, a computer system, or a combination thereof, which independently or collectively direct operations, as described herein. These instructions may take the form of one or more communications programs. For instance, such communications programs may include E-mail programs, IM programs, FTP programs, VoIP programs, and so forth. The instructions may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, equipment, storage medium, or propagated signal that is capable of being delivered to the host server .","Further, host server  includes a communications interface (not shown) used by the communications programs to send communications through network . The communications may include E-mail, audio data, video data, general binary data, or text data (e.g., encoded in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format).","The user systems ,  can execute an instant messaging (IM) client program. IM programs typically enable users to communicate in real-time with each other in a variety of ways. Most IM programs provide, for example:","(1) Instant messages\u2014send notes back and forth with a friend who is online","(2) Chat\u2014create a chat room with friends or co-workers","(3) Web links\u2014share links to your favorite Web sites","(4) Video\u2014send and view videos, and chat face to face with friends","(5) Images\u2014look at an image stored on your friend's computer","(6) Sounds\u2014play sounds for your friends","(7) Files\u2014share files by sending them directly to your friends","(8) Talk\u2014use the Internet instead of a phone to actually talk with friends","(9) Streaming content\u2014real-time or near-real-time stock quotes and news","(10) Mobile capabilities\u2014send instant messages from your cell phone","Examples of IM communications include those provided by AIM (America Online\u00ae Instant Messenger), Yahoo\u00ae Messenger, MSN\u00ae Messenger, and ICQ\u00ae, and so forth.","The framework  supports these IM communications and enables users to store video, images, sounds, files and other content, which can be included in IM communications. Unlike other systems, such as data storage networks, the framework  does not use fixed physical data storage to store data, such as image files and video files, for example. When a request to store data is received by the central server  from one of the user systems , , data is directed to a node in the network  where it is then continuously forwarded from node memory to node memory in the network  without storing on any physical storage medium such as a disk drive. The forwarded data resides only for a very brief period of time in the memory of any one node in the network . Data is not stored on any physical storage medium in any network node.","In a like manner, when a request to retrieve data is received by the central server  from a user system , , the requested data, which is being forwarded from node memory to node memory in the network , is retrieved.","Data forwarded in this manner can be segmented and segments forwarded as described above. Sill, the segmented data is not stored on any physical storage medium in any network node, but merely forwarded from the memory of one node to the memory of another node.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","16","18","20","22","200","202","200","204","204"]},"Process  sends () a message to the user system with the address of a specific node for the requester to forward the data.","Process  detects () the presence of data in node memory. Process  forwards () the data in memory to another node in the network of nodes and continues to repeat detecting () and forwarding () of the data from node memory to node memory. When data arrives in any node memory, process  affixes () a time stamp to the data. Additionally, as data enters and exits any mode memory, the data may be encrypted and de-encrypted.","Forwarding () can include pinging the node in the network to determine which of the nodes in the network is available, or determining which node in the network has the least traffic, or determining which node in the network has the largest available memory, or any combination of these or other factors.","In one specific example, at the point of entry to a node, data undergoes an encrypted \u201chandshake\u201d with the node or central server  or user. This can be a public or private encryption system, such as the Cashmere system, which can use public-private keys. Cashmere decouples the encrypted forwarding path and message payload, which improves the performance as the source only needs to perform a single public key encryption on each message that uses the destination's unique public key. This has the benefit that only the true destination node will be able to decrypt the message payload and not every node in the corresponding relay group. Cashmere provides the capability that the destination can send anonymous reply messages without knowing the source's identity. This is done in a similar way, where the source creates a reply path and encrypts it in a similar manner as the forwarding path.","In another example, other routing schemes are utilized.","If the received request is a request to retrieve data being continuously forwarded from node memory to node memory, process  matches () at the central server  using a hash mark or other unique code that can be \u201csniffed\u201d by the node upon the data entering the node via the encryption handshake. This can occur by pinging the nodes in the network. Process  sends () the message to return the data to the user directly to the node or node state where the central server  believes the data will likely appear. The more the central server  can narrow the node state that it pings to, then the more efficient the retrieval will become and the less burdened by unnecessary messaging traffic to nodes that are not necessary for a transaction between the central server  and the node capable of forwarding the data.","Once the correct node receives the message to forward the data in node memory to the requester, process  forwards () the data in node memory to the requester and forwards () a confirmation message that the data has been sent to the user. This routing message may be sent directly to the central server  or may be passed to the central server  or servers via other node(s) or supernode(s) in the network . Upon the user receiving the requested data the user's application functions to automatically ping the central server  that the data requested has been received. Thus the network  creates data storage without caching, downloading and\/or storing the data on any physical storage medium. Data storage and management is accomplished via a continuously routing of the data from node memory to node memory.","New nodes and node states may be added and\/or deleted from the network  based upon performance. Users may have access to all nodes or may be segmented to certain nodes or \u201cnode states\u201d by the central server(s) or via the specific architecture of the private, public or private-public network.","Individual nodes, nodes states and supernodes may also be extranet peers, wireless network peers, satellite peered nodes, Wi-Fi peered nodes, broadband networks, and so forth, in public or private networks. Peered nodes or users may be used as routing participants in the network  from any valid peer point with the same security systems employed, as well as custom solutions suitable for the rigors of specific deployments, such as wireless encryption schemes for wireless peers, and so forth.","In process , rather than have data cached or held in remote servers, hard drives or other fixed storage medium, the data are passed, routed, forwarded from node memory to node memory. The data are never downloaded until the authorized user calls for the data. A user on the system may authorize more than one user to have access to the data.","A primary goal in process  is to generate a data storage and management system where the data is never fixed in physical storage, but in fact, is continuously being routed\/forwarded from node memory to node memory in the network. The path of the nodes to which data is forwarded may also be altered by the central server  to adjust for system capacities and to eliminate redundant paths of data that may weaken the security of the network due to the increased probability of data path without this feature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["12","14"]},"Shown is a desktop  with a user interface  of the instant messaging client program. User interface  has a text box  that displays representations  of the program user's contacts or buddies (both terms are used interchangeably herein), which are other users of an instant messaging program with whom the program user desires to communicate and interact. The representations  may provide contextual information to the program user about the buddy, such as whether the contact is online, how long the contact has been online, whether the contact is away, or whether the contact is using a mobile device.","The list of contacts displayed in text box  of user interface  typically is referred to as the contact list or buddy list. The IM program user can typically add or remove contacts from the contact list. In the example shown, the representations  are text icons showing the screen names of the contacts.","Instant messaging programs may use an instant messaging server to assist in communications between users of the instant messaging program. The instant messaging server may be implemented, for example, using host server . When a user is connected to the network and executes the instant messaging program, the instant messaging program contacts the host server  and logs the user onto the host server . The host server  informs the instant messaging program when the program user's contacts are online and facilitates communications between the program user and an online contact.","The host server  may support IM services irrespective of a program user's network or Internet access. Thus, host server  may enable users to send and receive IMs, regardless of whether they have access to any particular Internet service provider (ISP). The host server  also may support associated services, such as administrative matters, advertising, directory services, chat, and interest groups related to IM. To transfer data, the host server  employs one or more IM protocols.","To begin an IM session, the IM client program running on a client system ,  establishes a connection with the host server  and logs onto the host server . Once a session is established, a user can use the IM client program to view whether particular buddies are online, exchange IMs with particular buddies, participate in group chat rooms, trade files such as pictures, invitations or documents. The IM program user also may be able to find other buddies with similar interests, get customized information such as news and stock quotes, and search the World Wide Web.","Host server  may assist IM communications between users of IM client programs by facilitating the establishment of a peer-to-peer communication session between the IM client programs. Or the host server  may assist IM communications by directly routing communications between the IM client programs.","When a contact is online, the IM program user can communicate or interact with the contact in a number of ways. For instance, the IM program user can send an instant message to the contact (typically in the form of text).","Sending a message opens up a window in which messages can be typed back-and-forth between the IM program user and the contact. Similarly, the IM program user also can send a file or other content to the contact.","To initiate these actions for a contact, the IM program user performs operations on the representation of the contact displayed in user interface . The program then executes the corresponding action in response to the operation performed on the representation. For example, an instant message might be initiated by double-clicking on a contact's representation. Or, a file transfer might be initiated by the IM program user selecting the contact's representation to bring up a context menu and choosing \u201csend a file\u201d from the menu.","Other actions can be executed in response to operations performed on the representation of the contact displayed in interface . For instance, a \u201cbuddy icon\u201d can be set for the contact such that communications with the contact display the buddy icon. In addition, for example, profile information about the contact can be retrieved, an alert can be set to inform the program user when the contact is online, a VoIP communication session can be established, or an e-mail can be sent.","User interface  may have icons  to help a user set various options or perform operations in the instant messaging program.","The techniques described above are not limited to any particular hardware or software configuration. Rather, they may be implemented using hardware, software, or a combination of both. The programs may be implemented in a high-level programming language and may also be implemented in assembly or other lower level languages, if desired. Any such program will typically be stored on a computer-usable storage medium or device (e.g., CD-ROM, RAM, or magnetic disk). When read into the processor of the computer and executed, the instructions of the program cause the programmable computer to carry out the various operations described.","Furthermore, while the techniques have been described primarily with IM applications, they may be applied to other communications programs such as FTP programs, e-mail programs, voice-over-IP (VoIP) or other telephony programs, or players for streaming media.","It is to be understood that the foregoing description is intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the disclosure, which is defined by the scope of the appended claims. Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
