{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates in general to the sharing of media content, and more particularly to a system, method and device for sharing of playlists of authorized content with other users.","Cable, satellite, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), and wireless are the most common types of broadband services. Cable systems deliver hundreds of channels to homes, while also providing a growing number of people with high-speed Internet access and phone service. For example, broadband Internet is achieved over coaxial cable by using cable modems to convert the network data into a type of digital signal that can be transferred over coaxial cable. Satellite television is television delivered by the means of communications satellite and received by a satellite dish and set-top box. DSL uses existing copper telephone lines and a DSL modem to provide broadband services over a standard phone line. Local phone companies, such as Verizon and AT&T, are laying fiber-optic cable directly to the neighborhood and even into the home and office in order to retain customers with promises of ultra-high-speed Internet connections and enhanced entertainment offerings online. Wireless broadband services are rapidly gaining popularity. Wireless broadband does not require a modem or cables. As a result, wireless broadband can be easily established in areas where it is not feasible to deploy DSL or cable. Speeds of wireless broadband are similar to those of cable and DSL.","Video sharing is the use of web-based software to upload and share video clips. Users can upload videos to a video hosting service on the web. These web services host videos online, allowing them to be accessed and viewed (usually streamed) over the internet. Most video hosting services allow users to choose whether the video is to be shared privately or shared publically with the world. For example, YouTube and iTunes allows users to create playlists and share the playlists with other users.","However, playlists associated with television programs, video-on-demand, and other content that is provided via a conditional access device or from the communication service provider have not been provided. Playlists may be created from a mobile device, tablet computers and personal computers, but set-top boxes or related conditional access devices do not provide for the creating and sharing of playlists. Furthermore, a playlist created on a personal computer does not interface with a program guide. So currently there is no method for sharing playlists between users or customers.","Accordingly, there is a need for a system, method and device for sharing of playlists of authorized content with other users.","To overcome the limitations described above, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification; embodiments for a system, method and device for enabling users to share their playlist with others is disclosed.","The above-described problems are solved by enabling the sharing of content playlists.

The STB  also includes a video processor for processing and providing digital and analog video signaling to the television set  via a cable communication transport . A multi-channel tuner is provided for processing video and data to and from the STB  and the server-side head end system , described below.","The STB  also includes an operating system  for directing the functions of the STB  in conjunction with a variety of client applications . For example, if a client application  requires a news flash from a third-party news source to be displayed on the television , the operating system  may cause the graphics functionality and video processor of the STB , for example, to output the news flash to the television  at the direction of the client application  responsible for displaying news items.","Because a variety of different operating systems  may be utilized by a variety of different brands and types of set-top boxes, a middleware layer  is provided to allow a given software application to be executed by a variety of different operating systems. According to an embodiment, the middleware layer  may include a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that are exposed to client applications  and operating systems  that allow the client applications to communicate with the operating systems through common data calls understood via the API set. As described below, a corresponding middleware layer is included on the server side of the CATV system  for facilitating communication between the server-side application server and the client-side STB . According to one embodiment; the middleware layer  of the server-side application server and the middleware layer  of the client-side STB  format data passed between the client side and server side according to the Extensible Markup Language (XML).","The set-top box  passes digital and analog video and data signaling to the television  via a one-way communication transport . The STB  may receive video and data from the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  through a video\/data downlink and data via a data downlink. The STB  may transmit data from the client side of the CATV system  to the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  via one data uplink. The video\/data downlink is an \u201cin band\u201d downlink that allows for digital and analog video and data signaling from the server side of the CATV system  through the HFC network  to the set-top box  for use by the STB  and for distribution to the television set .","The data downlink and the data uplink, illustrated in , between the HFC network  and the set-top box  comprise \u201cout of band\u201d data links. According to embodiments, data flow between the client-side set-top box  and the server-side application server  is typically passed through the \u201cout of band\u201d data links. Alternatively, an \u201cin band\u201d data carousel may be positioned in an \u201cin band\u201d channel into which a data feed may be processed from the server-side application server  through the HFC network  to the client-side STB . Operation of data transport between components of the CATV system , described with reference to , is well known to those skilled in the art.","Referring still to , the head end  of the CATV system  is positioned on the server side of the CATV system and includes hardware and software systems responsible for originating and managing content for distributing through the HFC network  to client-side STBs  for presentation to customers via televisions . As described above, a number of services may be provided by the CATV system , including digital and analog video programming, interactive television services, telephone services, video-on-demand services, targeted advertising, and provision of information content. Further, according to embodiments, CATV systems  provides for the creating and sharing of playlists of subscribers.","The application server  is a general-purpose computing system operative to assemble and manage data sent to and received from the client-side set-top box  via the HFC network . As described above with reference to the set-top box , the application server  includes a middleware layer  for processing and preparing data from the head end of the CATV system  for receipt and use by the client-side set-top box . For example, the application server  via the middleware layer  may obtain data from third-party services  via the Internet  for transmitting to a customer through the HFC network  and the set-top box . For example, a weather report from a third-party weather service may be downloaded by the application server via the Internet . When the application server  receives the downloaded weather report, the middleware layer  may be utilized to format the weather report for receipt and use by the set-top box .","According to one embodiment, data obtained and managed by the middleware layer  of the application server  is formatted according to the Extensible Markup Language and is passed to the set-top box  through the HFC network  where the XML-formatted data may be utilized by a client application  in concert with the middleware layer , as described above. As should be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a variety of third-party services data, including news data, weather data, sports data and other information content may be obtained by the application server  via distributed computing environments such as the Internet  for provision to customers via the HFC network  and the set-top box .","According to embodiments, the application server  obtains customer support services data, including billing data, information on customer work order status, answers to frequently asked questions, services provider contact information, and the like from data services  for provision to the customer via an interactive television session. As illustrated in , the services provider data services  include a number of services operated by the services provider of the CATV system  which may include data on a given customer.","A billing system  may include information such as a customer's name, street address, business identification number, Social Security number, credit history, and information regarding services and products subscribed to by the customer. According to embodiments, the billing system  may also include billing data for services and products subscribed to by the customer for bill processing billing presentment and payment receipt.","A customer information database  may include general information about customers such as place of employment, business address, business telephone number, and demographic information such as age, gender, educational level, and the like. The customer information database  may also include information on pending work orders for services or products ordered by the customer. The customer information database  may also include general customer information such as answers to frequently asked customer questions and contact information for various service provider offices\/departments. As should be understood, this information may be stored in a variety of disparate databases operated by the cable services provider.","A cross-platform mobile application server  may contain information such as electronic mail addresses, high-speed Internet access subscription information, and electronic mail usage data. An authentication system  may include information such as secure user names and passwords utilized by customers  for access to network services. As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the disparate data services systems , , ,  are illustrated as a collection of data services for purposes of example only. The example data services systems comprising the data services  may operate as separate data services systems, which communicate with a web services system (described below) along a number of different communication paths and according to a number of different communication protocols.","Referring still to , a web services system  is illustrated between the application server  and the data services . According to embodiments, the web services system  serves as a collection point for data requested from each of the disparate data services systems comprising the data services . According to embodiments, when the application server  requires customer services data from one or more of the data services , the application server  passes a data query to the web services system . The web services system formulates a data query to each of the available data services systems for obtaining any required data for a requesting customer as identified by a set-top box identification associated with the customer. The web services system  serves as an abstraction layer between the various data services systems and the application server . That is, the application server  is not required to communicate with the disparate data services systems, nor is the application server  required to understand the data structures or data types utilized by the disparate data services systems. The web services system  is operative to communicate with each of the disparate data services systems for obtaining necessary customer data. The customer data obtained by the web services system is assembled and is returned to the application server  for ultimate processing via the middleware layer , as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["200","210","210","220","230"]},"If the contacts have the same access privileges to the content, e.g., they are subscribers to the same content provider or network operator and have the same subscription package, then the contacts will be able to access the content maintained in the playlist. Contacts can acknowledge or accept the playlist , which then may be selected for addition to a playlist created by the contact. Alternatively, the playlist may be shown in the contacts' playlist as a separate playlist with the same title that the first user used to create the playlist. The contact may tag such playlist with an identification of the user that created the playlist. In addition, the contact may change the title of the received playlist. Titles within the playlist are displayed the same for the initial user and the contact. Depending upon the conditional access privileges associated with content in the playlist and what privileges the contact has subscribed to, the contact may be able to access the content for free. Optionally, the contact may need to purchase rights to access the content . If the contact is not entitled to access any of the content in the playlist, the titles may be presented in a manner that conveys this unavailability. For example, the contact may have to upgrade to a different subscription package to be able to access the content. The interface used to present the playlist to the contact may be configured to display a subscription interface for making arrangements to access the content in the playlist. If the contact is not within the service area of the content provider or network operator, the contact is still able to view the playlist titles  so that the contact and the initial user are able to communicate regarding playlists that have been created.","In such a situation, the playlist may be presented as an xml file or in any type of format that is capable of being sent via email to the contacts . Thus, the contact may search their viewable content to determine whether the same content that is listed in the playlist is available for separate access. For example, the contact may be a subscriber to a different content provider or network operator. Nevertheless, the contact can search for content provided by their content provider or network operator and access the content when it becomes available, record the content for later access or arrange with the content provider or network operator to have the content provided on demand, e.g., video-on-demand (VOD).","In addition, the playlist may be synchronized among the different platforms, including mobile devices, PC, set top boxes, etc. Within a household, for example, playlists may be shared with other members of the household. This facilitates personalization of the playlist within the home. In this scenario, the other members have the same access privileges because they are in the same household, except for parental\/primary user controls that may be implemented.","The playlist interface may be accessible through a program guide or may be provided using a separate program. Thus, a user may use a mobile device to access a portal, which then allows the user to display their playlists on the mobile device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","1","1","310","320","330","340","340","310","350","360"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","420","430","400","400","400","490","490","492"]},"Embodiments implemented on computer-readable media  may refer to a mass storage device, such as a hard disk or CD-ROM drive.
