title: Cardholder-not-present authorization
abstract: There is provided a method and system for real-time authorization of cardholder-not-present transactions. An authorization request application may be implemented on an electronic device, such as a cellular phone, a personal media player, or a computer. A cardholder may register a card account, such as a credit account, a debit account, a gift card account, and so forth, for participation in the real-time authorization program. The cardholder may then receive authorization requests when cardholder-not-present transactions are attempted. Via the authorization request application, the cardholder may approve or decline the authorization request. In addition, the cardholder may configure settings for automatically responding to missed authorization requests. The authorization request application may also allow the cardholder to flag automatically approved requests as unauthorized within a certain time period after an automatic approval response is sent, thereby enabling prompt detection of fraudulent activity.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Technical Field","The present disclosure relates generally to transaction authorizations and, more particularly, to authorizing cardholder-not-present transactions via an electronic device.","2. Description of the Related Art","This section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art that may be related to various aspects of the present disclosure, which are described or claimed below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present disclosure. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.","Card purchases, such as via credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, and the like, may often be made in person or remotely. For example, an in-person transaction may involve handing a card to a store clerk or swiping a card through a point-of-sale system. In-person transactions may be facilitated by an identity verification process, such as, for example, showing the store clerk a picture identification, signing a receipt, and\/or entering a personal identification number. Cardholder-present transactions rely upon several security mechanisms to deter fraud, including a physical card with raised numbers, holographic images, signature line, card verification values embedded within the payment card's magnetic stripe, and\/or various information protection mechanisms embedded into integrated circuits.","In contrast, remote transactions may occur without identity verification or physical fraud deterrents found in modern payment cards. For example, a consumer may purchase an item online or via the telephone without presenting a physical card to the vendor. These transactions may be known as cardholder-not-present, card-not-present, or customer-not-present transactions because the customer and card are not present at the point of sale. Cardholder-not-present transactions may be more susceptible to fraudulent abuse than traditional in-person transactions because the purchaser's identity is not verified. That is, the purchaser may be required to enter the card number and a security number located on the card; however, this information may be easily copied off of a card and used in a fraudulent manner. In addition, although a billing address may be requested and compared to the billing address associated with a card, goods may be shipped to addresses other than the billing address.","Accordingly, a card owner may not realize that a fraudulent cardholder-not-present transaction has occurred until a billing statement is received. It is generally preferable to detect the fraudulent activity as soon as possible so that additional use of the card may be prevented. It stands to reason, and widely publicized studies corroborate the fact, that losses can be more easily recouped when the fraud is timely discovered. While a consumer may be at least partially protected from liability when fraud has occurred, the issuing bank, acquiring bank, or merchant may bear the loss if goods have been sent to an unauthorized card user. These costs are passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices on goods and services, higher banking fees, and higher interest rates. In addition, even if the consumer is ultimately not held responsible for unauthorized charges, it may still be very time-consuming and frustrating to have the charges reversed. For many consumers, the theft of one's financial identity has a demoralizing psychological affect. Therefore, it may be desirable to reduce the possibility of fraud in cardholder-not-present transactions.","Certain aspects of embodiments disclosed herein by way of example are summarized below. It should be understood that these aspects are presented merely to provide the reader with a brief summary of certain forms an invention disclosed and\/or claimed herein might take and that these aspects are not intended to limit the scope of any invention disclosed and\/or claimed herein. Indeed, any invention disclosed and\/or claimed herein may encompass a variety of aspects that may not be set forth below.","Accordingly, there is provided an electronic device for real-time authorization of cardholder-not-present transactions. The electronic device may be a handheld device, such as a cellular phone or a personal media player, or it may be a computer, such as a desktop computer or a laptop computer. Regardless of the form the electronic device takes, the device may run an application enabling a cardholder to approve or decline cardholder-not-present transactions in real time, near real-time, or after the transaction is initially authorized or settled. That is, in addition to a card transaction being sent to an issuing bank for approval, details of the transaction may be sent to the cardholder for approval before the transaction is authorized. If the cardholder does not recognize the transaction, it may be declined immediately, thereby preventing the cardholder and the merchant from becoming victims of identity theft.","Additionally, if the cardholder does not respond to an authorization request in real-time (i.e., within a short period of time), the authorization request may be responded to automatically based on customizable settings configured by the cardholder. For example, the cardholder may enable automatic approval of all missed authorizations. In another example, the cardholder may enable automatic approval of only transactions below a certain value and\/or with certain merchants. Many automatic response settings may be available, and the cardholder may be able to combine the settings, for example, so that transactions up to a first value are automatically approved at a first merchant, while transactions up to a second value different from the first value are automatically approved at the second merchant.","Further, even after an authorization response has been sent to the issuing bank or credit card association (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and so forth), the cardholder may flag an approved transaction as unauthorized. In this way, the cardholder may quickly notify the issuing bank, the credit card association, the acquiring bank, and\/or the merchant that a previously approved transaction is fraudulent. If the merchant has not yet shipped goods purchased in the transaction, the merchant may cancel the flagged transaction, thereby avoiding a potentially costly loss. The issuing bank, once notified of the fraudulent activity, may choose to contact the cardholder to determine whether the card should be cancelled to prevent potential further fraud. In other embodiments, the payment application may display the issuing bank's customer service phone number to expedite the process of resolving the fraud and preventing further misuse of the cardholder's account information.","This functionality may be combined with parental controls, enabling parents to provide children with credit, debit, or prepaid cards, while allowing unauthorized or inappropriate charges to be identified and declined before goods are shipped or services rendered. See, for example, Casey et al., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/351,724, entitled \u201cParental Controls,\u201d filed on the same date as the present application, the entirety of which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes. This cardholder-not-present authorization functionality may also be combined with a distinctive gesture, such as a reverse swipe of a virtual control on a touchscreen and\/or acceptance of a modal confirmation dialog, to reduce the possibility of a transaction being accidentally declined and\/or to reasonably ensure that the end user understands and accepts that he or she is declining a fraudulent financial transaction or authorizing a legitimate transaction. See, for example, Casey et al., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/351,714, entitled \u201cMotion Based Payment Confirmation,\u201d filed on the same date as the present application, the entirety of which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.","One or more specific embodiments of the present invention will be described below. In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, not all features of an actual implementation are described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.","Turning first to , an electronic device  may be configured for verifying authorization of cardholder-not-present transactions. As discussed below with reference to , the electronic device  may be, among other things, a handheld device, a computer, or a media player adapted to enable a user to review and approve or cancel cardholder-not-present transactions using techniques described in greater detail below.

In addition, software for reviewing and approving or cancelling cardholder-not-present transactions may be included on the electronic device , as described below.","A main memory  may be communicably coupled to the CPU , which may store data and executable code. The main memory  may represent volatile memory such as RAM, but may also include nonvolatile memory, such as read-only memory (ROM) or flash memory. In buffering or caching data related to operations of the CPU , the main memory  may store data associated with open applications running on the electronic device .","The electronic device  may also include nonvolatile storage . The nonvolatile storage  may represent any suitable nonvolatile storage medium, such as a hard disk drive or nonvolatile memory, such as flash memory. Being well-suited to long-term storage, the nonvolatile storage  may store data files such as media (e.g., music files, video files, pictures, etc.), software (e.g., for implementing functions on the electronic device ), preference information (e.g., media playback preferences, desktop background image, ringtones, etc.), transaction information (e.g., credit card data, records of transactions, etc.), wireless connection information (e.g., wireless network names and\/or passwords, cellular network connections, etc.), subscription information (e.g., a record of podcasts, television shows, or other media to which a user subscribes), as well as personal information (e.g., contacts, calendars, email, etc.).","In certain embodiments, a display  of the electronic device  may display images and\/or data. The display  may be any suitable display, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), a light emitting diode (LED) based display, an organic light emitting diode (OLED) based display, a cathode ray tube (CRT) display, or an analog or digital television. In some embodiments, the display  may include touch screen or multi-touch screen technology through which a user may interface with the electronic device .","The electronic device  may further have a user interface . The user interface  may include, for example, indicator lights, user inputs, and\/or a graphical user interface (GUI) on the display . In practice, the user interface  may operate via the CPU , using memory from the main memory  and long-term storage in the nonvolatile storage . In an embodiment lacking the display , indicator lights, sound devices, buttons, and other various input\/output (I\/O) devices may allow a user to interface with the electronic device . In an embodiment having a GUI, the user interface  may provide interaction with interface elements on the display  via certain user input structures, user input peripherals such as a keyboard or mouse, or a touch sensitive implementation of the display .","At a given time, one or more applications may be open and accessible to a user via the user interface  and\/or displayed on the display  of the electronic device . The applications may run on the CPU  in conjunction with the main memory , the nonvolatile storage , the display , and the user interface . Various data may be associated with each open application.","A user may employ the electronic device  to review and approve or cancel cardholder-not-present transactions. As such, it should be appreciated that the instructions for carrying out such techniques may represent a standalone application, a function of the operating system of the electronic device , or a function of the hardware of the CPU , the main memory , the nonvolatile storage , or other hardware of the electronic device .","In certain embodiments, the electronic device  may include location sensing circuitry . The location sensing circuitry  may represent global positioning system (GPS) circuitry, but may also represent one or more algorithms and databases, stored in the nonvolatile storage  or main memory  and executed by the CPU , which may be used to infer location based on various observed factors. For example, the location sensing circuitry  may include an algorithm and database used to approximate geographic location based on the detection of local wireless networks (e.g., 802.11x, otherwise known as Wi-Fi) or nearby cellular phone towers. The location sensing circuitry  may be used by the electronic device  to determine a user's location during an event; the location during the event may then affect and\/or determine the information displayed on the electronic device .","With continued reference to , the electronic device  may also include a wired input\/output (I\/O) interface  for a wired interconnection between one electronic device  and another electronic device . The wired I\/O interface  may be, for example, a universal serial bus (USB) port or an IEEE 1394 port (e.g., FireWire\u00ae, available from Apple Inc.), but may also represent a proprietary connection. Additionally, the wired I\/O interface  may permit a connection to peripheral user interface devices, such as a keyboard or a mouse.","One or more network interfaces  may provide additional connectivity for the electronic device . The network interfaces  may include, for example, one or more network interface cards (NIC) or a network controller. In certain embodiments, the network interface  may include a personal area network (PAN) interface . The PAN interface  may provide capabilities to network with, for example, a Bluetooth\u00ae network, an IEEE 802.15.4 (e.g., ZigBee) network, or an ultra wideband (UWB) network. As should be appreciated, the networks accessed by the PAN interface  may, but do not necessarily, represent low power, low bandwidth, or close range wireless connections. The PAN interface  may permit one electronic device  to connect to another local electronic device  via an ad-hoc or peer-to-peer connection. However, the connection may be disrupted if the separation between the two electronic devices  exceeds the range of the PAN interface .","The network interface  may also include a local area network (LAN) interface . The LAN interface  may be, for example an interface to a wired Ethernet-based network or an interface to a wireless LAN, such as a Wi-Fi network. The range of the LAN interface  may generally exceed the range available via the PAN interface . Additionally, in many cases, a connection between two electronic devices  via the LAN interface  may involve communication through a network router or other intermediary device.","Additionally, for some embodiments of the electronic device , the network interfaces  may include the capability to connect directly to a wide area network (WAN) via a WAN interface . The WAN interface  may permit a connection to a cellular data network, such as the Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) network, a 3G network, or another cellular network. When connected via the WAN interface , the electronic device  may remain connected to the Internet and, in some embodiments, to another electronic device , despite changes in location that might otherwise disrupt connectivity via the PAN interface  or the LAN interface . As will be discussed below, the wired I\/O interface  and the network interfaces  may represent high-bandwidth communication channels for transferring user data using the simplified data transfer techniques discussed herein.","Certain embodiments of the electronic device  may also include a near field communication (NFC) interface . The NFC interface  may allow for extremely close range communication at relatively low data rates (e.g., 424 kb\/s), and may comply with such standards as ISO\/IEC 18092, ECMA-340, ISO\/IEC 21481, ECMA-352, ISO 14443, and\/or ISO 15693. The NFC interface  may have a range of approximately 2-4 cm. The close range communication with the NFC interface  may take place via magnetic field induction, allowing the NFC interface  to communicate with other NFC interfaces  or to retrieve information from tags having radio frequency identification (RFID) circuitry. As described below, the NFC interface  may enable initiation and\/or facilitation of data transfer of from one electronic device  to another electronic device .","The electronic device  of  may also include a camera . With the camera , the electronic device  may obtain digital images and\/or videos. In combination with optical character recognition (OCR) software, barcode-reading software, or QR-code-reading software running on the electronic device , the camera  may be used to input data from printed materials having text or barcode information.","In addition, in certain embodiments of the electronic device , one or more accelerometers  may be included which sense the movement and\/or orientation of the electronic device . The accelerometers  may provide input or feedback regarding the position of the electronic device  to certain applications running on the CPU . By way of example, the accelerometers  may include a 3-axis accelerometer from ST Microelectronics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIGS. 2-3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","10","40","40"]},"The handheld device  may have an enclosure  of plastic, metal, composite materials, or other suitable materials in any combination. The enclosure  may protect the interior components of the handheld device  from physical damage and electromagnetic interference (EMI). Additionally, the enclosure  may allow certain frequencies of electromagnetic radiation to pass to and\/or from wireless communication circuitry within the handheld device  to facilitate wireless communication.","The display  of the handheld device  may include the user interface  in the form of a GUI, which may have a number of individual icons representing applications that may be activated. The user interface  on the display  of the handheld device  may also include certain status indicator icons , which may indicate the status of various components of the handheld device . For example, the status indicator icons may include a cellular reception meter, an icon to indicate when the PAN interface  is active (e.g., when a Bluetooth\u00ae network is in use), or a battery life meter.","In some embodiments, a transaction management application icon  may be selectable by a user. For example, the display  may serve as a touch-sensitive input device, and icons may be selected by touch. Here, the transaction management application icon  is designated as \u201ceWallet\u201d to indicate to a user that selection of the icon  will allow the user to review and\/or manage financial transactions, such as cardholder-not-present transactions. When the transaction management application icon  is selected, the transaction management application may open, as described further below. The transaction management application may enable a user to review and authorize or decline in-progress and completed cardholder-not-present transactions.","The handheld device  may connect to another electronic device , such as a computer, through the wired I\/O interface . For example, the wired I\/O interface  may be a proprietary connection for coupling the handheld device  to another electronic device  via USB or FireWire\u00ae. Once connected, the devices  may synchronize and\/or transfer certain data, such as card information and\/or transactions, in accordance with techniques discussed herein.","User input structures , , , and  may supplement or replace the touch-sensitive input capability of the display  for interaction with the user interface . By way of example, the user input structures , , , and  may include buttons, switches, a control pad, keys, knobs, a scroll wheel, or any other suitable input structures. The user input structures  and  may work in conjunction with the display  to control functions of the device.

For example, audio structures  may include one or more microphones for receiving voice data from a user and\/or one or more speakers for outputting audio data, such as songs, ringtones, sound tracks associated with videos, voice data received by the handheld device  over a cellular network, and so forth. In addition, an audio structure  may include a speaker for output audio data, such as voice data received by the handheld device  over the cellular network. In certain embodiments, an audio port  may also enable connection of peripheral audio input and output devices, such as headsets, speakers, or microphones, for use with the handheld device .","As noted above, some embodiments of the electronic device  may include the NFC interface . The handheld device  depicted in  may include the NFC interface  in any suitable location within the enclosure . Because the NFC interface  may permit communication at a very short range, the location of the NFC interface  in the handheld device  may be indicated on the exterior of the enclosure , as illustrated in . The NFC interface  may enable the handheld device  to communicate with RFID tags and\/or other NFC-enabled electronic devices . Additionally, the camera  may be located, for example, on the back of the handheld device .","The handheld device  may also include the location sensing circuitry  and\/or the accelerometers . Certain applications running on the handheld device  may obtain information about the location, orientation, and\/or movement of the handheld device from the location sensing circuitry  and\/or the accelerometers . This information may enable applications, such as a transaction management application as discussed herein, to display personalized data or to display data in an innovative manner in response to a user's location and\/or movement.","Another embodiment of the electronic device  of  may be a computer , as illustrated in . The computer  may be any computer, such as a desktop computer, a server, or a notebook computer, but may also be a standalone media player or video gaming machine. By way of example, the computer  may be an iMac\u00ae, a MacBook\u00ae, or an AppleTV\u00ae by Apple Inc. In addition, the computer  may be a personal computer (PC) from another manufacturer. An enclosure  may protect internal components of the computer . Such internal components may include, for example, the CPU , the main memory , the nonvolatile storage , certain network interfaces , and\/or the NFC interface , as illustrated in .","The NFC interface  may permit near field communication between the computer  and other NFC enabled electronic devices , such as the handheld device . Accordingly, the location of the NFC interface  within the enclosure  may be noted by a label on the exterior of the enclosure  to enable positioning of other NFC enabled electronic devices  within the short range of the NFC interface .","The user interface  may be displayed on the display  of the computer  in the form of a GUI. The user interface  may display, for example, user interfaces for applications  running on the computer . Additionally, the user interface  may include a variety of icons related to applications installed on the computer , such as the travel management application icon . When the transaction management application icon  is selected, another version of the transaction management application optimized for the computer  may open. The transaction management application may enable a user to review and approve or cancel cardholder-not-present transactions, as described further herein.","A user may interact with the user interface  via various peripheral input devices, such as a keyboard  and\/or a mouse . Peripherals may connect to the computer , for example, via the wired I\/O interface  and\/or the PAN interface  (e.g., Bluetooth\u00ae). The wired I\/O interface  may also provide a high bandwidth communication channel for coupling other electronic devices , such as the handheld device , to the computer . The computer  may also include the camera .","Turning to , a schematic diagram  illustrates exemplary participants and their relationships in a cardholder-not-present financial transaction. For example, a purchaser  may place an order with a merchant . The merchant  may be, for example, an online vendor, a mail-order company, or any seller who accepts card payments without the card present. For illustrative purposes, the purchaser  may place an order with an online merchant , such as Amazon.com. The purchaser  may select one or more items to purchase and enter payment information. The payment information may be in the form of a credit card, a debit card, a gift card, a store credit, or any other payment form accepted by the merchant . In addition, the payment information may be stored by the merchant , or the purchaser  may enter the information at the time of purchase. If the purchaser  elects to make a purchase with a credit card, for example, the purchaser  may enter a credit card number, expiration date, and a card security code (e.g., card verification value (CVV), card verification value code (CVVC), card verification code (CVC), verification code (V-Code), credit card ID (CCID), and so forth). The card security code may be, for example, printed on the card (e.g., the signature strip or the card face) but not encoded on the card's magnetic stripe. In addition to this card information, the merchant  may request the cardholder's name and billing address for security purposes. However, purchases may generally be shipped to a shipping address which can be different from the billing address associated with the card.","After the purchaser  has chosen items for purchase and entered payment information, the merchant  may forward the payment information and an authorization request to an acquiring bank . Also known as a payment processor, the acquiring bank  is the merchant bank. The acquiring bank  forwards the authorization request to a credit card association  and\/or an issuing bank . The credit card association  and issuing bank  may be a single entity or separate entities. For example, American Express is both a credit card association  and an issuing bank . In contrast, Visa and MasterCard are credit card associations , and they work in cooperation with issuing banks , such as Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and so forth. In the case of separate entities, the credit card association  may receive the authorization request from the acquiring bank  and forward the request to the issuing bank ; in some instances, the acquiring bank  may submit the authorization request directly to the issuing bank . Furthermore, the credit card association  may respond on behalf of the issuing bank  according to conditions agreed upon between the credit card association  the issuing bank .","When the issuing bank  receives an authorization request, the payment information and purchase amount included in the authorization request are analyzed to determine if the account has enough credit to cover the purchase. For example, if an authorization request for $1,920.01 is received from Amazon.com, the issuing bank  may determine the limit on the associated account and\/or the amount of money available in the associated account. If insufficient funds are present, the issuing bank  may decline the transaction in an authorization response to the acquiring bank . The acquiring bank  may then notify the merchant  that the payment has been declined, and the merchant  may prompt the purchaser  to provide correct account information, use a different payment method, or cancel the transaction.","If, upon receiving the authorization request, the issuing bank  determines that sufficient funds are available, the issuing bank  and\/or the credit card association  may then forward the authorization request to a cardholder  for approval or denial. The authorization request may be forwarded to the cardholder  based on a flag on the account, comparison of the account to a database of registered accounts, and so forth. The cardholder  may be, for example, a single account holder, a primary account holder, a joint account holder who has opted to receive cardholder-not-present authorization messages, and so forth. In addition, the cardholder  may be the purchaser . However, if the purchaser  is an authorized or unauthorized account user, the cardholder  and the purchaser  may be different people.","Furthermore, in some embodiments, the issuing bank  and\/or the credit card association  may send the authorization request directly to the cardholder  over a public network infrastructure, such as the Internet or a cellular network. In other embodiments, the issuing bank  may submit the authorization request to the cardholder  through a dedicated network  infrastructure that may not be publicly accessible or may be only partially publicly accessible and which may be available when using the transaction management application on device . The authorization request may be submitted to the cardholder  via the electronic device  (). For example, the authorization request may be sent to the handheld device  () and\/or the computer  (). As will be discussed further below, the authorization request may be presented to the cardholder  via an application, such as a dedicated cardholder-not-present authorization application, a broader financial application (e.g., an eWallet application), or a synchronization application used to maintain a handheld device in sync with user specified preferences and content (e.g., iTunes available from Apple Inc.).","The authorization request to the cardholder  may include, for example, information pertinent to the cardholder's  decision to approve or deny the transaction authorization. For example, in one embodiment, the information may include the transaction amount, the payment method (e.g., the name of the card being used), and the name of the merchant. Additional information which may be included in the authorization request may include, for example, the internet protocol (IP address) of the purchaser , the shipping address for the order, a detailed list of all of the items included in the transaction, and so forth. Based on the provided information, the cardholder  may elect to approve or deny the authorization request. Exemplary techniques for submitting the cardholder's  authorization response are discussed in more detail below.","Additionally, in some embodiments, the credit card association  may send the authorization request directly to the cardholder  and to the issuing bank . The card association  may then apply an AND condition to the responses from the issuing bank  and cardholder . That is, if either the cardholder R the issuing bank  declines the payment, the credit card association  sends a \u201cdeclined\u201d message to the acquiring bank . If the cardholder  does not respond to the request for authorization within a brief predefined period of time, the card association  may evaluate the cardholder's  predefined rules for how missed authorizations should be treated, as described in more detail below. The credit card association  may then approve or decline the transaction accordingly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIGS. 5-7","b":["120","10","62","40","112","10","112","110","108","112","112"]},"Turning to , the illustrated application  may run, for example, on the electronic device , such as the computer  (). A screen  shows the application . In the illustrated embodiment, the application  is iTunes; however, the present techniques may be implemented in other applications. On the screen , a button  may be selected to enable a financial transaction aspect of the application. Upon selection of the button , a screen , illustrated in , may be presented to the user to input card information. The card information may include, for example, a card number, expiration date, card security code, cardholder name, and billing address. Once the requisite information is entered into text entry boxes  and\/or drop-down boxes , the user may select a button  to check if the entered card is eligible to be managed in the application . Accordingly, by entering the card information and selecting the button , the application  may send a request to determine if the credit card association  and\/or the issuing bank  associated with the entered card information enables account management using the present techniques. In one embodiment, the request may be sent directly to the credit card association  and\/or the issuing bank ; in another embodiment, the request may be sent to a third party with a list of eligible credit card associations  and\/or issuing banks . For example, in the case where the application  is iTunes, Apple Inc. or a third party may maintain a list of credit card associations  and\/or issuing banks  which participate in account management using the present techniques.","The user may then be notified of whether or not the account associated with entered card information is eligible for management via the present techniques, such as on an exemplary screen , illustrated in . In addition, the user may be able to enter a nickname for the entered card in a text entry box . In some embodiments, the user may also be able to specify or direct that account management be activated on another device , such as the handheld electronic device , which may be synchronized via the application . Such synchronization may be enabled by selection of a button .","Turning now to , an exemplary application  which may be used for account management, such as remote authorization of cardholder-not-present transactions, is illustrated. In the illustrated embodiment, the application  is implemented on the handheld device ; however, similar applications may be implemented on various electronic devices, including the computer . For example,  shows a screen  which lists a number of accounts  which may be managed via the handheld device . In the illustrated embodiment, each account  may be identified by an image , a nickname , and account identification information. In addition, a balance  associated with the account may be displayed for quick reference. Further, an indicator  may show how many messages and\/or offers are associated with the account. The messages may include, for example, cardholder-not-present authorization requests, as described in more detail below.","In some embodiments, cardholder-not-present authorization may be automatically activated upon entering the card information and verifying that the card is eligible for account management via the present techniques (). In another embodiment, illustrated in , the cardholder  () may activate real-time approval of cardholder-not-present transactions on a settings screen . As illustrated, in one implementation the real-time approval of cardholder-not-present transactions may be turned on or off by merely sliding a virtual selector  on the screen . The option to activate cardholder-not-present authorization may be present on the screen  if it is determined that the issuing bank  and\/or the credit card association  associated with the selected account  has the necessary messaging capabilities, as described in more detail below. In one embodiment, that determination may be made by the issuing bank  and\/or the credit card association  and communicated directly to the handheld device . In another embodiment, the determination may be communicated to a server maintained by a third party, such as Apple Inc., and the third party may in turn communicate with the handheld device . Communication between the issuing bank  and\/or the credit card association  and the third party and\/or the handheld device  may occur through an Application Programming Interface defined by the third party or the handheld device's  software. The ability to enable and disable cardholder-not-present authorization via the handheld device  may be particularly useful, for example, when the cardholder  will not be accessible for an extended period of time (e.g., during a movie or while on a flight). In addition, default authorization responses may be set by selecting a missed authorizations button  on the screen .","The default authorization responses may be configured via a missed authorizations screen , as illustrated in . For example, the cardholder  may choose to automatically or provisionally approve all transactions if an authorization request is not responded to within a set period of time by selecting a button . Other options may include automatically denying all transactions (button ); automatically approving transactions under a certain value and denying transactions over that value (button ); automatically approving or denying transactions from certain merchants (buttons  and , respectively); and so forth.","Additional setting options may be requested based on the missed authorizations setting selected on the screen . For example, if the cardholder  selects to approve transactions below a certain value and deny transactions over that value, the desired threshold value may be entered via a screen , illustrated in . The desired threshold value may be entered into a text entry box  via a virtual keypad . In some embodiments, the threshold value may the value above which transactions will be automatically denied; in other embodiments, the value may be the value below which transactions will be automatically approved. In addition, the approval or denial range may be inclusive or exclusive of the threshold value.","In another example of additional settings being entered, the cardholder  may specify certain merchants  for whom transactions should be automatically approved or denied if an authorization request is missed. For example, if the cardholder  selects button  () to approve missed authorizations from certain merchants, a merchant entry screen  may be presented, as illustrated in . In the illustrated embodiment, the user may enter a merchant name or standard industrial classification (SIC) code in a text entry box  via a virtual keyboard . In order to improve the accuracy of data entry, a list  of known merchants  based on prior purchases and\/or popular merchants may be searched based on the entered text. The cardholder  may then select the merchant's  name or SIC code from the list . In another embodiment, the cardholder  may directly enter the merchant name, and automatic approval\/denial of missed authorizations may be based on a comparison of the entered name to the requesting merchant's name. In addition, the cardholder  may be presented with an option to enter the merchant's name if the search does not return the desired results.","Once the cardholder  has selected a merchant  from the list  or entered the merchant's name directly, the user may be presented with a confirmation screen , as illustrated in . The confirmation screen  may prompt the cardholder  to confirm or cancel the automatic approval\/denial of missed authorizations from a particular merchant . If the cardholder  chooses to confirm the setting, a yes button  may be selected; to cancel the setting, a no button  may be selected. While  are illustrated in terms of automatic or provisional approval of specific merchants , similar screens may be used to set merchants  for whom missed authorizations are to be automatically denied. In addition, additional automatic responses may be selected, or a combination of multiple responses may be configured. For example, the cardholder  may choose to automatically authorize all missed transactions under a certain value unless the authorization request is from a particular merchant or merchants .","The missed authorization settings may be configured as described above and stored locally on the electronic device . In addition, or alternatively, the settings may be stored at an issuing bank , a credit card association , or at another site on a network, such as network , over which transaction and\/or authorization communications travel. For example, the settings may be stored on a server or database at the issuing bank , the credit card association , or the network  where they may be queried and\/or implemented in responding to authorization requests from a merchant or acquiring bank. In such an embodiment, if the cardholder  configures the missed authorization settings on the electronic device , those settings may be automatically uploaded to the a database and\/or server at one or more of the issuing bank , the credit card association , or the network  so that the settings on the electronic device  and the upload location are consistent. In this manner, if an authorization request is sent to the cardholder  while the electronic device  is powered off, the automatic response settings may still be put into effect based on the uploaded settings at the issuing bank , the credit card association , and\/or on a server or database on a network .","After cardholder-not-present authorization has been activated and configured for a given card, the cardholder  may be notified and asked to approve or decline a cardholder-not-present transaction. This authorization request may be, for example, via the application , the application , and\/or an additional application. It should be noted that the transaction authorization application may be running on the electronic device  whenever the device is powered on (e.g., the application may run in the background). The authorization request may then be \u201cpushed\u201d to the application in real-time rather than being retrieved only when the cardholder  downloads transaction information. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , the authorization request may be submitted to the cardholder  on the handheld device , although the request may also, or instead, be transmitted via the computer .","As illustrated in , the cardholder  may be notified of an authorization request by a pop-up box . In some embodiments, the pop-up box  may be accompanied by a sound emitted from the audio structure  () and\/or a vibration of the handheld device . In addition, the sound may be customizable such that it is distinguishable from a text message (e.g., via short message service (SMS)). The cardholder  may activate the handheld device  by moving a virtual slider . In some embodiments, a passcode (e.g., a personal identification number (PIN)) may also be entered before the handheld device  is activated.","In certain embodiments, after the handheld device  is activated, a home screen  may be presented, as illustrated in . The home screen  may include the transaction management application icon . Because an authorization request has been transmitted, the transaction management application icon  may include an integrated notification icon  to indicate that one or more authorization requests have been received. The user may select the transaction management application icon  to access an authorization screen , as illustrated in . The authorization screen  may include information pertinent to the transaction, such as an indicator  of the card being used, the transaction amount , and the merchant .","In addition, the authorization screen  may include a countdown timer  illustrating the time remaining for the cardholder  to approve or decline the transaction before automatic action is taken, such as by the issuing bank  and\/or the credit card association  or by the electronic device  itself. The automatic action may be determined as described above in reference to  and may be based upon rules established by the issuing bank  and\/or the credit card association , by rules uploaded and stored at one or more of these entities by the cardholder, and\/or by rules stored on the electronic device . The cardholder  may approve the transaction request by selecting a button  or decline the request by selecting a button . Upon selecting the button  or , the cardholder  may be prompted to confirm the selection, or the authorization response may be transmitted immediately.","As described above, the cardholder  may have a limited time period in which to approve or deny an authorization request for a cardholder-not-present transaction. This time period may be determined by the merchant , the credit card association , the issuing bank , the cardholder , or a combination thereof. The time period may generally be short enough to enable the merchant  to approve or deny the purchaser's  order almost immediately. For example, the time period may be approximately 20 seconds so that the entire authorization request and response process () may be performed in less than a minute. In other embodiments, where response time is not an issue, or where the merchant  is capable of receiving a \u201ccustomer decline\u201d message even after receiving an approval code from the issuing bank  and\/or the credit card association , the time period may be longer, such as between about 5 minutes to about 2 hours.","In certain embodiments, the cardholder  may be given an additional time period after an automatically approved missed authorization request to flag the transaction as unauthorized. This additional time period may be determined with significant input from, and agreement with, the merchant . Generally, the additional time period may be determined based on two competing factors, i.e., fraud prevention and timely shipment of purchased items. That is, the longer the additional time period in which the cardholder  may flag an authorization, the greater the opportunity to halt a shipment that the cardholder  identifies as fraudulent; whereas the shorter the additional time period, the faster the merchant  may move product and recognize revenue. The additional time period may be based on the minimum amount of time between when the merchant  receives an authorization for a sale and when the finished goods are shipped or services are performed. For example, if the merchant  generally does not ship an item within two hours of receiving an authorization for a sale, the additional time period may be two hours or less. If the merchant  has the ability to recall a shipped item in transit, it may be beneficial to increase this additional time period for flagging the transaction up to several days. In other embodiments, rules may be defined that, for example, allow for shorter additional time periods for transactions with a lower dollar value or lower risk, and longer additional time periods for transactions with a higher dollar value or higher risk.","The cardholder  may be notified of the option to flag an approved authorization by a message  on the authorization screen . Accordingly, if an authorization request is automatically or provisionally approved while the cardholder  is inaccessible, the transaction may still be flagged and\/or cancelled within a certain time period after the automatic approval. The automatically approved transaction may be accessed, for example, via a transaction summary screen , as illustrated in . The transaction summary screen  may include a list of recent transactions, including automatically approved cardholder-not-present transactions . Such transactions may be indicated by a countdown timer  illustrating the time remaining for the cardholder  to flag an automatically approved authorization request as unauthorized. Additionally, the transactions may be filtered such that only missed authorizations  are shown, for example, by selecting a button . An arrow  may indicate if the transaction information includes additional details.","The cardholder  may access a transaction flag screen , illustrated in , by selecting the countdown timer  associated with the desired missed authorization  (). As illustrated in , the transaction flag screen  may prompt the cardholder  to select whether to flag a missed authorization as unauthorized. By selecting a button , the cardholder  flags the transaction as unauthorized, thereby notifying the merchant , the credit card association , and\/or the issuing bank  that unauthorized activity has occurred on the card. The merchant  may cancel or recall the order to prevent loss. In addition, the credit card association , and\/or the issuing bank  may flag the account to notify other merchants  that the card may be compromised. If the transaction was properly authorized, the cardholder  may select a button  to end the countdown period for flagging the automatically approved transaction. The time remaining in the countdown period may be indicated by a countdown timer .","Returning to , as indicated above, the cardholder  may view further details of a transaction if the arrow  indicates that additional information is available. The cardholder  may select the arrow  to open a transaction detail screen , as illustrated in . The transaction detail screen  may include line item details  indicating the items purchased in the transaction and the price of each item. This information may be useful to the cardholder  to determine whether an authorization request should be approved, denied, or flagged.","While the invention may be susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and have been described in detail herein.
