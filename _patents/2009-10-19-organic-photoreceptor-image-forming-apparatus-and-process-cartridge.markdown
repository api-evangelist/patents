{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-271612 filed on Oct. 22, 2008, which is incorporated hereinto by reference.","The present invention relates to an organic photoreceptor used for an electrophotographic image forming apparatus and so forth, and to an image forming apparatus fitted with the organic photoreceptor and a process cartridge thereof.","In recent years, high image quality of electrophotographic image forming apparatuses has increasingly been demanded.","As to an apparatus for image formation, a method by which a digital method is employed, writing in the digital method is conducted by using a light source typified by semiconductor laser, and an image is obtained via reverse development becomes mainstream.","Since a semiconductor laser source exhibits coherency, reflected light from the layer interface of a photoreceptor and from a substrate causes complicated interference, whereby there appears a problem such that image defects referred to as so-called moire are generated.","Correspondingly, various techniques to improve the photoreceptor have been investigated so far.","For example, there are a method of cutting the surface of a conductive substrate with a bite, and a method of conducting a blast treatment for roughening the surface to appropriately scatter light, but there appears problems such that in the former case, burr is produced during a cutting work, resulting in generation of image defects, and in the latter case, impurities are penetrated into the substrate via the blast treatment, resulting in generation of image defects.","In this case, a technique by which metal oxide particles typified by titanium dioxide particles are dispersed and contained in an intermediate layer of the photoreceptor to scatter light appropriately in a subbing layer has been actively studied (refer to Patent Documents 1 and 2). However, when the titanium dioxide content is increased in order to improve moire resistance, produced is a problem such that titanium dioxide particles are partially coagulated in the intermediate layer, and a bridging structure is formed in the layer, whereby leakage of charge through the above-described portion is generated in the case of application to the photoreceptor. In order to solve this problem, the surface of titanium dioxide is subjected to an organic or inorganic treatment to increase electrical resistance, and a binder resin in the intermediate layer is designed to be set to high resistance, but results obtained via these trials are still insufficient. Accordingly, reduction of moire resistance and black spot defects has not still been satisfied at the same time in the case of an electrophotographic photoreceptor used in an image forming apparatus fitted with an inherent light source, resulting in a big problem to be solved.","(Patent Document 1) Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 4-303846","(Patent Document 2) Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 8-328283","The present invention has been made on the basis of the above-described situation, and it is an object of the present invention not only to provide an organic photoreceptor exhibiting extremely high moire resistance, but also to provide an organic photoreceptor capable of acquiring a high quality image to realize no generation of image defects such as black spots or the like.","After considerable effort during intensive studies, the inventor has found out that to contain inorganic particles exhibiting excellent scattering caused by coherent laser light or the like in an intermediate layer of an organic photoreceptor is extremely effective as an object of the present invention, and has accomplished the present invention. The present invention is accomplished by the following structures.","(Structure 1) An organic photoreceptor comprising a conductive support and layered thereon, an intermediate layer, a charge generation layer and a charge transport layer in this order, wherein the intermediate layer comprises porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated.","(Structure 2) The organic photoreceptor of Structure 1, wherein the metal oxide comprises at least one selected from the group consisting of a titanium dioxide particle, an alumina particle, a zinc oxide particle and a tin oxide particle.","(Structure 3) An image forming apparatus to repeatedly conduct image formation, comprising an organic photoreceptor and provided thereabout, a charging device, an exposure device equipped with a coherent light source and a reversal development device, wherein the organic photoreceptor comprises the organic photoreceptor of Structure 1 or 2.","(Structure 4) A process cartridge for the image forming apparatus of Structure 3, comprising at least one of a charging device, an image exposure light source and a developing device, integrally supported with the organic photoreceptor of Structure 1 or 2, the process cartridge removable from the image forming apparatus.","While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described using specific terms, such description is for illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood that changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims.","It is a feature that an organic photoreceptor of the present invention possesses a conductive support and layered thereon, at least an intermediate layer, a charge generation layer and a charge transport layer in this order, wherein the intermediate layer comprises porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated.","An organic photoreceptor of the present invention is capable of not only exhibiting high moire resistance, but also acquiring a high quality image with no generation of image defects such as black spots or the like.","Next, the configuration of the organic photoreceptor in the present invention will be described in detail.","[Porous Silica in which Metal Oxide is Encapsulated in the Present Invention]","The porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated, which is used in the present invention, is composed of an outer wall formed of porous silica and metal oxide encapsulated in a core portion on which the outer wall is provided as a shell. \u201cEncapsulation\u201d described herein means a state of being encapsulated by an outer wall formed of porous silica, and the core portion is not necessary to be entirely sealed. The porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated has a number average primary particle diameter of 0.05-1.0 \u03bcm.","(Metal Oxide)","Examples of metal oxide used in the present invention to form metal oxide particles include silicon oxide, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, lead oxide, aluminum oxide, tantalum oxide, indium oxide, bismuth oxide, yttrium oxide, cobalt oxide, copper oxide, manganese oxide, selenium oxide, iron oxide, zirconium oxide, germanium oxide, tin oxide, titanium dioxide, niobium oxide, molybdenum oxide, vanadium oxide and so forth. However, the metal oxide is preferably a material different from silica (silicon oxide) to form the outer wall. Specifically, metal oxide particles made of titanium dioxide, aluminum, zinc oxide, tin oxide and so forth are preferable. Of these, titanium dioxide is specifically preferable in view of prevention of moire. In the case of titanium dioxide, one having a rutile type crystalline structure is preferable.","Further, metal oxide used in the present invention is preferably prepared by commonly known conventional manufacturing methods such as a vapor deposition method, a chlorine method, a sulfuric acid method, a plasma method, an electrolytic method and so forth.","Metal oxide used in the present invention preferably has a number average primary particle diameter of 1-400 nm, and more preferably has a number average primary particle diameter of 20-300 nm.","As to the porous silica in which the above-described metal oxide is encapsulated, and a number average primary particle diameter of metal oxide particles, an enlarged micrograph was photographed at a magnification of 10000 times employing a scanning electron microscope (manufactured by JEOL Ltd.), and conducted was analysis of the photographic image in which 300 particles are taken at random by a scanner employing an automatic image processing analyzer (LUZEX AP, manufactured by Nireco Corporation) fitted with software version Ver. 1.32 to determine a number average primary particle diameter.","The content of metal oxide in porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated in the present invention is preferably 20-300 parts by weight, and is more preferably 40-200 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the porous silica.","The above-described metal oxide may be subjected to a surface modification treatment. Those which are commonly known are usable as the surface modifier, and specifically usable examples thereof include a silane coupling agent, a titanium coupling agent, an aluminum coupling agent and so forth.","(Porous Silica)","Porous material is a material having a number of fine pores, and the pores have regular shape or irregular shape caused by compression and fluidity in the formation process. Silica having the outer wall formed of such the material is porous silica of the present invention. The fine pore preferably has a particle of 1-300 nm, and more preferably has a particle of 10-100 nm. When the fine pore diameter falls within this range, not only a degree of dispersion becomes high, but also holding capability for metal oxide becomes high. Further, the BET specific surface area is preferably at least 400 m\/g, and more preferably at least 650 m\/g. The porous silica of the present invention may be silica having the above-described configuration. As a method of forming porous silica, commonly known methods can be utilized, but the following method is preferably usable in view of an easy encapsulation of metal oxide and easy formation of porous silica. The porous silica to form the outer wall is formed as porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated, as described in a method of preparing porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated in  shown below, by using matter in the form of liquid, called sodium silicate (water glass), in which silicic acid anhydride (SiO) and sodium oxide (NaO) are mixed in any ratio.","Water glass tends to have 20-40% of SiOin molar ratio, and typical examples of the water glass specified as water glass No. 1, water glass No. 2, water glass No. 3 or the like in accordance with Japanese Industrial standards (JIS K 1408).","{Method of Manufacturing Porous Silica in which Metal Oxide (Titanium Dioxide) is Encapsulated}","Though this is not specifically limited, titanium dioxide having a number average primary particle diameter of roughly 1-100 nm is added and mixed in an organic solvent in which a dispersing agent such as polyoxyethylene laurylether or the like, for example, is mixed, and the system is stirred, followed by further sufficiently stirring to prepare a dispersed suspension.","Next, the above-described dispersed suspension is added into water glass No. 1 to prepare O\/W type (oil-in-water type) emulsion. Numeral  represents water glass, and numeral  represents an oil droplet of an organic solvent in which titanium dioxide is dispersed (refer to A of ). This emulsion solution is charged in organic solvent  in which a dispersing agent such as polyoxyethylene laurylether or the like is added, followed by stirring again at high speed (refer to B of ). By doing this, an O\/W\/O type (oil-in-water-in-oil type) emulsion solution, in which first oil phase (O) as the innermost phase, second oil phase (O) as the outermost phase and water phase (W) as the intermediate phase are double-phase-emulsified, is prepared; a precipitant such as ammonium sulfate or the like is added for precipitation; and particles to be formed are separated via filtration, followed by washing, drying and heating to form the titanium dioxide particle encapsulated by outer wall  formed of porous silica, since the organic solvent inside the porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated is also volatilized (refer to C of ).","Intermediate Layer","In the present invention, an intermediate layer containing porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated as described before is provided between a conductive support and a photosensitive layer.","Porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated in the present invention is used in an intermediate layer, and use of the porous silica enhances light scattering performance in the intermediate layer, whereby generation of moire can be more effectively inhibited. It is for this reason that presumably, light is scattered not only on the silica particle surface, but also on the surface of metal oxide encapsulated inside or the porosity interface in the inside of a particle. By using porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated in the present invention in an intermediate layer, coagulation of porous silica or uneven region is difficult to be generated in an intermediate layer though increasing thickness of the intermediate layer, since dispersibility of porous silica in an intermediate layer coating solution is excellent, whereby generation of black spots is effectively prevented, and rise of residual potential becomes difficult to be generated, resulting in formation of an excellent organic photoreceptor.","The intermediate layer coating solution prepared for forming an intermediate layer of the present invention is composed of a binder resin and a dispersing solvent other than porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated as described before.","As to a ratio of porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated in an intermediate layer, a weight ratio of the porous silica to the binder resin contained in the intermediate layer is preferably 3.0-20 times (when weight of the binder resin is set to 1). By using porous silica in which metal oxide is encapsulated in the present invention in the intermediate layer, which exhibits high density, use of the porous silica enhances light scattering performance in the intermediate layer, whereby generation of moire can be more effectively inhibited.","On the other hand, as a binder resin to disperse these particles and form a layer structure of the intermediate layer, a polyamide resin is preferable in order to obtain excellent dispersibility of particles, but the following polyamide resins are specifically preferable.","As a binder resin used for the intermediate layer, an alcohol-soluble polyamide resin is preferable. As a binder resin used for the intermediate layer in the photoreceptor, a resin exhibiting excellent solvent solubility is desired to form an intermediate layer having a uniform thickness. As such the alcohol-soluble polyamide resin, known is a copolymerized polyamide resin or a methoxy-methylated polyamide resin composed of a chemical structure having not so many carbon chains between amide bonds such as the foregoing 6-nylon or the like, but the following polyamides other than these are preferably usable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"204.47mm","wi":"75.27mm","file":"US08236468-20120807-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"43.01mm","wi":"75.27mm","file":"US08236468-20120807-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"Further, the above-described polyamide resin preferably has a number average molecular weight of 5,000-80,000, and more preferably has a number average molecular weight of 10,000-60,000. In the case of a number average molecular weight of 5,000 or less, evenness in thickness of the intermediate layer is degraded, whereby the effect of the present invention is not sufficiently produced. On the other hand, in the case of a number average molecular weight of at least 80,000, solvent solubility of a resin is degraded, and a coagulated resin is easy to be produced in the intermediate layer, whereby generation of black spots and degradation of dot images are easy to be produced.","A part of the above-described polyamide resin has been commercially available, for example, under the trade name of VESTAMELT X1010, X4685 or the like, produced by Daicel-Degussa Ltd. They can be prepared by a commonly known method of synthesizing polyamide, but one synthesizing example is described below.","As a solvent to dissolve the above-described polyamide resin to prepare a coating solution, alcohol having 2-4 carbon atoms such as ethanol, n-propyl alcohol, iso-propyl alcohol, n-butanol, t-butanol, sec-butanol or the like is preferable in view of solubility of polyamide and coatability of the coating solution. The solvent in the total solvent has a content of 30-100% by weight, preferably has a content of 40-100% by weight, and more preferably has a content of 50-100% by weight. Examples of the auxiliary solvent to produce a favorable effect in combination with the foregoing solvent include methanol, benzyl alcohol, toluene, methylene chloride, cyclohexanone, tetrahydrofuran and so forth.","The intermediate layer preferably has a thickness of 0.5-15 \u03bcm. When the intermediate layer has a thickness of less than 0.5 \u03bcm, black spots and so forth are easy to be generated, whereby degradation of the image caused by moire is easy to be produced. When the intermediate layer has a thickness exceeding 15 \u03bcm, rise in residual potential is easy to be generated. The intermediate layer more preferably has a thickness of 0.5-5 \u03bcm.","It is also preferable that the intermediate layer is substantially an insulating layer. Herein, the insulating layer means a layer having a volume resistance of at least 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm. The intermediate layer as well as the protective layer preferably has a volume resistance of 1\u00d710-1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm, more preferably has a volume resistance of 1\u00d710-1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm, and still more preferably has a volume resistance of 2\u00d710-1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm. The volume resistance can be measured as described below.","The measurement conditions: in accordance with C2318-1975.","Measuring device: HIRESTA IP manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation","Measuring probe: Measuring probe HRS","Applied voltage: 500 V","Measuring environment: 30\u00b12\u00b0 C., 80\u00b15 RH % In the case of a volume resistance of less than 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm, a charge blocking property of the intermediate layer is lowered, generation of black spots is increased, and a potential holding property of the organic photoreceptor is deteriorated, whereby no good image quality can be obtained. On the other hand, in the case of a volume resistance exceeding 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm, the residual potential in repetitive image formation is easy to be increased, whereby no good image quality can be obtained.","Next, the configuration of an organic photoreceptor of the present invention possessing the above-described intermediate layer will be described in detail.","In the present invention, the organic photoreceptor refers to as an electrophotographic photoreceptor equipped with at least one of a charge generation function essential to the configuration of the electrophotographic photoreceptor, and a charge transport function.

When the straightness and the swing width exceed the above-described ranges, good images are difficult to be formed.","As to the conductive material, a metal drum made of aluminum, nickel or the like, a plastic drum on which aluminum, tin oxide, indium oxide or the like is evaporated, and a paper or plastic drum on which a conductive material is coated are usable. The conductive support preferably has a specific resistance of 10\u03a9cm or less at room temperature. The conductive support of the present invention is most preferably an aluminum support.

By taking the structure in which the function is separated, increase in residual potential caused by repetitive use can be controlled and minimized, and another electrophotographic property is easily controlled so as to suit the objective. In the case of a negatively charging photoreceptor, preferable is a configuration in which charge generation layer (CGL) is provided on an intermediate layer, and charge transport layer is provided thereon.","The photosensitive configuration of a function separation negatively charging photoreceptor will be described.","Charge Generation Layer","Examples of the charge generation material usable for the organic photoreceptor of the present invention include commonly known charge generation materials such as a phthalocyanine pigment, an azo pigment, a perylene pigment, a polycyclic quinine pigment and so forth.

Further, photoreceptors  and  were prepared similarly to preparation of photoreceptor , except that porous silica (KS-1), in which metal oxide was encapsulated, in an intermediate layer was replaced by titanium dioxide  and titanium dioxide  as shown in Table 1, respectively.","{Evaluation 1}","A photoreceptor obtained as described above was installed in a remodeled machine of a commercially available full-color composite copier bizhub PRO C6500 (manufactured by Konica Minolta Business Technologies, Inc.) having a configuration shown in , which is capable of varying a writing dot diameter thereof, and then the exposure light diameter in the main scanning direction of the writing light source was 30 \u03bcm at 1200 dpi by using a laser light source having a wavelength of 780 nm as a setting of an image exposure light source. The setting was made in such a way that the spot exposure of the exposure light diameter was set at 0.5 mW on the photoreceptor surface. In addition, since the above-described full-color composite copier possesses four sets of image forming units, photoreceptors in each of the image forming units are unified with the same kind of photoreceptors (for example, four pieces of photoreceptor  arranged in the case of photoreceptor ) to make evaluations. Each evaluation was made at 30\u00b0 C. and 80 RH %.","Evaluation Items and Evaluation Criteria","Moire (Evaluated in Black-White Image)","Halftone images were printed on A4 size paper sheets to make evaluation based on the following criteria.","5: Interference fringe is seen only in less than 1% of the halftone image area. (Excellent)","4: Interference fringe is generated in 1-5% of an A4 size paper sheet area. (Comparatively good)","3: Interference fringe is generated in 6-10% of an A4 size paper sheet area. (with no practical problem)","2: Interference fringe is generated in 11-30% of an A4 size paper sheet area.

(with a practical problem)","0: Interference fringe is generated in at least 51% of an A4 size paper sheet area. (with a practical problem)","Black Spots (Evaluated in Black-White Image)","Visualized black spots or image defects in the form of black streaks in which the periodicity coincides with the photoreceptor cycle were determined by the number per A4 size. Ten black-white images were printed on the A4 size paper sheet to make evaluations based on the following criteria.","A: Frequency of the image defect of at least 0.4 mm; all the printed images exhibiting not more than 5 per A4 size. (Excellent)","B: Frequency of the image defect of at least 0.4 mm; at least one printed image exhibiting at least 6 and not more than 10 per A4 size.
