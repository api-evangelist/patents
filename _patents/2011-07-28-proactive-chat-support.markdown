{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Most business and personal users depend heavily upon both client and web-based applications. For example, businesses are typically required to follow strict payroll laws and regulations. As a result, many businesses utilize payroll processing software in order to perform periodic payroll processing. Developers of such applications are required to keep pace with changing laws and regulations in order ensure that users are maintaining compliance. Developers may provide software updates to the users of a software application in order to implement changes to the application after release.","Many of the aforementioned software applications involve complex financial calculations and require a significant time investment by the user. Due to the sensitive nature of these calculations and the potential nuances of changing government requirements and regulations, users may require varying levels of support from software providers. The complexity and cost associated with providing such support can be significant, depending on the application and the user.","On the other hand, for software providers, support can be a leading source of revenue. Accordingly, it is in the interest of software providers to improve the efficiency of their support offering and to focus heavily on usability in their design. Thus, users of both client and web-based applications will be less likely to consume costly support resources. Innovations such as web-based chat have already contributed to increasing the efficiency of support resources for web-based applications. Conversely, client applications have had limited advancement in terms of support.","In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a method for providing online support to a user of a client application.

Like elements in the various figures are denoted by like reference numerals for consistency.","In the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.","In general, embodiments of the invention provide a method and system for providing support to a user of a client application. In general, embodiments of the invention display one or more dialogs to a user. Based on the user's interaction with the dialog(s), a determination is made that the user requires assistance. In response to the determination, a chat session is initiated between the user and an available support specialist.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["199","199","110","100","102","104","106","199","115","199","106","102"]},"The client computing device () may be a personal computer (PC), a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a nettop computer, a netbook computer, a tablet computer, a handheld computer, a mobile internet device (MID), an ultra-mobile personal computer (UMPC), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a smartphone, and\/or any other computing device capable of executing an application.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the client application () is a software application executing on the client computing device. Examples of a software application may include, but are not limited to, a payroll application, a financial management application, a tax preparation application, a medical billing application, a travel and expense application, a web application displayed in a web browser, and\/or any software application in accordance with various embodiments of the invention. The software application may be an interview-based application and\/or a financial application (i.e., any application involving one or more financial amounts). An interview-based application may include one or more interviews designed to obtain information from a user of the application through a series of related dialogs. An interview may be any series of input requests associated with a common task, which are obtained from a user. Thus, the interview may include pages on a web site and\/or dialogs displayed in a wizard.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the client application () includes functionality to display a dialog to a user. The dialog may be a user interface window configured to obtain input from or display information to the user. The dialog may be a modal dialog or a modeless dialog or may be a component on a web page displayed in a web browser.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the client application () includes functionality to display a wizard to a user. The wizard may be any series of dialogs displayed sequentially for the purpose of completing a task. Examples of a task may include, but are not limited to, setup of a business payroll account, completion of a tax form, entry of tax preparation information related to a tax topic (i.e., deductions, credits, personal income, business income, investments, education expenses, etc.), setup of an expense system, completion of a medical billing claim, completion of a payroll process for a pay period, and any task capable of being completed by a wizard.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user support module () includes functionality to identify a help threshold associated with a dialog. The help threshold may be an indication that the user requires assistance in completing the task. The help threshold may include any criteria for determining that the user requires help. For example, the help threshold may include a time interval associated with completion of a task, a change of focus between one or more fields, a change of focus between one or more dialogs, and\/or a number of additions, deletions, and\/or modifications of elements in one or more fields by the user. In one or more embodiments of the invention, a timer tracking the time interval is started upon opening of the wizard\/page or upon detection of a predefined event (e.g., user entry into one or more fields, change of focus, etc.). The time may be stopped when a window of the client application () loses focus and may be restarted when the window regains focus.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user support module () includes functionality to determine whether a network connection (e.g., an internet connection) is available. The user support module () may be configured to poll for internet connectivity by performing a periodic check for internet access. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user support module () disables proactive help functionality upon determining that internet connectivity is not available. The user support module () may be configured to enable proactive help functionality if it is determined that internet connectivity is available. Enabling proactive help functionality may include enabling one or more help thresholds.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user support module () includes functionality to determine that a help threshold is exceeded The help threshold may define any criteria or condition associated with the user support module () which must be met in order for the help threshold to be exceeded. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user support module () is configured to enable the help threshold in response to determining that a network connection is available. Once the help threshold is enabled, the user support module () may begin analyzing the user's usage of the client application () or a portion thereof in order to determine whether the help threshold is exceeded. For example, a help threshold may define a time interval associated with a moving window of three dialogs in a wizard. The help threshold may be defined such that, if the user fails to complete any three sequential dialogs in the wizard within the time interval, the threshold is exceeded. In another example, a help threshold may be defined such that, if the user maintains continuous focus on a field within a dialog for a given time interval, the help threshold is exceeded.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the help threshold specifies a change of focus in a wizard. For example, if a user shifts focus backwards (i.e., to a preceding dialog) more than once within a 20 second time interval, the user support module () may determine that a help threshold is exceeded. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the help threshold specifies one or more entries to a dialog and\/or field. The user support module () may perform a comparison of the entries defined by the help threshold with one or more user entries to a field or dialog. Based on the comparison, the user support module () may determine that the help threshold is exceeded. For example, the user support module () may compare an amount in a dialog of a tax preparation application to a criterion defined by a help threshold. In this example, the criterion may be an improbable or unlikely number, such as any gross income amount greater than $1,000,000. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the help threshold criterion includes a mathematical formula for satisfying a condition defined by the help threshold. For example, the help threshold may require that a user's tax amount be greater than or equal to 10% of their adjusted gross income. In this example, the user support module () identifies a tax amount in a first field of a dialog and an adjusted gross income in a second field of the dialog. The user support module () then calculates the user's tax percentage as tax amount divided by gross income. The user support module () determines, based on the tax percentage being less than 10%, that the help threshold is exceeded.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the help threshold specifies two or more related entries by a user. The help threshold may require that the entries be identical or similar (e.g., within a predefined numerical range, having a number of matching characters, etc.). In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user support module () is configured to determine that the help threshold is exceeded if the entries differ or if the difference between the entries exceeds a predefined range or criterion. For example, the user support module () may identify three gross income amount fields in a tax preparation application. In this example, the user support module () compares the gross income amounts based on a help threshold. The help threshold requires that the gross income amounts be within a range of plus or minus 10% year over year (YOY). In this example, the user support module () determines that the gross income amounts are $40,000 (2008), $42,000 (2009), and 48,000 (2010). The user support module () calculates the YOY difference between the gross income amounts based on the following formula: YOY=(Year2\u2212Year1)\/Year1. The user support module () calculates that the 2009 to 2010 growth was (48,000\u221242,000)\/42,000=0.1428 or 14.28%. The user support module () determines that, because the YOY increase is greater than 10%, the help threshold is exceeded.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the help threshold is based on a user request for help. The help threshold may include a number of help requests, a time interval spent browsing help, a help search string, help feedback from the user, one or more help topics, and\/or any help related information. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user support module () is configured to determine that the help threshold is exceeded if one or more of these criteria are met. For example, the user support module () may receive a help criterion specifying that, if a user requests help at least 2 times within any 5 minute time interval, the help criterion is exceeded. In another example, the user support module () may receive a help criterion defining a regular expression string. In this example, the user support module () evaluates the regular expression string against each search string entered by the user into a help utility of the client application (). If the regular expression matches a user search string, the user support module () determines that the help threshold is exceeded. In yet another example, the help threshold may identify one or more help topics. In this example, the user support module () is configured to determine whether the user has accessed one or more help items associated with the help topics. If the user did access help topics matching the help topics, the user support module () determines that the help threshold is exceeded.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the help threshold specifies one or more criteria for identifying errors. The user support module () may be configured to detect errors within a user's input. Examples of an error may include, but are not limited to, a negative number in a positive only field, a sum of percentages which exceeds one hundred percent, a missing entry in a required field, an invalid number which exceeds a predefined range (e.g., number of dependants in a tax return), a string entry which fails to match another string entry (based on a matching criterion), and\/or any other user error in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user support module () includes functionality to send an availability request to the support server (). The availability request may be a request to the support server for confirmation of an available support specialist. The request may be sent according to any protocol for communicating between programs and\/or across a network. The availability request may include one or more client data items. Examples of client data items may include, but are not limited to a screenshot of the client application (), a help topic accessed by the user, a task associated with a wizard or dialog being displayed, a sequence of accessed dialogs\/fields, a help threshold which has been exceeded, user account information, and\/or any other information associated with the user or the client application ().","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user support module () includes functionality to receive a confirmation of an available support specialist. The user support module () may be configured to receive confirmation of one or more available support specialists from the support server (). Alternatively, the user support module () may be configured to receive the confirmation directly from a user through a user interface or from any other source (e.g., a third party software application). Support specialists may be able to log into a software application which then transmits availability information to the support server ().","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user support module () includes functionality to display an indication to the user that support is available. The indication may be any visible element displayed on a display screen of the client computing device (). Examples of an indication may include, but are not limited to a tooltip, a popup window, a dialog box, a widget, a taskbar update, a message notification, a balloon tip, a system tray notification, and\/or any other user interface element in accordance with various embodiments of the invention. The indication may include a message conveying that one or more support specialists are available.

The user support module () may open a secure communication channel between the client computing device () and a computing device used by the support specialist (). The secure communication channel may utilize any protocol for transmitting electronic information and may encrypt information transmitted between the user and the support specialist, in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user support module () is configured to obtain feedback from the user regarding a chat session. The feedback may include a rating, a comment, a description, a transcription of the chat, a task which was discussed, an area of applicable payroll\/tax\/finance\/etc. functionality of the client application (), and\/or any type of feedback from the user in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the support server () is a software application or a series of related software applications executing on one or more hardware servers. The software application(s) may be a web application connected to a network and communicatively connected to the client application (). The support server () may also be implemented as a non web based server application executing on a hardware server. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the support server () is a third party application accessed by the client computing device () using an application programming interface (API).","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the support server () includes functionality to receive availability requests. The support server () may receive availability requests from one or more user support modules associated with one or more client applications (e.g., client application ()) and may be configured to allocate support specialists (e.g., support specialist ()) to the user support modules based on one or more criteria. A criterion may be first in first out (FIFO), a priority assigned to high priority customers (e.g., those paying a support premium), a help topic identified by the user support module (), a task identified by the user support module (), a support specialty (i.e., area of expertise) of the support specialist (), and\/or any other criterion defined by the user support module () and\/or the support server () in accordance with various embodiments of the invention. For example, the support server () may match a support specialist () to a user support module () based on a tax form identified by the user support module (). In this example, the support server () is configured to identify a support specialist having an area of expertise which is related to the identified tax form (e.g., business deductions, limited liability partnerships, investment income, and\/or real estate).","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the support server () includes functionality to send confirmation of one or more available support specialists to the user support module (). The support server may be configured to notify the user support module () and\/or the user of the client application using any means of sending messages in accordance with various embodiments of the invention (e.g., by send a text message to a mobile device of the user).

The examples are included to aid in the understanding of the invention but are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. In one example, a user executes a client payroll application on a desktop computer. The user initiates a wizard having 20 dialogs in order to setup a new payroll account for a small business. Upon launching the wizard, the client payroll application identifies two help thresholds associated with the wizard. The client payroll application determines that a network connection is available and, as a result, enables the two help thresholds. In this example, the wizard displays a first dialog requesting basic information about the business (e.g., address, phone number, number of employees, etc.). The user then enters tax information into the next two dialogs of the wizard.","Continuing the example,  depicts an example screenshot of the client payroll application (). As shown in the figure, the user tabs through a series of fields on the fourth dialog (wizard dialog box ()) of the wizard. The user skips the second field (\u201c2010 Social Security taxes\u201d) and enters data into the third field. Next the user pauses for 60 seconds on the fourth field of the dialog (\u201c2010 federal unemployment taxes\u201d). Meanwhile, a first help threshold of the two identified help thresholds is identified as being associated with the dialog. This help threshold includes a criterion defined such that, it is tracked whether the user skips any fields in the dialog (i.e., enters data in a subsequent field without entering data in the skipped field). If the user skips any such fields and also pauses for 60 seconds or more on a subsequent field, the client payroll application determines that the help threshold is exceeded.","In this example, upon determining that the help threshold is exceeded, the client financial application sends an availability request to an external support server. The support server, upon receiving the request, identifies ten available support specialists connected by a series of support machines. The support server then determines that five of the ten available support specialists specialize in the client payroll application. In response to identifying the five available support specialists, the support server sends a confirmation of an available support specialist to the client payroll application.","Continuing the example, the client payroll application receives the confirmation and displays an indication () to the user that support is available. As shown in , the indication () is a tooltip including a message to the user and a hyperlink for receiving the support request. In this example, the user clicks the hyperlink in order to request assistance. The client payroll application then randomly selects a support specialist of the five available support specialists and opens a chat dialog between the user and the selected support specialist.","Continuing the example,  depicts an example screenshot of the chat dialog (). After initiating the chat session, the client payroll application sends all information inputted into the wizard, along with a definition of the exceeded help threshold to the support specialist. The support specialist then provides real-time support to the user based on the provided information.","Embodiments of the invention may be implemented on virtually any type of computer regardless of the platform being used. For example, as shown in , a computer system () includes one or more processor(s) () (such as a central processing unit (CPU), integrated circuit, hardware processor, etc.), associated memory () (e.g., RAM, cache memory, flash memory, etc.), a storage device () (e.g., a hard disk, an optical drive such as a compact disk drive or digital video disk (DVD) drive, a flash memory stick, etc.), and numerous other elements and functionalities typical of today's computers (not shown). The computer system () may also include input means, such as a keyboard (), a mouse (), or a microphone (not shown). Further, the computer system () may include output means, such as a monitor () (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD), a plasma display, or cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor). The computer system () may be connected to a network () (e.g., a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet, or any other type of network) via a network interface connection (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many different types of computer systems exist, and the aforementioned input and output means may take other forms. Generally speaking, the computer system () includes at least the minimal processing, input, and\/or output means necessary to practice embodiments of the invention.","Further, in one or more embodiments of the invention, one or more elements of the aforementioned computer system () may be located at a remote location and connected to the other elements over a network. Further, embodiments of the invention may be implemented on a distributed system having a plurality of nodes, where each portion of the invention (e.g., support server (), client application (), etc. of , discussed above) may be located on a different node within the distributed system. In one embodiment of the invention, the node corresponds to a computer system. Alternatively, the node may correspond to a processor with associated physical memory. The node may alternatively correspond to a processor or micro-core of a processor with shared memory and\/or resources. Further, software instructions in the form of computer readable program code to perform embodiments of the invention may be stored, temporarily or permanently, on a non-transitory computer readable storage medium, such as a compact disc (CD), a diskette, a tape, memory, or any other tangible computer readable storage device.","One or more embodiments of the invention have one or more of the following advantages. By providing proactive chat support to a user of a client application, users may be assisted more quickly and efficiently. The client application may, by detecting when a network connection is available, be able to determine when a user requires assistance and provide such assistance in real time.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, users may be undisturbed when help is unavailable. Thus, users may work actively on the problem themselves until such time as help is available. In some instances, the user may even solve their own issue via other avenues (e.g., help topics) while waiting for assistance from a support specialist.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, user abandonment may be reduced or eliminated as there may be little or no wait time for chatting with a support specialist. Since abandonment may correlate with low user satisfaction, overall user satisfaction may also be improved.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the average length of support sessions may be reduced as users no longer take time to complain about long wait times. Also, users may be less likely to ask unrelated or hypothetical help questions before letting the support specialist go for fear of a long wait if the problem recurs.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, support specialists may be moved to higher priorities temporarily without substantially affecting the user experience. In this scenario, users with lower priority issues may simply not be offered a chat session. This may provide a significant cost savings.","While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention as disclosed herein. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be limited only by the attached claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIGS. 2 and 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
