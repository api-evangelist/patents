The specific component  may further receive additional information (environment information, time information and the like) by means of the communication unit. In this instance, the information may be received from another component.

Hereinafter, information related to electricity will be described as an example of the energy information, but information related to other energy sources may be identically applied.","For example, the kind of information related to the electricity may include time-based pricing, curtailment, grid emergency, grid reliability, energy increment, operation priority, and the like.","The information may be divided into scheduled information previously produced based on previous information, and real-time information changed in real time. The scheduled information and the real-time information may be divided by whether or not predict information after the current time (in the future).","The energy information  may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be transmitted\/received as a real price. Alternatively, the energy information  may be transmitted\/received by being divided into a plurality of levels.","The energy information  may be divided into time of use (TOU) information, critical peak pattern (CPP) information or real time pattern (RTP) information according to the change in the pattern of data with respect to time.","According to the TOU information, a data is changed step by step depending on time. According to the CPP information, a data is changed step by step or in real time depending on time, and emphasis is displayed at a specific point of time. According to RTP information, a data is changed in real time depending on time.","In a case where the energy information is time-based pricing information as an example, the time-based pricing information is changed. The time-based pricing information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be transmitted\/received as a real price. Alternatively, the time-based pricing information may be transmitted\/received by being divided into a plurality of levels.","In a case where the specific component  receives a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal, one signal may be recognized as an on-peak signal, and the other signal may be recognized as an off-peak signal.","Alternatively, the specific component  may recognize information on at least one drive, which contains the time-based information, and may recognize an on-peak or off-peak signal by comparing the value of the recognized information with the value of reference information.","For example, in a case where the specific component  recognizes information divided into levels or real pricing information, it recognizes an on-peak or off-peak signals by comparing the value of the recognized information with the value of reference information.","In this case, the value of the information on drive may be at least one of time-based pricing, electric energy, the variation of time-based pricing, the variation of electric energy, the average of time-based pricing and the average of electric energy. The value of reference information may be at least one of an average, the average between maximum and minimum values of power information during a predetermined period of time and the reference variation of power information during the predetermined period of time (e.g., the slope of consumed electric energy per unit time).","The value of reference information may be determined in real time or may be previously determined. The value of reference information may be determined on the UAN or may be determined on the HAN (a customer's direct input or an input from the energy management component, the central management component or the like).","In a case where the specific component  (e.g., the energy consumption component) recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), an output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased. If necessary, the output may be restored or increased. The driving scheme of the specific component may be previously determined before the specific component is operated, or may be changed when the specific component recognizes an on-peak signal posterior to the start of operation.","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component  recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output is maintained under an operable condition. In this case, the operable condition means that the value of the information on drive is less than a predetermined reference. The value of the information on drive may be time-based pricing, consumed electric energy, operation time, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a relative or absolute value.","The predetermined reference may be determined in real time or may be previously determined. The predetermined reference may be determined on the UAN or may be determined on the HAN (a customer's direct input or an input from the energy management component, the central management component or the like).","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes high-cost information, the output of the specific component may be maintained or increased when the difference between a state information value and a reference value is within a predetermined range. For example, in a case where a compressor of a refrigerator is not operated in a low-cost section, the temperature of a cool chamber or freezing chamber is increased. Therefore, the compressor is necessarily turned on when the temperature of the cool chamber or freezing chamber approaches a reference temperature. In a case where a high-cost section comes after the compressor is turned on, the compressor maintains a current output when the difference between the temperature of the cool chamber or freezing chamber and the reference temperature is within a predetermined range. In a case where a user selects a button for cancelling power saving in the state that the specific component  recognizes the high-cost information, the output of the specific component may be maintained.","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component  recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output may be increased. However, although the output is increased at the point of time when the specific component recognizes the on-peak signal, the total output amount of the specific component during the entire drive period may be decreased or maintained as compared with that when the specific component is operated at a normal output level. Alternatively, although the output is increased at the point of time when the specific component recognizes the on-peak signal, the total consumed power or total time-based pricing of the specific component during the entire operation period may be decreased as compared that when the specific component is operated at a normal output level.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the drive of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output among a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output (change in the state of cool air that is a medium for performing the function of the refrigerator). In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated (storage of hot water that is an additional medium for performing the function of the washing machine or washer). Alternatively, in a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, cool air may be stored in a separate supercooling chamber by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","The curtailment information is information related to a mode in which the specific component is stopped or a small amount of time-based pricing is taken. As an example, the curtailment information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system.","If the specific component  recognizes curtailment information, the output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased as described above.","The grid emergency information is information related to a power failure or the like. As an example, the grid emergency information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system. The information related to a power failure or the like has a relation with the reliability of a component using energy.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes grid emergency information, it may be immediately shut down.","The grid reliability information is information related to the supply amount of electricity supplied or information related to the quality of electricity. The grid reliability information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be determined by a component (e.g., an electric home appliance) through the frequency of AC power supplied to the component.","That is, if a frequency lower than the frequency of AC power supplied to the component is sensed, it may be determined that the amount of electricity supplied is small (information on the deficiency of the amount of electricity supplied). If a frequency higher than the frequency of AC power supplied to the component is sensed, it may be determined that the amount of electricity supplied is large (information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied).","In a case where the specific component recognizes shortage of the amount of electricity or poor quality of electricity in the grid reliability information, an output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased. If necessary, the output may be restored or increased.","On the other hand, in a case where the specific component recognizes the information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied, the output may be increased, or the operation may be converted from an off-state to an on-state.","The energy increment information is information related to a state that surplus electricity is generated because the amount of electricity used by a component is less than that of power generation. As an example, the energy increment information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes energy increment information, the output may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the drive of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output among a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or a washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","Meanwhile, in a case where the specific component  is the energy storage component  or , the energy storage component  or  may store electricity by receiving the electricity supplied from the UAN, for example, when electricity storage cost is smaller than a predetermined value.","However, in a case where the energy storage component  is connected to the energy generation component  that constitutes the HAN, it may continuously store energy generated by the energy generation component  until the electricity storage is completed. That is, the energy generated while the energy generation component  generates energy may be stored in the energy storage component .","The presence of completion of the electricity storage is determined while the energy storage component  or  stores electricity. In a case where the electricity storage is completed, the electricity supply for the electricity storage is cut off. Specifically, the presence of completion of the electricity storage may be determined using a sensor that senses the voltage, temperature or current of the energy storage component  or . The cutoff of the electricity supply may be performed using a switch (or circuit breaker) provided to a supply stage through which the electricity is supplied to the energy storage unit  or .","The electricity storage cost may be cost consumed in the electricity storage for a specific time period or electricity cost at a specific time.","As an example, in a case where the electricity storage cost is in an off-peak section (in a case where the specific component recognizes low-cost information which will be described later), the energy storage component  or  may store electricity. Alternatively, in a case where an on-peak section corresponds to an allowance section (in a case where the specific component recognizes high-cost information which will be described later), the energy storage component  or  may store in the on-peak section. In this instance, the allowance section is a section in which a power consumption information value is less than a predetermined reference. The power consumption information value may be a electricity cost, a power consumption amount, a time range, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a predetermined cost, a predetermined power consumption amount, a predetermined time, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a relative value or absolute value, and may be changed automatically or manually.","The energy storage component  or  may store a counter electromotive force generated when an energy consumption component that is rotatably operated or a motor provided to the energy consumption component is stopped (rotated).","Alternatively, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity using an energy consumption component that is rotatably operated or a motor provided to the energy consumption component. For example, in a case where the energy consumption component is a refrigerator, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a fan motor provided to the refrigerator is rotated (the fan motor may serve as a power generator or may be connected to the power generator). Alternatively, in a case where the energy consumption component is a washing machine, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a motor that rotates a drum for accommodating the laundry is rotated. In a case where the energy consumption component is a cooking appliance, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a motor for rotating a cooling fan is rotated. In a case where the energy consumption component is an air cleaner, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a motor for rotating a fan is rotated. That is, in this embodiment, in a case where a motor is provided regardless of the kind of the energy consumption component, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when the motor is rotated. Alternatively, in a case where a power generator is connected to a fan rotated by the flow of air (natural flow or forcible flow), the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated by the power generator.","The electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to one or more energy consumption components . In a case where electricity cost is higher than a reference value, the electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component . As an example, in a case where the electricity cost is an on-peak (in a case where the specific component recognizes the high-cost information), the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component . In a case where the electricity cost is an off-peak (in a case where the specific component recognizes the low-cost information) but is close to the on-peak, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component. If the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  is less than a predetermined value, electricity generated in the energy generation component  is supplied to the energy consumption component. Thus, it is possible to prevent the operation of the energy consumption component from being stopped due to the cutoff of the electricity supply while the energy consumption component is operated.","In a case where the supply of electricity generated in the energy generation component  is cut off by interruption of electric power, the electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component. In a case where the energy consumption component is an electric product, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to a communication unit or control unit provided to the electric product.","The electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to a portion of a plurality of energy consumption components. As an example, the stored electricity may be supplied to an electric product such as a refrigerator required in continuous operation among a plurality of electric products. Alternatively, the stored electricity may be supplied to an energy consumption component with relatively low power among a plurality of energy consumption components that constitute one electric product. It will be apparent that the stored electricity is supplied to an energy consumption component with high power. Alternatively, when a course using a relatively small amount of power is performed among a plurality of courses in which an electric product is performed, the stored electricity may be supplied. It will be apparent that the stored electricity may be supplied even when a course using a large amount of power is performed.","Meanwhile, in a case where electricity is generated and stored by a fan or motor as described above, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to an energy consumption unit with relatively low power. As an example, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to an LED lamp, a display, a control unit, a communication unit, a low-power heater, or the like. Alternatively, in a case where the energy consumption component performs a plurality of courses, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component in a course that requires low power.","The energy storage component  may be built in connected to one energy consumption component. Alternatively, a plurality of energy storage components  may be built in or connected to a plurality of energy consumption components, respectively. Alternatively, a plurality of energy storage components  may be built in or connected to one energy consumption component. The plurality of energy storage components  may be connected to one another to share the stored electricity.","Among the information related to energy, the on-peak information, the curtailment information and information on the deficiency of the amount of electricity supplied may be recognized as high-cost information considered that energy cost is relatively expensive. In this instance, the section in which the high-cost information is recognized by the specific component may referred to as a low-cost section.","On the other hand, among the information related to energy, the off-peak information, the energy increment information and the information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied may be recognized as low-cost information considered that energy cost is relatively cheap. In this instance, the section in which the low-cost information is recognized by the specific component may be referred to as a low-cost section.","The information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information) may be recognized as information for determining a power saving driving scheme of the specific component (e.g., the energy consumption component). That is, the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost may be recognized by dividing a time slot (time period) based on energy cost or pricing period (pricing zone) for determining a driving scheme of the specific component into at least two or more.","A high period means a high price time period (period of high cost) or a high pricing period and a low period means a low price time period (period of low cost) and a low pricing period.","As an example, in a case where the information related to energy is recognized as a Boolean signal, the time slot (time period) based on energy cost or pricing period (pricing zone) for determining a driving scheme of the specific component may be divided into two. In a case where the information related to energy is divided into a plurality of levels or recognized as real-time information, the time period or pricing period may be divided into three or more.","Meanwhile, the information related to energy cost corresponding to at least time may be recognized as information for determining a power saving driving scheme of the specific component. That is, the information related to energy cost may be recognized by dividing a time slot (time period) or pricing zone (time period) into at least two or more. As described above, the divided time period or pricing period may be determined based on the kinds of the recognized information (the Bloolean signal, the plurality of levels and the real-time information).","In other words, the information related to fluctuation of energy cost may be recognized by dividing a determination factor for driving the specific component into two or more, and functions on time and energy cost may be included in the determination factor.","In a case where the information related to energy cost is divided into two levels or more, the driving scheme of the specific component may be determined according to the information divided into levels.","On the other hand, in a case where the recognized information related to energy cost is not divided based on a specific reference (e.g., real-time cost information), it is compared with predetermined information, and the driving scheme of the specific component may be determined based on the compared result.","Here, the predetermined information may be reference information (e.g. reference value) for dividing the information related to energy cost, and the compared result may be whether not the information related to energy cost is more or less than the reference value.","Specifically, each of the kinds of information related to energy may be divided into first information  that is raw information, second information  that is refined information, and third information  that is information for performing the function of the specific component. That is, the first information is a raw data, the second information is a refined data, and the third information is a command for performing the function of the specific component.","The information related to energy is included a signal, and the signal is transmitted. In this instance, one or more of the first to third information may be transmitted several times while the content of the information is not converted but only the signal including the information is converted.","For example, as shown in , a component that receives a signal including the first information may convert only the signal and transmit a new signal including the first information to another component.","Therefore, it is described in this embodiment that the conversion of signal is a different concept from the conversion of information. In this instance, it can be readily understood that when the first information is converted into the second information, the signal including the first information is also converted into the signal including the second information.","However, the third information may be transmitted several times in the state that the content of the third information is converted or in the state that only the signal including the third information is converted while the content of the third information is identically maintained.","Specifically, in a case where the first information is raw information on time-based pricing, the second information may be refined information on the time-based pricing. The refined information on the time-based pricing is information in which the time-based pricing is divided into a plurality of levels or analysis information. The third information is a command generated based on the second information.","The specific component may generate, transmit or receive one or more of the first to third information. The first to third information are not necessarily transmitted or received in sequence. Only a plurality of pieces of third information without the first and second information may be transmitted in sequence or parallel. Alternatively, the first and third information may be transmitted or received together, the second and third information may be transmitted or received together, or the first and second information may be transmitted or received together.","As an example, in a case where the specific component receives the first information, it may transmit the second information or may transmit the second and third information.","In a case where the specific information receives only the third information, it may generate and transmit new third information.","Meanwhile, in the relation between two pieces of information, one is a message and the other is a response for the message. Thus, each of the components that constitute the network system may transmit or receive a message. In a case where each of the components receives a message, it may respond to the message. Therefore, in the case of an individual component, the transmission of a message is a relative concept with the response for the message.","The message may include a data (first or second information) and\/or a command (third information).","The command (third information) may include a command for storing the data, a command for generating the data, a command for processing the data (including the generation of an additional data), a command for generating an additional command, a command for transmitting the additionally generated command, a command for transmitting a received command, and the like.","In this specification, the response for the received message means storage of the data, processing of the data (including generation of an additional data), generation of a new command, transmission of the newly generated command, simple transmission of a received command (including generation of a command for transmitting the received command to another component), operation, transmission of the stored information, transmission of an acknowledge message (acknowledge character or negative acknowledge character), or the like.","For example, in a case where the message is first information, the specific component that receives the first information may generate second information by processing the first information, or may generate the second information and new third information, as a response for the message.","The specific component that receives the message may provide a response related to energy. Here, the term \u201cresponse\u201d may be understood as a concept including an operation through which the specific component can perform a function. As an example, the HAN  may perform an operation related to energy by receiving a message.","The response (operation) related to energy, provided by the specific component, will be described in detail. For example, the specific component may be an energy consumption component.","The energy consumption component may be driven so that the energy cost when it is driven based on the recognition for energy information is reduced as compared with that when it is driven without the recognition for energy information.","The specific component may include a plurality of modes in which it is driven to perform its own function. The plurality of modes are a first mode and a second mode in which energy cost is relatively saved as compared with that in the first mode. The specific component may be driven in at least one of the first and second modes.","Here, the first mode may be a general mode and the second mode may be a power saving mode. Alternatively, the first and second modes may all be power saving modes.","The general mode may be understood as a mode in which the function of the specific component is performed without recognition of energy information. On the other hand, the power saving mode may be understood as a mode in which the function of the specific component is performed based on the recognition of energy information so as to save energy cost.","In a case where the first and second modes are power saving modes, the first mode may be specified as a driving scheme for saving energy cost and the second mode may be specified as a driving scheme in which the energy cost in the second mode is more saved than that in the first mode.","Meanwhile, in a case where the specific component (e.g., the energy consumption component) is driven, at least a portion is recognized in a driving scheme including at least drive time and course. In this case, an unrecognized portion may be generated so as to save energy cost, and a recognized portion may be converted into another scheme.","For example, at least a portion of the driving scheme may be recognized under the control of the energy management component, the control of the energy consumption component, or the like. In a case where a specific driving scheme is further required so as to save energy cost, an unrecognized portion of the driving scheme may be newly generated, and a recognized portion may be converted into another scheme so as to save energy.","It will be apparent that the process of generating the unrecognized portion may be omitted. In this case, the process of converting the recognized portion into another scheme. On the other hand, the process of converting the recognized portion into another scheme may be omitted. In this case, the process of newly generating the unrecognized portion may be performed.","The drive time may include a drive start time or drive end time. The course may include a drive period of the specific component and the power of the specific component.","The generated scheme or converted scheme may be a scheme recommended by the specific component so as to save energy cost. Here, the specific component may be an energy consumption component (control component) or the energy management component.","As an example, in a case where the recognized scheme is a specific drive time, the specific drive time may be converted into another time so as to save energy cost, and a specific course may be generated.","On the other hand, in a case where the recognized scheme is a specific course, the specific course may be converted into another course so as to save energy cost, and a specific time may be generated.","Under the control described above, a change in time or power may be made with respect to the output function of the specific component based on time.","The generated scheme or converted scheme may be performed within a set range. That is, in the process of recognizing at least a portion of the driving scheme, the generation or conversion of the driving scheme may be performed within a predetermined reference in which the recognized portion appears (e.g., restriction set by a user, constraint set under the control of the energy management component or energy consumption component, or the like).","Therefore, in a case where the set range is out of the predetermined reference, it is restricted to generate the unrecognized portion or to convert the recognized portion into another scheme.","Another embodiment is proposed.","Cost information may further included in the recognized driving scheme. That is, in a case where the cost information is recognized, a portion related to the drive time or course may be generated. The generated driving scheme may be recommended.","Meanwhile, a response of the specific component based on the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information), e.g., a power control for power saving driving, may be performed. An output decrease (including an output of zero) or output increase may be included in the output control.","It is as described above that the output is decreased or zero, maintained or increased based on the recognition for the information (on-peak or off-peak) related to energy cost.","If high-cost information is recognized, the output may be zero or decreased. Specifically, the output in the recognition of the high-cost information may be decreased as compared with that in the recognition of low-cost information. As described above, the decrease of the output may be previously determined before the specific component is operated, or may be changed when the high-cost information is recognized posterior to the start of the operation of the specific component.","In a case where the output of the specific component is zero or decreased, the function to be performed by the specific component may be lost as compared with a normal case. Therefore, a response for restoring the lost function may be performed.","As an example, after the output of the specific component is decreased, the specific component may be controlled so that the total operation time of the specific component is increased or so that the output is increased in at least a time period.","In other words, if specific reference information related to energy information is recognized in a period after the output of the specific component is controlled, the response for controlling the output may be released. Here, the term \u201cperiod\u201d may be divided based on a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized.","The total operation time may be understood as a time approaching a specific target in the process of performing the function of the specific component. As an example, in a case where the specific component is an electric appliance (washing machine, drying machine, cooking appliance or the like) intermittently driven (or driven in a specific course), the total operation time may be understood as a time until a corresponding course is completed.","On the other hand, in a case where the specific component is an electric appliance (refrigerator, water purifier, or the like) driven at normal times, the total operation time may be understood as a time approaching a target set for performing the function of the specific component. For example, the set target may be a target temperature, a target amount of ice produced, or a target amount of clean water in the refrigerator.","The total operation time may be increased as compared with the operation time set before the output of the specific component is decreased. In a case where the output of the specific component is not decreased, the total operation time may be increased as compared with the operation time of the specific component. However, although the total operation time of the specific component is increased, the specific component is controlled so that the total energy cost generated through the drive of the specific component can be saved as compared with that when the output of the specific component is not decreased.","If the high-cost information is recognized, the output of the specific component may be increased.","However, although the output is increased at a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized, the total output of the specific component during the entire driving period may be decreased or maintained as compared with that when the specific component is operated under a normal output. Alternatively, although the output is increased at a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized, the total power consumption or total time-based pricing of the specific component during the entire driving period may be decreased as compared with that when the specific component is operated under the normal output.","If the low-cost information is recognized, the output of the specific component may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the driving of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output in a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or a washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","Meanwhile, in a case of a specific condition (additional condition) is generated based on the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information), the response of the specific component, e.g., the output control for power saving driving, may be limited. That is, the output of the specific component may be maintained.","Here, the term \u201climitation\u201d may be understood as the release of the output control performed or not performed.","The specific condition includes a case where influence on energy cost is minute even though the output control of the specific component is not performed or a case where it is necessary to prevent a function to be performed by the specific component from being degraded when the output of the specific component is controlled.","Whether or not the influence on the energy cost is minute may be determined based on a predetermined reference (time-based pricing, power consumption or information on operation time). The predetermined reference may be a relative or absolute value.","The case where the function to be performed by the specific component is degraded may be considered as a case where the specific component is a defrosting heater, for example.","In a case where it is controlled to decrease the output in a high-cost time period and to increase the output in the low-cost time period, the driving of the defrosting heater is more frequently performed than that during a normal time (setup period). In this case, the temperature of a storage room in the refrigerator is increased, and thus, the control of the output can be limited.","Meanwhile, the specific component  may include a display unit  for displaying information. In this embodiment, the term \u201cinformation display\u201d means that visual, auditory, olfactory and tactile information is known to the outside. The display unit  may include a touch screen for selecting or inputting information. Alternatively, the specific component  may include a separate input unit for inputting information by cable or radio.","All the information (energy information or additional information except the energy information) described above may be displayed in the display unit .

That is, two or more pieces of information may be simultaneously displayed in the display unit . As an example, in a case where two or more pieces of information are simultaneously displayed, any one of the information is selected. Then, the selected screen may be enlarged, and the unselected screen may reduced. As another example, if any one of the two or more pieces of information is selected, the selected screen may be enlarged, and the unselected screen may disappear. In a case where specific information is selected and the selected screen is enlarged, information more specific that the previous information or information different from the previous information may be displayed on the enlarged screen. For example, in a case where the selected information is a character, graphic information may be displayed on the enlarged screen, or two or more pieces of information may be sequentially displayed on the enlarged screen. In a case where two or more pieces of information are displayed in the display unit , two or more relative positions may be varied.","Information except energy cost information and energy cost may be displayed in the display unit .

The information displayed in the display unit  may include one or more of information on graph for each time or period, level, table. One or more of the shape, color, brightness, size, position, alarm period, alarm time of the information displayed in the display unit  may be varied.","A currently operable function (or menu) may be displayed in the display unit . Alternatively, among a plurality of functions, operable and inoperable function may be divided by size, color, position and the like, and then displayed in the display unit . Alternatively, in a case where separate input units are provided, only an input units for selecting an operable function may be activated, or an input unit for selecting an operable function and an input unit for selecting an inoperable function may be displayed in different colors.","The target or display method of information displayed in the display unit  may be set and changed by a user, or may be changed automatically.","In a case where a condition for informing the user of information is satisfied, specific information may be displayed in the display unit . It will be apparent that a portion of a plurality pieces of information may be continuously displayed in the state that a component is turned on. The display time of the information may be changed or set automatically or manually.","If specific information (one or more pieces of information) is selected using the input unit, the selected information may be displayed. If a user contacts a portion of a component, e.g., an input unit, a handle, a display or the like, regardless of information display selection, or operates one or more buttons or knobs that constitute the input unit, a portion of the information may be displayed. In this instance, the information to be displayed may be set or changed. It will be apparent that a sensing unit for sensing a user's contact may be provided to the component. Alternatively, the specific information may be displayed by installation environment or variation of outdoor environment. Alternatively, the specific information may be displayed when the specific component receives new information. Alternatively, the specific information may be displayed when the kind or state of the specific component is changed.

On the other hand, in a case where the display unit  is not communicated with the component  or information is not included in the communication signal due to the weak intensity of the signal, the display unit may be in an unavailable state. One of the display unit  and the component  transmits a communication signal, and the other of the display unit  and the component  transmits a response signal. The presence of use of the display unit  may be determined by the presence of reception of the communication and response signals and the signal intensity. That is, in a case where any one of the display unit  and the component  does not receive a signal or the intensity of received signal is less than a reference intensity, it may be determined that the display unit  is unavailable. Any one of the display unit  and the component  may increase the intensity of a transmission signal until it receives a response signal of which intensity is more than the reference intensity.","Information for informing the user of the presence of use of the display unit  may be displayed in the display unit  or the component .

If the display unit  is mounted on the component , vibration generated in the operation of the component  can be transferred to the display unit . Therefore, in a case where the difference between the values of vibrations respectively sensed by the sensors is less than a predetermined value, it may be recognized that the display unit  is mounted on the component . If it is recognized that the display unit  is mounted on the component , the operation of the component  may be controlled so that vibration or noise generated in the operation of the component  is decreased.

The repeated number of the first course or the performance of the first course is greater than the preset value, the first course is not performed ever, and the electric product may enter the second course.","Even though the result detected by the detection unit  does not satisfy the first condition, when the second condition related to the performance information of the first course is satisfied, the electric product  may perform the set course. As a result, the course of the electric product may be quickly performed to reduce electricity charges.","For another example, the second condition may include a condition related to the repeated number of the first condition. In detail, to enter the next order course, whether first condition is satisfied may be detected at least one time. Also, when the unsatisfied number of first conditions reaches a preset reference value, it may be determined that the second condition is satisfied, and thus, the electric product  may enter the next order course.","The washing machine will be described with respect to the above-described contents an example of the electric product .","The washing machine performs a plurality of courses (the sub-courses) as a set course. The plurality of courses include washing, dehydrating, and drying processes (courses). After the washing machine completely performs the washing course, the washing machine detects information related to a balance of a washing clothe within a washing bath using the detection unit  before the washing machine enters the dehydrating course.","A condition in which the balance of the washing cloth within the washing bath is detected may be a first condition for performing the dehydrating course. Here, the term \u201cthe balance of the washing cloth\u201d means that the washing cloth is uniformly disposed on a wall of the washing bath, i.e., a disentangled state of the washing cloth. Also, the term \u201can unbalance of the washing cloth\u201d means that the washing cloth is eccentrically disposed on the wall of the washing bath.","The detection unit  may include a hall sensor for detecting a rotation cycle of a driving unit of the washing machine or a weight sensor for detecting a weight of the washing cloth. The washing machine operates the driving unit at the preset number of rotation before the washing machine enters the dehydrating course.","While the driving unit is operated, the detection unit  detects whether the washing cloth is balanced. If a result detected by the detection unit  is less than the set value, it may be recognized that the washing cloth is balanced. The driving unit may be controlled so that the driving unit is continuously rotated until the balance of the washing cloth is detected.","However, for example, in a state where the high-price information related to the energy charge is received, the continuous driving of the driving unit to detect the balance of the washing cloth may have a limitation in which an energy usage amount or a usage energy charge is excessive. Thus, when one of the first and second conditions is satisfied by determining the additional second condition except the first condition related to the detection of the balance of the washing cloth, the washing machine may be controlled to perform the dehydrating course.","As described above, the second condition may be a condition related to the energy charge. When the energy consumption or energy charge increased by the continuous operation of the driving unit exceeds a reference value, the washing machine may enter the dehydrating course even though the balancing condition of the washing cloth is unsatisfied. However, whether the energy consumption or energy charge exceeds the reference value (i.e., on-peak information) may be merely an example for determining whether the energy consumption or energy charge exists in the high-price information period. Thus, when the above-described curtailment information and the supplied electricity shortage information are received, it may also be recognized that the energy consumption or energy charge exists in the high-price information period.","Also, in a case where the high-price information period exists after the estimated operation end time point of the washing machine although the high-price information is not received now, the washing machine may enter the dehydrating course even though the balancing condition of the washing cloth is unsatisfied.","Here, the second condition may be information related to the performance of a specific course. In detail, to balance the washing cloth, a course in which the driving unit is operated at the preset number of rotation may correspond to the first course, and the dehydrating course may correspond to the second course. When the repeated number (a rotation cycle of the driving unit) of the first course is greater than the preset number, or the performance time of the first course is greater than the preset time even though the balancing condition of the washing cloth is unsatisfied, the washing machine may enter the second course.","Here, the second condition may be information related to the repeated number or time of the first condition. In detail, when the unsatisfied number (or time) of first condition in which the balancing of the washing cloth is detected, i.e., the attempted number (time) of the disengagedness of the washing cloth is greater than the set number (or the set time), the washing machine may enter the dehydrating course. Here, the attempted number or time of the disengagedness of the washing cloth may be understood as the failed number (or time) of entering of the dehydrating course.","Another embodiment will now be described.","In the foregoing embodiment, the condition for allowing the electric product  to enter the next order course was determined according to whether the second condition is satisfied after the first condition is satisfied. However, on the other hand, the electric product  may select one of the plurality of entering conditions different from each other on the basis of the information related to the energy charge. That is, the first or second condition may be selected as the entering condition regardless of order of priority of the entering condition.","For example, when a stage period for determining whether the electric product  enters the next order course corresponds to the low-price period, it may be determined whether the electric product  enters the first condition. On the other hand, when the stage period corresponds to the high-price period, it may be determined whether the electric product  enters the next order course by the second condition, but the first condition. That is, in the low-price period, whether the electric product  enters the next order course may be determined by the first condition that is an entering condition of the electric product itself. Also, in the high-price period, whether the electric product  enters the next order course may be determined by the second condition for reducing the energy charge.","For another example, when an accumulated energy charge is less than the reference value in the stage period, it may be determined whether the electric produce  enters the first condition.

Thus, in the on-peak time, the control unit  may operate the pump  to supply water into the water storage tank  only when an amount of water stored in the water storage tank  is substantially more less.","Hereinafter, a method of controlling the water purifier capable of being applied into the network system according to an embodiment will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0452","num":"0451"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},"Referring to , a control unit  determines whether an energy charge exists in an off-peak time according to information received into a data receiving unit  (S). Also, when the control unit  determines that the energy change exists in the off-peak time in the operation S, the control unit  determines whether the value detected by the sensor , i.e., the water level of the water stored in the water storage tank  is less than the first set value (S).","In the operation S, when the value detected by the sensor  is less than the first set value, the control unit  controls the pump  to operate the pump  (S). Thus, the pump  may be operated to supply water into the water storage tank .","When it is determined that the energy charge does not exist in the off-peak time, i.e., exists in the on-peak time in the operation S, the control unit  compares the value detected by the sensor  with the second set value (S). Also, when it is determined that the value detected by the detection part  is less than the second set value in the operation S, the control unit  performs the operation S.","Although not shown, when the sensor  detects a full water level of the water stored in the water storage tank , the control unit  stops the operation of the pump . Thus, the water supply into the water storage tank  may be stopped.","As described above, only when a water level of the water stored in the water storage tank  is lower in the on-peak time in the water purifier , the pump  may be operated to supply water into the water storage tank . Thus, the operation of the pump  in the on-peak time may be minimized in the water purifier  to prevent the costs required for the operation of the pump  from being increased.","According to the network system according to the embodiments, the energy source may be efficiently produced, used, distributed, and stored to effectively manage the energy source. Thus, its industrial applicability is very high."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 26"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
