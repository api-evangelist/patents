{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 62\/084,517, filed on Nov. 25, 2014, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","This disclosure relates generally to multi-dimensional signal measurements.","Contactless data communication has been employed in multiple industries, including the automotive industry. There, contactless data communication is used to gain access to a vehicle. A key or key fob is held by a person and is operable to communicate with a vehicle when the key fob is within range of wireless communication with the vehicle. The person may press a button on the vehicle or lift the handle of a door of the vehicle to initiate communication between the vehicle and the key or key fob. Once communication is initiated, the vehicle and the key or key fob may exchange messages to allow the person access to the vehicle. For example, the key or key fob may transmit one or more authentication messages that the vehicle validates.","One problem that has arisen with contactless data communication is that it is susceptible to a relay attack. In the context of access to vehicles, this attack includes a person initiating the communication with the vehicle by pushing a button on the vehicle or lifting a handle on the vehicle's door. The vehicle then transmits a signal, which is captured by the person and relayed to a remote device using a transceiver. The remote device may be located away from the vehicle but in proximity to the key or key fob. For example, the vehicle may be in a parking lot of a restaurant and the owner of the vehicle may be in the restaurant. The remote device may be located inside the restaurant and may relay the signal transmitted by the vehicle in the restaurant. The key fob, while in the possession of the owner, may receive the signal transmitted by the vehicle as a result of the remote device and may respond with authentication signals. The remote device may capture the authentication signals and transmit them to the person in proximity with the vehicle who initiated the communication. The transceiver held by the person may transmit the authentication signals to the vehicle and the vehicle may validate the authentication signals. This may allow an unauthorized person access to the vehicle.","Systems, methods, circuits and computer-readable mediums are disclosed for sign detection in multi-dimensional signal measurements.","In some implementations, a system includes orthogonally oriented antennas that are configured to generate signals in response to a magnetic field, where the signals correspond to components of magnetic field vectors in space. A circuit is coupled to the antennas and configured to: determine polarities of the signals based on phase measurements between the signals; reduce a possible number of magnetic field vector interpretations based on the determined polarities of the signals; reduce a possible number of angles or angle differences between the magnetic field vectors based on the reduced possible number of magnetic field vector interpretations; compare the reduced possible number of angles or angle differences to predetermined angle or angle differences; and detect a relay attack based on results of the comparing.","In some implementations, a method comprises: generating, by orthogonally oriented antennas of a system, signals in response to a magnetic field, where the signals correspond to components of magnetic field vectors in space; determining, by a circuit of the system, polarities of the signals based on phase measurements between the signals; reducing, by the circuit, a possible number of magnetic field vector interpretations based on the determined polarities of the signals; reducing, by the circuit, a possible number of angles or angle differences between the magnetic field vectors based on the reduced possible number of magnetic field vector interpretations; comparing, by the circuit, the reduced possible number of angles or angle differences to predetermined angle or angle differences; and detecting, by the circuit, a relay attack based on results of the comparing.","In some implementations, a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium includes instructions, which when executed by one or more processors, causes the one or more processors to perform operations comprising: generating, by orthogonally oriented antennas of a system, signals in response to a magnetic field, where the signals correspond to components of magnetic field vectors in space; determining, by a circuit of the system, polarities of the signals based on phase measurements between the signals; reducing, by the circuit, a possible number of magnetic field vector interpretations based on the determined polarities of the signals; reducing a possible number of angles or angle differences between the magnetic field vectors based on the reduced possible number of magnetic vector interpretations; comparing the reduced possible number of angles or angle differences to predetermined angles or angle differences; and detecting a relay attack based on results of the comparing.","One type of contactless data communication for vehicles is the passive entry, passive start (PEPS) system. The PEPS system uses several low frequency (LF) antennas within a vehicle that are operated sequentially together with a key or key fob incorporating a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic antenna to detect a transmitted magnetic field from the LF vehicle antennas. The key or key fob includes an LF receiver that provides three communication channels to receive the 3 orientations (x, y, z) of a magnetic field transmitted by the LF vehicle antennas. The three communication channels provide voltages that can be measured and used to calculate a received signal strength indicator (RSSI).","The measured channel voltages (x, y, z) represent a vector per each transmitting vehicle antenna having an amplitude and an orientation within a 3D space, where the amplitude is given by\n\nAmplitude=\u221a{square root over (.)}\u2003\u2003[1]\n","To avoid the relay attack scenario described above, the angles between the vectors can be calculated. Indeed, an embodiment provides that angles between vectors can be used for defending against relay attacks for two antennas that are operated sequentially or at the same time. When two vehicle antennas are operated sequentially, two individual triples (x, y, z) of voltages can be measured sequentially from the LF receiver channels, representing the two vectors generated by the two car antennas.","As an example, assume that two vectors  and  are measured, having components (1, 4, \u22122) and (\u22123, 3, 1), respectively. The amplitudes of these vectors can be calculated:\n\nAmplitude=\u221a{square root over (1+4+\u22122)}=4.58\n\nAmplitude=\u221a{square root over (\u22123+3+\u22121)}=4.36\n","The angle between the two vectors can be calculated by the following formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":"cos","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mover":[{"mi":"a","mo":"\u21c0"},{"mi":"b","mo":"\u21c0"}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mover":{"mi":"a","mo":"\u21c0"}},{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mover":{"mi":"b","mo":"\u21c0"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}]}},{"mn":"69.49","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"\u00b0","mo":"."}}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"As can be seen in this example, the individual vector components (x, y, z) can have different polarities according to the orientation and the position of the receiving 3D antenna (e.g., key or key fob) and the transmitting vehicle antenna. Receivers that are in the market today do not measure the polarity of the channel voltages. For example, there can be eight possible interpretations of the measured vector components (x, y, z). In the above example, vector a could be interpreted as: (1, 4, 2), (1, 4, \u22122), (1, \u22124, 2), (1, \u22124, \u22122), (\u22121, 4, 2), (\u22121, 4, \u22122), (\u22121, \u22124, 2) and (\u22121, \u22124, \u22122). The eight interpretations of vector  could be interpreted as: (3, 3, 1), (3, 3, \u22121), (3, \u22123, 1), (3, \u22123, \u22121), (\u22123, 3, 1), (\u22123, 3, \u22121), (\u22123, \u22123, 1) and (\u22123, \u22123, \u22121). The resulting vector amplitudes are not affected by the multiple interpretations by the term \u00b7. The resulting calculations will result in 8*8=64 different interpretations where some of these are equal.
