Nos. 14\/086,463 and 14\/022,148, filed Nov. 21, 2013 and Sep. 9, 2013, respectively, both herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Those applications, in turn, are a continuation-in-part (CIP) application of and claim priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/838,249, filed Mar. 15, 2013, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,594,455 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/247,470 filed Sep. 28, 2011, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,532,427, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. This application also claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/834,497, titled \u201cSystem and Method for Image Enhancement and Improvement,\u201d filed on Jun. 13, 2013, herein incorporated by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government without the payment of royalties.","Image processing is a form of signal processing for which the input is an image, such as a photograph or video frame, and the output is either image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image. Forms of image processing include, for example, but are not limited to, face detection, feature detection, medical image processing, computer vision (extraction of information from an image by a computer), microscope image processing, etc.","Image resolution relates at least in part to the detail that an image possesses. For satellite images, generally speaking, an image is considered to be more detailed as the area represented by each pixel is decreased. As used herein, the term images include digital images, electronic images, film images, and\/or other types of images. Cameras taking pictures from great distances, such as aerial photos, may not obtain detailed information about the subject matter. Consequently, subtle or detail information may not present in the images.","An image may be captured by, for example, a monochrome camera, a single charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor and the image is formed via the light intensity projected onto the sensor therein.","In U.S. Pat. No. 7,536,012, to Meyers et al., hereby incorporated by reference, entitled \u201cEntangled Quantum Communications and Quantum Imaging,\u201d there is disclosed, inter alia, a quantum imaging system (see Col. 8, line 50, et seq.) in which the sender sends an image of an image mask using entangled photons and coincidence measurements to a receiver. The system differs from the conventional quantum imaging set-up in that polarization beam splitters are placed in the path of the photons to provide two channels for each of the sender and the receiver, as shown in FIG. 4 of the '012 patent. On the sender's side, a photon beam is split by a beam splitter into first and second sub-beams. The first sub-beam is passed through a mask  which creates the image which is directed through a beam splitter  to bucket detectors , , which are operatively connected to a coincidence circuit. The second sub-beam is transmitted to the receiver without ever passing through the mask . In the embodiment of FIG. 4 of the '012 patent, the receiver receives the second sub-beam and an image of the mask is constructed based upon photon coincident measurements composited from two photon detectors  and , also referred to a bucket detectors. The image of a mask is transmitted via coincidences and the photons transmitting the image have never encountered the image mask. Because of the somewhat puzzling nature or circumstances of the transmission, the process has been dubbed by some as \u201cGhost Imaging,\u201d while others have explained the effects as resulting from the quantum properties of light.","According to embodiments, a processor implemented method for image improvement comprising: receiving a plurality of frames of a given region of interest, the frames comprised of a plurality of pixels; determining, based on a quantum property of the frames, a normalized pixel intensity value for each pixel of each of the plurality of frames; and generating an improved image of the given region of interest based on the plurality of frames and the corresponding normalized pixel intensity values for the frames, the order of the image being two.","The frames of a region of interest are readily influenced by the effects of turbulence, obscuration, low signal to noise ratio, bad or changing weather and\/or low-lighting conditions. This leads to a poor image. Yet, by employing the novel image improvement method of the present invention, the image can be significantly improved ameliorating these negative effects. Unlike classical image improvement techniques conventionally-employed, the novel processing relies upon quantum properties.","The received frames may be generated by the detector\u2014directly or indirectly. For instance, the frames could be output straight from the detector for processing, or the frame may be generated by the detector, stored in a memory, and retrieved from the memory for processing at some later time. Not all frames need to be used for processing for all applications. Indeed, in some implementations, fewer than the total number of frames can be used to determine an improved image of the region of interest.","The normalized pixel intensity value may be determined based on a quantum property of the same frame data which comes from the detector. As such, only one detector or measuring device may be needed in some embodiments. In general terms, the normalized pixel intensity values may be thought as of averaged intensity values. For instance, determining the normalized pixel intensity value of a frame may comprise: determining pixel values within a frame; summing pixel intensity values for determined pixel values within a frame; and dividing each summed pixel value by the number of determined pixel values to form a normalized pixel intensity value for each pixel in the frame.","Generating the improved image of the region of interest can then comprise: calculating (i) the average of the product of determined pixel values and the corresponding normalized pixel intensity values for the plurality of frames, and (ii) the product of the average of the determined pixels values for each frame and the average of normalized pixel intensity values for the plurality of frames. And, in some embodiments, generating the improved image of the region of interest comprises may include further comprising: taking the difference of (i) and (ii).","Calculating (i) the average of the product of determined pixel values and the corresponding normalized pixel intensity values for the plurality of frames, in some instances, may comprise: multiplying pixel values for determined pixels within each frame by the corresponding normalized pixel intensity values for that frame to produce a product for each frame; summing the products of all the frames; and determining the average of first product arrays by dividing the sum of product by the number of frames. And, calculating (ii) the product of the average of the determined pixels values for each frame and the average of normalized pixel intensity values for the plurality of frames, in some instances, may comprise: determining the average value of each pixel for each frame for the plurality of frames; determining the average normalized pixel intensity value for each pixel for the plurality of frames; and multiplying the average pixel values and the average of the normalized pixel intensity value for each pixel.","Determining pixels values within a frame for processing may be achieved by various methodologies, including one or more of: selecting all pixels within each frame; selecting pixel based upon at least one predetermined criterion; selecting pixels which are shifted a pre-determined distance away from select pixels; and\/or determining an average value of adjacent pixels for select pixels. Practicing the image improvement method may further includes selecting at least one measureable property for determining a normalized pixel intensity value for each pixel of each of the plurality of frames; and using at least one different measurable property of the plurality of frames for generating the improved image. A measureable property may include: wavelength or wavelength band, color, polarity, polarization, orbital angular momentum, spin, a quantum particle; or any combination thereof.","Depending on the desired application, the frames can comprise regions of interest that are radiation emitting. Or the frames of a region of interest comprise sparse image data, and the improved image is generated using the sparse image data.","Select processing in generating the improvement image may be further employed, in some embodiments, based on differences among the frames. For instance, the image improvement method can further include: determining a frame intensity deviation value for each frame by subtracting the average frame intensity for the plurality of first frames from the frame intensity for each frame; and classifying the frame intensity deviation values for each frame based on whether the frame intensity deviation values is positive or negative. Then selecting processing for generating an improved image may be carried out based on the aforementioned classification. In addition, select processing may be carried out based on conditional product values for pixels. For example, the method can further comprise: calculating one or more conditional product values of the classified frame intensity deviation values for each frame; and selecting one or more of the conditional product values to generate the improved image. More, in some embodiments, at least two calculated conditional product values are treated differently based upon their classification. Or, all calculated conditional product values might be used to generate the improved image without any change thereto.","Additional refinements of the image improvement method may further be employed in many embodiments. These may comprise interpolating the pixel values for each frame to a finer resolution. Also, filtering of the frame data, the normalized pixel intensity value, and\/or any data used in one or more calculations thereof, can be utilized to additional improve the generation of the image.","Iterating or repeating certain processing may also be employed in embodiments. For instance, providing an iterated improved image of the region of interest may comprises: specifying one or more pixel locations to be normalized to form the normalized pixel intensity value for each pixel; selecting new pixel locations based on a pre-determined pixel selection criteria from the values of the improved image of the region of interest; reviewing the new determined pixels to determine if the new determined pixel locations are substantially the same as the pixel locations previously determined pixel locations; and repeating the aforementioned steps until a specified iteration criteria is met.","According to embodiments, a system for image improvement comprises: at least one processor; and at least one input for receiving or inputting frames of data; and at least one memory operatively associated with the at least one processor adapted to store frames of data taken of a region of interest, each frame of data comprises an array of pixels, with each pixel having a pixel value. The at least one processor is configured to process a plurality of frames of a given region of interest according to one or more or the aforementioned image improvement method embodiments. The input may be operably connectable to an input device, such as, a scanner, a DVD player, CMOS camera, SPAD array, video camera, smart phone, plenoptic camera, cell phone, lidar, ladar, television, CCD or analog and\/or digital camera.","According to other embodiments, a processor implemented method for image improvement comprises: receiving a plurality of frames of a given region of interest, the frames comprised of a plurality of pixels, each pixel including a value of at least one measureable property of quantum particles; specifying the order of the improved image to be generated, the order being greater than or equal to two; selecting at least one measureable quantum property for pixel values of the frames corresponding to the specified order; determining, based on the at least one measureable quantum property, normalized pixel intensity values for each pixel of each of the plurality of frames up to the specified order, to generate the improved image; and generating an improved image of the given region of interest based on the plurality of frames and the corresponding normalized pixel intensity values for the frames. The at least measureable quantum property can comprise, for example: wavelength or wavelength band, color, polarity, polarization, orbital angular momentum, spin, quantum phase, a quantum particle; or any combination thereof.","Additionally, according to embodiments, a system for generating an image of a target illuminated by quantum entangled particles. The system includes: an illumination system comprising: at least one source of quantum entangled particle pairs; and a beamsplitter receiving the quantum entangled particle pairs, such that one particle from each pair of particle generated by each source interfere on the beamsplitter causing the interfered particles to be directed towards a target and the remaining particle pairs are not directed towards the target, wherein the illumination system is configured so that the interfered particles interact with the target; a measuring system comprising a first detector and a second detector that are configured to perform at least one spatially resolved measurement of particles, where the first detector measures one of the remaining particle pairs and the second detector measures the other of the remaining particle pairs; and a processor configured to generate an image of the target based upon the correlated measured values and spatial information from the first detector and the second detector.","In some implementations, the system can further include: electronics configured to determine coincidences based on measurements of the first and second detectors which occur within a predetermined time interval. The processor can further be configured to generate at least a second order image using the coincidences. Also, the processor may be configured to apply an image improvement method for generating at least a second order image using at least one measureable quantum property.","In other implementations, the system may further include an optical delay element configured to introduce a time delay for particles reaching the measuring system. This optical delay element may, in some embodiment, be further configured to be operated so as to generate an absorption image of the target, a reflection image of the target, or both.","Additionally, the system may optionally include is some embodiment an optical delay line configured to ensure particle interference at the beamsplitter, and\/or a phase modulator configured to modify the phase relationship between the particle pairs generated by the two sources of quantum entangled particle pairs, respectively.","In one particular embodiment, the illumination system comprises: a single source of entangled particle pairs; and a pair of beamsplitters receiving the entangled particles pairs, such that one particle from each pair of particles generated by each source interfere on the beamsplitter causing the interfered particles to be directed towards a target and the remaining particle pairs to be retained; wherein the illumination system is configured so that the interfered particles interact with the target causing absorption at the target entangling the retained particle pair.","In some embodiments, the system may be configured so that the interfered particles interact with the target causing absorbtion at the target entangling the retained particle pairs. And, it yet other embodiments, the system may be configured so that the interfered particles interact with the target causing reflection at the target and further comprises optics or focusing components and measurement electronics wherein the measurement of the reflected entangled particles entangled the retained particle pairs.","These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings.

An embodiment of the present invention increases the image quality of an object or scene as seen by a detector. When a low quality detector is aimed at an object, a high quality image is generated using the quantum properties of light. A low quality detector picks up quantum information on the object shape and its temporal relations to reference fields. The reference fields may be recorded by the same imager (CCD, camera, etc.) that acts as a bucket detector (that is, it does not necessarily contain spatial information). Current imaging methods are limited to the quality of the detector looking at the object being imaged. A preferred embodiment generates an improved quality image of the object without the object being imaged in high resolution directly. The preferred method may be used in connection with photographs taken during turbulent conditions.","An alternate embodiment comprises computing the average overall intensity of a plurality of frames and arranging the frames into two sets. A first set contains the frames having frame intensities greater than the average overall intensity for all frames; the average overall intensity being the summation of the intensities for frames divided by the number of frames. The second set containing frames having an overall intensity less than the average overall intensity. Each of the first and second sets is processed by repeating steps (a) through (i). The result obtained using the second set of frames is then subtracted from the result obtained using the first set of frames to create the image.","Yet another embodiment includes a method for image improvement that comprises: providing a series of frames of a given region of interest; determining the value of each pixel within each frame to form a first array of pixel values; determining the integral of pixel values of each frame to form a second array of overall frame integrals; partitioning the first array into two sets based on a predetermined criteria; partitioning the second array into two sets based on a predetermined criteria; using the first and second sets of the first and second arrays to compute a conditional product term for each of the four combinations of the first and second sets of the first and second arrays; and combining the conditional product terms to provide an improved image of the region of interest.","And yet a further embodiment includes a method for image improvement comprising providing a series of frames of a given region of interest; determining the value of each pixel at each location within each frame to form a first array of pixel values for each frame; determining the overall intensity of each frame; determining the product of the overall intensity and the array of pixel values for each frame; determining the sum of the products by adding together the products of the overall frame intensity and first array of pixel values for each frame; determining the average of the sum of products by dividing the sum of products by the number of frames in the series of frames; determining the average value of each pixel at each pixel location for the series of frames to form a second array of average pixel values; determining the average overall frame intensity for the series of frames; determining a second product of the second array of average pixel values and the average overall frame intensity; subtracting the second product from the first product to provide an improved image of the region of interest; partitioning the improved image into at least two partitions based on a predetermined criteria; mathematically operating upon the partitioned improved image to increase image contrast or image clarity.","The current invention utilizes the ability to increase the image quality of an object as seen by a detector using methods relating to the Quantum nature of light. For example, when a low quality detector is aimed at an object, then a high quality image may be generated based on the quantum properties of light. The high quality image is generated even in the presence of turbulence which might otherwise be disruptive to image clarity. Scattering of quantum particles such as photons off the object carries information of the object shape even when the quantum particles such as photons do not go directly into the camera or detector. An additional low quality bucket detector (such as, for example, a detector lacking spatial information) records quantum information on the object shape and its temporal relations to collocated reference fields. The reference fields may be recorded by the same type of imager (CCD, Camera, etc.) that looks at the object and which act like bucket detectors in U.S. Pat. No. 7,536,012, referenced in the foregoing.","Current imaging methods are limited to the quality of the detector looking at the object being imaged. Embodiments of this invention enable an image quality improvement by using techniques developed in the course of Ghost Imaging experiments, and includes, but is not limited to, methods to generate a high quality image of the object without the object being imaged in high resolution directly; i.e., low resolution images may be enhanced, thereby enabling high quality imaging when only low quality images of the object are imaged directly.","Second Order Imaging","Imaging of a scene or subject is typically accomplished by mapping an illuminated scene or subject onto an image sensor where there is a light measurement component such as film, CCD, or other sensing device. Light consists of a plurality of photons that may be measured. The illuminating light may be from one or more light sources either natural or artificial, or both. Common sources of light include for example the sun, coherent, incoherent, or partially coherent light, entangled photons, infrared radiation emitted by atoms and molecules, accelerating charges, lasers, light bulbs, light emitting diodes (LEDs), chaotic laser light, pseudo-thermal light generated by passing laser light through a rotating ground glass or other scattering material, stars, moons, clouds, planets, space objects, fluorescent lamps, electrical discharges, plasmas, bio-luminescence, and stimulated emission. Although it is not absolutely necessary a lens is often used to perform this mapping. Imaging is often susceptible to adverse affects such as obscuration, turbulence, low signal to noise ratio such as when operating in low-light conditions, jitter, and noise. Often, this type of imaging is referred to as \u201cFirst Order\u201d imaging due to the time, ensemble, or mixed time-ensemble averaging of the sensors involved. For instance, a first-order light intensity image I(x, y, t) can be produced by light interacting with a sensor for some time \u0394t, i.e. shutter or integration time. A single instance of this may be referred to as a \u201cframe\u201d. Multiple frames of images, I(x, y, ti), may be averaged over some or all of the frames in a sequence of frames to generate an averaged first-order image of the subject <I(x, y, > where < > indicates an ensemble average. A second order image involves averages of products of two first-order intensity or normalized intensity measurements. An enhanced image results from the subtraction of products of averages of first order intensities from the average of the product of the intensities. An intensity or normalized intensity can be decomposed into a mean (<I>) plus a deviation from the mean or average (\u0394I).","The terms Iand Iare intensities or normalized intensities measured by sensors 1 and 2, I=<I>+\u0394Iand I=<I>+\u0394Iwith Iand Ibeing functions of space and time, i.e., x, y, t. <I> is the ensemble average of intensity or normalized measurements of sensor 1 and \u0394Iis the deviation from the mean for the intensity or normalized intensity measurements of sensor 1. <I> is the ensemble average of intensity or normalized measurements of sensor 2 and \u0394Iis the deviation from the mean for the intensity or normalized intensity measurements of sensor 2. The deviation is often called a fluctuation.","Mathematically the second-order enhanced image can be described by <II>=<<I><I>+\u0394I<I>+\u0394I<I>+\u0394I\u0394I>. Simplifying this expression yields <II>=<I><I>+<\u0394I\u0394I>.","Similarly",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0119"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","\u0394"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":[{"mi":"I","mn":"1"},{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}]}},{"mo":"\u2329","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"1"},"mo":"-","mrow":{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"1"}}}},{"mo":["(","\u232a"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"2"},"mo":"-","mrow":{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}],"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":"I","mn":"1"},{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}}},{"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"1"}}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"1"}},{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":["-","-","+"]}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"I","mn":"1"},{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":[{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"1"}},{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}}]},{"mrow":[{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"1"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}},"mo":"."}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":["-","+"]}}}}]}},{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","\u0394"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":[{"mi":"I","mn":"1"},{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}]}},"mo":"="},{"mrow":[{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"I","mn":"1"},{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"1"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msub":{"mi":"I","mn":"2"}},"mo":"."}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":"-"}],"mo":"\u2063"}},{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}]}]}}},"br":[{},{},{},{}],"sup":["rd ","th "],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{}],"i":["I","\u0394I","\u0394I","I","\u2212<I","I","\u2212<I","I","\u2212<I","I","\u0394I",". . . \u0394I",">=<I","I",". . .

Imay be selectable by user as follows. For instance, an imaging system may be configured to provide at least one measurement value for at least one spatial location of a region of interest. The spatial location can be represented by position within an array of \u201cpixels\u201d. A frame of measured values may be composed of a plurality of pixels, typically in an at least one-dimensional array that together may form an image. Exemplary frames may be electronic image data such a TIFF or JPEG file. The measured values can be assigned to variables I, I, . . . , Iin a variety of ways. As an example, when the imaging system provides a single color, or gray scale, image of the region of interest per frame then each measured pixel value may be assigned to variable I, and variable Imay be assigned the value of the sum of the measurement pixel values per frame. For a different embodiment Imay be, for instance, assigned the measured values of a particular pixel, say pixel i=12, j=300, and variable Iassigned the measured values of pixel, i=522, j=207 where i and j are indices into the 2D arrays of measured values. Generally, each measured value assigned to one of the Ivariables may be selected by the user to meet the requirements for their specific application. At least one of the variables Imust be assigned positions that correspond to the pixel positions of the measured pixel value arrays provided by the imaging system at known pixel position coordinates.","In an example of a second order improved image, Iand Imay refer to intensities measured by at least two sensors where one of the sensors measures spatial information of the light (I) coming from the scene or subject (the \u201cReference\u201d sensor) and the other sensor measures a quantity representative of the intensity (I) coming from the scene or subject, i.e. a \u201cthe bucket\u201d sensor. One of the sensors may be a \u201cvirtual\u201d sensor wherein, for instance, the representative intensity coming from the scene or subject is comprised of spatially integrating all or a selected subset of pixels on a CCD or CMOS camera or even consist of a single pixel from a CCD or CMOS camera. The enhanced image is contained in <\u0394I\u0394I> which has a \u03b4-function like correspondence between points on the object and points on the image sensor and is largely unaffected by the degrading effects of turbulence, obscuration, low signal to noise ratio such as when operating in low-light conditions, jitter, and noise.

Lett. 98, 111115, 2011, herein incorporate by reference.","A preferred method for practicing the present invention may be correlated to the mathematical representations as follows. Expressed using the terms Iand I, a preferred method for image improvement comprises inputting a series of frames of an image; determining the value of each pixel at each location within each frame to form a pixel value array for each frame; summing the pixel values in each frame to obtain the frame intensity for each frame (correlates to determining I); multiplying the pixels in pixel value array by the frame intensity to produce a frame intensity multiplied pixel value array (correlates to determining the product II); summing the frame intensity multiplied pixel value arrays together and dividing by the number of frames to obtain an average of the frame intensity multiplied pixel value arrays (correlates to determining <II>); using the pixel value arrays, creating an array of average pixel values (correlates to determining <I>); determining the average frame intensity for the series of frames (correlates to determining <I>); multiplying the array of average pixel values by the average frame intensity for all of the inputted frames (correlates to the product <I><I>); and subtracting the array of average pixel values multiplied by average frame intensity (<I><I>); from the average of the frame intensity multiplied pixel value arrays (correlates to <II>) to provide an array of modified pixel values to form an improved image <\u0394I\u0394I> second order image (which, from the previously expresses mathematical equations correlates to the equation <\u0394I\u0394I>=<II>\u2212<I><I>).","Other preferred methods may include the normalizing of the intensity to produce an enhanced image. There are several ways to normalize intensity. One way is to divide the Reference pixel intensity values by a non-zero value \u201cbucket\u201d intensity, J=I\/I. This normalization would give J=<J>+\u0394Jand I=<I>+\u0394Iwith Jand Ibeing functions of space and time, i.e. x, y, t. Where Jand Iare normalized intensities and intensities measured by sensors 1 and 2. <J> is the ensemble average of intensity or normalized measurements of sensor 1 and \u0394Jis the deviation from the mean for the normalized intensity measurements of sensors 1 and 2. <I> is the ensemble average of intensity or normalized measurements of sensor 2 and \u0394Iis the deviation from the mean for the intensity or normalized intensity measurements of sensor 2. The deviation is often called a fluctuation.","Mathematically the second-order enhanced image can be described by <JI>=<<J><I>+\u0394J<I>+\u0394I<J>+\u0394J\u0394I>. Simplifying this expression yields\n\n<>,\n\nrearranging terms yields\n\n<\u0394>\n\nwherein the enhanced image is contained in <\u0394J\u0394I>. The enhanced image may be normalized by the product of the standard deviations of Iand Ito generate an enhanced image that displays the correlation of Iand I. Other alternative ways to normalize the enhanced image include dividing <\u0394I\u0394I> or <\u0394I\u0394I> by the product <J><I> or <I><I> respectively.\n","One embodiment of the current invention comprises the subject area illumination being generated by one or more light sources which can be internal, external or a mixture of external and internal light sources. Examples of external light sources include the sun, coherent, incoherent, or partially coherent light illuminating the subject area generated by natural or artificial means indoors or out of doors propagating through any transmissive or partially transmissive media such as the air, water, or biological tissue including cells. Examples of internal light sources include the subject emanating light in the infrared given off by atoms and molecules. Light received may be reflected, scattered, or emanated from the subject into at least one first receiver at predetermined time intervals. Light may be received at the at least one second receiver at corresponding time intervals from the light source which may be reflected or partially reflected from the subject and contains spatial information. The first and second receivers may be selected from, for example, one or more arrays of pixels from one or more cameras, imagers, CCDs, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the measured values are transmitted from the first and second receivers to the at least one processor. The measured values of the at least one first receiver are then correlated with the spatially resolved measurements of the at least one second receiver at the corresponding intervals of time. A first image of the subject is then created based upon the correlated measured values and spatial information by combining the spatial information from at least one second receiver at predetermined intervals of time with the measured values from at least one first receiver at the corresponding intervals of time. An enhanced second image of the subject is generated by removing the blurred, distorted or noisy averaged first-order image part from the first image. The first order image part may be removed by subtraction or other equivalent mathematical operation.","It is to be appreciated that the methods and techniques described in this invention can be applied to microscopy. Microscopy of biological samples in particular can be degraded by the transmission and scattering of light propagating through scattering and absorbing media that can significantly degrade the quality of the image. It is to be appreciated that substituting a microscope objective for a telescope as described in certain embodiment only alters the focal length of the optical system and does not affect the image enhancement properties of this invention.","Another embodiment would entail generating enhanced images using intensity products where more than two intensity measurements are available. This is especially useful for when the intensity deviations do not follow Gaussian statistics. This would involve simultaneous measurements of three or more sensors at a time. Our method would be applied to generate enhanced images of the form <\u0394I\u0394I\u0394I>, <\u0394I\u0394I\u0394I\u0394I>, . . . , <\u0394I\u0394I. . . \u0394I>. This has application to the investigation of turbulence, finding of non-classical photon behavior and as a research tool exploring higher order correlation statistics, the investigation of the fundamental nature of quantum physics such as non-local correlations, Bell inequalities, and EPR effects.","There is a trend in modern imaging devices, i.e. cameras, to provide more measured quantities at each pixel. Thus, the intensity measurements may include measurements such as wavelength (color or derived color mappings such as RGB, CMY, CMYK, etc.), polarization, Stokes parameters, spatial modes, orbital angular momentum (OAM), spin, etc. For example, a color camera may provide separate wavelength measurements, red (R), green (G), and blue (B) intensity values at each pixel, the polarization Stokes parameters at each pixel, and modern infrared (IR) cameras can provide measurements of long-wave infrared (LWIR) and mid-wave infrared (MWIR) intensities at each pixel of the imaging device, or combinations of these measurements. In the current invention at least one of the available measured quantities is selected to provide the frame data for the generation of the improved image of the region of interest.","It is to be appreciated that measurements of quantities such as wavelength and polarization are typically dependent on the responsiveness of the measurement device to the quantity being measured. As an example, color cameras typically use band-pass filters arranged in a pattern over the pixels of the measurement device. These filters are usually labeled Red, Green, and Blue (R, G, and B). The wavelengths that each of the R, G, G filters pass is centered at a particular wavelength and also passes nearby wavelengths with wavelengths being more distant from the center wavelength being more highly attenuated. This effect is referred to as the bandwidth of the filter. Polarization filters have similar bandwidths with respect to the orientation of the filter. The responsiveness to wavelength, polarization, etc., of an element on a measurement may also be adjusted by applying, for example, larger or smaller voltages to increase or decrease the degree to which each element (pixel) reacts to the wavelength or polarization of light that interacts with that pixel.","It is to be further appreciated that information that can be extracted from measurements made by at least one sensor may exist over a spectrum or bandwidth of time and space scales and that extraction of such information may be facilitated by electronic, computational, and\/or optical filtering. For example, electronic filtering of measurements to emphasize lower or higher frequencies may enhance the observation of correlations between sensor measurements and improve the generated enhanced images. The character and amount of electronic and\/or optical filtering needed to optimize enhanced images may vary with the types and makeup of the sensors used, the physical properties of the area of interest, the physical properties of the source of illumination, the nature and physical properties of the intervening regions, (e.g. atmosphere, ocean, biological tissue, material, outer space, obscurants, etc) between the sensors, illuminators, and the region of interest. By physical properties we also mean to include physical, chemical, biological, and electronic properties.","Referring now to , in accordance with one preferred embodiment, in Box  a series of frames are inputted into the memory or input of a processor or image processor.

Depending on the source of illumination and the material composition of the objects within the scene the contributions from reflected\/scattered light and emitted light are often quite different. Light that is reflected from an object typically polarizes the reflected light while emitted light is often unpolarized. Emitted light may be from physical processes that include, but are not limited to, luminescence, fluorescence, \u201cblack body,\u201d and thermal radiation.","Low Light Imaging","The present invention relates to a method that can be applied to improve images of many types of low-light target objects and areas. Objects and target areas of interest are often very faint, either due, but not limited to, to low photon emission rate, being very distant (radiation intensity with distance from a source follows an inverse square law, i.e. 1\/(r) where r is the distance from the center of the emitter to the receiving device), the reflectance of the object or target area of interest being very small, the effective integration or shutter time of the measurement device being very short, the efficiency of the detector may be small, or through attenuation and\/or scattering due to the media through which the radiation propagates. Low light conditions could generally said to exist when the quality of the image degrades with the reduction of illuminating light or light received from the imaged area of interest by the eye or a sensor such as a camera. A low signal to noise ratio sensed by a sensor such as a CCD, CMOS, or single photon detector may also indicate low-light imaging conditions when the noise of the sensor exceeds the measured light by the sensor. Outdoors between dusk and dawn would typically be considered low-light conditions and indoors without bright overhead illumination may also produce low-light conditions. In an environment when obstacles occlude the light source such as in a cave or thick forest also produce low-light conditions. Conditions that cause the use of intensity amplification are considered low-light conditions.  is an average image of a distant (2.33 km) target taken under low-light conditions.  demonstrates an improved enhanced image of the same target as shown in .

A typical stereoscopic image or movie is produced by viewing a region of interest with two distinct and separated imaging sensors such as two cameras or two human eyes. The optical path from the region of interest to each sensor is slightly different and each sensor also emphasizes slightly different portions of the region of interest. Furthermore, the field of view between each sensor and the region of interest is typically subject to different degrees of obscuration and degrading turbulence effects. The methods and techniques described in this invention can be applied to each of the stereoscopic channels individually, or in other embodiments cross-channel products between the reference fields and the buckets may be used, i.e. a right channel reference with a left channel bucket and a left channel reference with a right channel bucket. Range or depth maps of a region of interest can be generated from stereographic images. Since the stereographic images are adversely affected by obscurants and turbulence the methods and techniques described herein can be applied to generate improved stereographic images which may then be used to generate more accurate range or depth maps of the region of interest.","Ladar Per Pixel Range","Turbulence causes changes in the index of refraction in the atmosphere. These changes in the index of refraction cause a change in the speed of light through media thereby causing ranging problems. For example, light travels slower thru air with higher index of refraction. Other factors that influence the index of refraction in the atmosphere include but are not limited to temperature and concentrations of other materials such as water. The current invention can be applied to mitigate the effects of the anisotropic, inhomogeneous, and temporally fluctuating changes in the index of refraction along an optical path from a sender to a receiver. As an example a current type of LADAR system would direct a laser pulse to the region of interest, on sending the pulse the receiver detector would start taking a series of measurements for N consecutive measurements or bins. Each of the measurements would correspond to a dT where light returning from the target area would be measured. The particular dT out of the N dT measurements that measured the greatest number of photons would be assumed to give the range to the region of interest (c M dT)\/2 where c is the speed of light, M is the index of the measurement time with the greatest number of photons measured, dT is the time width of each bin. The factor of 2 corrects for the time of the pulse to travel from the laser to the target and back from the target to the receiver. However, index of refraction variations generally spread out the pulse sometimes to the extent where no single dT bin has the greatest number of photon counts. Applying the methods and techniques described in this invention can mitigate this variable index of refraction induced degradation and generate improved depth or distance to target maps of the region of interest.","Alternative Grouping for Reference and Bucket Field Measurements","An alternative embodiment of the current invention may use different groupings of pixels or spatially resolved measurements for the \u201creference\u201d field and the \u201cbucket\u201d field measurements. As an example, the pixels of a CCD type sensor may be grouped into a checker board type pattern where the equivalent pixels to a red (even) or black (odd) box on a checker board are treated as two distinct sensors. The even (odd) pixel set is then used as a set of \u201creference\u201d measurements while the odd (even) pixel set is summed over and used as the set of \u201cbucket\u201d measurements. A Gtype image for each pairing, even\/odd or odd\/even, can then be computed using the methods and techniques described herein to generate improved images of a region of interest. Each of the computed improved images may be examined separately or the can be added or subtracted from each other to highlight different features of the region of interest. It is to be appreciated that other groupings of pixels or spatially resolved measurements would be advantageous for specific applications or characteristics and details in the region of interest.","Color Images and Movies","Many current imaging devices are able to measure distinct portions of the electro-magnetic and optical spectrum. These devices such as color CCD cameras, smart phone cameras, and video recorders often split the colors of a region of interest into three color bands, i.e. red, green, and blue. Turbulence and obscurants typically impose an optical frequency dependent degradation on color images. The current invention can mitigate these degradations on a per color band basis. For example, using the methods and techniques described in this invention the measured red, green, and blue color bands could be used to generate an improved red image, improved green image, and an improved blue image. These three improved color band images could then be collected into a single improved \u201ccolor\u201d image. Other alternative embodiments would include using, for instance a \u201cred\u201d bucket with a \u201cblue\u201d reference field. These types of cross-color calculations may be useful to highlight or suppress desired features of the region of interest.","Extraction of Relative Dynamics Between Measurements Separated in Space, Time, or Both","Embodiments of the present invention can be used to determine the dynamics and relative dynamics contained in measurements of the region of interest. The dynamics would consist of the information on the physical, chemical, and biological processes as they evolve in space and time. This would include but is not limited to the dynamics of light sources, surface characteristics such as reflection, and scattering in the transmission media.","Ghost Imaging with a Single Camera","Using ghost imaging we have shown that it is possible to generate an improved image of an area of interest using two detectors. The first detector is a sensitive light meter that measures light scattered or reflected from the area of interest. The second detector can be a camera, such as a charged coupled device (CCD), CMOS, or other device capable of imaging the relevant light source, such as the sun, stars, and moon outdoors, or light bulbs indoors, that illuminate the area of interest. In the case where the area of interest emits radiation such as infrared radiation, detector one measures the combined reflected, scattered, and emitted radiation. Detector two measures the effects of the reflected, scattered, and emitted radiation sources. By combining coincident measurements of first detector and the second detector a ghost image can be computed of the area of interest. It turns out that the ghost image can achieve higher resolution or greater clarity than an image of the area of interest using the camera type device alone taking a picture classically. This has been demonstrated in experiments and publications of peer reviewed articles. An explanation for the improvement of the image in turbulence is demonstrated by so called two-photon models of coincident imaging found in our publication. There it is shown that turbulence aberrations cancel and do not affect the improved resolution of the ghost image. Sometimes, a two-photon ghost image is referred to as a second order image. Whereas, the camera image taken by classical means is referred to as a first order image. Classical theory and experiment show that first order images are smeared by turbulence.","It would be desirable to generate a second order ghost image with high resolution and clarity even through turbulence while using just a single camera which may or may not be a color camera. In the case of a color camera ghost imaging system and method can be applied to each color that the color camera measures a color ghost image will result. Also, the camera could measure in infrared, UV, or more than one other wavelengths and pseudo-coloring can be used to display the ghost image depicting the intensity in the different wavelength bands. One embodiment of how to do this would be to treat the area of interest as a mirror or an imperfect mirror for the light sources. Thus, an array of pixel on the camera can image the area of interest as a measure of the light sources just as the second detector above. The first detector which measures the reflected and scattered light from the area of interest can be other or the same array of pixels in the camera.","One method would be to use a black and white checkerboard pattern of pixels where the white pixels act as detector two and the sum of the measurements on the black pixels act as detector one. By combining coincident measurements of first detector and the second detector a ghost image can be computed of the area of interest.","An alternate embodiment of this would be to place a beam splitter between the camera and the area of interest. The beam splitter can split the radiation into two parts, one part towards detector one and the other part towards detector two. For example with a 50\/50 beam splitter half of the light from the area of interest would be directed to the pixels of the camera which act as the second detector. The remaining half of the light would be directed to a separate sensor which acts as the first detector. The separate sensor could be attached to the camera or even be a single pixel of the usual camera array. This second embodiment is not as simple as the first embodiment. However, it may be more accurate if the first detector has higher sensitivity or accuracy. By combining coincident measurements of first detector and the second detector a ghost image can be computed of the area of interest.","Another alternate embodiment would be to use all of the pixels of the camera to act as detector two and the sum of the measurements of all of the pixels act as detector one. By combining coincident measurements of first detector and the second detector a ghost image can be computed of the area of interest. Various combinations of the pixels including those which overlap or do not overlap of the camera can used as detector one and detector two. It has been demonstrated with experiments that these combinations described can be useful to obtain improved quality ghost images.","In calculating the improved quality ghost image the processor creates a correlation product of measurements from detector one times measurements from detector two at coincident times for each pixel location measured by detector two. Summing and averaging these correlations over an ensemble of coincidence times yields a measure of the ghost image. This ghost image is combined of both first order and second order image information. Subtracting off the first order image which may be smeared by turbulence yields a second order ghost image which will be improved over the first order image in that it will have higher resolution and less distortion due to turbulence. This image is often referred to as a G(2) image. When, for instance, thermal photons have Gaussian statistics then the G(2) image is expected to be positive. However, Gaussian statistics may not accurately characterize the photon measurements made by cameras imaging areas of interest. In addition, turbulence and other physical characteristics of the illuminating source, area of interest, camera, detectors one and two and intervening media may combine in ways to create photon measurements that would be best characterized as non-Gaussian. Some of the physical characteristics that may contribute to the non-Gaussian photon statistics can include any or all of inhomogeneous, non-stationary, anisotropic, non-ergodic, nonlinear, and quantum processes.","As it turns out empirically, Ggives a good image of the area of interest. However, it is important to try to improve the Gimage contrast. Sometimes Gcontrast is not as high as ideally desirable. One way to improve the image contrast is to artificially scale the ghost image by subtracting off any background. An analysis of the Gsign shows that when Gis positive then the intensity deviations that comprise it are correlated. When Gis zero then the intensity deviations are uncorrelated. When Gis negative then intensity deviations are anti-correlated. When the negative parts of Gsubtracts from the positive parts of Gthen an all positive \u0394G=Gcorrelated\u2212Ganti-correlated can be computed. This method can be imaged by a display to have high contrast since the minimum is zero and other values are positive.","As described in the specification for U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/247,470 filed Sep. 28, 2011 (ARL 11-03) herein incorporated by reference, there are many possibilities to combine results from the conditional product terms, and R, R, R, and R, computations to generate and display an improved image of the region of interest. This sum, RI, is a weighed sum of correlated products. These correlated products would be formed from results of measurements of quantum particles. There are many applications for the method described below including imaging using photons and other quantum particles, measurement of gravitational waves, measurement of the quantum properties of sound, improved LIDARs, LADARs, improved medical imaging, improved Earth surveillance from space, improved space surveillance from Earth or other places in space. It is helpful to put the weighted sum of correlated products in a form where a user could compare the value of one vs. others for their application.","In particular, one useful way would be to weight terms in R+R\u2212R\u2212R by cos \u03b8 and sin \u03b8 factors, i.e. RI=cos \u03b8(R+R)+sin \u03b8(R+R),","where \u03b8 is an angle. This arrangement allows for continuously varying the contributions of the conditional product terms to display improved images to include an all positive image, an all negative image, a Gimage and the negative of the Gimage.","Another alternative would apply a cos \u03b8 weight to the cross-term portion, RI=(R+R)+cos \u03b8(R+R).","While the conditional product terms can be displayed independently as an image, the alternative means described here to present and display the results would be useful for teaching and for detailed examination and analysis of the properties of the region of interest.","In practice, a movie displaying RIor RIwould be made that scans through values of \u03b8 by the desired amount. For example, the movie could start at \u03b8=0 and each for each successive frame \u03b8 could be incremented by one degree until \u03b8 takes all values from 0 to 360 degrees. This will show the continuous change of RIor RIexhibiting varying contrast, visibility, and resolution of the computed image of the region of interest. For example when the symmetric terms are added to the asymmetric terms then a Gimage results when the asymmetric terms are subtracted from the symmetric terms then an all positive image results. Which image is \u201cbetter\u201d for the user depends on the needs of the user. For example, from RIone may obtain high contrast for \u03b8=180 degrees for an all positive image with high visibility. In some cases, more resolution of the region of interest may be found for \u03b8=0 degrees.","Color cameras often have pixel sensors that are covered by color filters. That way light directed towards a pixel sensor first passes through a filter before interacting with the pixel sensor. The filters are often laid out on a grid of pixel sensors in patterns that are variations of the \u201cBayer\u201d pattern. For example, the filters over each pixel may be red, green, or blue arranged in a Bayer pattern. Usually 50% of the pixels are green 25% are blue and 25% are red so that the pixels only respond to the color of light that transmits through their color filter. There is a process for converting a Bayer pattern image to a RGB image where a processor computes a RGB value for each pixel. For example at a pixel that ordinarily measures a \u201cgreen\u201d value the RGB values may be completed by interpolating surrounding red pixel values and surrounding blue pixel values to that pixel. One method to record the RGB image is a variation of the AVI standard. Video sequences or individual pictures from a color camera are often recorded in AVI. Producing ghost images from AVI may result in high-quality ghost images. Occasionally, visual artifacts may be present in the ghost images due to the Bayer to RGB interpolation and conversion process. For some images that have been converted from Bayer to RGB it is possible to reverse the process to investigate what the ghost image would look like in the original Bayer pattern format.","For example, one means to convert back to a Bayer pattern image from a RGB image would be to extract the Bayer pixel color for each pixel location and zero out the interpolated color components. This would recover the underlying Bayer pattern image which could then be used to compute a ghost image that would be absent any artifacts from the interpolative or Bayer-to-RGB process.","Resolution of Conditional Product Terms","This section contains information on the conditional product terms. Conditional product terms are terms formed by correlations between values measured above or below the mean value. The values may represent intensity, polarization, or other physical quantities that are able to be measured. When these quantities have quantum properties or are able to be represented by quantum physics, such as photons or other quantum particles, then the resolution and visibility of the conditional product terms may be enhanced beyond conventional limits.","Positive and Negative G","The values of a particular Gcan be either positive or negative. A positive Gindicates that the measurements at an x, y pixel are correlated with the bucket measurements. A negative Gindicates that the two measurements are anti-correlated.","CASE 1: As an example assume that an ensemble of measurements is made at location (a) and location (b). For this case assume that the ensemble consists of two measurement realizations 1 and 2. For realization 1, I(1)=8 and I(1)=8. For realization 2, I(2)=2 and I(2)=2. G=<II>\u2212<I><I>, where < > indicates and average over the ensemble of realizations. For this ensemble, G=34\u221225=9. Examining Ia and Ib it is easy to see that the values of both of the measurements decrease at the same and typically referred to as correlated.","CASE 2: In a case where the ensemble of measurements is made at location (a) and location (b) for realizations 1 and 2, I(1)=2, I(1)=8 and I(1)=8, I(2)=2. Then G=16\u221225=\u22129. In this example Iincreases in magnitude from 2 to 8 while Ib decreases from 8 to 2. This is typically referred to as anti-correlated.","Multiple Buckets on Same Image","Bucket pixels can be allocated down to an individual pixel or a group of pixels in particular frames. The pixels in a group of pixel selected to be summed to a bucket (integrated intensities) value for a frame need not be contiguous. The bucket pixel or pixels may also be chosen on a per-frame basis. For instance, all pixels within 10% of the maximum pixel value for a frame may be chosen to be summed over for the bucket value for that frame. The spatial distribution of those pixels within 10% of the maximum pixel value is likely to change from frame to frame based on lighting conditions and turbulence\/obscuration effects between the target area and the measurement system. Furthermore, single pixel buckets or multiple pixel buckets may be utilized.","Bucket Pixel Selection for Each Reference Pixel","The criteria for selecting a set of pixels to use as a \u201cbucket\u201d value includes but is not limited to finding those pixels which contribute to improved contrast of the refined image, improving the convergence rate of the refined image, improving resolution of the refined image, improving the refined image fidelity to the imaged scene or target, finding optimal placement\/selection of pixel sensors as \u201cbuckets\u201d to minimize noise in refined image, providing enhanced resolution, to comply with certain Gmathematical constraints such as positivity, and to explore the computational, mathematical, and\/or physical effects of changing the bucket configuration. For example, we can compute a Gusing all the pixels in a frame to represent the bucket. A Grefined image may also be computed using only one pixel out of a set of pixels in a frame. We may see from comparison of two Gimages that the Gimage with the many pixel bucket provides different images than a Gimage using a single pixel. Furthermore, the Gimage changes with the pixel location or other physical property such as wavelength in the ensemble of frames array. This comparison provides image information about the effect of a single pixel \u201cbucket,\u201d its location and the many pixel \u201cbucket\u201d average of the ensemble of such pixels. From this information, the effect of bucket size (number of pixels used for the bucket) and shape (distribution of pixels in space and time used as the bucket) on the properties of the refined image can be determined which provides theoretical and practical benefits such as determining and implementation of optimized bucket selection to provide enhanced images of the target or region of interest.","Each pixel within a set of measurements (I), typically intensity values, taken using a camera may be indexed by a location x, y, k, i.e. I(xi, yj, k). When the locations of the measurement elements of the sensor are not arbitrarily distributed a pixel value can be indexed as I(i, j, k). The values of i vary from 1 to IMAX where IMAX is the number of horizontal pixels on the sensor, j varies from 1 to JMAX where JMAX is the number of vertical pixels on the sensor and k is the identifier for the frame number which varies from 1 to NFRAMES. For example a sensor may have 8 pixels in the horizontal (IMAX=8) and 8 pixels in the vertical (JMAX=8). If 10 images where measured with this sensor then NFRAMES would equal 10. In the current invention, a \u201cbucket\u201d value B(i, j, k) is determined on a per pixel basis for each pixel in the set of measured values. The \u201cbucket\u201d for say, pixel i=2, j=6, k=3 could be a normalized summation of pixels values. For example B(2, 6, 3) could be [I(1, 1, 1)+I(3, 8, 7)]\/2. B(3, 1, 1)=[I(2, 1, 2)+I(1, 9, 3)+I(10,10,9)]\/3. Then these bucket values B(i, j, k) can be used to compute a Gimage as <I(i, j, k)*B(i, j, k)>\u2212I(i, j)>*<B(i, j)> where < > indicates an ensemble average over the number of frame. In the current invention a previous embodiment would have the \u201cbucket\u201d or \u201coverall frame intensity\u201d defined as B(k)=\u03a3I(i, j, k) where the summation is over all i=1 to IMAX and j=1 to JMAX. The B(k) value for this embodiment would be applied to compute a Gimages as G=<I(i, j, k)*B(k)>\u2212<I(i, j)>*<B>.","Correlations Between Different Wavelengths","Reference values and bucket (integrated intensities of pixels) values may be allocated based upon the wavelength, or color, of the measured photons. For instance, measured green values on a color CCD or CMOS camera may be used to provide the reference field pixel measurements and measured red values may be allocated or summed to provide the value of the bucket measurement for a frame.","Infrared Between Bands","Modern advanced infrared cameras may provide per-pixel co-located measurements of infrared wavelengths in, for instance, the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) wavelength bands. One band may be used to provide reference pixel values and pixel in the other band can be allocated or summed to provide bucket values. A further, local Gtype calculation may take place wherein deviations from the ensemble mean of one wavelength band can be multiplied with deviations from the ensemble mean of the other wavelength band. These deviation products are performed for each pixel in a frame and summed over all the frames of data in the ensemble. A preferred methodology may therefore comprise dividing this deviation product sum by the total number of frames in the ensemble to yield a Gimage of the area of interest.","Coordinate Shifting of Pixel Values",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0234","num":"0233"},"figref":["FIG. 42","FIG. 42"],"b":["930","931","930","932","933","934","930","934"],"sup":["(2) ","(2) "],"sub":["i,j","i,j","i,j","i,j","i,j","i,j"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0235","num":"0234"},"figref":"FIG. 43"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0236","num":"0235"},"figref":["FIG. 44","FIGS. 43 and 44","FIGS. 1"],"b":["2","40","41","38","58","68","78","98","118","78"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0237","num":"0236"},"figref":"FIGS. 45 to 47"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0238","num":"0237"},"figref":["FIG. 45","FIG. 46"]},"Taken together,  outline the steps of an alternate preferred methodology involving selecting a set of pixels to generate a normalized sum to use as a \u201cbucket\u201d value for each measured pixel value in the plurality of frames.

A smaller subset of G(k) can be summed over a sub-ensemble, k=1 to N where N is less than the total number of frames in the ensemble to provide an improved image.

When the G(k) are summed and averaged over a set of frames that is less than the total number of frame this constitutes a sub-ensemble Gcalculation. This sub-ensemble improved Gimage can highlight different features of the area of interest and may further provide a means to generate improved image frames for a movie of the area of interest.","The movies produced by this method can separate scale of turbulence. Separate scales of turbulence can be better images by the ability to choose different sizes of an ensemble and different size sets within an ensemble to use as the sub-ensemble.","Iterative Improvement Techniques","An iterative means to calculate in improved Gimage could involve progressively incorporating more or fewer pixels of the measured frames to be summed over for a bucket value. One such method would be to choose a single pixel location to provide the bucket values over all frames. A Gimage would then be computed using those bucket values. A new set of bucket values would be selected based on some criteria, such as choosing pixel locations where the Gvalue is greater than 0. A new Gimage is computed and the process iterated until no new pixels are being added to or removed from the set of pixels being used to provide bucket values. Criteria other than the positivity of the Gmay be used to emphasize or converge to differing features in the Gimage of the area of interest.","Iterative techniques may generally refer to methods wherein a sequence of operations is repeated to achieve a desired result. These types of methods sometimes have stopping criteria that are based on an estimated error parameter falling below some specified value. When this criterion is met the iteration is said to have \u201cconverged\u201d to a solution. However, due to sometimes slow or erratic convergence a counter of the number of times the sequence of operations has been performed is often tracked. This number is sometimes called the iteration number. A further halting criterion beyond that of the iterative technique achieving the specified convergence is a maximum iteration number. This maximum iteration number criterion is desirable when computational operations must be completed within a specified time and to prevent so called \u201cinfinite loops\u201d where the iterative technique is unable, due to round off or other error, to achieve the convergence criterion.","Area of Interest as an Imperfect Mirror","When an area of interest is illuminated by a source of photons such as for example, the Sun, laser, LED, etc, the illuminated area acts as an imperfect mirror of the illuminating source. A perfect mirror would acts to reflect the photons from the illuminating source where the angle of incidence would equal the angle of reflection. Furthermore, the perfect mirror would not absorb any of the incident photons. However, a region of interest may contain many differing scattering and absorbing elements. All of these elements are illuminated by the source and when the reflected and scattered photons from the region of interest are measured some information about the spatial distribution of photons of the light source is retained. It is this retained information of the spatial distribution of photons that enables a series of images measured with a single sensor of a region of interest to act much as a typical two sensor ghost imaging system wherein one of the sensors for a ghost imager measures only undisturbed spatial distributions of photons from the light source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0273","num":"0272"},"figref":"FIG. 55","b":["5501","5502","5503","5504","5505"]},"Next, in step , each R, G, B value per pixel is summed over all frames and stored in an array, RS, GS, BS.

In one embodiment, a pair of entangled photons with nearly the same transverse momentum from an entangled photon source can be collinearly-propagated towards a remote target. The entangled photons may be directed towards specific areas on the remote target using a pointing and aiming device. The entangle photons that reflect off of a remote target can be measured by photon detectors. When the entangled photon source operates in a pulsed manner then an elapsed time from a particular pulse to the first entangled photon pair measurement that returns from target may be determined. The time that it takes from the pulsed source to the target and back to the photon detectors indicates the distance of the target from the entangled photon source and detector system. Since entangled photons may be recognized by consideration that the entangled photons are formed at virtually the same time and therefore if they take the same path they must arrive at the detectors at nearly the same time or in coincidence. An advantage of this type of coincidence measurement is that background noise from single photon measurements can be ignored and only detection measurements that happen in pairs within some small time interval will be used to provide a more accurate determination of distance to a remote target. Consider, for instance, the case where a single pulse of entangle photons is propagated and when the pulse contains more than one pair of entangled photons then several coincidences may be measured after reflecting off of the remote target. The first pair of entangled photons to be detected would be indicative of reflection of the entangled photons from a nearer target distance than later entangled photon measurements generated by the same pulse. The locus of target points indicated by the detection events would describe the shape and distance of the target from the setup comprising the entangled photon source and detectors. Photons that were received after the first entangled photons are indicative of photons that have traveled further than the nearest points of the target and may have been scattered by the environment or within the body of the target over a longer path before being measured. Scatterers in the environment may include the atmosphere, dust, fog, air pollution, etc. It should be appreciated that this process would apply to propagation in water, liquids, oceans, solids such as glass, and other media such as biological tissues.","In the non-collinearly propagating entangled photon case when the photons are directed towards a remote target then each photon of the pair likely will be reflected off of different areas of the remote target.","Two detectors can measure the photons in a small time interval, i.e. coincidence time window. One detector can act as a bucket detector and the other detector can determine the reference location of the measured photon. Thus the entangled photons can be used for ghost imaging, higher-order imaging, but also determine the distance of each measured pixel from the entangled photon source to the detectors setup. Of course, the timing must consider the path from the source to the target and back to the detectors.","The first entangled photon pair back may be calculated from the time of the pulse. One or more optical delays may be included to allow a longer path and thereby allow longer time delays to measure a coincidence event. Typical optical delays that may be used are for example, lenses, quartz rods, fiber-free space optical delay line, slow light media, or quantum memories.","Motion of Target in a GImage","Ghost imaging, sometimes called higher order or Gimaging, may be used to identify the motion of objects within a region of interest. If the time period for forming a ghost imaging is too short then the motion cannot be detected in a single ghost imaging frame. A ghost imaging movie can be made by stringing together such a series of frames covering a time period over which an object is moving. This way, the object motion does not smear the ghost image but rather resolves each of the individual frames in the series. However, there is another way to indicate motion of an object within a region of interest via ghost imaging. If the object moves at least one pixel, a series of measurement frames are collected, then a ghost image using those frames may resolve the object. But signatures of the object motion will appear on the ghost image. In the case of the all-positive form for a ghost image using conditional products, (R+R\u2212(R+R)), then edges of the moving object can be distinguished by above background positive magnitudes. The ghost image made from positive and negative quadrants, (R+R+(R+R)), will still visually appear as an improved image. The separate terms, R, R, R, R, may have both edge and improved image qualities. It is to be noted that Gmay take on both positive and negative values depending on location within the image. That is, some points will be positive or zero valued and other points will have negative values. The ghost images produced can still acquire the turbulence free ghost imaging properties even though the signs may change. That is the images will still be enhanced and improved over conventional images. A constant can be added to the ghost image to guarantee its positivity to satisfy certain rendering requirements. Thus, ghost imaging of moving objects has the benefit in that it can produce edge maps of the scene and indicate objects that are moving such as to separate them from stationary objects in the same region of interest. Such edge maps and identification of moving objects can be very useful for many human endeavors requiring such benefits that may include machine vision for robotics, intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance, moving object pointing and tracking, medical imaging of moving organs, law enforcement, military situational awareness, documentation of flow lines of moving media, earthquake motion, or missile motion. For example, transmission of a single ghost image identifying moving objects in a scene is more efficient than transmitting a movie with many frames. As a further example the edge image generated by ghost imaging can be mapped to a 1 bit per pixel image where only those edges greater than some threshold are set to a value of 1 and all other pixels are set to zero to greatly increase transmission efficiency. Ghost imaging of the Earth from satellite or aircraft can indicate changes in terrain features and crop evolution. Ghost images of outer space from the Earth may indicate the outlines of moving satellites more clearly and distinguish them from background. Ghost imaging can also be applied to indicate the motion of underwater objects more clearly, or objects in moving media more clearly.","It must be appreciated that all-positive enhanced images for higher order, i.e. G, G, . . . , G, images can be calculated by combining the products of the higher order quadrant terms may be grouped such that an individual conditional product term (R) has a positive or a negative value. The all positive Gcan then be determined by adding together those Rterms with positive values and subtracting the negative valued Rterms. In the following Ris shorted to R for ease is reading. For example an all positive Gwould have R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, conditional product terms. The conditional product terms that have positive values are R, R, R and, R. The conditional terms with negative values are R, R, R, and R. So an all-positive Gwould have the form (R+R+R+R)\u2212(R+R+R+R). Similar groupings can be determined and used to calculate other all-positive G(N) enhanced images.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0296","num":"0295"},"figref":"FIG. 72","b":["4901","4902","4903","4904","4904","4904","4904","4904"]},"Box  is an entangled photon source.

More particularly, the time-frequency properties of the detectors may be such that they do not resolve the Gcorrelations which would normally yield an enhanced image.

But the inventors have found that, with filtering, these measurements can still nonetheless produce an enhanced image processing. Thus, in some embodiments filtering (i) the individual detector measurement events before determining the Gcorrelations, and\/or (ii) during the determination of the joint coincidences, may yield enhanced images since the resolvable filtered components of the Gwould be processed.","Entanglement Swapping","Entanglement swapping is a quantum process by which particles that are not entangled become entangled with each other. For example, consider that particles 1 (P1) and 2 (P2) are entangled with each other and that particles 3 (P3) and 4 (P4) are entangled with each other. To entangle P1 and P4, particles P2 and P3 are interfered on a beam splitter and then are measured. The interference and measurement swaps the entanglements P1\u2212P2 and P3\u2212P4 to P1\u2212P4. Particles P2 and P3 are also affected by the measurement device and may be absorbed. The process of entanglement swapping has previously been verified. See, e.g., Bouwmeister et al. [Physical Review Letters 80, 3891-3894 May 1998] which described a process of entanglement swapping with experimental verification using entangled photons. Swapping may be considered as the teleportation of an unknown photon\/particle state onto another photon\/particle.","The process of entanglement swapping has many potential applications in the development of quantum technology. Thus far, relatively few applications have found uses for entanglement swapping. Potential applications for entanglement swapping in quantum technology include quantum computing, quantum communications and, in the current invention, quantum imaging. There are potentially many benefits to using entanglement swapping for quantum imaging that have not yet been described or exploited. The reason for this is that entanglement swapping has required high precision in its implementation and great expense for equipment that achieves the high precision. The lack of robust applications for entanglement swapping has been another drawback to its implementation in technology. This technology is being miniaturized in solid state devices and some components are being tested on chips. These quantum chips, can generated entangled particles and perform interference operations and measurements of quantum states.","It would be beneficial to have an entanglement swapping application that is robust and can be implemented with both available and evolving technologies. One way to make entanglement swapping useful would be to apply it information transfer, sharing, or communication without the need for a classical communications channel. For example, the current Internet, radio, and telephone are generally considered to be classical communications channels. Another way to make entanglement swapping useful would be to be able to transfer, share or communicate by quantum means without the sender or receiver needing access to information or resources held by the other. For example, the sender having access to photons P2, P3 and the receiver having access to photons P1, P4 is sufficient to transfer information from sender to receiver. Repetition of this process allows the transfer of images without sending classical information and by only sharing entanglement. This type of communication of information, such as data and\/or images, would be difficult to detect by an external observer since there would be no particle or radiation going between the sender and the receiver which an observer would be able to sense and follow. Military and domestic applications requiring stealth and\/or security would benefit from this capability.","Benefits of entanglement swapping for quantum imaging may include performing an entanglement swap to optimize photon detection efficiency while simultaneously optimizing transmission properties from an illumination source to a target. Another benefit is that an entanglement swap may be used to measure absorption maps of a target without the need to measure reflected photons. Furthermore, entanglement swapping may be used to help compute the product of the absorption values at two locations on a target. Using the environment to enable entanglement swapping provides a direct and remote measurement on the environment. For example, absorption of photons by a remote target can be sensed by the enabling of quantum swapping of entangled particles which can be measured remotely without need for the return of photons from the target. It should be noted that besides images of absorption fields of targets any property can be imaged by enabling quantum swapping when the quantum particle is sensitive to the effects of object. Furthermore, with time sequencing this provides range information from, for example, the source of entangled quantum particles to target features. It should be further realized that the source or sources of the entangled quantum particles need not be located with the equipment used to direct particles towards a target (sender) or located with the equipment that measured those entangled particles that never directly interacted with the target (receiver). For example, the source or sources of the entangled particles may be on a satellite that would send the entangled particle pairs to the \u201csender\u201d equipment and \u201creceiver\u201d equipment. Alternately, both the sender and receiver may have a single entangled quantum particle source and each shares one particle of their entangled particle pairs with the other. The identification of which particles are entangled with each other relative to initial entangled pair creation times may be achieved using an auxiliary time stamp, e.g. a laser pulse encoded with time information for each entangled photon pair created, that propagates with each particle of each entangled particle pair. Also, the use of an entanglement source such as the one described in  does not have an issue (or question) as to the identification of which particles are entangled as there is only a single source that sequentially generates entangled particles. Although not obvious, we consider it possible to use thermal light photon number fluctuations and their correlations and quantum illumination for variations of teleportation and swapping in our current inventions with swapping.","Further benefits of entanglement swapping applied to quantum imaging using measurements of reflected photons may include application to quantum imaging of remote targets and microscopy with the images being generated for the user at a distant location with entangled photons that did not interact directly with the target. The reflected photons may be further used to compute the product of reflectance or the product of reflected intensities of at least two locations on the target. Current imaging systems, such as cameras, are dependent on producing imaging using photons that have directly interacted with the target. The sharing of images taken by a camera normally requires communication by electromagnetic radiation that takes specific paths to communicate a facsimile of the image between sender and receiver. Even quantum teleportation requires a classical communication channel using electromagnetic radiation that takes specific paths to communicate. It would be beneficial to use entanglement swapping to communicate images or quantum images that does not require a classical communications channel to complete the transfer of images between a sender and a distant user at the receiver in order to avoid having the classical communications channel blocked which would also block image communication. Communication information transfer using entanglement swapping would be an entirely quantum process. The speed of quantum information has been recently been reported as being greater than or equal to 1.37*10times the speed of light See, J Yin et al. [Physical Review Letters 110, 260407 June 2013]. The benefits of utilizing swapping in the process of quantum communications is that communications would be at the speed of the quantum information even if it is faster than the speed of light which can be beneficial for many applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0312","num":"0311"},"figref":"FIG. 79","b":["4901","4902","4903","4904","4904"]},"The system is specifically configured to transmit entangled photon pairs to the region of interest.

Element A is similar to  and directs portions of the entering entangled photon pairs towards measurement devices  and . Coincidence measurements of the entangled photons directed to element A are used to generate a reflection image of the target  with information that is provided by the shared entanglement properties of the entangled photons that were directed from  to telescope A. It is to be appreciated that this invention will operate to generate an improved image of the target where the target may be partially absorbing and\/or partially reflecting.","Potential Applications","Gimaging in the infrared may be useful for applications in: art, medical imaging of blood vessels, identify and face recognition, imaging of blood vessels, medical imaging of blood vessel flow over the face and other parts of the body, and remote feature extraction.","A further application is terahertz ghost imaging. The methods and techniques of this invention apply to all electromagnetic wavelengths. Gamma rays, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave, and radio waves and terahertz radiation can be utilized to produce improved images of a region of interest.","The potential extent of possible use of this invention is described in the following. However, this description should not be construed as limited to the statements. Potential applications include high resolution imaging, remote sensing, microscopic sensing, phase-contrast imaging or microscopy, astronomical imaging, physics, chemistry, biology, medical applications, quality control, surveillance, surface tampering detection, imaging partially occluded scenes, spectroscopy, raman spectroscopy, satellite imaging, detection of exoplanets, identification of hidden or concealed objects, remote biometrics, design of new sensors and image processing methods, design of new types of stealth technology, design of new types of communications devices. Furthermore, the methods and techniques can be used to determine characteristics of imaging sensors and discover favorable or unfavorable artifacts and properties including but not limited to spatial and temporal noise.","Speed Traffic Enforcement\u2014Current local governments use traffic enforcement cameras to enforce traffic regulation violations. A traffic enforcement camera (also road safety camera, road rule camera, photo radar, speed camera, Gatso\u2122) is an automated ticketing machine. It may include a camera which may be mounted besides, on, or over a highway or installed in an enforcement vehicle to detect traffic regulation violations, including speeding, vehicles going through a red traffic light, unauthorized use of a bus lane, for recording vehicles inside a congestion charge area and others. The latest automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems can be used for the detection of average speeds and use optical character recognition on images to read the license plates on vehicles. There are a number of possible factors that affect the ANPR software performance. One of these important factors is poor image resolution, usually because the plate is too far away but sometimes resulting from the use of a low-quality camera. In the case of camera recording a video (a sequence of images), this invention can process the recorded images to improve image quality of the license plate on vehicle. The enhanced license plate images are used to improve the performance of ANPR software. The invention is especially useful when the images are acquired from a far away distance and\/or from a low-quality camera.","The invention may be utilized in conjunction with large crowd event security and management. Events involving a large crowd, especially the types of events including circuses, sporting events, theatrical events, concerts, rallies, parades, etc., the security task is to prevent, where possible, crimes including theft, vandalism or assault through the deployment of trained and licensed security personnel. Camera monitoring is an important component in this type of event security and management. The invention can be used to improve image details of a human face, nomenclature on a jersey, or a moving object\/vehicle, etc., from a distance, or from the periphery of the event location. Also at football games, a preferred embodiment could be used to enhance the readability of numbers and\/or names on football uniforms.","As used herein, the terminology \u201csubject\u201d means: an area, a scene, an object or objects, a landscape, overhead view of land or an object or objects, or a combination thereof.","As used herein, the terminology \u201cframe\u201d means: a picture, an image or one of the successive pictures on a strip of film or video.","As used herein, the terminology \u201cprocess\u201d means an algorithm, software, subroutine, computer program, or methodology.","As used herein, the terminology \u201calgorithm\u201d means: sequence of steps using computer software, process, software, subroutine, computer program, or methodology.","As used herein, the terminology \u201cimage sensor\u201d means: a camera, bucket detector, CMOS, SPAD, quantum well, LIDAR, LADAR, charge coupled device (CCD), video device, spatial sensor, light field (plenoptic) camera, gyro-stabilized camera, spatial phase sensitive camera, or range sensor. The image sensor may comprise a device having a shutter controlled aperture that, when opened, admits light enabling an object to be focused, usually by means of a lens, onto a surface, thereby producing a photographic image OR a device in which the picture is formed before it is changed into electric impulses.","The terminology \u201ccamera\u201d as used in the following claims includes devices which measure intensity of photons to produce images. Cameras which can take a series of images may be termed video cameras. Many individual cameras have circuitry to allow the capture and storage of video sequences and hence are called video cameras. Cameras are often embedded or attached to computers or smart\/cell phones or other types of phones. Cameras may be sensitive to one or more wavelengths of light. Color cameras are sensitive to more than one wavelength band of light and can distinguish between those wavelength bands. For example, color cameras may sense red, green, and blue at separate pixels. Color cameras may use a Bayer pattern for collection of more than one wavelength band and use methods for Bayer interpolation to provide intensity for each wavelength band at each pixel. Digital cameras are readily interfaced to digital computers. Analog cameras need analog-to-digital (A\/D) circuitry to transfer images from the camera to a digital computer processor. For example, a digital camera is a device used for measuring images of a region of interest. Some digital cameras such as charged coupled devices (CCDs) have an advantage of being able to achieve low image noise especially when cooled. High quality CCDs may have an electronic cooling capability to lower image noise. CCD cameras may have readout or processing noise. CMOS cameras also called complementary metal oxide cameras. CMOS cameras may have an advantage of lower cost and may have lower readout noise but may have higher image noise. CMOS cameras can also be cooled to achieve improved properties. Analog cameras have been used in television industry and may have advantages where digital cameras should not be used. For example, analog cameras may be less susceptible to digital computer viruses. Analog cameras may already be used as sensors in a wide variety of applications. Analog cameras may be made using photo-diodes. Photo-diodes measure single or multiple photons and in general the total intensity of light falling on the diode. Photo-diodes have a small or large active area which allows them to be used as point or area detectors such as photon bucket detectors. Plenoptic cameras utilize an alternate means to record information of a scene or region of interest than conventional cameras. Plenoptic cameras record light coming into the camera through more than one lens. The measurements are saved in a manner that can be combined to achieve refocusing of the image after the measurements are made. As plenoptic cameras improve, they will be able to store measured light with higher resolution and speed.","The terminology \u201cSPAD\u201d as used in the following claims means Single Photon Avalanche Diode. SPAD arrays can be used to form an image of an area of interest in terms of single photon counts for a specified period of time at each SPAD location. Currently SPADs can operate in the nano-seconds and pico-seconds but it is expected that their speeds may improve even further. Since SPADs can be individually addressed with electronic logic they may be suitable for a wide variety of multi-photon interference applications such as for producing enhanced images in cases with and without obscurants and\/or turbulence. SPADs are becoming more common because the technology is advancing to lower the cost of SPAD arrays. SPADs may also be coupled with illumination timing circuits such as laser triggers to be able to measure time-of-flight for an emitted laser pulse to travel to a target and return to a particular SPAD pixel. Thus each pixel of a SPAD array in this case can be used to represent a distance or depth map between the SPAD sensor and a corresponding location on a target in the region of interest. Such a distance or depth map would indicate not only the intensity of light reflected and returned but also the distance to the target at each corresponding point.","The terminology \u201cLIDAR\u201d as used in the following claims means Light Detection and Ranging. LIDAR devices use lasers to measure distances to an object. Often LIDARs are pulsed but they may alternatively be modulated in periodic or aperiodic ways in order to determine distance such as by use of phase modulation. LIDARs may be scanned to produce an image and range map also giving depth and 3D information of the target in the region of interest.","The terminology \u201cLADAR\u201d as used in the following claims means Laser Radar which produces an image or a map of objects at a distance from the laser source. LADARs may use scanning or \u201cflash\u201d methods. Flash methods are distinguished from scanning methods in that a larger region of target is illuminated at nearly the same time. Whereas a single laser beam scan illuminates different parts of the target at sequential times. However, arrays of lasers may also be used to illuminate different parts of a target at approximately the same time. Each laser when used in combination with a synchronized sensor produces a distance to the target in addition to a strength of intensity return.","The terminology \u201cdisplay device\u201d as used in the following claims include a display capable of rendering a display. These ways may include rendering on a screen, cathode ray tube (CRT), glasses, liquid crystal diodes (LCDs), light emitting diode (LED) arrays, plasma screens, projectors projecting onto a surface, or even to the eyes. Modern televisions (TVs), sometimes called smart TVs, not only render images for viewing but also render the images into other formats which may be interfaced to other imaging, multi-media, computing, or recording devices such as digital video recorders (DVRs), through free-space (e.g. WiFi or Bluetooth), electrical wiring, and optical fiber.","The terminology \u201cprocessor\u201d or \u201cimage processor\u201d as used in the following claims includes a computer, multiprocessor, CPU, GPU, FPGA, minicomputer, microprocessor or any machine similar to a computer or processor which is capable of processing algorithms.","The terminology \u201coperations\u201d as used in the following claims includes steps, a series of operations, actions, processes, subprocesses, acts, functions, and\/or subroutines.","As used herein the terminology \u201csuccession\u201d means the act or process of following in order or sequence, but is not limited to sequential order. As used herein the terminology \u201csuccession\u201d refers to a later taken image being compared with an earlier taken image.","As used herein the terminology \u201carray\u201d refers to a systematic arrangement of data in rows and columns. An example of an array is a matrix which is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions. Examples of arrays include a matrix which is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions and a vector which is a linear array of numbers, symbols or expressions.","As used herein, the terminology \u201cphase\u201d refers to a property of waves that measures the advance of one wave relative to another wave or that wave at an earlier place in space-time. Quantum particles such as photons having some wave properties may exhibit phase properties. Phase differences may be manifest as interference or diffraction fringes. Since images are the result of interaction of quantum particles with reflective or scattering objects they can exhibit interference fringes as signatures of instantaneous or average phase variations. Often objects that exhibit some fringes can be referred to as phase objects. \u201cPhase information\u201d refers to images that provide indications such as interference or diffraction fringes induced by the target and its environment. Phase information can be useful to distinguish features of the target that are generally not as recognizable without the phase information. Phase is discussed in R. E. Meyers, K. S. Deacon, and Y. H. Shih, \u201cTurbulence-free ghost imaging,\u201d Appl. Phys. Lett. 98, 111115 (2011), R. E. Meyers, K. S. Deacon, and Y. H. Shih, \u201cPositive-negative turbulence-free ghost imaging,\u201d Appl. Phys. Lett. 100, 131114 (2012). As used herein the terminology, \u201cSPAD\u201d refers to an array of Single Photon Counting Detectors that is used for imaging.","As used herein the terminology, \u201csynchronous\u201d means data or frames that are acquired at the time or are time coincident.","As used herein the terminology, \u201casynchronous\u201d means data or frames that are not acquired at the same time or are not time coincident.","As used herein the terminology, \u201clight\u201d is meant to describe electro-magnetic energy of any portion of the electro-magnetic spectrum to include, but not limited to, cosmic rays, x-rays, ultra-violet, visible, infra red, terahertz, microwave, and radio waves. Light may be measured in terms of its photons or fields.","As used herein for those embodiments that indicate two or more sensors, the sensors need not be co-located and may be distant from the other sensor(s), each sensor would have optionally present optical elements such as lenses or telescopes, each sensor system could optionally consist of a processor and memory, and further include means to exchange measurement values with other remotely located sensor system locations.","Super-resolution generally refers to methods and techniques that enhance the resolution of an imaging system. This resolution increase can mean exceeding the diffraction limit \u0394L=1.22*f*\u03bb\/D where \u0394L is the spatial resolution, f is the focal length of the lens, X the wavelength of the light and D the diameter of the lens aperture, or super-resolution may involve extracting sub-pixel features from an image or set of images using digital image processing techniques.","For the current invention, one way to enhance the resolution is to distribute the measured intensity value at pixels onto a finer scale array of pixel. For example, a 2\u00d72 array of pixels could be expanded to a 4\u00d74 pixel array. Each pixel of the coarse 2\u00d72 array may be partitioned into another 2\u00d72 pixel where each pixel of the fine scale array would be apportioned \u00bc of the value of the parent coarse pixel. This type of distribution is sometimes referred to as \u201cinjection\u201d. Another method to distribute values to a finer grid from a coarse grid would involve interpolation techniques such as bilinear interpolation where values interior to four surrounding points are a bounded linear combination of the values at the four surrounding points.","The invention can be used with measurements of quantum particles. There are many quantum particles including but not limited to photons, electrons, neutrons, protons, atoms, ions, mesons, and positrons. Photons, mesons, neutral atoms or molecules are bosons. Fermions include quantum particles such as electrons, ionized atoms and ionized molecules sometimes referred to as ions.","The invention can be used to generate improved images through a variety of gaseous, solid, or liquid media or mixtures of these that are at least partially transparent to quantum particles. These media may include but are not limited to, for instance, glasses, diamond, silicon, water and air. As an example, images captured with an underwater camera can be used as input for the inventive process for enhancement as well as images taken through say an air-water interface such as an imaging system on a boat looking down into the water or a submerged imaging looking into the air above the water.","Although various preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described herein in detail to provide for complete and clear disclosure, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that variations may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention.","It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments are merely possible examples of implementations.
