In particular, such Apo2L\/TRAIL formulations include lyophilized and crystal compositions.","Various molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (\u201cTNF-alpha\u201d), tumor necrosis factor-beta (\u201cTNF-beta\u201d or \u201clymphotoxin-alpha\u201d), lymphotoxin-beta (\u201cLT-beta\u201d), CD30 ligand, CD27 ligand, CD40 ligand, OX-40 ligand, 4-1BB ligand, Apo-1 ligand (also referred to as Fas ligand or CD95 ligand), Apo-2 ligand (also referred to as Apo2L or TRAIL), Apo-3 ligand (also referred to as TWEAK), APRIL, OPG ligand (also referred to as RANK ligand, ODF, or TRANCE), and TALL-1 (also referred to as BlyS, BAFF or THANK) have been identified as members of the tumor necrosis factor (\u201cTNF\u201d) family of cytokines [See, e.g., Gruss and Dower, 85:3378-3404 (1995); Schmid et al., 83:1881 (1986); Dealtry et al., 17:689 (1987); Pitti et al., 271:12687-12690 (1996); Wiley et al., 3:673-682 (1995); Browning et al., 72:847-856 (1993); Armitage et al. 357:80-82 (1992), WO 97\/01633 published Jan. 16, 1997; WO 97\/25428 published Jul. 17, 1997; Marsters et al., 8:525-528 (1998); Chicheportiche et al., 272:32401-32410 (1997); Hahne et al., 188:1185-1190 (1998); WO98\/28426 published Jul. 2, 1998; WO98\/46751 published Oct. 22, 1998; WO\/98\/18921 published May 7, 1998; Moore et al., 285:260-263 (1999); Shu et al., 65:680 (1999); Schneider et al., 189:1747-1756 (1999); Mukhopadhyay et al., 274:15978-15981 (1999)]. Among these molecules, TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, CD30 ligand, 4-1BB ligand, Apo-1 ligand, Apo-2 ligand (Apo2L\/TRAIL) and Apo-3 ligand (TWEAK) have been reported to be involved in apoptotic cell death.","Apo2L\/TRAIL was identified several years ago as a member of the TNF family of cytokines. [see, e.g., Wiley et al., 3:673-682 (1995); Pitti et al., 271:12697-12690 (1996)] The full-length human Apo2L\/TRAIL polypeptide is a 281 amino acid long, Type II transmembrane protein. Some cells can produce a natural soluble form of the polypeptide, through enzymatic cleavage of the polypeptide's extracellular region [Mariani et al., 137:221-229 (1997)]. Crystallographic studies of soluble forms of Apo2L\/TRAIL reveal a homotrimeric structure similar to the structures of TNF and other related proteins [Hymowitz et al., 4:563-571 (1999); Hymowitz et al., 39:633-644 (2000)]. Apo2L\/TRAIL, unlike other TNF family members however, was found to have a unique structural feature in that three cysteine residues (at position 230 of each subunit in the homotrimer) together coordinate a zinc atom, and that the zinc binding is important for trimer stability and biological activity. [Hymowitz et al., supra; Bodmer et al., 275:20632-20637 (2000)]","It has been reported in the literature that Apo2L\/TRAIL may play a role in immune system modulation, including autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and in the treatment of HIV [see, e.g., Thomas et al., 161:2195-2200 (1998); Johnsen et al., 11:664-672 (1999); Griffith et al., 189:1343-1353 (1999); Song et al., 191:1095-1103 (2000); Jeremias et al., 28:143-152 (1998); Katsikis et al., 186:1365-1372 (1997); Miura et al., 193:651-660 (2001)].","Soluble forms of Apo2L\/TRAIL have also been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells in vitro, including colon, lung, breast, prostate, bladder, kidney, ovarian and brain tumors, as well as melanoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma [see, e.g., Wiley et al., supra; Pitti et al., supra; Rieger et al., 427:124-128 (1998); Ashkenazi et al., 104:155-162 (1999); Walczak et al., 5:157-163 (1999); Keane et al., 59:734-741 (1999); Mizutani et al., 5:2605-2612 (1999); Gazitt, 13:1817-1824 (1999); Yu et al., 60:2384-2389 (2000); Chinnaiyan et al., 97:1754-1759 (2000)]. In vivo studies in murine tumor models further suggest that Apo2L\/TRAIL, alone or in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, can exert substantial anti-tumor effects [see, e.g., Ashkenazi et al., supra; Walzcak et al., supra; Gliniak et al., 59:6153-6158 (1999); Chinnaiyan et al., supra; Roth et al., 265:1999 (1999)]. In contrast to many types of cancer cells, most normal human cell types appear to be resistant to apoptosis induction by certain recombinant forms of Apo2L\/TRAIL [Ashkenazi et al., supra; Walzcak et al., supra]. Jo et al. has reported that a polyhistidine-tagged soluble form of Apo2L\/TRAIL induced apoptosis in vitro in normal isolated human, but not non-human, hepatocytes [Jo et al., 6:564-567 (2000); see also, Nagata, 6:502-503 (2000)]. It is believed that certain recombinant Apo2L\/TRAIL preparations may vary in terms of biochemical properties and biological activities on diseased versus normal cells, depending, for example, on the presence or absence of a tag molecule, zinc content, and % trimer content [See, Lawrence et al., 7:383-385 (2001); Qin et al., 7:385-386 (2001)].","Induction of various cellular responses mediated by such TNF family cytokines is believed to be initiated by their binding to specific cell receptors. Previously, two distinct TNF receptors of approximately 55-kDa (TNFR1) and 75-kDa (TNFR2) were identified [Hohman et al., 264:14927-14934 (1989); Brockhaus et al., 87:3127-3131 (1990); EP 417,563, published Mar. 20, 1991; Loetscher et al., 61:351 (1990); Schall et al., 61:361 (1990); Smith et al., 248:1019-1023 (1990); Lewis et al., 88:2830-2834 (1991); Goodwin et al., 11:3020-3026 (1991)]. Those TNFRs were found to share the typical structure of cell surface receptors including extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular regions. The extracellular portions of both receptors were found naturally also as soluble TNF-binding proteins [Nophar, Y. et al., 9:3269 (1990); and Kohno, T. et al., 87:8331 (1990); Hale et al., 151991, p. 113 (P424)].","The extracellular portion of type 1 and type 2 TNFRs (TNFR1 and TNFR2) contains a repetitive amino acid sequence pattern of four cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) designated 1 through 4, starting from the NH-terminus. [Schall et al., supra; Loetscher et al., supra; Smith et al., supra; Nophar et al., supra; Kohno et al., supra; Banner et al., 73:431-435 (1993)]. A similar repetitive pattern of CRDs exists in several other cell-surface proteins, including the p75 nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) [Johnson et al., 47:545 (1986); Radeke et al., 325:593 (1987)], the B cell antigen CD40 [Stamenkovic et al., 8:1403 (1989)], the T cell antigen OX40 [Mallet et al., 9:1063 (1990)] and the Fas antigen [Yonehara et al., supra and Itoh et al., 66:233-243 (1991)]. CRDs are also found in the soluble TNFR (sTNFR)-like T2 proteins of the Shope and myxoma poxviruses [Upton et al., 160:20-29 (1987); Smith et al., 176:335 (1991); Upton et al., 184:370 (1991)]. Optimal alignment of these sequences indicates that the positions of the cysteine residues are well conserved. These receptors are sometimes collectively referred to as members of the TNF\/NGF receptor superfamily.","The TNF family ligands identified to date, with the exception of lymphotoxin-beta, are typically type II transmembrane proteins, whose C-terminus is extracellular. In contrast, most receptors in the TNF receptor (TNFR) family identified to date are typically type I transmembrane proteins. In both the TNF ligand and receptor families, however, homology identified between family members has been found mainly in the extracellular domain (\u201cECD\u201d). Several of the TNF family cytokines, including TNF-alpha, Apo-1 ligand and CD40 ligand, are cleaved proteolytically at the cell surface; the resulting protein in each case typically forms a homotrimeric molecule that functions as a soluble cytokine. TNF receptor family proteins are also usually cleaved proteolytically to release soluble receptor ECDs that can function as inhibitors of the cognate cytokines.","Pan et al. have disclosed another TNF receptor family member referred to as \u201cDR4\u201d [Pan et al., 276:111-113 (1997); see also WO98\/32856 published Jul. 30, 1998]. The DR4 was reported to contain a cytoplasmic death domain capable of engaging the cell suicide apparatus. Pan et al. disclose that DR4 is believed to be a receptor for the ligand known as Apo2L\/TRAIL.","In Sheridan et al., 277:818-821 (1997) and Pan et al., 277:815-818 (1997), another molecule believed to be a receptor for Apo2L\/TRAIL is described [see also, WO98\/51793 published Nov. 19, 1998; WO98\/41629 published Sep. 24, 1998]. That molecule is referred to as DR5 (it has also been alternatively referred to as Apo-2; TRAIL-R, TR6, Tango-63, hAPO8, TRICK2 or KILLER [Screaton et al., 7:693-696 (1997); Walczak et al., 16:5386-5387 (1997); Wu et al., 17:141-143 (1997); WO98\/35986 published Aug. 20, 1998; EP870,827 published Oct. 14, 1998; WO98\/46643 published Oct. 22, 1998; WO99\/02653 published Jan. 21, 1999; WO99\/09165 published Feb. 25, 1999; WO99\/11791 published Mar. 11, 1999]. Like DR4, DR5 is reported to contain a cytoplasmic death domain and be capable of signaling apoptosis. The crystal structure of the complex formed between Apo-2L\/TRAIL and DR5 is described in Hymowitz et al., 4:563-571 (1999).","A further group of recently identified receptors are referred to as \u201cdecoy receptors,\u201d which are believed to function as inhibitors, rather than transducers of signaling. This group includes DCR1 (also referred to as TRID, LIT or TRAIL-R3) [Pan et al., 276:111-113 (1997); Sheridan et al., 277:818-821 (1997); McFarlane et al., 272:25417-25420 (1997); Schneider et al., 416:329-334 (1997); Degli-Esposti et al., 186:1165-1170 (1997); and Mongkolsapaya et al., 160:3-6 (1998)] and DCR2 (also called TRUNDD or TRAIL-R4) [Marsters et al., 7:1003-1006 (1997); Pan et al., 424:41-45 (1998); Degli-Esposti et al., 7:813-820 (1997)], both cell surface molecules, as well as OPG [Simonet et al., supra; Emery et al., infra] and DCR3 [Pitti et al., 396:699-703 (1998)], both of which are secreted, soluble proteins. Apo2L\/TRAIL has been reported to bind those receptors referred to as DcR1, DcR2 and OPG.","Apo2L\/TRAIL is believed to act through the cell surface \u201cdeath receptors\u201d DR4 and DR5 to activate caspases, or enzymes that carry out the cell death program. Upon ligand binding, both DR4 and DR5 can trigger apoptosis independently by recruiting and activating the apoptosis initiator, caspase-8, through the death-domain-containing adaptor molecule referred to as FADD\/Mort1 [Kischkel et al., 12:611-620 (2000); Sprick et al., 12:599-609 (2000); Bodmer et al., 2:241-243 (2000)]. In contrast to DR4 and DR5, the DcR1 and DcR2 receptors do not signal apoptosis.","For a review of the TNF family of cytokines and their receptors, see Ashkenazi and Dixit, 281:1305-1308 (1998); Ashkenazi and Dixit, 11:255-260 (2000); Golstein, 7:750-753 (1997); Gruss and Dower, supra; Nagata, 88:355-365 (1997); Locksley et al., 104:487-501 (2001).","Certain proteins, such as Apo2L\/TRAIL and other members of the TNF family of cytokines, exhibit biological activity when the protein is in a trimer or trimeric form. Thus, for purposes of therapeutic or even diagnostic use, formulations of such proteins are desired wherein the protein is stable and remains biologically active, particularly stable in a trimeric form. Applicants have found that certain formulation components, or \u201cexcipients\u201d, can provide stability for such proteins like Apo2L\/TRAIL and enhance solubility (i.e., to reduce aggregation or precipitation of the protein). Applicants also surprisingly found that, under certain conditions, Apo2L\/TRAIL can readily crystallize. Such crystal forms of Apo2L\/TRAIL may be useful in preparation of suspension formulations of Apo2L\/TRAIL and\/or provide an effective and efficient process for protein purification.","Accordingly, the present invention provides compositions or formulations comprising Apo2L\/TRAIL and one or more excipients which provide sufficient ionic strength to enhance solubility and\/or stability of the Apo2L\/TRAIL, wherein the composition optionally has a pH of 6 (or about 6) to 9 (or about 9).

In one embodiment, the polypeptide sequence comprises residues 114-281 of  (SEQ ID NO:1), and optionally, consists of residues 114-281 of  (SEQ ID NO:1). Optionally, the polypeptide sequence comprises residues 92-281 or residues 91-281 of  (SEQ ID NO:1). The Apo-2L polypeptides may be encoded by the native nucleotide sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:2). Optionally, the codon which encodes residue Pro119 (; SEQ ID NO:2) may be \u201cCCT\u201d or \u201cCCG\u201d.

Optionally, the Apo2L\/TRAIL polypeptide is encoded by a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent conditions with the encoding polynucleotide sequence provided in  (SEQ ID NO:2). The definition encompasses substitutional variants of Apo2L\/TRAIL in which at least one of its native amino acids are substituted by an alanine residue. Particular substitutional variants of the Apo2L\/TRAIL include those in which at least one amino acid is substituted by an alanine residue. These substitutional variants include those identified, for example, as \u201cD203A\u201d; \u201cD218A\u201d and \u201cD269A.\u201d This nomenclature is used to identify Apo2L\/TRAIL variants wherein the aspartic acid residues at positions 203, 218, and\/or 269 (using the numbering shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1)) are substituted by alanine residues. Optionally, the Apo2L variants may comprise one or more of the alanine substitutions which are recited in Table I of published PCT application WO 01\/00832. Substitutional variants include one or more of the residue substitutions identified in Table I of WO 01\/00832 published Jan. 4, 2001. The definition also encompasses a native sequence Apo2L\/TRAIL isolated from an Apo2L\/TRAIL source or prepared by recombinant or synthetic methods. The Apo2L\/TRAIL of the invention includes the polypeptides referred to as Apo2L\/TRAIL or TRAIL disclosed in PCT Publication Nos. WO97\/01633 and WO97\/25428. The terms \u201cApo2L\/TRAIL\u201d or \u201cApo2L\u201d are used to refer generally to forms of the Apo2L\/TRAIL which include monomer, dimer or trimer forms of the polypeptide. All numbering of amino acid residues referred to in the Apo2L sequence use the numbering according to  (SEQ ID NO:1), unless specifically stated otherwise. For instance, \u201cD203\u201d or \u201cAsp203\u201d refers to the aspartic acid residue at position 203 in the sequence provided in  (SEQ ID NO:1).","The term \u201cApo2L\/TRAIL extracellular domain\u201d or \u201cApo2L\/TRAIL ECD\u201d refers to a form of Apo2L\/TRAIL which is essentially free of transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Ordinarily, the ECD will have less than 1% of such transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, and preferably, will have less than 0.5% of such domains. It will be understood that any transmembrane domain(s) identified for the polypeptides of the present invention are identified pursuant to criteria routinely employed in the art for identifying that type of hydrophobic domain. The exact boundaries of a transmembrane domain may vary but most likely by no more than about 5 amino acids at either end of the domain as initially identified. In preferred embodiments, the ECD will consist of a soluble, extracellular domain sequence of the polypeptide which is free of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic or intracellular domains (and is not membrane bound). Particular extracellular domain sequences of Apo-2L\/TRAIL are described in PCT Publication Nos. WO97\/01633 and WO97\/25428.","The term \u201cApo2L\/TRAIL monomer\u201d or \u201cApo2L monomer\u201d refers to a covalent chain of an extracellular domain sequence of Apo2L.","The term \u201cApo2L\/TRAIL dimer\u201d or \u201cApo2L dimer\u201d refers to two Apo-2L monomers joined in a covalent linkage via a disulfide bond. The term as used herein includes free standing Apo2L dimers and Apo2L dimers that are within trimeric forms of Apo2L (i.e., associated with another, third Apo2L monomer).","The term \u201cApo2L\/TRAIL trimer\u201d or \u201cApo2L trimer\u201d refers to three Apo2L monomers that are non-covalently associated.","The term \u201cApo2L\/TRAIL aggregate\u201d is used to refer to self-associated higher oligomeric forms of Apo2L\/TRAIL, such as Apo2L\/TRAIL trimers, which form, for instance, hexameric and nanomeric forms of Apo2L\/TRAIL.","Determination of the presence and quantity of Apo2L\/TRAIL monomer, dimer, or trimer (or other aggregates) may be made using methods and assays known in the art (and using commercially available materials), such as native size exclusion HPLC (\u201cSEC\u201d), denaturing size exclusion using sodium dodecyl sulphate (\u201cSDS-SEC\u201d), reverse phase HPLC, capillary electrophoresis, and including those methods described in further detail in the Examples below.","The term \u201ctagged\u201d when used herein refers to a chimeric polypeptide comprising Apo2L\/TRAIL, or a portion thereof, fused to a \u201ctag polypeptide\u201d. The tag polypeptide has enough residues to provide an epitope against which an antibody can be made or to provide some other function, such as metal ion chelation, yet is short enough such that it generally does not interfere with activity of the TNF family cytokine. The tag polypeptide preferably also is fairly unique so that a tag-specific antibody does not substantially cross-react with other epitopes. Suitable tag polypeptides generally have at least six amino acid residues and usually between about 8 to about 50 amino acid residues (preferably, between about 10 to about 20 residues).","The term \u201cdivalent metal ion\u201d refers to a metal ion having two positive charges. Examples of divalent metal ions include but are not limited to zinc, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, magnesium, and manganese.

Optionally, a divalent metal ion for use in the present invention is zinc, and preferably, the salt form, zinc sulfate or zinc chloride.","\u201cIsolated,\u201d when used to describe the various proteins disclosed herein, means protein that has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would typically interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the protein, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the protein will be purified (1) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (2) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain, or (3) to homogeneity by mass spectroscopic or peptide mapping techniques. Isolated protein includes protein in situ within recombinant cells, since at least one component of the Apo2L\/TRAIL natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated protein will be prepared by at least one purification step.","An \u201cisolated\u201d Apo2L\/TRAIL nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the Apo2L\/TRAIL nucleic acid. An isolated Apo2L\/TRAIL nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated Apo2L\/TRAIL nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the Apo2L\/TRAIL nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated Apo2L\/TRAIL nucleic acid molecule includes Apo2L\/TRAIL nucleic acid molecules contained in cells that ordinarily express Apo2L\/TRAIL where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.","\u201cPercent (%) amino acid sequence identity\u201d with respect to the sequences identified herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the Apo2L\/TRAIL sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including assigning algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length sequences being compared. For purposes herein, percent amino acid identity values can be obtained using the sequence comparison computer program, ALIGN-2, which was authored by Genentech, Inc. and the source code of which has been filed with user documentation in the US Copyright Office, Washington, D.C., 20559, registered under the US Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.","\u201cStringency\u201d of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art, and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length, washing temperature, and salt concentration. In general, longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing, while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to re-anneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired identity between the probe and hybridizable sequence, the higher the relative temperature which can be used. As a result, it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent, while lower temperatures less so. For additional details and explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions, see Ausubel et al., , Wiley Interscience Publishers, (1995).","\u201cHigh stringency conditions\u201d, as defined herein, are identified by those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing; 0.015 M sodium chloride\/0.0015 M sodium citrate\/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50\u00b0 C.; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent; 50% (v\/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin\/0.1% Ficoll\/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone\/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42\u00b0 C.; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5\u00d7 Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 \u03bcg\/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42\u00b0 C., with washes at 42\u00b0 C. in 0.2\u00d7SSC (sodium chloride\/sodium citrate) and 50% formamide at 55\u00b0 C., followed by a high-stringency wash consisting of 0.1\u00d7SSC containing EDTA at 55\u00b0 C.","\u201cModerately stringent conditions\u201d may be identified as described by Sambrook et al., , New York: Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1989, and include overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C. in a solution comprising: 20% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5\u00d7 Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 mg\/ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 1\u00d7SSC at about 37-50\u00b0 C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.","The term \u201ccontrol sequences\u201d refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.","Nucleic acid is \u201coperably linked\u201d when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \u201coperably linked\u201d means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.","The term \u201cstorage-stable\u201d is used to describe a formulation having a shelf-life acceptable for a product in the distribution chain of commerce, for instance, at least 12 months at a given temperature, and preferably, at least 24 months at a given temperature. Optionally, such a storage-stable formulation contains no more than 5% aggregates, no more than 10% dimers, and\/or minimal changes in charge heterogeneity or biological activity.","As used herein, \u201csoluble\u201d refers to polypeptides that, when in aqueous solutions, are completely dissolved, resulting in a clear to slightly opalescent solution with no visible particulates, as assessed by visual inspection. A further assay of the turbidity of the solution (or solubility of the protein) may be made by measuring UV absorbances at 340 nm to 360 nm with a 1 cm pathlength cell where turbidity at 20 mg\/ml is less than 0.05 absorbance units.","An \u201cosmolyte\u201d refers to a tonicity modifier or osmotic adjuster that lends osmolality to a solution. Osmolality refers to the total osmotic activity contributed by ions and nonionized molecules to a solution. Examples include inorganic salts such as sodium chloride, polyethylene glycols (PEGs), polypropylene glycol, sugars such as sucrose or trehalose, glycerol, amino acids, and sugar alcohols such as mannitol known to the art that are generally regarded as safe (GRAS).","\u201cPreservatives\u201d can act to prevent bacteria, viruses, and fungi from proliferating in the formulation, and anti-oxidants, or other compounds can function in various ways to preserve the stability of the formulation. Examples include octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, hexamethonium chloride, benzalkonium chloride (a mixture of alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chlorides in which the alkyl groups are long-chain compounds), and benzethonium chloride. Other types of compounds include aromatic alcohols such as phenol and benzyl alcohol, alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben, and m-cresol. Optionally, such a compound is phenol or benzyl alcohol. The preservative or other compound will optionally be included in a liquid or aqueous form of the Apo2L\/TRAIL formulation, but not usually in a lyophilized form of the formulation. In the latter case, the preservative or other compound will typically be present in the water for injection (WFI) or bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI) used for reconstitution.","A \u201csurfactant\u201d can act to decrease turbidity or denaturation of a protein in a formulation. Examples of surfactants include non-ionic surfactant such as a polysorbate, e.g., polysorbates 20, 60, or 80, a poloxamer, e.g., poloxamer 184 or 188, Pluronic polyols, ethylene\/propylene block polymers or any others known to the art that are GRAS. Optionally, the surfactant is a polysorbate or poloxamer.","A \u201cbuffer\u201d as used herein is any suitable buffer that is GRAS and generally confers a pH from about 6 to about 9, optionally from about 6.5 to about 8.5, and optionally at about 7 to about 7.5, if the polypeptide is Apo2L\/TRAIL. Examples include Tris, Hepes, triethanolamine, histidine, or any others known to the art to have the desired effect.","The term \u201ccytokine\u201d is a generic term for proteins released by one cell population which act on another cell as intercellular mediators. Examples of such cytokines are lymphokines, monokines, and traditional polypeptide hormones. Included among the cytokines are growth hormone such as human growth hormone, N-methionyl human growth hormone, and bovine growth hormone; parathyroid hormone; thyroxine; insulin; proinsulin; relaxin; prorelaxin; glycoprotein hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH); hepatic growth factor; fibroblast growth factor; prolactin; placental lactogen; tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and -\u03b2; mullerian-inhibiting substance; mouse gonadotropin-associated peptide; inhibin; activin; vascular endothelial growth factor; integrin; thrombopoietin (TPO); nerve growth factors; platelet-growth factor; transforming growth factors (TGFs) such as TGF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2; insulin-like growth factor-I and -II; erythropoietin (EPO); osteoinductive factors; interferons such as interferon-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -gamma; colony stimulating factors (CSFs) such as macrophage-CSF (M-CSF); granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF); and granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF); interleukins (ILs) such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-11, IL-12; and other polypeptide factors including LIF and kit ligand (KL).

Consecutive treatment or administration refers to treatment on at least a daily basis without interruption in treatment by one or more days. Intermittent treatment or administration, or treatment or administration in an intermittent fashion, refers to treatment that is not consecutive, but rather cyclic in nature.","The term \u201cmammal\u201d as used herein refers to any mammal classified as a mammal, including humans, cows, horses, dogs and cats. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the mammal is a human.","The present invention provides various formulations, and methods for making such formulations, of Apo2L\/TRAIL. Various formulation excipients can enhance solubility of Apo2L\/TRAIL in formulations, for instance, which are acceptable for pharmaceutical uses and\/or enhance stability of the Apo2L\/TRAIL protein in a form (e.g., trimer form) which has biological activity. For example, Applicants have found that the presence of various excipients (for instance, arginine salts) in such formulations can markedly increase the solubility and stability of Apo2L\/TRAIL.","The unexpected finding of the readily reversible crystallization of Apo2L\/TRAIL further provides basis for purification methods and stable formulations of Apo2L\/TRAIL. In particular, forming crystals and subsequently drying the material by various methods (including lyophilization) may provide long term stability of bulk preparations of the protein. Further, lyophilized crystal compositions are expected to retain stability through a range of temperatures. Dried crystals can also be employed in suspension formulations suitable for, e.g., subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. As described in the Examples, sodium salts, particularly sodium sulfate (NaSO), provided ready and reversible crystallization, with retention of biological activity upon re-dissolution of the protein. The protein crystals then readily re-dissolved in water or an aqueous buffer, e.g. a carboxylic acid salt of an amino acid, or can be suspended in non-aqueous media without loss in physicochemical properties that can be important for the protein's biological activity.","Generally, the formulations are prepared using Apo2L\/TRAIL polypeptides (proteins), at the desired degree of purity, and various excipients or components, described below.","Production of Apo2L\/TRAIL","The description below relates to methods of producing Apo2L\/TRAIL by culturing host cells transformed or transfected with a vector containing Apo2L\/TRAIL encoding nucleic acid and recovering the polypeptide from the cell culture.","The DNA encoding Apo2L\/TRAIL may be obtained from any cDNA library prepared from tissue believed to possess the Apo2L\/TRAIL mRNA and to express it at a detectable level. Accordingly, human Apo2L\/TRAIL DNA can be conveniently obtained from a cDNA library prepared from human tissues, such as the bacteriophage library of human placental cDNA as described in PCT Publication WO97\/25428. The Apo2L\/TRAIL-encoding gene may also be obtained from a genomic library or by oligonucleotide synthesis.","Libraries can be screened with probes (such as antibodies to the Apo2L\/TRAIL or oligonucleotides of at least about 20-80 bases) designed to identify the gene of interest or the protein encoded by it. Screening the cDNA or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted using standard procedures (Sambrook et al., ; New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). An alternative means to isolate the gene encoding Apo2L\/TRAIL is to use PCT methodology (Sambrook et al., supra; Dieffenbach et al., , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995).","Amino acid sequence fragments or variants of Apo2L\/TRAIL can be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the Apo2L\/TRAIL DNA, or by synthesis of the desired Apo2L\/TRAIL polypeptide. Such fragments or variants represent insertions, substitutions, and\/or deletions of residues within or at one or both of the ends of the intracellular region, the transmembrane region, or the extracellular region, or of the amino acid sequence shown for the full-length Apo2L\/TRAIL in  (SEQ ID NO:1). Any combination of insertion, substitution, and\/or deletion can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses, for instance, a desired biological activity or apoptotic activity as defined herein. In a preferred embodiment, the fragments or variants have at least about 80% amino acid sequence identity, more preferably, at least about 90% sequence identity, and even more preferably, at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity with, for example, the sequences identified herein for the intracellular, transmembrane, or extracellular domains of Apo2L\/TRAIL, or the full-length sequence for Apo-2L\/TRAIL. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the Apo-2L\/TRAIL, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites or altering the membrane anchoring characteristics.","Variations in the Apo2L\/TRAIL sequence as described above can be made using any of the techniques and guidelines for conservative and non-conservative mutations set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,934. These include oligonucleotide-mediated (site-directed) mutagenesis, alanine scanning, and PCR mutagenesis.","Scanning amino acid analysis can be employed to identify one or more amino acids along a contiguous sequence. Among the preferred scanning amino acids are relatively small, neutral amino acids. Such amino acids include alanine, glycine, serine and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning amino acid among this group because it eliminates the side-chain beyond the beta-carbon and is less likely to alter the main-chain conformation of the variant. (Cunningham et al., Science 1989, 244:1081). Alanine is also typically preferred because it is the most common amino acid. Further, it is frequently found in both buried and exposed positions (Creighton, , (W.H. Freeman & Co., NY); Chothia, J. Mol. Biol. 1976, 150:1).","Particular Apo2L\/TRAIL variants of the present invention include those Apo2L\/TRAIL polypeptides which include one or more of the recited alanine substitutions provided in TABLE I of published PCT application WO 01\/00832. Such Apo2L\/TRAIL variants will typically comprise a non-naturally occurring amino acid sequence which differs from a native Apo2L\/TRAIL amino acid sequence (such as provided in ; SEQ ID NO:1, for a full length or mature form of Apo2L\/TRAIL or an extracellular domain sequence thereof) in at least one or more amino acids. Optionally, the one or more amino acids which differ in the Apo2L\/TRAIL variant as compared to a native Apo2L\/TRAIL will comprise amino acid substitution(s) such as those indicated in Table I of WO 01\/00832. Apo2L\/TRAIL variants of the invention include soluble Apo2L\/TRAIL variants comprising residues 91-281, 92-281, 95-281 or 114-281 of  (SEQ ID NO:1) and having one or more amino acid substitutions. Preferred Apo2L\/TRAIL variants will include those variants comprising residues 91-281, 92-281, 95-281 or 114-281 of  (SEQ ID NO:1) and having one or more amino acid substitutions which enhance biological activity, such as receptor binding. A particularly preferred variant comprises residues 114-281 of  (SEQ ID NO:1). In a specific embodiment, Apo-2L\/TRAIL consists of residues 114-281 of  (SEQ ID NO:1).","As described in WO 01\/00832 published Jan. 4, 2001, the x-ray crystal structure of the extracellular domain of Apo2L\/TRAIL identified, and alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed to provide the mapping of its receptor contact regions. The structure obtained for Apo2L\/TRAIL revealed a homotrimeric protein which contains a novel divalent metal ion (zinc) binding site that coordinates the interaction of the Apo2L\/TRAIL trimer molecule's three subunits. Like other members of the TNF family, Apo2L\/TRAIL appears to comprise a compact trimer formed of three jelly roll monomers which bury approximately 5100 Angstrom(1700 Angstromper monomer) to form the globular trimer. The position of the core beta-strands was well conserved compared to the other structurally characterized members of the TNF family, TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, and CD40L when compared to the core strands of TNF-alpha or TNF-beta.","Variations in the Apo2L\/TRAIL sequence also included within the scope of the invention relate to amino-terminal derivatives or modified forms. Such Apo2L\/TRAIL sequences may include any of the Apo2L\/TRAIL polypeptides described herein having a methionine or modified methionine (such as formyl methionyl or other blocked methionyl species) at the N-terminus of the polypeptide sequence.","The nucleic acid (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) encoding native or variant Apo2L\/TRAIL may be inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. Various vectors are publicly available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence, each of which is described below. Optional signal sequences, origins of replication, marker genes, enhancer elements and transcription terminator sequences that may be employed are known in the art and described in further detail in PCT Publication WO97\/25428.","Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the Apo2L\/TRAIL nucleic acid sequence. Promoters are untranslated sequences located upstream (5\u2032) to the start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 100 to 1000 bp) that control the transcription and translation of a particular nucleic acid sequence, such as the Apo2L\/TRAIL nucleic acid sequence, to which they are operably linked. Such promoters typically fall into two classes, inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoters are promoters that initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA under their control in response to some change in culture conditions, e.g., the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature. At this time a large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. These promoters are operably linked to Apo2L\/TRAIL encoding DNA by removing the promoter from the source DNA by restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector. Both the native Apo2L\/TRAIL promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and\/or expression of the Apo2L\/TRAIL DNA.","Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are known in the art, and are described in further detail in PCT Publication No. WO97\/25428.","Preferred methods for the production of soluble Apo2L\/TRAIL in employ an inducible promoter for the regulation of product expression. The use of a controllable, inducible promoter allows for culture growth to the desirable cell density before induction of product expression and accumulation of significant amounts of product which may not be well tolerated by the host.","Three inducible promoter systems (T7 polymerase, trp and alkaline phosphatase (AP)) have been evaluated by Applicants for the expression of Apo2L\/TRAIL (amino acids 114-281). The use of each of these three promoters resulted in significant amounts of soluble, biologically active Apo2L\/TRAIL trimer being recovered from the harvested cell paste. The AP promoter is preferred among these three inducible promoter systems tested because of tighter promoter control and the higher cell density and titers reached in harvested cell paste.","Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of the above-listed components employs standard ligation techniques. Isolated plasmids or DNA fragments are cleaved, tailored, and re-ligated in the form desired to generate the plasmids required.","For analysis to confirm correct sequences in plasmids constructed, the ligation mixtures can be used to transform K12 strain 294 (ATCC 31,446) and successful transformants selected by ampicillin or tetracycline resistance where appropriate. Plasmids from the transformants are prepared, analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion, and\/or sequenced using standard techniques known in the art. (See, e.g., Messing et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1981, 9:309; Maxam et al., Methods in Enzymology 1980, 65:499).","Expression vectors that provide for the transient expression in mammalian cells of DNA encoding Apo2L\/TRAIL may be employed. In general, transient expression involves the use of an expression vector that is able to replicate efficiently in a host cell, such that the host cell accumulates many copies of the expression vector and, in turn, synthesizes high levels of a desired polypeptide encoded by the expression vector (Sambrook et al., supra). Transient expression systems, comprising a suitable expression vector and a host cell, allow for the convenient positive identification of polypeptides encoded by cloned DNAs, as well as for the rapid screening of such polypeptides for desired biological or physiological properties. Thus, transient expression systems are particularly useful in the invention for purposes of identifying analogs and variants of Apo2L\/TRAIL that are biologically active Apo2L\/TRAIL.","Other methods, vectors, and host cells suitable for adaptation to the synthesis of Apo2L\/TRAIL in recombinant vertebrate cell culture are described in Gething et al., Nature 1981, 293:620-625; Mantei et al., Nature 1979, 281:40-46; EP 117,060; and EP 117,058.","Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include but are not limited to eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as , e.g., , e.g., , e.g., , and , as well as such as and (e.g., 41P disclosed in DD 266,710 published 12 Apr. 1989), such as , and .

Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated Apo2L\/TRAIL are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of all such host cells, including CHO cells, are described further in PCT Publication No. WO97\/25428.","Host cells are transfected and preferably transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for Apo2L\/TRAIL production and cultured in nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.","Transfection refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaPOand electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell.","Transformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described in Sambrook et al., supra, or electroporation is generally used for prokaryotes or other cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Infection with is used for transformation of certain plant cells, as described (Shaw et al., Gene 1983, 23:315 and PCT Publication No. WO 89\/05859). In addition, plants may be transfected using ultrasound treatment, PCT Publication No. WO 91\/00358 published 10 Jan. 1991.","For mammalian cells without such cell walls, the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Graham and van der Eb, Virology 1978, 52:456-457) may be employed. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transformations have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,399,216. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of Van Solingen et al., J. Bact. 1977, 130:946 and Hsiao et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1979, 76:3829. However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells, such as by nuclear microinjection, electroporation, bacterial protoplast fusion with intact cells, or polycations, e.g., polybrene, polyornithine, may also be used. For various techniques for transforming mammalian cells, see Keown et al. Methods in Enzymology 1990, 185:527-537 and Mansour et al. Nature 1988, 336:348-352.","Prokaryotic cells used to produce Apo2L\/TRAIL may be cultured in suitable culture media as described generally in Sambrook et al., supra. Particular forms of culture media that may be employed for culturing are described further in PCT application WO 01\/00832. Mammalian host cells used to produce Apo2L\/TRAIL may be cultured in a variety of culture media.","Examples of commercially available culture media include Ham's F10 (SIGMA\u2122), Minimal Essential Medium (\u201cMEM\u201d, SIGMA\u2122), RPMI-1640 (SIGMA\u2122), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (\u201cDMEM\u201d, SIGMA\u2122). Any such media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and\/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleosides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMICIN\u2122 drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.","In general, principles, protocols, and practical techniques for maximizing the productivity of mammalian cell cultures can be found in , M. Butler, ed. (IRL Press, 1991).","Expression of the Apo2L\/TRAIL may be measured in a sample directly, for example, by conventional Southern blotting, Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA (Thomas, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1980, 77:5201-5205), dot blotting (DNA analysis), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately labeled probe, based on the sequences provided herein. Various labels may be employed, most commonly radioisotopes, and particularly P. However, other techniques may also be employed, such as using biotin-modified nucleotides for introduction into a polynucleotide. The biotin then serves as the site for binding to avidin or antibodies, which may be labeled with a wide variety of labels, such as radionucleotides, fluorescers or enzymes. Alternatively, antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes, including DNA duplexes, RNA duplexes, and DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA-protein duplexes. The antibodies in turn may be labeled and the assay may be carried out where the duplex is bound to a surface, so that upon the formation of duplex on the surface, the presence of antibody bound to the duplex can be detected.","Gene expression, alternatively, may be measured by immunological methods, such as immunohistochemical staining of cells or tissue sections and assay of cell culture or body fluids, to quantitate directly the expression of gene product. With immunohistochemical staining techniques, a cell sample is prepared, typically by dehydration and fixation, followed by reaction with labeled antibodies specific for the gene product coupled, where the labels are usually visually detectable, such as enzymatic labels, fluorescent labels, luminescent labels, and the like.","Antibodies useful for immunohistochemical staining and\/or assay of sample fluids may be either monoclonal or polyclonal, and may be prepared in any mammal. Conveniently, the antibodies may be prepared against a native Apo2L\/TRAIL polypeptide or against a synthetic peptide based on the DNA sequences provided herein or against exogenous sequence fused to Apo2L\/TRAIL DNA and encoding a specific antibody epitope.","Apo2L\/TRAIL preferably is recovered from the culture medium as a secreted polypeptide, although it also may be recovered from host cell lysates when directly produced without a secretory signal. If the Apo2L\/TRAIL is membrane-bound, it can be released from the membrane using a suitable detergent solution (e.g., Triton-X 100) or its extracellular region may be released by enzymatic cleavage.","When Apo2L\/TRAIL is produced in a recombinant cell other than one of human origin, the Apo2L\/TRAIL is free of proteins or polypeptides of human origin. However, it is usually necessary to recover or purify Apo2L\/TRAIL from recombinant cell proteins or polypeptides to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous as to Apo2L\/TRAIL. As a first step, the culture medium or lysate may be centrifuged to remove particulate cell debris. Apo2L\/TRAIL thereafter is purified from contaminant soluble proteins and polypeptides, with the following procedures being exemplary of suitable purification procedures: by fractionation on an ion-exchange column such as SP-sepharose or CM-sepharose; hydroxyapatite; hydrophobic interaction chromatography; ethanol precipitation; chromatofocusing; ammonium sulfate precipitation; gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75; and diafiltration.","The Apo2L\/TRAIL can be isolated by affinity chromatography. Apo2L\/TRAIL fragments or variants in which residues have been deleted, inserted, or substituted are recovered in the same fashion as native Apo2L\/TRAIL, taking account of any substantial changes in properties occasioned by the variation. For example, preparation of an Apo2L\/TRAIL fusion with another protein or polypeptide, e.g., a bacterial or viral antigen, facilitates purification; an immunoaffinity column-containing antibody to the antigen can be used to adsorb the fusion polypeptide.","A protease inhibitor such as phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) also may be useful to inhibit proteolytic degradation during purification, and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants. One skilled in the art will appreciate that purification methods suitable for native Apo2L\/TRAIL may require modification to account for changes in the character of Apo2L\/TRAIL or its variants upon expression in recombinant cell culture.","During any such purification steps, it may be desirable to expose the recovered Apo2L\/TRAIL to a divalent metal ion-containing solution or to purification material (such as a chromatography medium or support) containing one or more divalent metal ions. The divalent metal ions and\/or reducing agent may be used during recovery or purification of the Apo2L\/TRAIL. Optionally, both divalent metal ions and reducing agent, such as DTT or BME, may be used during recovery or purification of the Apo2L\/TRAIL. It is believed that use of divalent metal ions during recovery or purification will assist in providing stability of Apo2L\/TRAIL trimer or preserve Apo2L\/TRAIL trimer formed during the cell culturing step.","In the preparation of the formulations herein, it is noted that the recommended quality or \u201cgrade\u201d of the components employed will depend on the ultimate use of the formulation. For therapeutic uses, it is preferred that the component(s) are of an allowable grade (such as \u201cGRAS\u201d) as an additive to pharmaceutical products.","In certain embodiments, there are provided compositions comprising Apo2L\/TRAIL and one or more excipients which provide sufficient ionic strength to enhance solubility and\/or stability of the Apo2L\/TRAIL, wherein the composition has a pH of 6 (or about 6) to 9 (or about 9). The Apo2L\/TRAIL protein may be prepared by any suitable method to achieve the desired purity of the protein, for example, according to the above methods. In preferred embodiments, the Apo2L\/TRAIL protein comprises amino acids 114-281 of , and more preferably, the Apo2L\/TRAIL protein is recombinantly expressed in host cells. The concentration of the Apo2L\/TRAIL protein in the formulation may vary depending, for instance, on the intended use of the formulation. Those skilled in the art can determine without undue experimentation the desired concentration of the Apo2L\/TRAIL protein. For therapeutic uses, the concentration of the Apo2L\/TRAIL protein in the formulation is optionally about 0.1 to about 100 mg\/ml, about 1 to about 20 mg\/ml, about 10 to about 20 mg\/ml, or about 20 mg\/ml.","The one or more excipients in the formulations which provide sufficient ionic strength to enhance solubility and\/or stability of the Apo2L\/TRAIL is optionally a polyionic organic or inorganic acid, aspartate, sodium sulfate, sodium succinate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, Captisol\u2122, Tris, arginine salt or other amino acids, sugars and polyols such as trehalose and sucrose. Preferably the one or more excipients in the formulations which provide sufficient ionic strength is a salt. Salts which may be employed include but are not limited to sodium salts and arginine salts. The type of salt employed and the concentration of the salt is preferably such that the formulation has a relatively high ionic strength which allows the Apo2L\/TRAIL in the formulation to be stable (i.e., reduce precipitation and enhance trimer content) and\/or which allows the soluble protein concentration to exceed 2 mg\/ml, more preferably, exceed 5 mg\/ml, even more preferably exceed 10 mg\/ml, and most preferably to achieve a concentration of at least about 20 mg\/ml. Optionally, the salt is present in the formulation at a concentration of about 20 mM to about 0.5 M. In more preferred embodiments, the salt is an arginine salt or sodium sulfate. Optionally, the arginine salt may comprise arginine citrate, arginine tartrate, arginine malate, arginine succinate, arginine phosphate, and arginine sulfate. More preferably, the arginine salt is present in a concentration of about 0.2 M to about 0.5 M. It is noted that while arginine tartrate is useful as an excipient in the formulations described herein, the use of tartaric acid as a vehicle at higher concentrations (such as hundreds of mM) may not be desirable for parenteral administration or human clinical applications. Applicants have observed in an in vivo animal study that vehicle concentrations of 0.5M arginine neutralized with 0.25M tartrate administered intravenously at greater than 5 ml\/kg\/hr can have a deleterious effect on renal tissue. Accordingly, there may be an upper threshold concentration of tartaric acid beyond which one skilled in the art would not select for clinical, therapeutic uses.","If relatively lower concentrations of Apo2L\/TRAIL protein are desired in the formulation, for instance, less than about 5 mg\/ml, or less than about 2 mg\/ml, or about 0.1 to about 2 mg\/ml, the excipient providing stability to the formulation may be a sugar, such as trehalose, sucrose, glucose, lactitol, or lactose. Optionally, the sugar may be employed in the formulations at a concentration of about 1% to about 8%. The excipient may also be an arginine salt, as described above.","The composition preferably has a pH of 6 (or about 6) to 9 (or about 9), more preferably about 6.5 to about 8.5, and even more preferably about 7 to about 7.5. In a preferred aspect of this embodiment, the composition will further comprise a buffer to maintain the pH of the composition at least about 6 to about 8. Examples of buffers which may be employed include but are not limited to Tris, HEPES, and histidine. When employing Tris, the pH may optionally be adjusted to about 7 to 8.5. When employing Hepes or histidine, the pH may optionally be adjusted to about 6.5 to 7. Optionally, the buffer is employed at a concentration of about 5 mM to about 50 mM in the formulation, and preferably at a concentration of about 10 mM to about 20 mM.","Particularly for liquid formulations (or reconstituted lyophilized formulations), it may be desirable to include one or more surfactants in the composition. Such surfactants may, for instance, comprise a non-ionic surfactant like TWEEN\u2122 or PLURONICS\u2122 (e.g., polysorbate or poloxamer). Preferably, the surfactant comprises polysorbate 20 (\u201cTween 20\u201d). The surfactant will optionally be employed at a concentration of about 0.005% to about 0.2%.","Preferred formulations are those in which the excipient(s) provide for optimized Apo2L\/TRAIL trimer content and minimize the amount of Apo2L\/TRAIL dimer formation (or aggregate formation) or changes in charge distribution. Optionally, the formulation contains no more than 5% Apo2L\/TRAIL aggregates, no more than 10% Apo2L\/TRAIL disulfide linked dimer (of the total amount of Apo2L\/TRAIL protein in the formulation), and\/or no more than 10% change in the initial charge distribution.","In preferred embodiments, the present invention provides compositions comprising about 0.1 mg\/ml to about 20 mg\/ml of Apo2L\/TRAIL and an arginine salt, wherein the composition has a pH of about 6.5 to about 8.5 (optionally, 6.8 to 7.5).

The divalent metal ion may be a zinc molecule, such as zinc sulfate, zinc chloride, or zinc acetate. The divalent metal ion can optionally be included in the formulation at a concentration of about 50 micromolar to about 400 micromolar.","The formulations of the present invention may include, in addition to Apo2L\/TRAIL and those components described above, further various other excipients or components. Optionally, the formulation may contain, for parenteral administration, a pharmaceutically or parenterally acceptable carrier, i.e., one that is non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation. Optionally, the carrier is a parenteral carrier, such as a solution that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Examples of such carrier vehicles include water, saline or a buffered solution such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Ringer's solution, and dextrose solution. Various optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are described further in 16th edition, Osol, A. ed.

Alternatively, the formulation can be lyophilized and provided as a powder for reconstitution with water for injection that optionally may be stored at 2-30\u00b0 C.","The formulation to be used for therapeutic administration must be sterile. Sterility is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes (e.g., 0.2 micron membranes). Therapeutic compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.","The composition ordinarily will be stored in single unit or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampules or vials, as an aqueous solution or as a lyophilized formulation for reconstitution. The containers may any available containers in the art and filled using conventional methods. Optionally, the formulation may be included in an injection pen device (or a cartridge which fits into a pen device), such as those available in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,629), which are suitable for therapeutic delivery of the formulation. As an example of a lyophilized formulation, 10 mL vials are filled with 5.5 mL of sterile-filtered 2% (w\/v) aqueous Apo2L\/TRAIL solution, and the resulting mixture is lyophilized. An injection solution can be prepared by reconstituting the lyophilized Apo2L\/TRAIL formulation using, for example, Water-for-Injection.","In further more particular embodiments of the formulations, there are provided compositions which include Apo2L\/TRAIL crystals. For instance, the composition may comprise a suspension formulation comprising Apo2L\/TRAIL crystals. Applicants surprisingly found that the solid state of Apo2L\/TRAIL protein at 5\u00b0 C. is crystalline at moderate to low ionic conditions, unlike many other proteins known in the art that are soluble or form amorphous precipitates under similar conditions. Further, it was found that the solid state of the Apo2L\/TRAIL crystals reversibly solubilizes when brought to ambient temperature (i.e., room temperature) without a loss in protein biological activity or adverse effect on the biochemical properties of the protein. This observation was quite different from the denaturation or irreversible precipitation observed for other proteins known in the art.","Optionally, the Apo2L\/TRAIL crystals are prepared by cooling a super-saturated solution of Apo-2L\/TRAIL protein from about 20 to about 30\u00b0 C. to below about 15\u00b0 C., preferably about 2 to 8\u00b0 C., and more preferably, below about 2-8\u00b0 C. Crystallization can be carried out in batch or semi-batch mode at a large range of scale, from a few milliliters to hundreds of liters of solution. The crystallization rate can be controlled by programmed cooling and agitation. The equipment may include, but is not limited to, agitated or static tanks with surface and\/or internal temperature control. Internal baffles and draft tubes may also be used to enhance mixing in agitated tanks. Crystal nucleation can also be controlled by seeding [Moore, AIChE Practical Engineering Perspectives, Distillation and Other Industrial Separations, pp. 239-245]. The degree of super-saturation, salt composition, cooling rate, agitation rate, and seeding can affect crystal formation rate, crystal size distribution, and crystal yield.","Optionally, to prepare the crystals, the solution of Apo-2L\/TRAIL protein contains sodium sulphate or sodium chloride. Optionally, the salt concentration is about 100 mM to about 150 mM and optionally the pH is about 6 to about 9 (preferably, pH of about 6.5 to about 8.5).","The Apo2L\/TRAIL crystal slurry may be washed to remove the salts. Optionally, the crystal slurry may be washed with water. Alternatively, the crystal slurry may be equilibrated to a low ionic strength. Subsequently, the material may be dried for storage or preparation for parenteral formulations. The crystal drying methods may include but are not limited to static vacuum drying, vacuum drying with vibration, rotation, or agitation motion facilitated by dry air\/N2 flow, lyophilization, spray drying and fluidized bed drying.","The dried crystals can be reconstituted to a liquid formulation and sterilized for parenteral injection. Alternatively, the dried crystals can be suspended in a high viscosity biocompatible medium for subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. The suspending medium may be aqueous or non-aqueous. Examples of aqueous suspensions include cellulose-based systems such as carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or polymer-based systems like polylactic acid-glycolic acid (PGLA). An example of non-aqueous medium is sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB) predissolved in solvents such as ethanol, propylene carbonate, or N-methyl pyrrolidone. A suspension of uniform size distribution can be prepared by homogenizing the dried crystals in the viscous medium using, by way of example, a probe homogenizer or a microfluidizer.","In one embodiment of the invention, there is provided an improved method for purifying and storing Apo2L\/TRAIL protein. More particularly, the methods of purification employ crystallization of Apo2L\/TRAIL and the crystals can be dried for storage. The methods provide an effective, efficient, and cost saving alternative to, for instance, purification protocols requiring multiple column purifications. Drying the crystalline material can also provide a relatively low volume, effective way of bulk storage which avoids freezing the purified material in bulk containers and thawing the frozen bulk material.","In the methods, an Apo2L\/TRAIL preparation, such as a cell paste containing recombinantly expressed Apo2L\/TRAIL protein, is provided. Optionally, though not required, the cell paste may be processed (for instance, may be exposed to one or more reducing agents such as DTT or BME) or partially purified using any suitable methods known in the art, such as cation exchange chromatography methods. Cation exchange chromatography materials may optionally be SP-Sepharose, CM-Sepharose, or Macro-prep ceramic HS resin. The processed or partially purified Apo2L\/TRAIL in the preparation can be crystallized from, for instance, a supersaturated solution by decreasing temperature and agitation using the methods described herein. The crystals may then be collected, and washed with buffer (or water) (preferably a cold buffer at a temperature of about 2 to 8\u00b0 C.). The washed crystals can be re-suspended or re-dissolved at ambient temperature.","Re-solubilized Apo2L\/TRAIL can be further purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, recrystallized, washed and stored as wet crystalline bulk material. Alternatively, the hydrophobic interaction or other chromatography step may be omitted in favor of simply recrystallizing. The wet crystalline bulk material can be stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. or dried for storage at ambient temperature (room temperature) or at 2-8\u00b0 C. Preferably, the dried crystalline material is re-solubilized in an arginine succinate-containing formulation described above. Optionally, such a formulation can be sterile filtered and\/or filled in individual dosage vials, and lyophilized for later reconstitution or suspension. Optionally, the dried crystalline formulation can be filled as a powder in vials and made into a solution or suspension.","The Apo2L\/TRAIL formulations described herein can be employed in a variety of therapeutic and non-therapeutic applications. Among these applications are methods of treating disorders, such as cancer, immune related conditions, or viral conditions. Such therapeutic and non-therapeutic applications are further described, for instance, in WO97\/25428, WO97\/01633, and WO 01\/22987.","In the methods of the invention for treating a disorder using a formulation disclosed herein, the formulation of Apo2L\/TRAIL can be directly administered to the mammal by any suitable technique, including infusion or injection. The specific route of administration will depend, e.g., on the medical history of the patient, including any perceived or anticipated side effects using Apo2L\/TRAIL and the particular disorder to be corrected. Examples of parenteral administration include subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, and intraperitoneal administration of the composition. The formulations are preferably administered as repeated intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intramuscular (i.m.) injections or infusions, intracranial infusions or as aerosol formulations suitable for intranasal or intrapulmonary delivery (for intrapulmonary delivery see, e.g., EP 257,956).","It is noted that osmotic pressure of injections may be important in subcutaneous and intramuscular injection. Injectable solutions, when hypotonic or hypertonic, may cause pain to a patient upon infusion. Usually, for the therapeutic, injectable formulations herein, it is preferred that the relative osmolarity of the injectable solution be about 300 mosm to about 600 mosm.","Apo2L\/TRAIL can also be administered in the form of sustained-release preparations. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the protein, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include cellulose derivatives (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose), sucrose-acetate isobutyrate (SABER\u2122) in non-aqueous media, polyesters, hydrogels (e.g., poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (Langer et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 1981, 15: 167-277; Langer, Chem. Tech. 1982, 12: 98-105 or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919, EP 58,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., Biopolymers 1983, 22: 547-556), non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra), degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the Lupron Depot (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988). One optional method of delivery for systemic-acting drugs involves administration by continuous infusion (using, e.g., slow-release devices or minipumps such as osmotic pumps or skin patches), or by injection (using, e.g., intravenous or subcutaneous means, including single-bolus administration).","The composition to be used in the therapy will be formulated and dosed in a fashion consistent with good medical practice, taking into account the clinical condition of the individual patient, the site of delivery of the composition, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to practitioners. The \u201ceffective amounts\u201d of each component for purposes herein are thus determined by such considerations and are amounts that result in bioavailability of the Apo2L\/TRAIL or other drugs to the mammal.","As a general proposition, the total pharmaceutically effective amount of the Apo2L\/TRAIL polypeptides administered will be in the range of from about 1 mg\/kg\/day to about 20 mg\/kg\/day based on kg of patient body weight although, as noted above, this will be subject to therapeutic discretion.","Although injection is preferred, an infusion device may also be employed for continuous infusions. An intravenous bag solution may also be employed.","It is contemplated that yet additional therapies may be employed in the methods. The one or more other therapies may include but are not limited to, administration of radiation therapy, cytokine(s), growth inhibitory agent(s), chemotherapeutic agent(s), cytotoxic agent(s), tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ras farnesyl transferase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors which are known in the art and defined further with particularity in Section I above. In addition, therapies based on therapeutic antibodies that target tumor antigens such as Rituxan\u2122 or Herceptin\u2122 as well as anti-angiogenic antibodies such as anti-VEGF, or antibodies that target Apo2L receptors, such as DR5 or DR4.","Preparation and dosing schedules for chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers' instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Ed., M. C. Perry, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md. (1992).","It may be desirable to also administer antibodies against other antigens, such as antibodies which bind to CD20, CD11a, CD18, CD40, ErbB2, EGFR, ErbB3, ErbB4, vascular endothelial factor (VEGF), or other TNFR family members (such as DR4, DR5, OPG, TNFR1, TNFR2). Alternatively, or in addition, two or more antibodies binding the same or two or more different antigens disclosed herein may be co-administered to the patient. Sometimes, it may be beneficial to also administer one or more cytokines to the patient. In one embodiment, the Apo2L formulations are co-administered with a growth inhibitory agent.","The Apo2L\/TRAIL formulation may be administered concurrently or sequentially with such other agents. For example, the Apo2L\/TRAIL formulation may be administered as a pre-treatment (prior to administration of any such other agents), such as a pre-treatment of cancer cells which may otherwise be resistant to the apoptotic effects of Apo2L\/TRAIL.","The invention also provides kits which include a formulation described herein. A typical kit will comprise a container, preferably a vial, for Apo2L\/TRAIL in one or more excipients as described above; and instructions, such as a product insert or label, directing the user as to how to employ the Apo2L\/TRAIL formulation. This would preferably provide a pharmaceutical formulation. Preferably, the pharmaceutical formulation is for treating cancer or an immune related condition. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, and test tubes. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds an Apo2L\/TRAIL formulation that is effective for diagnosing or treating the disorder and may have a sterile access port (for example, the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). The label on, or associated with, the container indicates that the formulation is used for diagnosing or treating the disorder of choice. The article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising water-for-injection, a pharmaceutically-acceptable solution, saline, Ringer's solution, or dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts with instructions for use.","All patents, patent applications, publications, product descriptions, and protocols are cited throughout this application, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way. Commercially available reagents referred to in the examples were used according to manufacturer's instructions unless otherwise indicated. The source of those cells identified in the following examples, and throughout the specification, by ATCC accession numbers is the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va.","Formulations were prepared and assays were conducted to identify Apo2L\/TRAIL formulations having desirable characteristics from a therapeutic, diagnostic, and\/or commercial standpoint. In particular, Applicants sought to identify formulation components and conditions that, among other things, may enhance solubility of biologically active Apo2L\/TRAIL, particularly at concentrations up to at least 20 mg\/ml, and may provide stability upon storage at 2-8\u00b0 C. or at ambient temperature. Applicants also sought to identify Apo2L\/TRAIL formulations for use in the clinic that may preserve the protein's native non-covalent trimer content, charge distribution, and\/or biological activity during storage.","Apo2L\/TRAIL protein consisting of amino acids 114-281 (see ) was expressed in under the AP promoter control (preparation and expression described in Example 8 (Section A) of WO 01\/00832 published Jan. 4, 2001), and purified from the cell lysates by three chromatographic steps consisting of cation exchange, hydroxyapatite, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (WO 01\/00832, Example 8, Section C). In the third chromatographic separation, the Apo2L\/TRAIL protein was eluted in 600 mM Na sulfate or 400 mM ammonium sulfate, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5. The protein was then buffer exchanged to the various formulation excipients listed in Table 1 by dialysis, and was next concentrated at ambient temperature using Centricon-10 filtration up to concentrations of 20 mg\/mL. The samples were then filtered through 0.22 micron filters and stored at either 2-8\u00b0 C. or 30\u00b0 C. to assess solubility and stability.","As shown in Table 1, about 20 different excipients were examined. High purity NF, USP, or EP grade excipients were used from common commercial sources (SIGMA\u2122, Mallindkrodt) unless otherwise indicated as follows: alpha,alpha trehalose dihydrate (Pfanstiehl or Senn), sucrose (Pfanstiehl), CAPTISOL\u2122 (Cydex), Arginine free base (Ajinomoto or Kyowa Hakko Kogyo). Criteria used for initial excipient screening included 1) solubility at 2-8\u25a1C (the storage condition of bulk preparations prior to fill in vials), 2) solubility under manufacturing scale ultrafiltration and diafiltration steps, 3) short term liquid stability and freeze-thaw stability, and 4) lyophilized formulation physical stability. Solubility at 2-8\u25a1C was evaluated by periodic visual assessment of precipitation for up to 1 month and confirmed by UV spectroscopy scan using an extinction coefficient of 1.53 at 278 nm.","Table 1 indicates that excipients having relatively high ionic strength conditions provided solubility at concentrations of Apo2L\/TRAIL above 10 mg\/ml at 2-8\u00b0 C.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0172","num":"0173"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Excipient","Solubility At 2-8\u00b0 C."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u20028% Trehalose","<3","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20028% Sucrose","<3","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"16% Sucrose","<2","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20026% Lactitol","<2","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20024% Sucrose\/4% Mannitol","<2","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20025% PEG3350","<5","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"20% Glycerol","<5","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"0.15 M NaCl","<5","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"0.25 M Na phosphate","<5","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20020.5 M Glycine","<12","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20020.5 M Aspartate","10-20","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20020.5 M Na sulfate","10-20","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20020.5 M Na acetate",">20","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20020.5 M Na chloride",">20","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"24% Sulfobutylether beta-",">20","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"cyclodextrin (Captisol\u2009\u2122)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20020.5M Tris",">20","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20020.5M Arginine-tartrate",">20","mg\/ml"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Short-term liquid stability (1 week storage time period at 30\u00b0 C.) was then evaluated for several of those preparations shown in Table 1 that provided solubility of Apo2L\/TRAIL at concentrations of about 20 mg\/ml.

Cysteine-containing proteins are typically formulated at low pH, well below the pKa of the thiol groups, to prevent disulfide bond formation (see, e.g., N. Derby and T. Creighton, \u201cDisulfide Bonds in Protein Folding and Stability,\u201d Methods in Enzymology, Vol 40 (Edited by B. A. Shirley; Humana Press Inc, Totowa, N.J.), Chapter 10 (1995)). Surprisingly, as the results discussed below reveal, the stability of native, non-covalent Apo2L\/TRAIL trimer was found to decrease with decreasing pH.","Apo2L\/TRAIL consisting of amino acids 94-281 () (referred to herein and in  as \u201cApo2L\/TRAIL.2\u201d) was prepared essentially as described in WO 01\/00832, except that a Ni-chelating affinity chromatography, instead of HIC, was used as the third chromatographic step. Formulations were prepared by dialysis into 10 mM Na succinate (pH range 5.5 to 6.5) or 10 mM Na phosphate (pH range of 7 to 7.5). Liquid stability of these formulations was assessed by SEC and bioactivity assays according to procedures described in the Examples above.","Within one day storage at ambient temperature, the formulations having pH below about pH 6.5 lost trimer content and bioactivity (see ). This pH-stability profile was observed with other Apo2L\/TRAIL protein variants. For example, a poly-histidine-tagged Apo2L\/TRAIL formulation consisting of amino acids 114-281 () (His-Apo2L\/TRAIL; prepared essentially as described by Ashkenazi et al., \u201cSafety and Antitumor Activity of Recombinant Soluble Apo2 ligand\u201d, 104:155-162 (1999) was prepared in 10 mM Na succinate (pH 5.5 to 6) or 10 mM Na phosphate buffers (pH 6.5 to 7). After storage at 30\u00b0 C. for 1 week, the stability of trimer and bioactivity (determined as described above for the formulations of ) was found to be enhanced at pH \u22676.5 (see ).","Crystal structure analysis of Apo2L\/TRAIL reveals that coordination of an intrinsic Zn atom to three free thiols of cysteine 230 is needed for proper folding and native structural stability of the protein (see WO 01\/00832 and Hymowitz et. al., supra). The unexpected pH-stability profile of Apo2L\/TRAIL, although not fully understood, is believed to be associated with loss in Zn binding to the trimer as the thiol moiety becomes more protonated at lower pHs (see ). It is believed that neutral pH in the range of about 6.5 to about 8.5 will be most preferred for maintaining the bioactivity and physical-chemical stability of Apo2L\/TRAIL formulations.","To examine the effect of surfactant on stability of Apo2L\/TRAIL formulations, formulations containing 20 mg\/ml Apo2L\/TRAIL (114-281 protein (); prepared as described in Example 1) in 0.5 M arginine-succinate, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.2, and varying concentrations of TWEEN 20\u2122 (0.005%, 0.01%, 0.02%, or none (as control)) were prepared and agitated at 70 rpm and ambient temperature for up to 24 hours in glass vials positioned horizontally. Within 1 hour of agitation, an increase in light scattering (measured by absorbance in the range of 340-360 nm) was observed as the concentration of TWEEN 20\u2122 fell below 0.005% ().","It is therefore believed that it may be preferable to include non-ionic surfactant(s) such as TWEEN 20\u2122 in Apo2L\/TRAIL formulations to enhance stabilization against agitation and handling that can denature the bulk protein at air-water interfaces.","A liquid formulation of Apo2L\/TRAIL protein consisting of residues 114-281 () (prepared as described in Example 1) was prepared using 20 mg\/ml Apo2L\/TRAIL, 0.5M arginine-tartrate, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.0, in the presence of zero, 117 uM, or 330 uM Zn sulfate. After storage at 30\u00b0 C. or 2-8\u00b0 for up to 2 months, stability was evaluated by SEC, IEX, and SDS-SEC (as described above in Examples 1 and 2) relative to \u221270\u00b0 C. control samples.","As shown in , addition of Zn sulfate to the formulations provided increased stabilization against disulfide-linked intramolecular dimer formation. Though Zn sulfate did not affect the stability of Apo2L\/TRAIL at 2-8\u00b0 C., it improved stability towards dimer formation at higher temperatures ().","Applicants have found that under conditions of low Apo2L\/TRAIL solubility (for example, at moderate to low ionic strength), the protein can be crystallized. As described herein, the crystallization rate, particle size, and yield can be controlled to give useful industrial methods for purification, bulk storage, and controlled release suspension formulation of Apo2L\/TRAIL.","Apo2L\/TRAIL protein consisting of residues 114-281 () (prepared as described in Example 1) was formulated at ambient temperature using NAP5 column (PHARMACIA\u2122) elution in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.2 and various concentrations of Na sulfate. After elution at ambient temperature, within hours, hexagonal shaped crystals of varying lengths were observed (see ). Equilibrium solubility was reached when samples were continuously rotated for 3-4 days at a given temperature. There was a minimum in solubility at approximately 10-50 mM ionic strength. Solubility increased to a maximum at approximately 0.3 M Na sulfate and then decreased until limiting solubility of the salt was reached. The pattern was similar at higher temperatures, but solubility increased with increasing temperature. The observation of increasing protein solubility (hence decreased crystallization) with increasing salt concentration in the hundreds of millimolar salt range is unlike common understanding with respect to other proteins, where crystallization propensity tends to increase with increasing salt concentration (see, e.g., A. Ducruix and MM Reis-Kautt, \u201cSolubility Diagram Analysis and the Relative Effectiveness of Different Ions on Protein Crystallization,\u201d METHODS: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 1, pp. 25-30 (1990)).","Monovalent cationic salts (such as sodium chloride) provided the greatest crystallization propensity as shown in , while divalent cationic salts (e.g. calcium chloride and magnesium chloride) significantly reduced crystallization. Crystallization also occurred in positively charged (lysine-salts and arginine-salts) and negatively charged (aspartic acid) amino acid solutions below 0.3 molar concentration (see ), though arginine salts reduced crystallization propensity at the same ionic strength.","To identify various crystallization process parameters, a 0.5 L solution containing 5 mg\/ml Apo2L\/TRAIL (residues 114-281; prepared as described in Example 1), 0.1M NaSOand 20 mM Tris at pH 7.2 was subjected to a single step cooling from room temperature to 5\u00b0 C.

Apo2L\/TRAIL (amino acids 114-281; purified according to the method described in Example 1) was crystallized in 20 mM Tris, 0.1 M sodium sulfate, pH 7.2 and washed with cold water to remove excess salt. The crystal slurry was filled in open glass vials and dried under 29-30 inches of mercury vacuum at ambient temperature overnight. The dried crystals were dissolved to 2-3 mg\/ml in either water or in 0.5 M arginine-salt, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.2.","The second drying method evaluated was vibrational vacuum drying (apparatus obtained from SWECO Co.) to allow better flow and decrease solid clumping. The crystal slurry was loaded on a 20 um filter to remove the bulk liquid, and the wet crystals were washed with cold Tris buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5) or ethanol-water mixture (50%, 63%, 75%, 100%, v\/v). The washed crystals were dried by passing dehumidified nitrogen gas from the bottom of the filter. A slight vacuum (8-10 inches of mercury) from the top of the filter chamber facilitated the drying rate. Furthermore, the filter chamber containing the wet crystals vibrated at 1,800 rpm to break up the wet cake into fine powder during the drying process. The drying process was monitored using a relative humidity sensor. Dried product was recovered through a discharge port. The ethanol-water mixture washes produced finer and better flowing powder than crystals washed with Tris buffer, which in turn increased the process yield. These crystals were dissolved in a buffered 0.5M arginine salt, as described for the vacuum dried crystals.","The third drying method evaluated was lyophilization. In this method, the crystal slurry was washed with cold water and filled in glass vials. Excess bulk water was removed after the crystals settled. The slurry was then frozen to \u221250\u00b0 C. Primary and secondary drying were carried out at \u221225\u00b0 C. and 0\u00b0 C., respectively.

The flocculated material was centrifuged by a BTPX205 (ALFA LAVAL\u2122 Separation AB, Sweden) continuous feed centrifuge and clarified by depth filtration. The clarified cell lysate (extract) was conditioned with Triton-X100 to a final concentration of 0.05%.

Apo2L\/TRAIL bound to the column while the non-binding proteins flowed through the column and were removed by washing with equilibration buffer until absorbance at 280 nm reached baseline. The column was then washed with 3 column volumes of 0.1 M NaCl in equilibration buffer. The Apo2L\/TRAIL was step-eluted using 0.1 M NaCl (or 0.1M NaSO) in 50 mM each of Hepes, Tris and Triethanolamine, 0.05% Triton-X 100 and 1 mM DTT buffer, pH 7.8.","The ambient temperature Apo2L\/TRAIL pool collected from the SP column was placed in a stainless steel tank with an insulated jacket for heating and cooling.

A temperature control skid was used to linearly ramp the temperature from approximately 25\u00b0 C. to approximately 4\u00b0 C. over the course of 1 hour. Spontaneous crystallization was observed within minutes after the pool reached 4\u00b0 C. After more than 12 hours under these conditions, crystallization was complete as equilibrium solubility was nearly established.

Following crystal deposition on the filter surface, the crystals were washed with chilled 20-50 mM Tris at pH 7.5. An equal volume of wash buffer compared to the Apo2L\/TRAIL SP pool volume was then used to remove residual mother liquor (supernatant) from the deposited crystals. Following the wash, the crystals were dissolved in 100 mM sodium sulfate\/20 mM Tris at pH 7.5 by recirculating the dissolution buffer through the crystal bed at approximately 30\u00b0 C.

The data indicate that the \u201cone-column\u201d step purified Apo2L\/TRAIL protein is amenable to crystallization and has a purity comparable to or better than the Apo2L\/TRAIL protein purified by the three-column purification method described in Example 1.  shows the effect of salt type on crystallization of a one-column step purified Apo2L\/TRAIL. \u201cPoisoning\u201d of crystallization by divalent cations was observed for partially purified Apo2L\/TRAIL (), similar to that observed for >99% purified Apo2L\/TRAIL shown in .","The biochemical properties of Apo2L\/TRAIL were also not adversely impacted by crystallization of the partially purified Apo2L\/TRAIL (see Table 7). The data suggest that crystallization of recombinant-expressed Apo2L\/TRAIL, when in a partially purified state, can be an effective, efficient and cost-effective means for its purification. Optionally, such crystals can then be used for preparation of dried bulk for storage or controlled release formulations as described in Examples 8 and 9.","The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein.
