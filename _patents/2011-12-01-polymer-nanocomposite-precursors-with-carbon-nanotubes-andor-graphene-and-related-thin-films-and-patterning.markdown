Field of the Invention","Embodiments of this invention relate to the design, synthesis, fabrication, characterization, and use of new coatings including soluble precursor conjugated polymers and nanotubes or graphene sheets to form new nanocomposites and dispersions or formulations. The coatings maybe used to form thin films and\/or to create patterned surfaces.","More specifically, embodiments of this invention relate to the design, synthesis, fabrication, characterization, and use of new coatings, where a soluble precursor conjugated polymer is able to aid in the dispersion and\/or deaggregation of nanotubes and\/or graphene sheets to form clear and stable solutions polymer coated nanotubes and\/or graphene sheets to form new nanocomposites and dispersions or formulations. Being polymerizable, the solutions are suitable for film formation and patterning substrate surfaces and the resulting films and patterned surfaces are amenable to crosslinking, e.g., electropolymerized and\/or oxidatively polymerized on a surface, as homogeneous crosslinked films. The films find utility as electrically conducting films, electro-optically active films, and in electropatterning thin film applications. The films and patterns find utility as electrically conducting films, electro-optically active films, sensing, solid-state devices and in electropatterning thin film applications.","2. Description of the Related Art","The discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene sheets (G) with their combination of extraordinary physical properties and ability to be dispersed in various polymer matrices has created a new class of polymer nanocomposites. Polymer nanocomposites containing CNTs and graphene have received high interest due to their unique properties, such as adjustable electrical conductivity, robust thermo-mechanical properties, and the potential to create new materials with improved characteristics coupled with good chemical stability.","Graphene has recently attracted attention due to its novel electronic, mechanical and thermal properties that have been well documented. However, just as with the newly discovered allotropes of carbon, such as carbon nanotubes, the limited availability of graphene and the lack of known adequate processes to transform it into valuable commercial products have been the rate-determining steps in the evaluation of graphene applications. However, the exploitation of the unique properties of nanocomposites made of carbon nanotubes and\/or graphene depends on the quality of their dispersion at the molecular level and the level of polymer-CNTs\/graphene interfacial interactions and\/or bonding through covalent bonding interactions and\/or non-covalent interactions.","An important challenge remaining for CNTs and graphene utilization in commercial products is achieving homogeneous dispersion of individual CNTs and individual graphene sheets to accelerate the use of such dispersions in various applications and especially in large scale applications. At the same time, it is desirable that such dispersions be easily made into films or paenabling the electro-optical and thermo-mechanical properties of the CNT\/graphene to be exhibited.","The manufacture of composites including carbon nanotubes and\/or graphene require not only that carbon nanotubes and\/or graphene sheets to be produced on a large enough scale, but also that they be incorporated and homogeneously distributed into various matrices. However, it is known that carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets are very hydrophobic and easily from irreversible agglomerates in polar solvents (in the absence of dispersing reagents) as a result of strong pi-pi (\u03c0-\u03c0) stacking and van der Waals interactions. Thus, various methods have been developed to stabilize these materials either by covalent modification or noncovalent modification using chemical agents such as aromatic molecules, surfactants, and polymers. Among those two strategies, the noncovalent modification is favored because it is more convenient to use and the electronic structure of CNTs and graphene sheets can be maintained.","The lack of dispersibility of graphite materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene in aqueous media and in organic solvents constitutes a significant barrier to the use of graphite materials. Thus, colloidal dispersions of oxidized graphite sheets are preferentially used in making composite materials. One such oxidized graphite is graphene oxide (GO), which is a graphene (G) material including oxygen functional groups, such as epoxide, \u2014OH, and \u2014COOH groups that make the graphene hydrophilic and, through electrostatic repulsion, are dispersible in polar solvents. Such dispersions may be stabilized by strong stirring or ultrasonication. Exfoliated GO may then be subjected to chemical or electrochemical reduction to obtain graphene as individual sheets typically using hydrazine as reducing agent. While the chemical reduction of GO resulted in significant restoration of spcarbon sites in the sheet, the reduction is unable to completely remove all the oxygen functionalities.","As the processing of CNTs is generally difficult due to their insolubility in most common organic solvents, only low weight\/weight (w\/w) or weight\/volume (w\/v) concentrations are usually obtained. It is necessary to obtain a homogeneous dispersion of CNTs in an organic solvent for film preparation. It is desirable to have a convenient and facile route for the formation of such homogeneous dispersions through solution mixing methods including a dispersant polymer and CNTs. One such approach, that has been commonly employed, is the direct grafting of small molecules or polymers on the surface of the CNTs, e.g. surface initiated polymerization (SIP). However, a drawback of SIP is a reduction in the electro-optical properties of the CNT. Another approach involves the use of non-covalently adsorbed initiators or end-grafted polymers on the surface of the CNT without disrupting the \u03c0-conjugation of the aromatic rings on the CNT.","While various methods for preparing composite materials including carbon nanotubes and\/or graphene sheets have been proposed, they all suffer from certain drawbacks. Thus, there is a need in the art for methods for making compositions including carbon nanotubes and\/or graphene sheets that are readily scalable, render homogeneous nanocomposites having unique properties and that do not suffer from the drawback of prior art methods. Patterning is also of high interest, because patterning surfaces can lead to more integration of these materials in devices and miniaturization.","Embodiments of this invention provide nano-composites, dispersion or formulations including a graphite derived material and allotropes and a polymer including sufficient \u03c0-conjugated moieties to interact with surfaces of the graphite material to form a graphite material partially or completely coated with the polymer, and provide methods for making nano-composites and using the nano-composites.","Embodiments of this invention provide compositions comprising nano-composites including graphite material having a partial or complete coating of a polymer including sufficient \u03c0-conjugated moieties to interact with surfaces of the graphite material.

PVK is well-known for its high chemical and thermal stability, photoconductivity, and opto-electronic properties, e.g., hole transporting properties. See, Xia, C.; Advincula, R. 2001, 13, 1682. Thus, the inventor has found that the incorporation of carbon nanotubes and\/or graphene oxide sheets into a PVK matrices to prepare polymer-CNTs nanostructured materials provide unique and interesting ways to extend the electro-optical properties of PVK. We have previously reported methods for the deposition of high optical quality ultrathin films made of \u03c0-conjugated polymer network (CPN) films on a flat conducting substrate including electro-nanopatterning. See, Baba, A.; Onishi, K.; Knoll, W.; Advincula, R. C. 2004, 108, 18949 and Taranekar, P.; Fulghum, T.; Baba, A.; Patton, D.; Ponnapati, R.; Clyde, G. Advincula, R. 2007, 129, 12537. In such instances, a polymer precursor is first synthesized and by design contains pendant electroactive monomer units. The precursor is then electropolymerized on the conducting substrate forming an insoluble cross-linked network of \u03c0-conjugated polymer (oligomer) segments. Various polymer backbones and dendrimers have been utilized. See, Taranekar, P.; Fulghum, T.; Baba, A.; Patton, D. and Advincula, R. Langmuir 2007, 23, 908. The addition of more monomers during the formation of the \u03c0-conjugated polymer network is important because the increased monomers facilitate the formation of more linear polymer species, thereby increasing the amount of \u03c0-conjugation and enhancing electrical conducting properties. See, Taranekar, P., Baba, A., Fulghum, T., Advincula, R. Macromolecules 2005, 38, 3679-3687. We have investigated this method dubbed \u201cprecursor polymer route\u201d by depositing films using electrochemical methods and applying them in the fabrication of OLED devices. Fulghum, T.; Karim, S. M. A.; Baba, A.; Taranekar, P.; Nakai, T.; Masuda, T.; Advincula, R. C. 2006, 39, 1467. Other approaches involved the use of layer-by-layer (LbL) films and electro-nanopatterning using current sensing atomic force microscopy (CS-AFM).

Huang, C.; Jiang, G.; Advincula, R. 2008, 41, 4661.

The dispersion may then be spin-coated onto a substrate including a film of PVK\/CNTs, PVK\/GO or mixtures an combinations thereof. The film may then be electropolymerization\/crosslinking by cyclic voltammetry (CV) to achieve film crosslinking and fixing onto the substrate. The initial dispersion of PVK and CNTs is performed in a highly miscible solvent for both. PVK is slowly and continuously added to a CNTs dispersion in order to form PVK\/CNTs solutions having various composition ratios. It is believed that the PVK polymers wrap around the CNTs to form partially PVK coated or wrapped CNTs. The method and order of this procedure and method for making is important and is an integral part of the invention set forth in the claims.","Embodiments of this invention relate to methods for making PVK\/GO nanocomposites is achieved by first oxidizing the G to form GO and subsequently adding PVK to disperse the GO through electrostatic repulsion and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. The method and order of this procedure and method for making is important and is an integral part of the invention set forth in the claims. These dispersions are then used to form solutions or spin-cast films that are electropolymerizable by cyclic voltammetry to form \u03c0-conjugated polymer network nano-composite films. While cyclic voltammetry (CV) is used herein to illustrate the present invention, other potentiodynamic and potentiostatic methods or constant potential electropolymerization (chronoamperometric) methods maybe used to achieve a similar goal\u2014as described in another section. Similarly a chemical oxidant such as FeClor NHSOor other oxidizing agents maybe used for polymerization, the common mechanism being the formation of a radical cation during the polymerization process. The formation of PVK\/CNTs and PVK\/GO nano-composites were investigated using fluorescence and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, CV, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), FT-IR ATR spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The thermal properties of PVK\/CNTs nano-composites were analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Correlation of the EIS impedance and dc conductivity data and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images provide a morphological and structural rationale for PVK\/CNTs nano-composite composition differentiation. Finally, films of nano-composites made of PVK\/CNTs and PVK\/GO were used to create patterns of the film surface.","Other embodiments of this invention relate to the design, synthesis, fabrication, characterization, and use of new types of electrodeposited (or chemically oxidized) polymer coatings (soluble precursor conjugated polymer) that are co-dispersed with carbon nanotubes or graphene sheets that are subsequently used to form thin films and\/or to create patterns on surfaces. Methods of this invention have the ability to use polymer precursors or composite precursors to disperse or deaggregate carbon nanotubes and graphene such that they form optically clear and transparent solutions (as shown in FIG. I.). This, in turn, allows them to be electropolymerized on electrode surfaces (or oxidatively polymerized by oxidizing agents or reductively polymerized by a reducing agent) as homogeneous films, which may then be used for electrically conducting, electro-optically active, and electropatterning thin film applications. An aspect of the methods of this invention is the use of a polymer or composite precursor that has the ability to deaggregate or delaminate carbon nanotube and graphene oxide sheet dispersions in order to avoid the formation of undesired clusters of nanotubes or graphene oxide sheets, as carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide sheets tend to spontaneously form clusters in absence of the polymer or composite precursors of this invention. The role of the polymer or composite precursor is to facilitate the process of deaggregation and delamination inside the dispersions, enabling the formation of clear solutions. The clear solutions then allows for the formation of homogeneous thin films and eventually nano-patterned surfaces. It should be emphasized also that electropolymerization (or chemical oxidative polymerization or chemical reductive polymerization) brings about the formation of \u03c0-conjugated polymer units through a radical cation reaction mechanism of the electroactive monomers such as the carbazole unit in PVK. The formation of clear and transparent solutions of nanotubes or graphene oxide sheets allows for the successful use of spin-casting or solution casting to make high quality clear and transparent films as wells as allows the successful use of other films forming methods such as doctor blade methods, painting, brushing, roll-to-roll processing, and other solution based film forming methods designed to apply films on small area or wide area surfaces. Also their ability to form clear, homogeneous, and transparent films make them useful for transparent and window-type applications. An important derivative procedure is that the films or patterns prepared from this dispersion, can be applied to a non-conducting or non-electrode substrate such as glass or plastic. This can in turn be crosslinked or oxidatively polymerized or reductively polymerized using a chemical oxidizing agent or initiator, which does not require an electrochemical procedure.","In other embodiments, the present invention relates to methods for synthesize nano-composites, where the methods include either a mix of poly (N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) or a mix of PVK and graphene oxide (GO). The MWCNTs (purity 95%) used herein were obtained commercially as Baytubes (C150 P). These MWCNTs are produced in a high-yield catalytic process based on chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The outer and inner diameter, length, and density of the MWCNTs are 13 nm, 4 nm, 1 \u03bcm, and 130-150 kg\/m, respectively. The obtained MWCNTs are further purified by heating at 200\u00b0 C. for 6 hours prior to use. The nano graphene platelets (NGPs) (purity 99.5%) used herein were obtained commercially from XG Sciences. These NGPs have thicknesses between 5 nm and 15 nm and widths between 5 \u03bcm and 25 \u03bcm. The obtained NGPs were oxidized using Hummers method prior to use. PVK was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals (USA) (ca MW between 25,000 g\/mol and 50,000 g\/mol). All solvents are analytical grade solvents and used without further purification.","The synthesis of poly (N-vinyl carbazole)\/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PVK\/MWCNTs) nano-composites were achieved using a solution mixing process. In a typical synthesis, different weight\/volume (mg\/mL) (w\/v) ratios of PVK were prepared in methylenedichloride (CHCl) or dimethylchloride (DMC) or in a mixing vessel with MWCNTs in N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP). The purified MWCNTs (5 mg\/mL) were dispersed in N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP) and ultrasonically agitated for 4 hours. The PVK was dissolved in CHClusing sonication process for 30 minutes to disperse the PVK in the solvent. The PVK solution was then slowly added into the MWCNTs dispersion, followed by another 1 hour sonication. The PVK\/MWCNTs dispersion was subjected to a high-speed centrifugation (4400 rpm, 1 hour). A black precipitate settled at the bottom of the tube, which are mostly aggregates of MWNTs. The precipitate was removed (ca 1 mg CNTs). The remaining solution of PVK\/MWCNTs dispersion was then treated with 5 mL of methanol and again placed in a high speed centrifugation (4400 rpm for 30 minutes). A batch of a blackish precipitate comprising MWCNTs wrapped by PVK was collected. From the initial mass of PVK and MWCNTs used and the small amount of MWCNTs that are removed after sonication\/centrifugation, the mass ratio of PVK to CNTs is about 1:1. The above PVK\/MWCNTs precipitate was redispersed in DCM (mg\/mL) followed by 20 minutes of ultrasonication, which furnishes a stable PVK\/MWCNTs solutions. The inventor has found that it is possible to optimize various concentrations in different miscible solvent systems of the PVK\/MWCNT using this method. It should be emphasized that the procedure outlined here constitutes a concentrated \u201cmother solution\u201d of the PVK\/CNT, which maybe diluted or mixed with other miscible solvents to achieve a particular viscosity, transparency, volatility, miscibility, and chemical inertness. The method and order of this procedure and method for making is important and is an integral part of the invention set forth in the claims.","The initial step for the synthesis of poly (N-vinyl carbazole)\/graphene oxide (PVK\/GO) nano-composites includes preparing graphene oxide (GO) from exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets. The procedure goes as follows: To 1 g of graphite powder, 23 mL of cooled concentrated HSOwere added. Three grams of KMnOwere then added gradually with stirring and cooling to maintain the temperature below 20\u00b0 C. The mixture was stirred at 35\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes and 46 mL of distilled water were slowly added to cause an increase in temperature to 98\u00b0 C. The temperature of the prepared mixture was maintained for 15 minutes. The reaction was terminated by adding 140 mL of distilled water. After termination, 10 mL of 30% HOsolution were added. The mixture was subjected to centrifugation to separate a solid product. The solid product was washed repeatedly with 5% HCl solution until sulfate could not be detected with BaCl. The product was then washed 3-4 times with acetone and dried in an oven overnight. The colloidal dispersion of GO sheets was obtained by dispersing 50 mg of GO in different solvents by sonication for 30 minutes. The method and order of this procedure and method for making is important and is an integral part of the invention set forth in the claims.","The PVK\/GO nano-composites were prepared using a solution mixing process. In a typical synthesis, the weight\/volume (mg\/mL) (w\/v) ratios of PVK and GO are prepared in N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP). The prepared GO is dissolved in N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP) and ultrasonically agitated for 1 hour. The PVK was dissolved in DCM using sonication process for 30 minutes to disperse the PVK in the solvent. The PVK solution was slowly mixed to a GO dispersion, followed by another 30 minutes sonication. The PVK\/GO dispersion was subjected to a high-speed centrifugation (4400 rpm, 30 minutes) and a grayish precipitate that settled at the bottom of the tube was collected as PVK\/GO nano-composites. The above precipitate was redispersed in CHP followed by 20 minutes of ultrasonication, which furnishes a stable PVK\/GO solution. Note that it is possible to optimize various concentrations in different miscible solvent systems of the PVK\/GO using this method.

Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass plate (1 inch\u00d70.5 inch) is used as the substrate for PVK\/MWNTs and\/or PVK\/GO nanocomposites using \u03c0-conjugated polymer network (CPN) film fabrication. The ITO-coated glass plates were cleaned by sequentially sonicating the plates in deionized water, isopropanol, hexane and toluene, each for 15 minutes. The clean plates or substrates were dried in an oven and under a stream of N. The ITO glass substrate was plasma cleaned for 3 minutes prior to use. A spin-coating speed was set based on the viscosity of the solution to be spin-coated onto the substrate. A thin PVK\/MWNTs and PVK\/GO film was spin-coated onto the ITO glass substrate at 500 rms for 60 seconds and 1500 rms for 30 seconds consecutively to deposit a film on the ITO substrate surface. After spin-coating deposition, the nanocomposite films were thoroughly dried in a vacuum oven for 24 hours at 70\u00b0 C. to remove any solvent.","Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out with a Princeton Applied Research Parstat 2263 using a three (3) electrode set-up from a solution of 0.1 M LiClOdissolved in acetonitrile (ACN). The coated ITO glass substrate was used as the working electrode (WE), Pt wire as the counter electrode (CE) and Ag\/AgCl as the reference electrode (RE). Electrochemical cross-linking of PVK\/MWNTs and\/or PVK\/GO nanocomposite films was accomplished by repeatedly cycling an electrode potential between the limits 0 to 1.4 V for up to 50 cycles at a potential scan rate of 50 mV\/s. The \u03c0-conjugated polymer network (CPN) nanocomposite film being insoluble in ACN solvent was thoroughly washed with ACN and dried in nitrogen before the analysis of the film to remove excess PVK. Alternatively, the PVK\/NWNT and\/or PVK\/GO films may be crosslinked using a prior art method comprising a chemical oxidant to provide for the reaction of carbazole (or other electro-active monomer units) via a radical cation coupling mechanism. This alternative method may involve the spin-coating or casting of the solution to a non-conducting or conducting (electrically) substrate followed by drying. The dried film is then treated with a solvent (immiscible to the film) containing the chemical oxidant. This will result in a similar polymerization mechanism and conversion of the precursor to a conjugated polymer network composite.","The dispersion and interfacial interaction of MWNTs and GO within PVK polymer matrix films prepared by solution mixing cast on ITO glass substrate was determined by UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic methods. UV-vis spectra were recorded using an Agilent 8453 spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer LS-45 luminescence spectrometer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Princeton Applied Research Parstat 2263) was used to investigate the change of electrochemical system and interface within PVK\/MWNTs and PVK\/GO nanocomposites. The EIS measurements for the nanocomposite films were performed under open circuit potential in an ac frequency range from 100,000 Hz to 0.01 Hz with an excitation signal of 5 mV. All electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature. The dc conductivity of pure PVK polymer and PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposite films were measured by an Alessi four point probe method at room temperature (Keithley 2400). For the four-point probe test, a fixed current was applied to the substrate through two outer probes and a voltage was measured between two inner probes. The measured resistances were converted into conductivity by multiplying by the constant 4.532. The product was the sheet resistance in \u03a9\/surface area of the film being measured. The calculated sheet resistance was then multiplied by the film thickness to get the conductivity of the prepared film. The data shown represented mean measurement values from at least 10 trials for every sample. FT-1R-attenuated total internal reflection (ATR) spectra were recorded with a FTS 7000 Digilab Spectrometer within the 700-3500 cmrange in multiple ATR geometry at the surface of the waveguide prism equipped with a liquid N-cooled MCT detector. The Raman analysis of pure MWNTs and its nanocomposites were recorded using FTS 7000 Digilab Spectrometer. The excitation wavelength was of 1064 nm using an Nd:YAG laser having an energy setting of 500 mW. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was taken on D5000 diffractometer using Cu K{acute over (\u03b1)}.","Thermal stabilities of the prepared PVK\/MWNTs and PVK\/GO nanocomposites were performed from 20\u00b0 C. to 900\u00b0 C. at a heating rate of 20\u00b0 C.\/min by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a TA Instruments 2950 thermogravimetric analyzer. All experiments were performed under a Natmosphere at a purge rate of 80-90 mL\/min. The experimental samples weighing from 5 to 10 mg were prepared from 5 mL of nanocomposite solutions, which was precipitated using 3 mL methanol. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out on all samples from 20\u00b0 C. to 600\u00b0 C. at a heating rate of 20\u00b0 C.\/min. TGA and DSC data were analyzed using TA Instruments' Universal Analysis software. The morphology before and after electropolymerization of PVK\/MWNTs and PVK\/GO on ITO glass substrates were characterized by Atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM imaging was done under ambient conditions with a PicoSPM II (PicoPlus, Molecular Imaging\u2014Agilent Technologies) in the Magnetic AC mode (MAC mode) using a magnetic field to drive a magnetically coated cantilever in the top-down configuration. Type II MAC levers with a spring constant of 2.8 nN\/M with about 10 nm tip radius were used for all scans. The contact angle goniometry was measured using a KSV CAM 200 instrument utilizing bubble drop method with water.","In other embodiments, the present invention relates to the preparation of solutions of PVK\/MWNTs by initially dispersing carbon nanotubes in an appropriate medium. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have unique structural, mechanical, thermal and electronic properties, and have extensive applications in many fields. However, the manipulation and processing of CNTs have been limited by their insolubility in most common organic solvents and tendency to aggregate. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was employed to gain further insight into the capability of solvents and sonication time to disperse multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as optical inspection of dispersions only indicated the presence or absence of particles that are larger than 10 \u03bcm. The UV-vis spectra were obtained under identical conditions, and the solutions were diluted by the same factor so that qualitative comparisons between the different solvents could be made. UV-vis absorbance as a function of organic solvent to the length of sonication time in the range of 300-800 nm are presented in . All the solutions had the same starting concentration of MWCNTs and the observed increase in absorbance indicated an increase in concentration of unbundled MWCNTs remaining in the solution after the sonication\/centrifugation process. Different organic solvents including CHP, NMP, DMF and DMSO demonstrated stability and it can be observed from the spectra that CHP exhibited the highest absorbance compared to NMP, DMF, and DMSO. Sonication has been proven to be necessary to help the dispersion of MWCNTs in a solvent. However, excessive sonication has been reported to damage and cut the MWCNTs. To monitor the dispersion as a function of sonication time used in this work, UV-vis spectroscopy was carried out on the solutions. With increasing sonication time up to 4 hours, the intensity of whole spectral region increased and the dispersion of MWNTs became better.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0163"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"sub":["2","2","2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0164"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0165"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"sub":["2 ","2 "]},"To understand the interfacial differences between the PVK\/MWNTs solutions as compared to pure PVK, DSC analysis is also performed in this study.  shows the DSC traces of pure MWNTs, pure PVK and PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites. For pure PVK, the melting temperature (T) is observed around 420\u00b0 C. and glass transition temperature (T) at 190\u00b0 C. The introduction of MWNTs into the PVK polymer matrix leads to an increase in the Tand Twhich could be due to high interfacial area of interaction between MWNTs and PVK, which in turn decreases the mobility of the outer polymer chain segments due to steric hindrance. This also presents further evidence of the wrapping around of the PVK chains on the MWNTs. These results could be a manifestation of the compatibility of PVK and MWNTs as has been reported elsewhere.","Another embodiment of the present invention discloses the electrochemical deposition, characterization, and spectroscopic analysis of nanocomposite films made of PVK\/MWNTs or \u03c0-conjugated polymer network (CPN). FIG. I. describes the cyclic voltammograms recorded on Au electrode spin-coated with PVK and PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposite in 0.1 M LiClOin ACN at different scan rates; (a) pure PVK, (b) 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs, (c) 95% PVK\/5% MWNTs, and (d) 93% PVK\/7% MWNTs. In all cases the 1st cyclic voltammogram is presented. Potentials are reported against Ag\/AgCl reference electrode. CV electrodeposition, cross-linking and characterization of the prepared PVK (control) and PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposite films are done in 0.1 M LiClOin ACN with potential scans from 0-1.2 V. The solutions prepared as described previously are spin-casted on the ITO glass substrate and in Au substrate to directly measure the thickness of the film. Note that the spin-coated films are insoluble to ACN.  shows the cyclic voltammograms of pure PVK scanned at 50 mV\/s for 50 cycles and PVK\/MWNTs films at different scan rates in order to cross-link the PVK film forming the \u03c0-conjugated polymer network (CPN) film (). For pure PVK, an irreversible oxidation peak at about 0.9-1.0 V and reduction peak at 0.7 V is observed in the voltammogram which suggest the formation of the of carbazolylium radical cation, and a cross-linked material having a higher electrical conducting behavior compared to the PVK precursor. This essentially represents the formation of a CPN control film.  depicts the cyclic voltammograms recorded on ITO glass electrode spin-coated with (A) pure PVK and (B) 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs CPN film in 0.1 M LiClOin ACN at 50 mV\/s for 50 cycles. Potentials are reported against Ag\/AgCl reference electrode. The scan rate dependence studies for pure PVK at scan rates 10-200 mV\/s was also investigated. The current of the oxidation\/reduction peaks are dependent on scan rates in the range of 50-200 mV\/s (). The electron transfer rate depends on the electron transfer resistance across the electrode\/conductive polymer\/electrolyte layer model. The shapes of the voltammogram are different when the MWNTs are added to the electrochemically cross-linkable PVK. A downshift in the reduction peak is observed for PVK\/MWNTs and this could be due to the doping behavior of the negatively charged MWNTs. No anodic peak is observed regardless of the number of cycles employed on the PVK\/MWNTs film deposited in ITO glass substrate. The electrochemical cross-linking of PVK and MWNTs carried out at different voltage scan rates shows a good correlation with the cathodic peak current and voltage scan rate indicating that the electron transfer is diffusion controlled. The observed correlation is in agreement with the EIS analysis as will be discussed further. With increasing number of cycles recorded for the PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites, a gradual shift in peak potentials for the reduction peaks is indicative of the doping role of MWNTs which would assume a negative charge. Such a down-shift in the cathodic peak could be due to the doping role of MWNTs, which are known to be amphoteric in character (can be doped with either electron donor or acceptor). Taking into account in this CPN nanocomposite films the PVK acting as electron donor and MWNTs which act as the electron acceptor. Note that CV is used herein as a representative method among other existing potentiodynamic electropolymerization methods. Other potentiostatic methods or constant potential electropolymerization methods can be used to achieve the same or a similar goal. Similarly a chemical oxidant such as, but not limited to FeClor NHSOor other oxidizing agents can be used for polymerization, the common mechanism being the formation of a radical cation during the polymerization process. Therefore as an alternative method based on prior art, the use of a chemical oxidant to provide for the reaction of carbazole (or other electro-active monomer units) via a radical cation coupling mechanism can be employed. This can involve the spin-coating or casting of the solution to a non-conducting or conducting (electrically) substrate followed by drying. The dried film is then treated to a solvent (immiscible to the film) containing the chemical oxidant. This will result in a similar polymerization mechanism and conversion of the precursor to a conjugated polymer network composite.","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is well established as a powerful tool for investigating interfacial charge-transfer of a given system. It is also useful for investigating ion-transport phenomena in thin films. The charge-transfer in nanocomposites can occur at both the interface between the PVK and MWNTs and the PVK and the electrodes used. Thus, the need to investigate the interfacial properties of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites films is important for understanding fundamental properties of the nanocomposites and in evaluating their utility for devices. To evaluate the variations in interfacial properties of PVK\/MWNTs, the qualitative differences in impedance spectra according to the different ratios of the MWNTs in PVK polymer matrix is considered. The pure PVK and PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposite films are spin coated in ITO glass substrate and are electropolymerized using CV at 50 mV\/s for 50 cycles from 0-1.4 V. The equivalent circuit model for the working electrode employed in this work and the physical significance of the components are presented in an inset graph. The equivalent circuit for this state is based on the modified Randles circuit, wherein the sum of the electrolyte resistance and polymer electronic resistance, Celectrolyte interface, R, the charge-transfer resistance and Za complex circuit element is included. In this case, Ris attributed primarily to the charge transfer resistance. A 45\u00b0 slope in the Nyquist plot as the percentage of MWNTs in the composite increases signals the presence of a Warburg element (Z), which represents diffusion mass transport. At low frequencies it is possible to estimate the faradaic pseudocapacitance (redox) which is associated with the capacitive behavior of a film. The physical origin of Cmeans that its magnitude increases with the quantity of electroactive material deposited in the substrate. As presented in , in spite of similar shape of the impedance spectra, an obvious difference in the diameters of the semicircles which corresponds to the electron transfer-limited process measured at higher frequencies, the Rof PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites decreases as the loading of the MWNTs increases. The spectra proved the formation of the charge-transfer complex of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites occurs and that charge-transfer flows through the film. The complex plane impedance plots produced from the analysis of PVK\/MWNTs CPN nanocomposite films are presented inset graph of . The intercepts of the pure PVK and CPN nanocomposites film with the real impedance 55.78 and for 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs is 48.10, this result shows that the CPN nanocomposite film is 7.68 less resistive than pure PVK. While this result is in agreement with a conductive contribution from the addition of MWNTs, this decrease in resistance could also be due to the formation of CPN between the nanotubes and PVK polymer chains.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0170","num":"0169"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A&B","FIG. 9","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0171","num":"0170"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A&B","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B"]},"The FT-IR-ATR spectra of pure MWNTs, pure PVK and 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs CPN films spin-coated in ITO glass substrate are shown in  ranging from 700 to 3500 cm. For pure MWNTs, the peak at 1630 cmis due to the C\u2550C stretch mode in the MWNTs. The main absorption peaks of pure PVK structure are shown at the following characteristic bands at around 700-800 cm(out of plane \u2014C\u2014H aromatic), 1100-1150 cm(in plane \u2014C\u2014H aromatic) and at around 1600 cm(C\u2550C stretching). The peaks of pure PVK are attributed to the following vibrations at 720 (ring deformation of substituted aromatic structure), 744 (>CHrocking vibration due tail to tail addition), 1159 (out of plane deformation of vinylidene group and C\u2014H in plane deformation of aromatic ring), 1220 (C\u2014N stretching of vinyl carbazole), 1326 (\u2014CHdeformation of vinylidene group), 1459 (ring vibration of n-vinyl carbazole), and 1626 cm(C\u2550C stretching vibration of vinylidene group). However, the 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs CPN film material significantly changes bonds at 744 and 1459 cm. The addition of MWNTs in the PVK solution result in a new absorption band from 744 to 749 cm, 1459 to 1449 cm, and 1626 to 1620 cm. The FTIR spectra of pure PVK and PVK\/MWNTs CPN film show similar bands with a little variation in the stretching frequencies. The shift in the peak region between 700-1600 cmis related to the change in the structure of the polymer, in which the spectra shows a shift to a lower wave number is an indicative of an increase in the conjugation length and these observed changes in characteristics peaks in PVK provides the information that the MWNTs are wrapped by PVK and PVK is successfully cross-linked with MWNTs. Note that the IR properties imbued by the combination of the PVK and the MWNT is not only an intrinsic property but also a possible application of such films where the functional group chemistry is employed.","Raman spectroscopic analysis further supports the wrapping of MWNTs by PVK matrix. The Raman spectroscopic results of pure MWNTs and its corresponding PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites are presented in , respectively. The Raman spectra for the pure MWNTs show two peaks around (D-band) known as the disorder or defect band at 1340 cmand (G-band) known as the graphitic or tangential band at 1594 cm. The peak at G-band represents the spbonds having a planar configuration. The D-band corresponds to the spbonds, the tetrahedral configuration and this band could also explain the disorder in spbonds (graphene edge configuration). The intensities of the characteristic bands of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites bands shifted towards the higher wavenumber. This suggests that the PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposite material needs more energy to vibrate the individual nanotube and each tube became bulky that could be due to the MWNTs wrapped by the PVK polymer chains and some of the PVK polymer chains are even grafted in the MWNTs outer surface. Note that the Raman properties imbued by the combination of the PVK and the MWNT are not only an intrinsic property but also a possible application of such films where the functional group chemistry is employed.","Another embodiment of the present invention discloses the electrical properties of nanocomposite films made of PVK\/MWNTs or PVK\/MWNTs CPN. One of the important methods to compare the state of the nanotube dispersion at a given concentration is electrical conductivity measurements on films. In this study the conductivity of pure PVK, and PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites at various compositions are measured using the four point probe conductivity test. For the four-point probe test, a fixed current is injected into the substrate through the two outer probes and a voltage is measured between the two inner probes. The measured resistances are converted into conductivity by multiplying the constant 4.532. The product is the sheet resistance in\/area of the film being measured. The calculated sheet resistance is multiplied by the film thickness to get the conductivity of the prepared film. The measured conductivity is summarized in Table 1.

PVK belongs to a class of conjugated polymers that become electrically conductive upon the addition of electron donors or acceptors. The conductivity of PVK is about 10to 10S\/cm, whereas with increasing MWNTs level, the conductivity increases. Dispersing the conducting filler, MWNTs in the polymer matrix forms a conductive polymer nanocomposite. The prepared CPN nanocomposite films of compositions 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs, 95% PVK\/5% MWNTs, and 93% PVK\/7% MWNTs show the conductivity of 5.53\u00d710\u2032, 0.53, and 1.79 S\/cm which clearly shows a remarkable increase in conductivity. This increase in conductivity could be due to the formation of an interconnected network between PVK and MWNTs which then permits a very high percentage of electrons to flow through the conductive path in the PVK\/MWNTs matrix. But, increasing the concentration of MWNTs in PVK solution to 9% by weight, the MWNTs started to agglomerate as evidenced from the PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposite solution (Supporting information). Insulating polymers are transformed to conductive composites by addition of MWNTs above a critical concentration or percolation threshold. When the positions of MWNTs in the polymer matrix form a conducting film, the conductivity of nanocomposites greatly increased, this may be due to the formation of percolating network. Percolation means that at least one pathway of connected MWNTs exists in the sample which in case of conductive fillers allows the charge to flow through the sample. In conductive fillers like MWNTs, electrical measurements are suitable to detect the percolation composition. In this study the percolation threshold is found to be in the range of 3% to 5% MWNTs. In this range the conductivity shows a high increase and the composites with MWNTs content higher than 5% weight can be regarded as electrically conductive. These values mean that in the presence of 5% MWNTs in the PVK matrix is enough to form a network of conductive path. Above the percolation threshold concentration, 3% MWNTs independent fillers tend to link together to form conductive networks which leads to a significant increase in the conductivity of the prepared CPN nanocomposite films. Note that the conducting properties imbued by the combination of the PVK and the MWNT are not only an intrinsic property but also a possible application of such films where the conducting property is employed.","The conductivity study of the nanocomposites shows that better dispersion of MWNTs in the polymer matrix greatly enhances the conductivity. The minimum MWNTs sidewall damage and improved percolation in PVK\/MWNTs CPN nanocomposite films leads to an improvement in its electrical conductivity. Hence, this study suggests an effective way to improve dispersion of MWNTs into PVK matrices and also retain the electronic structure of MWNTs that could be used in various functional materials and coatings. In principle, utilizing single walled nanotubes (SWNT) should even show a more remarkable change in conductivity and electro-optical properties assuming the same dispersion qualities.","Another embodiment of the present invention discloses the morphology of nanocomposite films made of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposite films, and PVK\/MWNTs CPN.  shows the AFM topography of (A) 93% PVK\/7% MWNTs nanocomposite film spin-coated on ITO glass substrate and (B) 93% PVK\/7% MWNTs CPN nanocomposite film. The AFM image of CPN nanocomposite film is electropolymerized for 50 cycles at a range of 0-1.4 V with a scan rate of 50 mV\/s in 0.1 M LiClO\/ACN as electrolyte. AFM is a very useful tool for investigating the morphology of the modified surfaces because it provides spatial resolution, film topology, and nanostructure formation. The surface topography of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites in terms of roughness values of the interfaces can also be analyzed by AFM.  shows the topographies of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposite films deposited using spin casting in ITO glass substrate before and after electropolymerization. The 93% PVK\/7% MWNTs nanocomposite film shows an elongated globular kind of clusters that can be attributed to the presence of MWNTs, since there composition is in agreement with 3% with respect to the composition of PVK with rms value of 3.11 nm. This result suggests a homogeneous wrapping of MWNT within the PVK polymer matrix is achieved especially at the 93% PVK\/7% MWNTs composition. The measured water contact angle is found to be 53.30\u00b0 in water. The PVK\/MWNTs CPN nanocomposite film shows rms value of 4.86 nm which is also correlated to the decrease in the surface energy of the film as revealed in the measured WCA of 89.13\u00b0. The increase in the measured WCA indicates that a more hydrophobic PVK\/MWNTs CPN nanocomposite films is grafted in the substrate.","Another embodiment of the present invention discloses the preparation and characterization of nanocomposites made of poly (N-vinyl carbazole) and graphene oxide (GO). Stable graphene dispersion is hard to prepare under common mechanical method like stirring and sonication because of inter and intra pi-pi stacking of graphene with a mount of carbon leads to aggregation. The action of mechanical forces is beneficial in dispersing the graphene but it is not enough to control the aggregation of graphene sheets through van der waals interactions. In this work the pristine graphite is oxidized using Hummers method to produce graphene oxide (GO). The GO containing oxygen functionalities, such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and epoxide easily forms GO dispersion in most organic solvents. But GO, is not as conductive as pristine graphite thus reduction of GO using chemical method like hydrazine could produce electrically conductive graphene. As the reduction of GO proceeds, the brown solution of GO turns into black. The mechanism for oxidation-reduction of graphite using Hummers method is presented in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0180","num":"0179"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0181","num":"0180"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},"To understand the formation of GO and R-GO, DSC analysis is also performed in this study.  shows the DSC traces of pure NGP, GO and R-GO.

The coated ITO glass substrate is used as the working electrode (WE), Pt wire as the counter electrode (CE) and Ag\/AgCl as the reference electrode (RE). Electrochemical cross-linking of PVK\/GO nanocomposite films is accomplished by repeatedly cycling an electrode potential between the limits 0 to 1.4 V for up to 50 cycles at a potential scan rate of 50 mV\/s (). The \u03c0-conjugated polymer network (CPN) nanocomposite film being insoluble in ACN solvent is thoroughly washed with ACN and is dried in nitrogen before the analysis of the film to remove excess PVK. Note that an alternative method based on prior art is the use of a chemical oxidant to provide for the reaction of carbazole (or other electro-active monomer units) via a radical cation coupling mechanism. This can involve the spin-coating or casting of the solution to a non-conducting or conducting (electrically) substrate followed by drying. The dried film is then treated to a solvent (immiscible to the film) containing the chemical oxidant. This will result in a similar polymerization mechanism and conversion of the precursor to a conjugated polymer network composite.","XRD is an effective method to evaluate the interlayer changes of graphite-related powders and crystalline properties of nanocomposite. XRD patterns of the nanocomposites further support the preparation of PVK\/GO as individual graphene sheets in the nanocomposites as presented in . After the electrochemical cross-linking of GO in PVK matrix, the XRD pattern of the PVK\/GO nanocomposites shows only the diffraction peak for PVK and the peak for GO is shifted to a larger 2 theta. A similar phenomenon can also be observed for many polymer\/GO nanocomposites and is considered to be a result of polymer crystallization that is induced by graphene. This result could be due to the electrostatic interaction that may contribute to the ordered arrangement of the PVK attached to GO.","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to investigate the change of electrochemical system and interface within PVK\/GO nanocomposites. EIS measurements for the PVK\/NGP-GO nanocomposite films are performed under open circuit potential in an ac frequency range from 100,000 to 0.01 Hz with an excitation signal of 5 mV. The EIS data are analyzed using the nyquist plot which show the frequency response of the electrode\/electrolyte system and are the plots of the imaginary component (Z\u2033) of the impedance against the real component (Z\u2032). From the nyquists plots shown in  of the pure PVK, GO and PVK\/GO display a small semicircle at high frequency followed by a transition to linearity at low frequency. The intercepts of the pure PVK and PVK\/GO nanocomposites film with the real impedance 58.65 and for PVK\/GO is 35.10, this result shows that the PVK\/GO nanocomposite film is 23.55 less resistive than pure PVK. While this result is in agreement with a conductive contribution from the addition of GO, this decrease in resistance could also be due to the formation of between the cross-linking of GO and PVK polymer chains.","Another embodiment of the present invention discloses the use of nanocomposite films made of PVK\/MWNTs and PVK\/GO to create patterns on their surface. First, nanoparticles of polystyrene microbeads (or colloidal crystals) are layered. This layering is accomplished using a similar procedure described earlier by Grady and co-workers. The method is called Langmuir-Blodgett (LB)-like technique for it forms a monolayer of PS particles onto flat surfaces without using the conventional LB set-up that employs floating barriers. Briefly, the substrate is attached into the dipper motor via Teflon clip and is dipped into an aqueous solution containing PS particles (1 wt. %) and sodium n-dodecyl sulfate or SDS (34.7 mM) as spreading agent. Note that a higher concentration of anionic surfactant (SDS) will result to multiple layers of highly disordered latex spheres while a lower concentration will not form a full coverage in hexagonal array. Then the substrate is withdrawn vertically from the solution at a lift-up rate between 0.1 to 0.3 mm\/min. Finally, the substrate is dried by suspending it in air for a few minutes. The monolayer ordering of the microsphere particles has been reported to be dependent on the LB-like technique and the concentration of the particles and surfactant (SDS) in solution. The addition of surfactant has been explained to increase the ionic strength of the solution, and thus creating a driving force for the migration of particles from the bulk solution to the air-liquid interface. Also, the surfactant molecules at the air-liquid interface has been reported to slow down the evaporation rate of the latex-surfactant solution with respect to the latex solution, giving more time for the particles to rearrange and form a highly ordered arrays on the substrate as the liquid film evaporates. The other roles of surfactant towards the formation of well-ordered arrays of latex spheres have been explained elsewhere.","The electropolymerization (as illustrated in step 2 of ) is done using cyclic voltammetric (CV) and chronoamperometric techniques using an Autolab PGSTAT 12 potentiostat (Brinkmann Instruments now MetroOhm Inc) in a standard three electrode measuring cell (fabricated electrochemical cell with a diameter of 1.0 cm and 0.785 cm, Teflon made) with platinum wire as the counter electrode, Ag\/AgCl wire as the reference electrode, and the bare Au or PS coated Au substrate as the working electrode (). The PVK\/MWNTs and PVK\/GO nanocomposite solution (1 mg\/ml) by (w\/v) is further diluted with ACN (1:200) dilution factor. The potential is scanned between 0 V to 1.5 V at varying scan rate and cycles. After the electrodeposition, the resulting film is washed in ACN (for 3 times), and a monomer free scan is performed by using exactly the same experimental parameters but for 1 CV cycle only. Then the electropolymerized substrate is dried with Ngas. The PS microspheres are removed from the surface after electropolymerization by dipping the PS coated substrate in THF for 30 minutes (2 times) to create the inverse colloidal crystals of composite films. The THF removes the PS particles only and not the electropolymerized composite film. Then the substrate is allowed to dry naturally under ambient condition.","One interesting application of the CNT and PVK nanocomposite is to make a robust and conducting patterned surface of 2D arrays (called inverse opals) via facile approach called colloidal template assisted electropolymerization. Recently, inverse opals have become a significant interest due to myriad applications such as photonic crystals, diffraction gratings, biosensors, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The use of polymers in making inverse opals is advantageous since they have unique mechanical, optical, and electrochemical properties. These properties are highly enhanced with the incorporation of CNT, which are known to have inherent electrochemical, electrical and mechanical properties. To date, CNTs have been applied to nanoelectronic devices, composite materials, field-emission devices, atomic force microscope probes, gas and chemical sensors, lithium ion storage, 3D electrode, etc. Previously, single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been reported to have a great potential for the reinforcement of polymer matrix composites because of their high strength, outstanding thermal property and good electrical conductivity.","To illustrate the patterning, the nanocomposite is electrodeposited via CV around a sacrificial template layer of PS particles (500 nm size) thru PVK, which has a carbazole moiety that is an electropolymerizable unit. The use of CV technique endows several advantages\u2014ease in control of thickness and lateral dimension of the pattern, site-directed patterning, and deposition over large surface areas onto various conducting substrates. After electropolymerization using cyclic voltammetric technique, the layer of PS particles is removed from the surface by solvent washing (2\u00d7, 30 mins) using THF, dichloromethane, or toluene.

For instance, by increasing the number of cycles and scan rate, a thicker cavity wall is formed (). This finding is seen clearly in the AFM phase image () and also observed in the line profile analysis (). Still, the pattern is present on the surface. Furthermore, with these electropolymerization conditions, the composite film starts to form on the inside cavity as observed in the topography and phase images. More compelling evidence is the result of the line profile, which shows a decrease in the peak-to-base distance (as compared to ). Similarly, the same solution of the CNT and PVK composites is electropolymerized onto bare ITO using these parameters. Again, a random deposition of the composite film is observed on the surface () with the same granular features depicted on the phase image (). Like the earlier control experiment, a random profile () is seen in the cross sectional analysis but the height has increased (\u22124 to +4 nm). Note that the size of the pattern can be changed by varying the size of the PS masks. Moreover, the cavity wall and cavity dimensions can also be modified by electrodeposition of a thicker polymer film composite.","Chronoamperometric technique (constant potential deposition alternative to CV deposition) is also exploited in the electrodeposition of the composite film. An oxidation potential of 1.5 V is used for the electropolymerization (1000 sec) of the PVK. After etching the sacrificial template layer, a patterned surface is also seen but not as defined and ordered as the CV electrodeposition ( and ). Also, the inside cavity is slightly backfilled with the composite film. The formation of the patterned surface is also evident in the AFM line profile (). With the longer deposition time at 2000 seconds, a thicker cavity wall ( and ) is formed that almost covered the inside hole (). At this condition, the PS templated-pattern almost disappeared.","Previously, we have compared the CV versus constant potential deposition of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) on conducting substrate. The film formation is monitored in-situ by combination of electrochemistry, surface Plasmon resonance spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy called EC-SPR-AFM technique. Results show that CV deposition is more reproducible and homogenous than the constant potential. Both techniques have been explained to exhibit different electrodeposition mechanisms. For constant potential, an induction period for the build-up of charge is required, which will eventually cause nucleation and gradual deposition of the film to the substrate. At the start, a slow initial stage occurs that is related to the nucleation on bare substrate involving a double layer charging effect. The next stage involves the rapid deposition of the polymer film corresponding to autocatalytic growth. In the case of CV, the formation of radical cation via oxidation process occurs simultaneously with electrodeposition of the film onto the substrate. This is probably the reason why the CV deposition demonstrated a more ordered and periodic pattern on ITO. It is also believed that the formation of patterned film via constant potential can be improved by further optimization of the parameters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0198","num":"0197"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 28","FIG. 29"],"sup":["\u22121","\u22121 ","\u22121","\u22121","\u22121","\u22121"],"sub":["2 ","2 "]},"The patterning is extended to the use of GO and PVK nanocomposite. The same above fabrication scheme () is applied but this time CV technique is only used for electrodeposition of the composite film. Likewise, a patterned surface of GO and PVK composite film is observed in the AFM topography 2D () and 3D () images with a cavity dimension similar to the size of the PS particle (500 nm). The line profile () shows the height of the wall cavity that is equivalent to \u221230 nm. Upon electropolymerization of the same solution on bare ITO, an unpatterned composite film is formed that shows the same granular features (and ). The AFM cross sectional analysis of the topography image reveals a random profile due to composite film deposition onto the substrate ().","Varying the parameters for CV deposition changes the morphology of the pattern surface. For instance, the electrodeposition of the same GO and PVK solution but with different condition (10 mV\/s, 10 cycles) disrupted the formation of a highly ordered triangular and periodic pattern. Instead, a macroporous network array of the composite film is formed ( and ). The height of the wall cavity is similar about \u221230 nm but the lateral dimension of the cavity has changed. The cavity has narrowed due to the formation of a thicker cavity wall (). As expected, the electropolymerization of the same solution on bare ITO revealed an unpatterned surface of composite film ( and ) with the same granular features in nanometer sizes. A random profile () of the composite film is depicted in the AFM cross sectional analysis.","To confirm the PVK\/GO nanocomposite films on the patterned surface UV-vis and FTIR-ATR analysis is done. The UV-vis absorbance after the electropolymerization shows a spectral difference which is due to the formation of conjugated oligocarbazole species. The band observed at 440 nm is consistent with the previous works on electropolymerized PVK CPN approach. The observed slight spectral red shift after cross-linking can be attributed to an increase in conjugation through the introduction of GO.  shows the UV-vis analysis of patterned PVK and PVK\/GO nanocomposite film.","The FTIR-ATR spectra of PVK and PVK\/GO nanocomposite film are presented in . The main peaks of pure PVK are attributed to the following vibrations at 741 (>CHrocking vibration due tail to tail addition), 1159 (out of plane deformation of vinylidene group and C\u2014H in plane deformation of aromatic ring), 1226 (C\u2014N stretching of vinyl carbazole), 1328 (>CHdeformation of vinylidene group), 1488 (ring vibration of n-vinyl carbazole), and 1561 cm(C\u2550C stretching vibration of vinylidene group). The peaks at 749, 1255, 1328, 1597 indicate the doped PVK and shift to 1335 when GO is introduced to the composites. This could be explained to the doping of the carboxyl acid of GO to the PVK backbone and pi-pi stacking of PVK and GO.","Note that the formation of the observed patterns and the resolution may vary as a function of the composition of the colloidal templating solution (dispersion of colloids and surfactants) and the electrochemical deposition parameters such as, but not limiting to the choice of the solvent, scan rate, number of cycles, concentrations of precursor polymer (or monomer), induction time, constant potential, substrate geometry, etc. Also as a matter of resolution and patterning, the templated or non-templated patterning method can be employed where the solution or the formation of such a pattern can be demonstrated using optimized solutions of the precursor and the particle (CNT or GO) in this embodiment. Other methods to achieve patterning include the use of surface probe microscopy (SPM), patterned electrodes, site-directed, site activated, and selectively addressable area patterning, or any other suitable method employing this precursor dispersion.","While the invention described here specifically relates to the design, fabrication, characterization, and use of new types of electrodeposited polymer coatings (soluble precursor conjugated polymer) that is co dispersed with a carbon nanotube (CNT) and\/or graphene (G) or graphene oxide (GO) which is then electrodeposited by cyclic voltammetry (CV) or potentiostatic method to form thin films or patterns on surfaces, one of ordinary skills in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, would recognize the extension of this approach to other types of electrodeposition process or chemical oxidative polymerization or chemical reductive polymerization processes and patterning. It should also be recognized that other forms of particles, nanoparticles, and filler materials-carbon or non-carbon where such a favorable precursor polymer solubilization and electropolymerizability is observed can be used as substitutes to achieve similar goals; those include but are not limited to carbon fibers, clay particles, metal particles, metal oxide particles, diatomaceous earth, carbon black, etc. It should also be recognized that other types of polymer precursors and combinations of polymer backbone and electropolymerizable monomers can be used as mean to prevent aggregation and\/or lamination; those include but are not limited to polyolefins, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyesters, polyamides, polyvinyl polymers, polystyrenes, polythiophenes, polypyrroles, polyphenylene, polyanilines, and others may be employed.

Electropolymerizable monomers such as include but are not limited to pyrrole, aniline, thiophene, oligomeric thiophenes, fluorenes, carbazole, oligomeric phenylenes, polyacenes, and others may be employed. It should be possible to further modify the electro-optical and thermo-mechanical properties by copolymers of the backbone or copolymerization with an electropolymerizable monomer.","The present invention is particularly well suited for the design, synthesis, characterization, fabrication and use of new conducting films, pressure-sensitive sensors, anti-static films, electrically conducting electrodes, transparent conducting electrodes, chemical sensors, pressure sensors, piezolelectric sensors, transducers, bio-sensors, thermo-resistive heating elements, anti-corrosion coatings, biocidal coatings, anti-microbial coatings, superhydrophobic coatings, superhydrophilic coatings, stimuli-responsive coatings, fluorescent coatings, self-cleaning coatings, membranes, electrochromic films, electro-wetting coatings or patterns, stimuli-responsive membranes, selective solvent separation, filtration, ink jet printing, on-demand delivery, selective wetting, and other applications involving the thermo-mechanical, optical, chemical, electro-optical, wetting, adhesion, and electrically conducting properties of these materials and their film\/coating and pattern formation.","The present invention is well adapted to attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those that are inherent therein. The particular embodiments disclosed above are illustrative only, as the present invention may be modified and practiced in different but equivalent manners apparent to those skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings herein. Furthermore, no limitations are intended to the details of construction or design herein shown, other than as described in the claims below.

The CNTs used for these nanocomposites could either be single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs), the latter being more commercially relevant. However, effective utilization of the excellent properties of CNT-based composites depends on the quality of their dispersion and the level of polymer\/CNT interfacial contact through covalent or non-covalent interactions. The use of \u03c0-conjugated polymers provides a tailored structure to interact with CNTs by means of \u03c0-\u03c0 electronic interactions, which promotes better dispersion of CNTs. It was also suggested that the enhanced solvating power of \u03c0-electron rich polymers for CNTs can be ascribed to the donor-acceptor mechanism, which results to the intimate contact of the polymer to the walls of the CNTs. The additive effects of these interactions lead to the wrapping of the polymer backbone around the sidewalls of the CNTs that causes its dispersion.","The formation of a homogeneous film of polymer\/CNT nanocomposite has remained a great challenge because of the tendency of the CNTs to remain agglomerated. As the processing of CNT is generally hindered by their insolubility in most common organic solvents, only low weight\/weight (w\/w) or weight\/volume (w\/v) concentrations are usually obtained. For optimum transparent film preparation by casting, it is necessary to obtain a homogeneous dispersion of CNT in an organic solvent. One approach that has been commonly employed is the direct grafting of small molecules or polymers on the surface of the CNT, e.g. surface-initiated polymerization (SIP), but with a resulting disruption of the primary structure of the nanotubes. Another involves solution mixing methods of a dispersant polymer and CNT. This method is a convenient and facile route and is highly desirable because the surface of the CNT is preserved during the process (i.e. the dispersant is only non-covalently adsorbed on the CNT).","The facile preparation of poly (N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) solution and conjugated polymer network (CPN) nanocomposite film is described. The stable solutions of PVK\/MWNT were prepared in mixed solvents by simple sonication method, which enabled successful deaggregation of the MWNTs with the polymer matrix. MWNT was most effectively dissolved in N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP) compared to other solvents like N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl formamide, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The solution was relatively stable for months with no observable precipitation of the MWNTs. Thermogravimmetric analysis (TGA) revealed the thermal stability of the nanocomposite while the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed an increasing melting (T) and glass transition (T) temperatures as the fraction of the MWNTs in the nanocomposite was increased. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) allowed the electrodeposition of the nanocomposite film on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates and subsequent cross-linking of the carbazole pendant group of the PVK to form CPN films. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), fluorescence, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) confirmed film composition while atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed its surface morphology. Four-point probe measurements revealed an increase in the electrical conductivity of the CPN nanocomposite film as the composition of the MWNTs was increased: 5.53\u00d710(3% MWNTs), 0.53 (5%), and 1.79 S cm(7%). Finally, the interfacial charge transfer resistance and ion transport on the CPN nanocomposite film was analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with a measured real impedance value of \u02dc48.10\u03a9 for the 97% PVK and 3% MWNT ratio of the CPN nanocomposite film.","The combination of the unique properties of CNT and organic polymers like poly(N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK) makes it an interesting composite material for the development of practical semi-conductor devices. PVK is well-known for its high chemical and thermal stability, photoconductivity, and opto-electronic properties, e.g. hole transporting properties. It has been established that CNT could exhibit an amphoteric behavior by exchanging electrons with electron acceptors or electron donors to form the corresponding positive or negatively charged counterions. Thus, the incorporation of CNT into the PVK matrix may be one of the interesting ways to extend the electro-optical properties of PVK and vice versa. Several studies have reported the preparation and characterization of different types of PVK\/CNTs nanocomposites through chemical and electrochemical methods.","The use of PVK to form the polymer\/CNT nanocomposite could not only contribute to the unique properties of the composite but could also serve as a precursor polymer to electrodeposit a homogeneous film of nanocomposite on conducting surfaces. We have reported a series of methods for depositing high optical quality ultrathin films of \u03c0-conjugated polymer network (CPN) system on a flat conducting substrate through the precursor polymer approach, including electro-nanopatterning. Combining this approach with the CNT nanocomposite film preparation would be of advantage since PVK can serve as both CNT dispersant and surface immobilizer at the same time.","Referring now the , a schematic representation describing CNT dispersion and CPN nanocomposite film formation is shown as Scheme 1.","Here, we report the preparation of PVK\/MWNT nanocomposites by sonication-dispersion of the MWNTs with PVK in a mixed solvent, spin-coating, and subsequent electrodeposition on surface by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Scheme 1). The latter procedure leads to the formation of a CPN nanocomposite film. The method for accomplishing this depends on an optimized dispersion of PVK and MWNT in a highly miscible solvent for both. This procedure involved a slow and continuous addition of dissolved PVK in a MWNT solution with the expectation that the PVK polymer chains would wrap around the MWNTs. These dispersions were then used to form spin-casted films that are electro-immobilized by CV to form cross-linked CPN nanocomposite films. The spectral properties of the PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite were examined by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, while thermal properties were analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The formation of the PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite film was investigated by CV, UV-vis spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), ATR spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Four-point probe test was also used to probe conductivity behavior of the prepared films.","Materials","The MWNTs (purity\u226795%) used in this study were obtained commercially from Baytubes (C150 P). The prepared MWNTs from Baytubes were produced in a high-yield catalytic process based on chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The outer and inner diameter, length, and density of the MWNTs were 13 nm, 4 nm, 1 \u03bcm and 130-150 kg\/mrespectively. The obtained MWNTs were further purified by heating at 200\u00b0 C. for 6 hours prior to use. Poly (N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals (USA) (ca MW=50,000 g\/mol). All solvents were of analytical grade and used without further purification and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals or VWR: N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dichloromethane (DCM), dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass plate (1 inch\u00d70.5 inch) was used as the substrate for PVK\/MWNT nanocomposites and CPN film fabrication. The ITO-coated glass plates were cleaned by sequentially sonicating the plates in deionized water, isopropanol, hexane and toluene, each for 15 min and the substrates were dried in an oven. The ITO-glass substrates were plasma cleaned for 3 minutes prior to their use.","Synthesis of PVK\/MWNTs Nanocomposites","The PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites were prepared using a solution mixing process. In a typical dissolution experiment, separate solutions of PVK in DCM and MWNTs in CHP with weight\/volume (mg\/mL) (w\/v) concentration were first prepared. The purified MWNTs (5 mg\/mL) was dissolved in CHP and ultrasonically agitated for 4 hours. The PVK was dissolved in DCM using a sonication process for 30 minutes to disperse the PVK in the solvent. An appropriate amount of the PVK solution was slowly mixed to the MWNTs solution, which was followed by 1 hour sonication. The PVK\/MWNT dispersion was subjected to a high-speed centrifugation (4400 rpm, 1 hour) and the black precipitate (mostly aggregates of MWNTs) obtained after centrifugation was removed. Methanol (5 mL) was then added to the remaining solution of the PVK\/MWNTs dispersion. The mixture was then again placed in a high-speed centrifugation (4400 rpm, 30 minutes) and another batch of black precipitate was obtained. From the initial mass of PVK and MWNT used and the small amount of MWNTs that were removed after sonication\/centrifugation, the final mass ratio of PVK to MWNT is 1:1. The above PVK\/MWNTs precipitate was redispersed in CHP (mg\/mL) followed by 20 minutes of ultrasonication which produced a very stable PVK\/MWNT solution.","PVK\/MWNTs Nanocomposites Film Fabrication","The PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite solution was spin-coated on ITO substrate prior to its electrodeposition on the substrate. The spin-coating speed was decided depending on the viscosity of the prepared solutions. In a typical run, a thin PVK\/MWNT film was spin-coated onto the ITO surface at a rate of 500 rms for 60 seconds and 1500 rms for 30 seconds consecutively to deposit a film on the ITO substrate surface. After spin-coating deposition, the PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite films were thoroughly dried in vacuum oven for 24 hours at 70\u00b0 C. to remove any solvent.","After the deposition of the PVK\/MWNT film through spin-coating, the film was electrochemically crosslinked using CV. CV experiments were carried out on a Princeton Applied Research Parstat 2263 using a three-electrode set-up from a solution of 0.1 M LiClOdissolved in acetonitrile (ACN). The coated ITO glass substrate was used as the working electrode (WE), Pt wire as the counter electrode (CE), and Ag\/AgCl as the reference electrode (RE). Electrochemical cross-linking of PVK and MWNTs nanocomposite film was accomplished by repeatedly cycling an electrode potential between the potential range of 0 to 1.4 V for up to 50 cycles at a potential scan rate of 50 mV\/s. The highly crosslinked nanocomposite film was thoroughly washed with ACN and was dried in nitrogen before its analysis.","Characterization of PVK\/MWNT Nanocomposites and Films","All UV-vis spectra of the PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite films and solutions were recorded using an Agilent 8453 spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer LS-45 luminescence spectrometer. Thermal stability measurements of the prepared PVK\/MWNT nanocomposites were performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The samples were heated from 20 to 900\u00b0 C. at a heating rate of 20\u00b0 C.\/min on a TA Instruments 2950 thermogravimetric analyzer. All experiments were operated under a Natmosphere at a purge rate of 80-90 mL\/min. DSC measurements were carried out on all samples from 20 to 600\u00b0 C. at a heating rate of 20\u00b0 C.\/min. TGA and DSC data were analyzed using TA Instruments' Universal Analysis software.","Attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectra were obtained using an FTS 7000 Digilab Spectrometer within the 700-4000 cmrange in multiple ATR geometry at the surface of the waveguide prism equipped with a liquid N-cooled MCT detector. The morphology before and after the electrodeposition of the PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite on ITO substrates were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM imaging was done under ambient conditions with a Pico SPM II (PicoPlus, Molecular Imaging\u2014Agilent Technologies) using an intermittent contact mode. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was also used to determine the surface morphologies of the PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite films. The micrograph images were observed by performing SEM investigation on a LEO 550 scanning electron microanalyzer. Silver sputtering of PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite films were done using a silver coater to enhance the conductivity of the sample. Afterwards, it was placed on copper stubs with carbon tape. The microscope chamber was maintained at a pressure below 10Torr. The SEM filament was set at a voltage of 10 kV and a current of 5 nA using 200K\u00d7 magnifications. The water contact angle of the films was measured using a KSV CAM 200 instrument utilizing a bubble drop method with water.","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Princeton Applied Research Parstat 2263) was used to investigate the ion-transport and dielectric\/impedance properties of the PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite and crosslinked PVK\/MWNTs CPN films. EIS measurements were performed under an open circuit potential in an AC frequency range from 100,000 to 0.01 Hz with an excitation signal of 5 mV. All electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature. The DC conductivity of the PVK polymer alone and PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite films were measured by an Alessi four-point probe method at room temperature (Keithley 2400). For the four-point probe test, a fixed current is injected into the substrate through the two outer probes and a voltage is measured between the two inner probes. The measured resistances were converted into conductivity by multiplying the constant 4.532. The product is the sheet resistance in\/square of the film being measured. The calculated sheet resistance was multiplied by the film thickness to get the conductivity of the prepared film. The data were represented by mean measurement values from at least 10 trials for every sample.","Solution Characterization and Mixing Optimization","CNTs have unique structural, mechanical, thermal and electronic properties, and have extensive applications in many fields. However, the manipulation and processing of CNTs have been limited by their insolubility in most common organic solvents and their tendency to aggregate. UV-vis spectroscopy was first employed to gain insight on the developed solution-mixing and sonication method to disperse the MWNTs as visual-optical inspection of dispersions only indicates the presence or absence of particles that are larger than 10 The UV-vis spectra were obtained under identical conditions and were diluted by the same factor so that qualitative comparisons between the different solvents could be made. The UV-vis absorbance of MWNT solutions using different solvents is presented in . All the solutions had the same starting concentration of MWNTs and the observed increase in absorbance indicates an increase in concentration of the unbundled MWNTs remaining in the solution after the sonication\/centrifugation process. Different organic solvents (CHP, NMP, DMF and DMSO) demonstrated stable dispersions of MWNTs. From the UV-vis spectra (), however, it can be observed that CHP exhibited the highest absorbance as compared to NMP, DMF, and DMSO, signifying that CHP would be the best suitable solvent for the dispersion of MWNTs. The AFM image of the spin-casted solution of MWNT\/CHP on mica depicts the de-aggregation of the individual MWNT as shown in , while  shows the same process for MWNT in CHP before and after sonication for comparison.","The sonication process has been proven to be necessary in dispersing MWNTs in a solvent. However, excessive sonication has been reported to damage and cut the MWNTs. To monitor the dispersion as a function of sonication time used in this work, UV-vis spectroscopy was also carried out as a function of time. With the increasing sonication time up to 4 hours, the intensity of the whole spectral region increased and the dispersion of MWNTs became better (data not shown). Increasing the sonication time to 5 hours, showed no significant difference in the absorbance as compared to 4 hour sonication, which indicates that the concentration of the unbundled MWNTs in the solution approaches the solubility limit at this period. The SEM () and AFM analysis of the dispersed CNTs () showed disentangled and long CNTs indicative that after sonication cutting was not observed in MWNTs (also ). Upon monitoring the absorbance of the sonicated MWNT in CHP for 4 h, it was observed that the dispersion was stable only up to 10 days (see ) where the absorbance decreased after 11 days due to aggregation.","It has been identified that one of the most promising approach to effectively disperse CNTs is through its functionalization with polymers that could prevent its agglomeration. However, this approach requires several tedious synthetic steps. The dispersion of MWNTs in PVK solution is an attempt to increase the solubility of MWNTs without going through the surface functionalization route but to induce adsorption through the wrapping of the PVK chains on the MWNTs. The polymer as a dispersant is usually more effective for MWNTs in organic solvents compared to small molecules or monomers. In this case, the carbazole units are expected to have better \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking properties on the benzenoid rings of the MWNTs surface and should have greater compatibility in terms of electro-optical properties. Thus, the dispersion containing well-dispersed and exfoliated MWNTs should lead to the preparation of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites through a strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction. One critical element is the formation of a homogeneous PVK\/MWNT solution. The UV-vis of the PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite in different organic solvents (CHP, DMSO, DMF, and NMP) are presented in , showing distinct peaks between 320 and 350 nm assigned to the \u03c0-\u03c0* and n-\u03c0* band of the carbazole moieties in PVK, which were not found in the MWNT solutions alone (). From the previously described, CHP is the most effective solvent for the MWNTs. CHP is also miscible with DCM, which is a good solvent for PVK. By first preparing separate solutions of the MWNTs in CHP and PVK in DCM, relatively high concentrations of each component can be made. The solution composed of MWNTs, PVK, and the two miscible solvents was also aided by sonication, which plays a significant role in improving the interaction between the MWNTs and PVK. The homogeneity of the solution was proven by the clear and stable solution in mixed solvents (see ). A possible explanation for the stable dispersion of MWNTs in the mixed solvent of CHP\/DCM is that the PVK polymer chains are adsorbed to the MWNTs sidewalls due to strong \u03c0-\u03c0 electronic interactions between the aromatic pendants and the MWNTs surfaces. Another reason is the donor-acceptor interaction between the PVK (donor) and the MWNTs (acceptor). These interactions keep the MWNTs from its aggregation. Furthermore, the affinity of the polymer chains with the solvent leads to a more dispersed MWNTs in the organic solvents as presented in . The solution was stable for months without MWNTs precipitating out, which indicates effective solubilization of MWNTs by using PVK as the dispersant. The absorbance of PVK\/MWNTs solution as a function of days was found to be stable even after 90 days of incubation of the prepared solution. The PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites also showed a good dispersion with other organic solvents (see ).","The dispersion of PVK\/MWNTs in mixed solvent system was affected not only by sonication time but also by the percentage weight of the final PVK\/MWNTs solutions. The different percentages of MWNTs in PVK (3, 5, and 7%) were investigated in terms of dispersion and adherence on ITO glass substrate using the spin-coating technique as discussed in the next sections.","Analysis of the PVK\/MWNT Nanocomposites in Solid-State or as Bulk Material","To confirm the formation (mixing) and the macromolecular interactions of the PVK\/MWNTs solutions, TGA and DSC analyses of pure MWNTs, pure PVK, and different ratios of the PVK\/MWNTs were conducted. The TGA thermograms of the pure MWNTs, pure PVK and different ratios of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites were recorded under Natmosphere scanned in the range of 20-900\u00b0 C. (). The TGA thermogram of pure PVK exhibited 2 degradation steps. The 1st degradation step takes place at 260\u00b0 C. and then the polymer showed a fast 2\u2032 degradation step reaching a 98% weight loss at 408\u00b0 C. and almost total degradation at 455\u00b0 C. It is evident in the graph that the pure MWNTs exhibited a higher stability showing only a 2% weight loss even after heating the composite to 500\u00b0 C. For the 3 different compositions of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites, the temperature of the distinct weight loss is lower compared to the pure PVK. The 7% MWNTs in PVK showed a lower % weight loss at 490\u00b0 C. as compared to the two other ratios (5% and 3% MWNTs in PVK), which is attributed to the presence of more thermally stable MWNTs. It should be noted that the decrease in the % MWNTs leads to more weight loss due to the higher composition of more degradable PVK at this temperature range. The first derivative TGA (dTGA) curves of various samples are also shown in . The dTGA curves were added to identify the point where significant weight loss is most apparent. From the dTGA curves, it can be seen that there is a shift to higher degradation temperature for the PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites as compared to the pure PVK. Polymer chains near the nanotubes may degrade more slowly, which helps to shift the decomposition temperature to higher values. Another possible reason is the increased thermal stability of the polymer composite due to the higher thermal conductivity of MWNTs that facilitates heat dissipation within the composite. An improvement of the thermal stability can be associated with a better dispersion of MWNTs, since it hinders the flux of decomposition product and thus delay the decomposition. It is important to point out that the difference in extent of interaction between pure PVK and PVK\/MWNT nanocomposites could be responsible for the higher thermal stability of the composites, i.e. the addition of MWNTs in PVK improves thermal stability to degradation as compared to PVK alone.","To understand the difference in behavior of the nanocomposites as compared to pure PVK with respect to temperature, DSC analysis was also performed.  shows the DSC traces of pure MWNTs, pure PVK and PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites. For pure PVK, the glass transition temperature (T) was observed at around 190\u00b0 C. while the melting temperature (T) is found at 420\u00b0 C. The introduction of MWNTs into the PVK polymer matrix leads to an increase in the Tand T, which could be due to high interfacial area of interaction between MWNTs and PVK that may lead to the decrease in the mobility of the outer polymer chain segments due to steric hindrance. This observation also presents further evidence of the wrapping around of the PVK chains to the MWNTs.","CV electrodeposition, cross-linking and characterization of the prepared PVK (control) and PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposite films were done in 0.1 M LiClOin ACN with potential scans between 0-1.2 V. The prepared solutions were spin-casted on the ITO-glass and Au substrate to directly measure the thickness of the film. Note that the spin-coated films are insoluble to ACN. The electrochemical crosslinking of the carbazole moieties was executed by employing CV. The reaction proceeded via a radical cation mechanism, typical of carbazolic moieties.  shows the cyclic voltammograms of pure PVK and PVK\/MWNTs films scanned at different scan rates. For pure PVK (), an oxidation peak at about 0.9-1.0 V and a reduction peak at 0.7 V were observed in the voltammogram, which suggest the formation of the of carbazolylium radical cation, and a cross-linked material having more \u03c0-conjugated species compared to the PVK precursor. This result essentially represents the formation of a CPN control film. The scan rate dependence studies for PVK\/MWNTs with different weight % at scan rates 50-200 mV\/s is shown in . The current of the oxidation\/reduction peaks were dependent on scan rates in the range of 50-200 mV\/s. The electron transfer rate depends on the electron transfer resistance across the electrode\/conductive polymer\/electrolyte layer model. The shapes of the voltammogram were clearly different when the MWNTs were present together with the electrochemically cross-linked PVK. A downshift in the reduction peak was observed for PVK\/MWNTs which could be due to the doping behavior of the negatively charged MWNTs. No prominent anodic peak was observed regardless of the number of cycles employed as deposited in ITO glass substrate. The electrochemical cross-linking of PVK and MWNTs carried out at different scan rates shows a good correlation with the cathodic peak current and voltage scan rate indicating that the electron transfer is diffusion controlled. The electron transfer rate depends on the electron transfer resistance across the electrode\/conductive polymer\/electrolyte layer model. The PVK\/MWNT CPN film exhibited a good linear relationship I and v. The slope of the plot is relative to the number of electrons in unit volume (n, cm), diffusion coefficient (D, m\/s), and the concentration of electrolyte ions (C, mol\/cm), as indicated in Cottrell equation:\n\n()=NFAD\/\u03c0\n\nThe observed correlation is in agreement with the EIS analysis as will be discussed further.  also shows that with increasing number of cycles, a gradual shift in peak potentials for the reduction peaks is indicative of the doping role of MWNTs, which would assume a negative charge. Such a downshift in the cathodic peak could be due to the doping role of MWNTs, which are known to be amphoteric in character (can be doped with either electron donor or acceptor). Taking into account this observation in the CPN nanocomposite films, in which the PVK act as electron donor and MWNTs acts as the electron acceptor.\n\nElectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy of the PVK\/MWNTs and CPN Nanocomposite Films\n","EIS is a well-established and powerful tool for investigating interfacial charge-transfer in films. It is also useful for investigating ion-transport phenomena. The charge-transfer in nanocomposites can occur at both the interface between the PVK and MWNTs and the PVK and the electrodes used. To evaluate variations in interfacial properties of PVK\/MWNTs, the qualitative differences in impedance spectra according to the different ratios of the MWNTs in PVK polymer matrix was considered. The equivalent circuit model for the working electrode employed and the physical significance of the components are presented in  (inset graph). The equivalent circuit for this state is based on the modified Randles circuit, wherein the sum of the electrolyte resistance and polymer electronic resistance, Celectrolyte interface, R, the charge-transfer resistance and Za complex circuit element is included. In this case, Ris attributed primarily to charge transfer resistance. A 45\u00b0 slope in the Nyquist plot as the percentage of MWNTs in the composite increases the signal in the presence of a Warburg element (Z), which represents diffusion mass transport. At low frequencies it is possible to estimate the faradaic pseudocapacitance (redox) which is associated with the capacitive behavior of a film. The physical origin of Cmeans that its magnitude increases with the quantity of electroactive material deposited in the substrate. As presented in , in spite of the similar shape of the impedance spectra, an obvious difference in the diameters of the semicircles which corresponds to the electron transfer-limited process measured at higher frequencies, the Rof PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites decreases as the loading of the MWNTs increased. The spectra proved that the formation of the charge-transfer complex of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposite occurs and that charge-transfer flows through the film. The complex plane impedance plots produced from the analysis of PVK\/MWNTs CPN nanocomposite films are also presented in . The intercepts of the pure PVK and CPN nanocomposites film with the real impedance 55.78 and for 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs is 48.10. This result shows that the CPN nanocomposite film is 7.68 less resistive than pure PVK. While this result is in agreement with a conductive contribution from the addition of MWNTs, this decrease in resistance could also be due to the formation of a-conjugated CPN between the nanotubes and PVK polymer chains.","Spectroscopic Analysis","UV-visible spectra were used to characterize the interfacial interaction between the PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite films and after the CPN nanocomposite film formation. As expected, no absorption peaks at the visible region of the electro-magnetic spectrum were observed for pure MWNTs, similar to the observation in solution. For the spin-casted nanocomposite film (), the main absorption bands occur at 331 and 345 nm, indicative of the \u03c0-\u03c0* and n-\u03c0* attributed to optical transitions in pendant carbazole moieties of PVK. It can be seen from the spectra that the main absorption peaks for pure PVK is still prominent for the PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposite. There is also a slight red shift of \u02dc5 nm in wavelength when MWNTs is incorporated in PVK (). This shifting maybe attributed to the lowering of energy due to the electronic interaction between the PVK and MWNTs. The UV-vis absorbance after electrochemical crosslinking showed a different spectra due to the formation of \u03c0-conjugated oligocarbazole species (). The defined peaks for spin-coated PVK\/MWNT film before cross-linking at 331 and 345 nm disappeared and a new band was formed at 440 and 760 nm, which corresponds to the polaronic and bipolaronic carbazole species. The observation is consistent with previous works on electropolymerized PVK with the CPN approach. The observed spectral red shift for the PVK\/MWNTs CPN nanocomposite film after cross-linking can be attributed to an increase in \u03c0-conjugation and aided by the presence of MWNTs (serving as electron acceptor). Clearly further studies by spectro-electrochemistry will also be useful.","The fluorescence spectra of the films were also obtained using an excitation wavelength of 300 nm (see ). From all the prepared films, the peak for PVK is clearly evident even in the nanocomposite films. It is known that PVK fluorescence spectra are broad and structureless, which is the case observed from the spectra. The broad peak observed is a combination of the two emissions from the radioactive decay of two spectrally distinct excimers. The wavelength emission at 375 nm corresponds to the partially eclipsed configuration of the PVK (i.e. only one carbazole moiety is aligned with the polymer backbone or between adjacent chains). On the other hand, the peak at 420 nm is attributed to the totally eclipsed conformation of the carbazole pendants (i.e. carbazole groups are aligned face-to-face in adjacent positions along the polymer backbone).","ATR-IR Spectroscopy","IR spectroscopy is an important tool for confirming the presence of the components in the nanocomposite film. The ATR spectra of pure MWNTs, pure PVK and 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs CPN films spin-coated in ITO glass substrate are shown in . The presence of interactions in the nanocomposite would shift the frequency of C\u2014H stretching vibration of the polymer. For pure MWNTs, the peak at 1630 cmis due to the C\u2550C stretch mode in the MWNTs. The main absorption peaks of pure PVK structure are shown at the following characteristic bands at around 700-800 cm(out-of-plane \u2014C\u2014H aromatic), 1100-1150 cm(in-plane \u2014C\u2014H aromatic), around 1600 cm(C\u2550C stretching), 2900 cm(aliphatic C\u2014H stretching), and 3050 cm(aromatic C\u2014H stretching). The peaks of pure PVK are attributed to the following vibrations: at 720 cm(ring deformation of substituted aromatic structure), 744 cm(\u2014CHrocking vibration due to tail-to-tail addition), 1159 cm(out-of-plane deformation of vinylidene group and C\u2014H in plane deformation of aromatic ring), 1220 cm(C\u2014N stretching of vinyl carbazole), 1326 cm(>CHdeformation of vinylidene group), 1459 cm(ring vibration of n-vinyl carbazole), and 1626 cm(C\u2550C stretching vibration of vinylidene group).","However, for the 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs electropolymerized CPN film material, the peaks significantly changed at 744 and 1459 cm. The addition of MWNTs in the PVK solution resulted to anew absorption band from 744 to 749 cm, 1459 to 1449 cm, and 1626 to 1620 cm. The FTIR spectra of pure PVK and PVK\/MWNTs CPN film show similar bands with a little variation in the stretching frequencies. The shift in the peak region between 700-1600 cmis related to the change in the structure of the polymer upon the addition of the MWNTs.","Electrical Conductivity","One of the important methods to compare the state of nanotube dispersion at a given concentration is through electrical conductivity measurements on films. The conductivity of pure PVK, and PVK\/MWNTs CPN nanocomposite films at various compositions were measured using the four point probe conductivity test. For the four-point probe test, a fixed current is injected into the substrate through the two outer probes and a voltage is measured between the two inner probes. The measured resistances were converted into conductivity by multiplying the constant 4.532. The product is the sheet resistance in\/square of the film being measured. The calculated sheet resistance was multiplied by the film thickness to get the conductivity of the prepared film. The measured conductivity is summarized in Table 2. A key issue in producing superior PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites is the ability to control deagglomeration and dispersion of MWNTs in PVK matrices which are directly correlated with the achievable conductivity. The conductivity of PVK was about 10to 10S\/cm, whereas with increasing MWNTs level, the conductivity increases. Dispersing the conducting filler, MWNTs in the polymer matrix forms a conductive polymer nanocomposite. The prepared CPN nanocomposite films of compositions 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs, 95% PVK\/5% MWNTs, and 93% PVK\/7% MWNTs show conductivity values of 5.53\u00d710, 0.53, and 1.79 S\/cm which clearly shows a remarkable increase in conductivity. This increase in conductivity could be due to the formation of an interconnected network of MWNTs with the PVK matrix which then permits a very high percentage of electrons to flow through a conductive path in the PVK\/MWNT composite film. However, by increasing the concentration of MWNTs in PVK solution to 9% by weight, the MWNTs started to agglomerate (data not shown). Insulating polymers are transformed to conductive composites by addition of MWNTs above a critical concentration or percolation threshold. When the positions of MWNTs in the polymer matrix form a conducting film, the conductivity of nanocomposites greatly increased, this may be due to the formation of a percolating network. Percolation means that at least one pathway of connected MWNTs exists in the sample which in case of conductive fillers allows the charge to flow through the sample. In conductive fillers like MWNTs, electrical measurements are suitable to detect the percolation composition. In this study, the percolation threshold was determined to be in the range of 3% to 5% MWNTs. In this range the conductivity shows a high increase and the composites with MWNTs content higher than 5% weight can be regarded as electrically conductive. These values indicated that in the presence of 5% MWNTs in the PVK matrix is enough to form a network of conductive path. Above the percolation threshold concentration, 3% MWNTs independent fillers tend to link together to form conductive networks which led to a significant increase in the conductivity of the prepared CPN nanocomposite films. The role of the CPN of the PVK is clear in comparison to the PVK alone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0234","num":"0233"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"The DC Conductivity of Pure PVK and Various PVK\/MWNTs"},{"entry":"CPN Nanocomposite Film Compositions as Measured"},{"entry":"by the Four-point Probe Technique"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Sample","Measured Conductivity (S\/cm)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"(1) Pure PVK","\u2003\u20021 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":[{},"(2) 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs","5.53 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":[{},"(3) 95% PVK\/5% MWNTs","0.53"]},{"entry":[{},"(4) 93% PVK\/7% MWNTs","1.79"]},{"entry":[{},"(5) 91% PVK\/9% MWNTs","1.64"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"*Note:"]},{"entry":[{},"Mean conductivity at 10 measurements per sample."]}]}}]}}},"The conductivity study of the nanocomposites shows that better dispersion of MWNTs in the polymer matrix greatly enhanced the conductivity. The absence of MWNTs sidewall damage and improved percolation in PVK\/MWNTs CPN nanocomposite films led to an improvement in its electrical conductivity. Hence, this study suggests an effective way to improve dispersion of MWNTs into PVK matrices and also retain the electronic structure of MWNTs that could be used in various functional materials and coatings. In principle, utilizing single walled nanotubes (SWNT) should even show a more remarkable change in conductivity and electro-optical properties assuming the same dispersion qualities.","AFM Imaging","AFM is a very useful tool for investigating the morphology of the modified surfaces because it provides spatial resolution, film topology, and nanostructure formation. The surface topography of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites in terms of roughness values of the interfaces can also be analyzed by AFM.  shows the topographies of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposite films deposited using spin casting in ITO glass substrate before and after electrochemical crosslinking. The 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs nanocomposite film () showed elongated globular clusters that can be attributed to the presence of MWNTs (3% with respect to the composition of PVK) with rms value of 3.11 nm. This result suggests a homogeneous wrapping of MWNT within the PVK polymer matrix is achieved, especially at the 97% PVK\/3% MWNTs composition since no domains of MWNT were observed. The measured water contact angle was found to be 53.30\u00b0\u00b10.6 in water. The PVK\/MWNTs CPN nanocomposite film () showed rms value of 4.86 nm, which is also correlated to the decrease in the surface energy of the film as revealed in the measured WCA of 89.13\u00b0\u00b10.4. The increase in the measured WCA indicates that a more hydrophobic PVK\/MWNTs CPN nanocomposite films was formed in the substrate.","Referring now to , a surface sensitive analytical technique, XPS, was used to investigate the elemental composition of the pure PVK and PVK\/CNTs CPN nanocomposite film on Au substrate.  show XPS spectra of the N1s and C1s of Pure PVK.  shows an XPS spectrum of the C1s for pure CNTs.  show XPS spectra of the C1s and N1s of a composite including 97% PVK and 3% CNTs.  show XPS spectra of the N1s and C1s of a composite including 93% PVK and 7% CNTs.

Both FT-IR ATR and XPS data confirmed the spectral data and distribution in the binding energy associated with the cross-linking of the carbazole units.","Referring now to , a show a nanotube wrapped with a PVK polymer in a film of this invention. The film is supported on a substrate. The film is then crosslinked through the electropolymerizable, reductively polymerizable moieties, and\/or oxidative polymerizable moieties in the PVK polymers to form a crosslinked film, where the ovals are the polymerizable groups shown crosslinked by an equivalent molecular framework.","PVK\/MWNT nanocomposites were successfully prepared via solvent mixing process. The said process disrupted the van der Waals interactions between bundled MWNTs upon addition of the PVK dispersant, leading to a better dispersion of MWNTs in a PVK polymer matrix. The electrochemical cross-linking of PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites showed the doping role in the charge-transfer interaction of MWNTs in PVK\/MWNT nanocomposite preparation via CPN film formation. The EIS spectra for the PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites fitted to a modified Randles circuit showed that the charge-transfer resistance decreases as the loading of MWNTs in PVK\/MWNTs nanocomposites increases. ATR demonstrated the interaction between the PVK and MWNTs chains via shifts in the vibronic spectra. The prepared nanocomposites also exhibited better thermal stability as revealed by the TGA and DSC data. The incorporation of a small weight percentage of MWNTs in the PVK polymer matrix relatively increased the DC conductivity for all the composite systems. Electrical conductivity in the composites showed a 3% weight of MWNT minimum percolation threshold for the nanotubes\u2014which indicates a good dispersion of MWNTs within PVK polymer matrix. The surface topography exhibited an improved uniformity for the nanocomposite films.","Organic-inorganic \u201chybrid\u201d materials as thin film coatings are of great interest for various fields of applications. For electronic materials, thin films often produced higher efficiency of the diffusion of excitons. Likewise, for optical devices the control in film thickness affects the interference and absorption of light. In sensing applications, functionalized thin film coatings create a site of recognition with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. Hence, the facile and large-scale fabrication of robust thin films is highly desirable.","Recently, the use of carbon materials such as graphene for thin films has produced hybrid materials for a wide range of applications due to its multi-functionality and versatility. This 2-dimensional single-atom-thick nanomaterial of hexagonally arrayed sp-bonded carbon atoms exhibits high aspect ratio, outstanding electrical conductivity, mechanical stability, and cost efficiency. With such unique properties and the spectrum of possible applications, graphene has been recognized as one of the most promising nanomaterial. However, just as with the newly discovered allotropes of carbon, the availability and processability have been the rate-determining factors in the evaluation of graphene applications.","A major challenge in working with graphene involves achieving homogeneous dispersions for large-scale coating fabrication. For example, in the creation of graphene-organic composites, thin graphitic layers require exfoliated graphite sheets. The non-dispersibility of graphite in aqueous medium and in organic solvents leads to the difficulty of working with graphite. The most common and effective approach is based on the use of graphene oxide (GO) as a precursor. Compared to its pristine counterpart, GO contains oxygen functional groups (i.e. epoxides, \u2014OH, and \u2014COOH group), which make it hydrophilic and disperse well in aqueous solutions. However, aqueous dispersion of graphene is of limited interest because in most of its proposed applications (electronics, sensors, composites), organic solvents are normally required in the processing and manufacturing of such materials. Therefore, it is highly desirable to find an easy and stable approach of exfoliating graphene in various organic solvents.","Polymers are often combined with graphene, as polymer nanocomposites for improved dispersion and solubility in organic solvents. Specifically, pi-electron rich polymers as matrix were used because of its ability to form pi-stacking with the graphene sheets. Zhang and co-workers observed the increased solubility of GO in toluene upon covalent modification with poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK). Alternatively, the noncovalent incorporation of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) on modified GO also resulted in greater dispersion in chloroform. Although both the covalent and noncovalent strategies showed better graphene exfoliation, none of the dispersion investigations reported to date have focused on the fabrication of robust polymer nanocomposite immobilized onto solid supports (i.e. as thin film coating).","The electrodeposition of polymer nanocomposite thin films of PVK-GO on conducting ITO substrate are demonstrated. Prior to thin film formation, highly exfoliated and stable graphene oxide (GO) solutions were first prepared by incorporating poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) using solution mixing process. The resulting PVK-GO dispersions showed enhanced stability for up to 30 days in both aqueous and organic solvents as compared to the exfoliated GO without PVK. The successful dispersion of GO in the PVK matrix was characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and UV-vis measurements. Film fabrication of the PVK-GO nanocomposite was presented using electrochemical methods. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) ascribed to the electrodeposition of the carbazole moieties of PVK were acquired to monitor the deposition. The presence of GO on the PVK-GO surface was confirmed with the appearance of the C\u2550O (1700 cm) and OH (3400 cm) stretches, attributed to the carboxylic and hydroxyl functional groups, respectively of GO. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of the fabricated PVK-GO film showed homogeneous and well-defined film morphology.","The electrodeposition of PVK-GO nanocomposite thin film on conducting substrate is first demonstrated. Solutions of highly dispersed PVK-GO in both aqueous and non-aqueous solvent systems are first prepared via noncovalent incorporation of preformed PVK and GO using solution mixing process according to Scheme III.Scheme 1 as shown in .","Herein, we present a simple and facile route of preparing well-dispersed polymer-GO nanocomposites (PVK-GO) in both aqueous and organic solvents by solution mixing process for coating application. In particular, we have used a commercially available preformed polymer, PVK, as the matrix. This method provides a simple route of GO dispersion without the need of synthesizing the dispersant polymer or grafting approaches. Furthermore, the noncovalent approach maintains the pristine nature of graphene oxide where the subsequent reduction of GO is still possible. More importantly, the electroactivity of the precursor polymer, PVK, allows for large-scale immobilization of the nanocomposite on any conducting surface via electrochemical method.","Materials","The graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) (purity 99.5%) used in this study were obtained commercially from XG sciences. The poly (N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals (USA) (MW=25,000-50,000 g\/mol). All solvents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate was cleaned by sequentially sonicating the ITO plates in deionized water, isopropanol, hexane and toluene, each for 15 minutes prior to use. The ITO was dried in the oven and plasma cleaned prior to use.","Preparation of the Graphene Oxide","Graphene oxide (GO) were synthesized using the modified procedure reported by Macarno et al. Briefly, GNPs (3.0 g) were oxidized by mixing with KMnO(18.0 g). A 9:1 mixture of concentrated HSO\/HPO(360:40 mL) was then added producing an exothermic reaction that raised the temperature to 35\u00b0 C.-40\u00b0 C. The reaction was heated further to 50\u00b0 C. with stirring and maintained for 12 hours, then cooled to room temperature.","The cooled mixture was poured into ice (\u02dc400 mL) with 30% HO(3 mL). The mixture was sifted through 425 nm and 250 nm US Standard Testing Sieves and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 4 hours. The solids were washed with Millipore water (200 mL) while passing it through 425 nm and 250 nm US Standard Testing Sieve and then the mixture was centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 1 hour. The residue was washed with ethanol (400 mL), then coagulated with ether (200 mL) before it was placed in vacuum oven to dry overnight.","Preparation of the PVK-GO Nanocomposites in Solution","The PVK-GO nanocomposites were prepared using solution mixing process. In a typical experiment, the weight\/volume (mg\/mL) (w\/v) ratios of PVK and GO were dispersed in N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP) at 1 mg\/mL concentration and ultrasonically agitated for 1 hour. The PVK solution was slowly mixed to a GO solution at 97:3 (wt %) ratio respectively followed by sonication for another 30 minutes. We also prepared 96:4, 95:5, 94:6, and 93:7 wt % ratios of PVK:GO.","Preparation of the solid PVK-GO Nanocomposites","Solid PVK-GO nanocomposite was prepared using solution mixing process but using THF as solvent. PVK and GO was dispersed separately in THF at 5 mg\/mL concentration and ultrasonically agitated for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The mixture of PVK in THF was mixed slowly with GO in THF at 97:3 (wt %) ratio respectively. The mixture was agitated ultrasonically for 30 minutes before THF was evaporated from the mixture using a rotary evaporator. The obtained mixture was placed in a vacuum oven to thoroughly dry the product.","Preparation of the PVK-GO Drop-Casted Film","The PVK-GO nanocomposite solution was dropcasted (50 \u03bcL) onto an ITO-coated glass plate (1 in.\u00d70.5 in.) substrate and thoroughly dried in a vacuum oven.","Preparation of the Electrodeposited PVK-GO Film","The solution for electrodeposition was prepared by mixing 0.1 M TBAH (2 mL) in acetonitrile with PVK-GO (50 \u03bcL) at 97:3 (wt %) ratio described above. The PVK-GO film was deposited on bare ITO by repeatedly scanning the potential between 0 to 1500 mV at a scan rate of 10 mV\/s for 50 cycles. Ag and Pt wires were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. The deposited film was washed with acetonitrile (3\u00d7) to remove any unbound material from the surface.","Characterization of PVK-GO Bulk Nanocomposites and Films","UV-vis spectra were recorded using an Agilent 8453 spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectra were recorded using an FTS 7000 Digilab Spectrometer within the 700-3500 cmrange. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was taken using Rigaku Ultima III diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 X-ray radiation (k=1.54056 \u212b) from 0.5\u00b0-30\u00b0 at 0.04\u00b0\/s.","Thermal stabilities of the prepared PVK-GO nanocomposites were performed from 20\u00b0 C. to 900\u00b0 C. at a heating rate of 20\u00b0 C.\/min by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a TA Instruments 2950 thermogravimetric analyzer. All experiments were operated under a Natmosphere at a purge rate of 80-90 mL\/min. The experimental samples weighed from 5 to 10 mg were prepared from 1 mL of PVK-GO solution, which was precipitated using methanol. TGA data was analyzed using TA Instruments' Universal Analysis software.","The morphologies of the electrodeposited PVK-GO on ITO substrates as well as the spin-casted GO films were characterized by AFM. The topography measurement was done under ambient conditions with a PicoSPM II (PicoPlus, Molecular Imaging-Agilent Technologies) using the intermittent contact mode.","Dispersions of Individual GO Sheets in PVK","Stable graphene dispersion is hard to prepare under common mechanical methods like stirring and sonication because of inter- and intramolecular pi-pi stacking that further leads to aggregation. The use of mechanical forces is beneficial in dispersing the graphene but it is not enough to control the aggregation of graphene sheets through Van der Waals interactions. In this work, the pristine graphite was first oxidized using the modified method reported by Macarno et al. to produce GO, wherein the cooled mixture produced after the reaction was allowed to pass through a series of microsifters followed by centrifugation. The sifting procedure removed the agglomerated GO leaving finer particles with relatively uniform sizes in the mixture. This procedure was done twice, which resulted in a more homogeneous dispersion of GO in aqueous and most organic solvents as shown in .","Analysis of a large number of AFM images () of spin-casted GO on mica dispersed in various solvents show that most GO sheets have average heights of approximately 1 nm and lengths ranging from nanometers to several micrometers. This result correlates well with the previously reported AFM morphologies suggesting the successful exfoliation of GO. The solubility of the produced GO was tested in aqueous and organic solvents, in particular tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF), N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP), and N-methylpyrolidone (NMP).  shows the digital images of the prepared GO dispersions in different solvents. All the dispersions remained stable for 24 h, after which GO started to settle and agglomerate.","To improve the stability of the exfoliated GO, we incorporated PVK, a precursor polymer containing aromatic groups. The use of polymer as a dispersant is usually more effective for GOs in organic solvents compared to small molecules or monomers. We hypothesize that the presence of this polymer will increase the dispersion through pi-pi stacking interaction between the carbazole groups of PVK and the aromatic groups of GO.","Different weight % compositions of GO in the nanocomposite (3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) were prepared to test the stability of the dispersions in NMP. More stable exfoliations were observed at higher PVK loadings and the greatest change in stability time was acquired at 97% loading (results not shown).","Specifically, enhanced solubility of PVK-GO nanocomposite was observed for 30 days in CHP and NMP, 2 days in DMF, 5 days in THF, and 2 days in water. For comparison, the digital images of the PVK-GO (3 wt. % GO) and GO solutions in NMP after 30 days of incubation are presented in .","UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was employed to characterize the presence of PVK and GO in the nanocomposite. All the UV-vis measurements shown were taken in NMP because it yielded the most stable dispersion. As illustrated in , the main absorption peaks for PVK are observed at 342 nm and 352 nm. Similar peaks were also observed for the nanocomposite with a broad tailing from 400-800 nm (). This tailing is comparable to the one acquired for the oxidized graphene sample () and thus, indicates the presence of GO in the nanocomposite.","XRD measurement was performed to determine the dispersion state of GO in the PVK matrix. The XRD patterns of the pure PVK, GO, and their nanocomposite are shown in . The pristine GO nanosheet () exhibits a diffraction band at 2\u03b8=11.1\u00b0, which corresponds to a d spacing of 0.8 nm. The diffraction peak of pure PVK appeared at around 2\u03b8=28.9\u00b0 indicative of its amorphous nature. This peak was also found in the XRD pattern for the PVK-GO nanocomposite (). However, the characteristic peak of GO was not present in the diffractogram of PVK-GO. The disappearance of the GO peak in the nanocomposite clearly demonstrates the absence of the regular periodic structure of GO, indicating that GO was fully exfoliated in the polymer nanocomposite.","The functional groups present in the PVK-GO nanocomposite were determined using FTIR. The FTIR spectrum of the pure PVK is shown in . The characteristic bands of PVK were given the following assignments: 3100 cm(aromatic C\u2014H stretch), 2900-3000 cm(aliphatic C\u2014H stretch from the polymer backbone), 1597 cm(C\u2550C stretching), 1255 cm(C\u2014N stretching of vinyl carbazole), 1100-1150 cm(in plane \u2014C\u2014H aromatic), and 749-800 cm(out of plane \u2014C\u2014H aromatic). Although all these peaks were observed in the PVK-GO nanocomposite, the successful incorporation of GO in the nanocomposite was only verified by the appearance of the C\u2550O (1700 cm) and OH (3200 cm) stretch peaks coming from the carbonyl and carboxylic acid\/hydroxyl groups, respectively of GO. These peaks were also observed for the GO control sample ().","The thermal stabilities of the PVK-GO nanocomposites were analyzed by TGA against GO and PVK. The TGA curve of the graphene oxide () indicated an abrupt \u02dc30% decrease in weight at around 200\u00b0 C. that could be attributed to the decomposition of its labile-oxygen containing functionalities. On the other hand, a slower and steady mass loss was observed at temperatures greater than 300\u00b0 C. ascribed to the removal of the more stable oxygen groups. Compared with GO, the TGA data for the PVK-GO nanocomposites indicated a three-step decomposition process. The first 2 steps are consistent with the thermal degradation of the PVK, corresponding to the degradation of the side chains and polymer backbone, while the observed third decomposition step corresponds to the oxidation and decomposition of GO. The presence of GO in the composite contributed to a higher decomposition temperature at around 500\u00b0 C. as compared to the pure PVK.","Fabrication of PVK-GO Films","The fabrication of PVK-GO films was done by electrochemical methods. As mentioned earlier, the presence of the electro-active carbazole groups in PVK facilitates the incorporation of the composite to the surface. Compared to the films fabricated by the conventional drop-casting, which resulted to an uneven coating distribution and removal of the film upon prolong solvent washing, the electrodeposited films were observed to be evenly coated and stable even after several washings (results not shown).","FIG. shows the representative CV plot obtained during the electrodeposition of PVK-GO on the ITO substrate. Although the PVK-GO nanocomposite is simultaneously being deposited on the substrate, the CV diagram would only provide the information for the electrochemical crosslinking of the electro-active carbazole moieties in the PVK. During the first cycle, the onset of the anodic peak is at 1.1 V, typical for the oxidation of the carbazole monomer. In the succeeding cycles, a lower oxidation onset was observed at \u02dc0.9 V due to the formation of more conjugated crosslinked carbazole units. The increasing current as the number of cycles is increased evidenced the deposition of the PVK-GO nanocomposite on the surface. Furthermore, the monomer-free scan of the electrodeposited PVK-GO film ( inset) still displayed the redox peaks of the PVK nanocomposite, confirming the presence of the film on the surface.","The potentiodynamically deposited PVK-GO film was further characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy (). The well-defined peaks at 342 and 352 nm that are initially found in the PVK-GO nanocomposite disappeared after its electrodeposition on ITO. A new broad polaronic band centered at 450 nm was depicted after the electrodeposition process, signifying the electrochemical crosslinking of the carbazole pendants in PVK. These observations are consistent with our previous studies on electropolymerized PVK and carbazole-containing precursors.","To determine the morphology of the PVK-GO film after electrodeposition, AFM measurement was performed. As shown in , both the topography and phase images of the resulting film revealed a homogeneous and well-defined surface coverage with a root mean squared (rms) value of 2.4 nm. The average grain size obtained was about 160 nm, which corroborates well with the typical grain size reported for the presence of PVK on the surface.","To verify that GO was indeed immobilized on the surface upon electrodeposition, FTIR-ATR spectroscopy measurement of the resulting film was acquired. As a control, ATR spectrum of the electrodeposited pure PVK film was also evaluated. Clearly, the electrodeposited PVK-GO film revealed expected peaks for PVK (). More importantly, the intense peak at 1700 cmassigned for the C\u2550O stretch and the broad peak that extends from 3000-3500 cmattributed to the OH functional groups from the carboxylic acid alcohol groups, both of which are stretches only ascribed if GO is present were also observed.","In conclusion, we have presented an effective method of preparing PVK-GO nanocomposite coating on ITO substrate by electrodeposition of PVK-GO dispersion. Highly stable exfoliations of graphene oxide were first prepared in various solvents through the incorporation of a preformed PVK via solution mixing process. The resulting PVK-GO nanocomposite does not only exhibit good dispersibility but also show excellent storage stability (30 days in CHP and NMP). Electrodeposition of the PVK-GO dispersion facilitated the electrocrosslinking of the PVK on the surface to create a robust conducting polymer nanocomposite network thin film. We believe that simplicity of the method and the stability of the nanocomposite dispersions and films produced, will greatly facilitate useful and large-scale applications of graphene-based nanomaterials.","We demonstrate the fabrication of graphene oxide (GO)-containing polymer nanocomposite (PVK-GO) as an antimicrobial coating. The antimicrobial film was 90% more effective in preventing bacterial colonization relative to the unmodified surface. More importantly, the nanocomposite thin film showed higher bacterial toxicity than pure GO-modified surface.","Biofilm formation on conducting materials (metal, metal alloys, metal oxides, and electrodes) has emerged as a significant problem in the long-term use of bioimplants, biosensors, and marine and industrial apparatus. Strategies for controlling bacterial colonization have focused on improving and developing antimicrobial materials and design to inhibit biofilm formation. Examples of antimicrobial agents previously used as surface coatings that have shown reduced bacterial adhesion are antibiotics, quaternary ammonium salts, cationic peptides, and metal ions. However, problems related to the development of microbial resistance, surface coating difficulties, and relatively high costs make these approaches unsuitable for long-term antimicrobial coatings.","The incorporation of graphene on surfaces is an alternative method to prevent bacterial colonization. This ultrathin nanomaterial has been reported to show promising antibacterial activity. Furthermore, compared to other antibacterial surfaces, it is relatively inexpensive, possesses very high mechanical stiffness and has extraordinary electronic transport property. Despite the many advantages that it has to offer, the investigation of graphene as an antimicrobial coating film has not been well-established. To our knowledge, most of the antibacterial investigations were conducted either in solution or as free-standing graphene sheets. In this present study, we investigate the antimicrobial properties of graphene polymer nanocomposite coated surfaces. At present, the major challenges of working with pristine graphene are its non-dispersibility in either aqueous or organic solvents, direct immobilization on surfaces and processability, which leads to difficulty in working with pristine graphene alone. To address these issues, our group has developed a method of producing a more stable and easily dispersible graphene in a polymer matrix composed of graphene oxide (GO) and poly-N-vinyl carbazole (PVK). GO unlike its pristine counterpart contains both unoxidized aromatic and aliphatic regions with phenolic, carboxylic, and epoxide groups that allow it to be easily dispersed in various solvents. PVK on the other hand forms a p-p stacking interaction with GO through the carbazole group that stabilizes the dispersion of the nanocomposite (NC) and creates a conducting polymer network (CPN) which can be immobilized and patterned on any conducting substrate via electrochemical methods.","We present the first report on the immobilization of graphene on conducting surfaces as an antimicrobial coating. Specifically, we tethered GO-PVK nanocomposite via electrodeposition on indium tin oxide (ITO). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR IR) spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to monitor its deposition. The antibacterial property of the electrodeposited GO-PVK films was then tested against K12 MG1655 ().","The preparation of the PVK-GO nanocomposite film was carried out by electrodeposition on the ITO interface.  shows the CV plot monitoring the immobilization of PVK-GO on the surface. The first oxidation peak was observed at 1.4 V, which moved towards lower oxidation potential as the cycle is increased. This lowering of potential is expected due to the formation of more p-conjugated species upon the crosslinking of the carbazole pendant moieties of the vinyl backbone. The irreversible oxidation process could possibly be due to the reduced electron transfer kinetics caused by the presence of the graphene oxide. The monomer-free scan of the film also showed the oxidation peak observed during the electrodeposition procedure, signifying the presence of the material on the surface as shown in .","ATR-IR was used to verify the presence of electrodeposited GO-PVK on ITO. The ATR-IR spectra for the PVK and GO-PVK-modified surfaces are depicted in . For the electropolymerized PVK, absorption peak assignments are as follows: 3100 cm(aromatic C\u2014H stretch), 2900-3000 cm(aliphatic C\u2014H stretch from the polymer backbone), 1600 cm(C\u2550C stretching), 1226 cm(C\u2014N stretching of vinyl carbazole), 1100-1150 cm(in plane \u2014C\u2014H aromatic), and 700-800 cm(out of plane \u2014C\u2014H aromatic). While all these peaks were observed on the PVK-GO film, the presence of GO on the surface was verified by the appearance of an intense peak at 1700 cmassigned for the C\u2550O stretch; and OH stretch the broad peak that extends from 3000-3500 cmattributed to the OH functional groups from the carboxylic acid alcohol groups present in the GO.","To determine the composition of GO on the surface. High resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) scans in the C1s and N1s regions () were acquired for the PVK and PVK-GO films. From the obtained atomic concentrations of the high resolution scans (C1s and N1s), the C\/N ratios of PVK and PVK-GO were obtained 14.0 and 14.4, respectively. By using these values, the amount of GO on the surface was estimated to be 3%. This value correlates well with the initial 3 wt % loading for GO. The homogeneity of the deposited film was determined via AFM (). The electrodeposited PVK-GO surface revealed excellent well-defined film coverage with a root mean squared (rms) roughness value of 2.38 nm. The average grain size was about 160 nm typical of the grain size observed for the presence of PVK on the surface.","Prior to testing bacterial toxicity on modified surfaces, the antibacterial property of the nanocomposite, GO-PVK, GO, and PVK were evaluated by incubating each of the solution with cells for 1 h. The growth curves of bacterial-treated with GO-PVK nanocomposite, GO and PVK samples were examined via optical density (OD) measurements, which corresponded to the number of live cells that are able to grow after 1 h of exposure to the samples. In general, compared to the control, the samples containing GO were observed to be antibacterial.","This activity was shown by the low OD values observed for all measured samples (). To evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of the different nanomaterials, we measured for each of the growth curves the time required to reach 10CFU\/mL, which corresponds to an ODof 0.5. Based on the results, all the GO-containing samples took longer time to reach OD of 0.5 as compared to the untreated samples (control) and the PVK samples (). GO is already known to be toxic to bacteria, however, the addition of PVK resulted in an increased dispersion of GO in the solution providing a greater aspect ratio, thereby resulting in an increased interaction with the bacteria and higher toxicity.","After testing the antibacterial properties of the composites in solution, we tested the effects of modified films of PVK, PVK-GO, and GO on . In situ live-dead staining of the bacterial organisms attached to the differently modified surfaces were performed to determine the ratio of dead bacteria versus the total number of bacteria. SYTO 9 dye was used to show both the live and dead cells, while the dead bacteria with compromised membranes were stained only by propidium iodide (PI). Fluorescence images of the surface reveal that after incubation a more pronounced antibacterial activity was observed for the GO-modified surfaces than the unmodified and PVK films (). In fact, the PVK-GO and GO-modified surfaces were successful in inactivating by approximately 90% and 84%, respectively. This result showed that GO remained effective even after surface immobilization. It is worth noting that the addition of PVK did not hinder its efficacy but showed an enhanced bacterial toxicity than the GO alone. We infer that the improved dispersion caused by the presence of PVK led to the observed results. Although investigating the detailed mechanism of antibacterial toxicity is beyond the scope of this study, it is inferred that GO has similar antimicrobial mechanisms as other carbon based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, i.e., the direct contact of GO or carbon allotrope with bacteria can lead to cell inactivation through cell-membrane disruption and subsequent lysis.","In conclusion, we have presented the antibacterial properties of a PVK-GO graphene nanocomposite dispersion electropolymerized on ITO surface. In principle, this robust antimicrobial coating can be applied on most electrically conducting substrates such as most metals. The use of PVK allowed GO immobilization as a homogeneous film via electropolymerization. Moreover, it allowed better exposure of the GO surface as quantified by XPS measurements. Antibacterial properties of the GO-containing films and solutions resulted in increased bacterial inactivation even at 3 wt %, relative to the control as shown in . This result shows the potential use of PVK-GO nanocomposite films as an alternative antimicrobial coating for electrode or metal surfaces that can be widely used in the biomedical and industrial fields.","Preparation of the Electropolymerized PVK-GO Film","The preparation of the antimicrobial PVK-GO (97-3 PVK-GO wt %) film was similar to previously reported literature. Briefly, the polymerizing solution was prepared by mixing 0.1 M TBAH (2 mL) in acetonitrile with PVK-GO (50 \u03bcL) at 97:3 (wt %) ratio described above. The PVK-GO film was deposited on bare ITO by repeatedly scanning the potential between 0 to 1500 mV at a scan rate of 10 mV\/s for 50 cycles. Ag and Pt wires were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. The deposited film was washed with acetonitrile (3\u00d7) to remove any unbound material from the surface.","Atomic Force Microscopy","The morphology before and after electropolymerization of PVK\/GO on ITO glass substrates were characterized by AFM. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging was done under ambient conditions with a PicoSPM II (PicoPlus, Molecular Imaging\u2014Agilent Technologies) in the Magnetic AC mode (MAC mode) using a magnetic field to drive a magnetically coated cantilever in the top-down configuration. Type II MAC levers with a spring constant of 2.8 nN\/M with about 10 nm tip radius were used for all scans.","Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transformed Infrared (ATR FTIR)","The ATR FTIR spectra were obtained on a Digilab FTS 7000 equipped with a HgCdTe detector from 4000 to 600 (cm) wavenumbers. All spectra were taken with a nominal spectral resolution of 4 cmin absorbance mode. All films were measured under ambient and dry conditions for several trials at different areas of the sample surface.","X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Measurements","XPS measurements of the samples were performed using a PHI 5700 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), which was equipped with a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 X-ray source (hn=1486.7 eV) incident at 90\u00b0 relative to the axis of a hemispherical energy analyzer. The spectrometer was operated both at high and low resolutions with pass energies of 23.5 and 187.85 eV, respectively, a photoelectron take off angle of 45\u00b0 from the surface, and an analyzer spot diameter of 1.1 mm. High-resolution spectra were obtained for photoelectrons emitted from C 1s and N 1s. All spectra were collected at room temperature with a base pressure of 1\u00d710ton. Electron binding energies were calibrated with respect to the C1s line at 284.8 eV. A PHI Multipak software (ver 5.0A) was used for all data processing. The high-resolution data was first analyzed by background subtraction using the Shirley routine and a subsequent nonlinear fitting to mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian functions. Atomic compositions were derived from the high-resolution scans. Peak areas were obtained after subtraction of the integrated baseline and corrected for sensitivity factors.","Bacterial Culture","A single isolated K12 MG1655 () colony was inoculated in 5 mL Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) overnight at 35\u00b0 C. The bacterial culture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the bacteria pellet was resuspended in TSB. The optical density of the suspension was adjusted to 0.5 at 600 nm, which corresponds to a concentration of 10colony forming units per milliliters (CFU\/ml).","Treatment of Samples with Bacterial Culture","Aliquots of 180 \u03bcl of bacterial suspensions (10CFU\/ml) were placed in an Eppendorf tube containing 20 \u03bcl of sample (GO, GO-PVK, PVK) of 1000 \u03bcg\/ml concentration in DI water. Control samples contained 180 \u03bcl of bacterial suspensions added with 20 \u03bcl of DI water. The tubes were shaken at 50 rpm for 1 h at room temperature.","Antimicrobial Activity Determined by Growth Curve Measurements","The antimicrobial property of GO, GO-PVK, and PVK samples were evaluated by examining the bacterial growth curves via ODafter 1 h exposure to these materials. Briefly, the mixtures of bacteria and samples were transferred into 5 mL TSB broth, and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring the ODevery hour using Spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer). The OD curves were generated by plotting the OD values versus growth time. The fast or slow increase in OD during the incubation represents the ability of to survive and grow in the presence of the different nanomaterials.","Antibacterial Measurements on Stainless Steel Substrates","PVK-GO, PVK, GO-modified films and unmodified ITO substrate were individually placed in a 12 well-plate (Falcon). To each well was added 1.0 ml of bacterial culture and then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. (without shaking) for 2 h. The samples were then removed and immediately prior to viewing were stained with 3 ml of L 7007 Live-dead stain solution for 10 minutes from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The netherlands) containing a green fluorescent dye (Syto 9) marking viable bacteria cells and red fluorescence dye (PI) for detection of dead cells. The surfaces were placed in microscope slides, covered with a cover slip and imaged using BX 51 Olympus Fluorescent Microscope equipped with a DP72 digital camera under 100\u00d7 objective. All images were acquired and analyzed using cell Sens Dimension software (Olympus). Percent dead was expressed as the percent of the ratio of the total number of dead cells to the total number of bacteria attached.","A facile approach of making scalable nanocomposite and electro-patterned films using graphene oxide (GO) and poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is reported. The method involves the layering of polystyrene colloidal templates, electrodeposition of the composite film on template array, and finally removal of the sacrificial templates to reveal the patterned GO-PVK arrays. Due to its well-known fast electron transport, excellent mechanical and thermal properties, and very high surface area, graphene has been the subject of intense scientific interest as evidenced by the rapid increase in the number of publications since 2004. Equally important and relatively more processable is the graphene oxide (GO), which is being exploited as useful graphene precursor for incorporation into ceramics, metals, and polymers and is being developed as thin film electronic materials, hydrogen storage devices, anti-bacterial paper, etc. The combination of GO and polymer into composites has created many unique physical properties including improved conductivity and thermal stability particularly of the host polymer. Recently, creating or patterning well-ordered graphene nanostructures have gained significant attention as well due to its application as an effective field effect transistor device. Graphene nanostructures were earlier fabricated by a combination of electron beam (e-beam) lithography and dry etching, which can limit their practical applications. Lately, Tour and co-workers reported periodic two-dimensional (2D) graphene nanostructures through self-assembled monolayers of colloidal microspheres. Here, we present a simple and alternative route of patterning GO and polymer nanocomposites via colloidal template assited electrodeposition technique (), which can be done at room temperature and without intricate instrumental set-up. To our knowledge, this is the first report on patterning GO with a conducting polymer precursor to form 2D well-ordered nanocomposite film arrays on conducting electrode surfaces like Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). Briefly, the process begins with the layering of sacrificial templates of 500 nm sized polystyrene (PS) particles using a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB)-like deposition technique. This step is followed by cyclic voltammetric (CV) electrodeposition of GO\/PVK (3\/97 wt %) nanocomposite film, and finally removal of the PS templates via dissolution in tetrahydrofuran (THF). We hypothesized that the carbazole moieties of the PVK creates \u03c0-\u03c0* interactions with the GO, which was confirmed using semi-empirical and density functional theory (DFT) calculations ().","The proposed patterning method also offers the advantage of facile and accurate control of preparing arrays by varying the size of the colloidal templates and the different electrodeposition process parameters.  (in the Supporting Document) presents the CV-electrodeposition of the GO\/PVK nanocomposite film onto the PS-colloidal template array that shows the typical oxidation peak due to the cross-linking of the carbazole electroactive groups of the PVK. A similar oxidation peak with an onset potential of about 0.95 V is displayed in the CV diagrams for the electrodeposition of the same nanocomposite solution () and pure PVK () on bare ITO substrates (control). In all the CV diagrams, a decreasing oxidation peak was observed in the range between \u02dc0.95 V to \u02dc1.3 V, which is due to the depletion of the cross-linkable mono-carbazole moieties of the already electrodeposited PVK film. This result may be feasible since a very dilute concentration of the PVK solution was used for both electrodepositions. Unlike our previous results that utilized a concentrated solution of PVK (1 mg\/mL), increasing oxidation peak was observed during the CV electrodeposition. To confirm the formation of the GO\/PVK nanocomposite and pure PVK films on ITO substrates, a post-polymerization monomer free-scan was performed, which was done after thoroughly washing the electrodeposited films. The appearance of the same CV diagram (inset of ) with the signature oxidation peak of the cross-linked carbazole units as that of the electrodepositions verifies the successful formation of the electrodeposited films. The UV-Vis measurements () of these films further substantiate the results that show the characteristic peaks of a typical electrodeposited or cross-linked carbazole (black curve) with peaks centered at \u02dc445 nm and \u02dc850 nm, which are consistent with our earlier reports. These peaks are assigned to the \u03c0-\u03c0* transition of the cross-linked carbazole and the polaronic band of the conjugated or cross-linked carbazole specie and their complex redox ion couple with hexafluorophosphate ions (from the TBAH), respectively. These two peaks are also present but are slightly shifted to lower wavelength in the GO\/PVK nanocomposite and electro-patterned film, approaching the reported absorption range (227-231 nm) for GO. The shift may be related also to the p-p stacking phenomena between GO and the carbazole moeities, which was earlier observed in the DFT calculations ().","A more compelling evidence about the formation of the GO\/PVK nanocomposite film is shown by ATR IR analysis.  shows the IR spectrum of the electrodeposited pure PVK film (black curve) with the characteristic peaks of an electrodeposited polycarbazole: 3050 cm(aromatic CH stretch due to pendant carbazol moiety), 2850-3000 cm(aliphatic C\u2014H stretch due to the polymer backbone), and 1596 cm(C\u2550C stretch), 1450-1500 cm(CH stretch), and 1220 cm(C\u2014N stretch) of the pendant carbazol moiety. With the GO\/PVK nanocomposite and electro-patterned film (red curve), the IR spectrum also depicts signature peaks for PVK with additional peaks at 1700 cmand in between \u02dc3100 to \u02dc3650 cmdue to the C\u2550O and OH stretching vibrations, respectively. These peaks are known to be attributed to the numerous hydroxyl and carbonyl groups that are present in the GO. Complementary X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals a strong N 1s peak (between 398 to 403 eV) () in the GO\/PVK electro-patterned surface and a significant increase in the C 1s signal (282 to 287 eV) ( and ) by \u02dc130% in the GO\/PVK than the prinstine PVK electro-patterned surface, indicating the formation of the nanocomposite film. Its 0 is signal () shows maximum peak intensity at 532.0 eV and a shouldering peak at 529.9 eV, attributed to the C\u2014O and C\u2550O moieties, respectively of the GO in the composite electro-patterned film. XPS was used to determine the exact composition of GO in the film to be \u02dc3%, equivalent to the feed ratio or composition.","Prior to the fabrication of the GO\/PVK nanocomposite and electro-patterned film, the formation of graphene oxide was verified by a combination of surface analytical techniques. For instance, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images () demonstrate the typical flaky morphology for the spin casted GO layer on mica that shows an average thickness between \u02dc1.20 to \u02dc1.40 nm () while the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) layer also on mica shows the usual thickness between 0.8 to 1.0 nm (). Moreover, the results of the other techniques like TGA () and XRD () clearly confirm the synthesis of GO and the formation of the GO\/PVK nanocomposite, which were also consistent with the other reported works.","The electro-patterned film of GO\/PVK nanocomposite was evidenced by the AFM topography measurements.  shows the hexagonally and highly closed packed 2D colloidal PS (500 nm size) template array on ITO substrate. The same AFM image was observed after the electrodeposition of the GO\/PVK nanocomposite. Therefore, the employed CV conditions have not disrupted the PS assembly and have enabled the controlled electrodeposition of the nanocomposite film at the interstitial void spaces underneath and in between the sacrificial colloidal sphere monolayer. This was verified by the AFM image taken of the nanocomposite film after washing the colloidal spheres with THF (2\u00d7, 30 mins), which leaves behind a highly ordered inverse colloidal array of the GO\/PVK nanocomposite and electro-patterned film (). Similarly, the electro-patterned film is vividly observed in the AFM amplitude image (). The high magnification AFM image on  clearly illustrates the highly porous and inter-connected 2D hexagonal network of the GO\/PVK nanocomposite film. The line profile analysis () of the high magnification image determines an average total thickness (t) of the patterned film of about 42\u00b12 nm. This value is the measured distance between the baseline and the highest peak of the line profile. A smaller protrusion () of thickness (t) of about 8.5\u00b12 nm is observed on top of the cavity wall. The line profile also measures the inner (d) and outer (d) diameters of the cavity with an average values of 290\u00b110 nm and 625\u00b15 nm, respectively. The GO\/PVK nanocomposite and electro-patterned film may have possibly swelled laterally during the washing of the PS colloidal templates, and thus the peak-to-peak distance between cavities is much greater than the size of the templated PS particles. To further verify the electro-patterned nanocomposite film, a contact mode current sensing (CS)-AFM ( and ) was performed on the same sample. This technique is feasible to use since the nanocomposite film is expected to be relatively conducting than the electro-patterned PVK. This was substantiated by measuring first the conductivity of the GO\/PVK nanocomposite solution versus the PVK solution alone. As expected, the GO\/PVK solution (97:3 wt. %) showed a conductivity reading between 0.2 to 0.3 \u03bcS\u00b7cmwhereas the pure PVK solution registered a nil value for several trials. This result underscores the importance of having GO in the nanocomposite array to enhance its conductivity. Therefore the CS-AFM allowed the successful imaging of the electro-patterned nanocomposite film with a good contrast due to differing conductivities between the patterned material (GO\/PVK nanocomposite) and the unmodified region (bare ITO). The contact mode and current topography images confirmed more the electro-patterned GO\/PVK nanocomposite film that shows the same inverse colloidal array of highly ordered and hexagonal interconnected network.","Lastly, to demonstrate the usefulness of the pattern as a highly porous material for potential patterned electrodes and electrochemical devices, molecular diffusion of an ionic probe [Fe(CN)] was performed using CV (). The GO\/PVK electro-patterned film displays the typical redox couple of the KFe(CN)between 0.0 V to 0.5 V with similar current peak intensity as that of the bare ITO. This result implies that the molecular ion probe is able to diffuse freely in and out of the surface of the GO\/PVK electro-patterned surface like the unmodified ITO. However, the non-templated and continuous GO\/PVK film illustrates a relatively much lower redox peak intensity, which means that the ionic probe was somewhat prevented from freely moving into the surface. Also, the porosity of the GO\/PVK electro-patterned film is validated by the appearance of the doublet In 3d (440 to 455 eV) () and Sn 3d (484 to 498 eV) () peaks in the XPS, which are unique elemental makers of the underlayer ITO substrate.","In conclusion, a facile and versatile method of making scalable nanocomposite and electro-patterned film was demonstrated by colloidal template assisted electrodeposition. The composite electro-patterned substrate maybe utilized in various applications such as biological scaffold, catalysis, sensors, photonics and nanostructured functional composites. Also, with the numerous H-bonding sites in the GO that are useful for complexing with another molecule (i.e. template analyte), the nanocomposite and electro-patterned film can be potentially applied for molecular imprinting purposes, which are currently being pursued by our group.","Materials","Polystyrene (PS) latex microbeads (0.5 mm in diameter, 2.5% solids (w\/v) aqueous suspension, 3.64\u00d710particles\/mL) were purchased from Polysciences, Inc. and were used without any purification. These particles contain a slight anionic charge from sulfate ester. Sodium n-dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used to control the organization of the PS microbeads at the air-liquid interface. Millipore water (18 M\u03a9\u00b7cm) was used to dilute the PS suspension solution and to control the total concentration of the mixture solution. The acetonitrile (ACN), tetrahydrofuran (THF), sodium n-dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAH) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All solvents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The nano graphene platelets (NGP) (purity 99.5%) were obtained commercially from XG Sciences. The NGP has a thickness of 5-15 nm and width between 5-25 \u03bcm. The tin-doped indium oxide, ITO (In[Sn]O, one side coated on glass, sheet resistance\u226630 \u03a9cm) was purchased from SPI Supplies\/Structure Probe, Inc. Prior to use, the ITO substrate was sonicated in Alconox detergent followed by rinsing with ultra pure water. The ITO was then sonicated for 10 min in isopropanol, hexane, and then toluene, respectively, prior to oxygen plasma cleaning for \u02dc120 sec. The poly (N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals (USA) (ca MW=25,000-50,000 g\/mol).","Electrochemistry","Cyclic voltammetry were performed in a conventional three-electrode cell using an Autolab PGSTAT 12 potentiostat (Brinkmann Instruments now MetroOhm USA). The potentiostat was controlled by GPES software (version 4.9). The electrodeposition of the GO\/PVK nanocomposite was done using cyclic voltammetric (CV) technique in a standard three electrode measuring cell (fabricated electrochemical cell with a diameter of 1.0 cm and 0.785 cm, Teflon made) with platinum wire as the counter electrode, Ag\/AgCl wire as the reference electrode, and the bare or PS coated ITO-substrate as the working electrode.","Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)","The AFM measurements were carried out in a piezo scanner from Agilent Technologies. The scanning rate was between 0.8 to 1.0 lines\/s. Commercially available tapping mode tips (TAP300, Silicon AFM Probes, Ted Pella, Inc.) were used on cantilevers with a resonance frequency in the range of 290-410 kHz. The scanning of the electropolymerized film was performed under ambient and dry conditions. All AFM topographic images (AAC tapping mode) were filtered and analyzed by using SPIP software (Scanning Probe Image Processor, Imagemet.com) or Gwyddion 2.19 software.","The current sensing (CS) AFM analyses in contact mode were done on the same set up using Pt-coated SiNtip with radius around 20 nm and force constant of 0.5 N\/m. The measurements were done under ambient conditions at \u02dc40-50% relative humidity and 20-25\u00b0 C. temperature. All AFM topographic images (AAC tapping mode) were also filtered and analyzed by using SPIP software (Scanning Probe Image Processor, Imagemet.com) or Gwyddion 2.19 software.","Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR)","The ATR FTIR spectra were obtained on a Digilab FTS 7000 equipped with a HgCdTe detector from 4000 to 600 (cm) wavenumbers. All spectra were taken with a nominal spectral resolution of 4 cmin absorbance mode. All films were measured under ambient and dry conditions.","Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis)","The UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a HP-8453 UV-Vis spectrometer within the 300-900 nm range. The UV-Vis measurement was done at ambient and dry condition at different areas of the film. The UV-Vis spectra were recorded for an equal concentration of each material.","X-ray Diffraction (XRD)","The XRD data was taken using Rigaku Ultima III diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 X-ray radiation (\u03bb=1.54056 \u212b) from 0.5\u00b0-30\u00b0 at 0.04\u00b0\/s.","Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)","The TGA analysis was performed on a TA Instruments 2950 thermogravimetric analyzer. The experiment was done by heating the sample from 20 to 900\u00b0 C. at a heating rate of 20\u00b0 C.\/min. All experiments were operated under a Natmosphere at a purge rate of 80-90 mL\/min.","X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Measurement","A PHI 5700 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer was equipped with a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 X-ray source (hv=1486.7 eV) incident at 90\u00b0 relative to the axis of a hemispherical energy analyzer. The spectrometer was operated both at high and low resolutions with pass energies of 23.5 eV and 187.85 eV, respectively, a photoelectron take off angle of 45\u00b0 from the surface, and an analyzer spot diameter of 1.1 mm. All spectra were collected at room temperature with a base pressure of 1\u00d710torr. The peaks were analyzed first by background subtraction using the Shirley routine. All the samples were completely dried in argon gas prior to XPS measurements.","Preparation of Graphene Oxide and Poly(N-Vinylcarbazole) Nanocomposite","Preparation of Graphene Oxide","Graphene oxide was synthesized using the improved method reported by Tour and co-workers. Briefly, graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) (3.0 g) were oxidized by mixing GNP with KMnO(18 g). A 9:1 mixture of concentrated HSO\/HPO(360:40 mL) was added producing an exothermic reaction that raised the temperature to 35-40\u00b0 C. The reaction was heated further to 50\u00b0 C. with stirring and maintained for 12 hours, and cooled to room temperature.","The cooled mixture was poured into ice (\u2212400 mL) with 30% HO(3 mL). The mixture was sifted through 425 \u03bcm and 250 \u03bcm US Standard Testing Sieve and then centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 4 hours. The solids were washed with 200 mL of Millipore water while passing it through 425 and 250 \u03bcm US Standard Testing Sieve and then the mixture was centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 1 hour. The residue was washed with 400 mL of ethanol, then coagulated with 200 mL ether before it was placed in vacuum oven to dry overnight.","Preparation of GO\/PVK Nanocomposite Solution","The GO\/PVK nanocomposite was prepared using solution mixing process. In a typical synthesis experiment, the weight\/volume (mg\/mL) (w\/v) ratios of PVK and GO were dispersed in N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP) at 1 mg\/mL concentration and ultrasonically agitated for 1 hour. The PVK solution was slowly mixed to a GO solution at 97:3 (% wt.) ratio, respectively followed by sonication for another 30 minutes. The mixture was used to prepare the PVK\/GO film. Previously, GO and other polymer composites were also prepared using other methods.","Preparation of Graphene Oxide and Poly(N-Vinylcarbazole) Nanocomposite and Electro-Patterned Film","Polystyrene Layering by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB)-Like Technique","The layering of PS microbeads (or formation of colloidal crystals) was accomplished using a similar procedure described earlier by Grady and co-workers. The method was called Langmuir-Blodgett (LB)-like technique for it formed a monolayer of PS particles onto flat surfaces without using the conventional LB set-up that employs floating barriers. As shown in , the substrate was attached into the dipper motor via Teflon clip and was dipped into an aqueous solution containing PS particles (1 wt. %) and SDS (34.7 mM) as spreading agent. A higher concentration of anionic surfactant (SDS) will result in multiple layers of highly disordered latex spheres while a low concentration will not form a full coverage in hexagonal array. Then the substrate was withdrawn vertically from the solution at a lift-up rate between 0.1 to 0.3 mm\/min. Finally, the substrate was dried by suspending it in air for few minutes.","Electrodeposition of the Graphene Oxide and Poly(N-vinylcarbazole) Nanocomposite","The electrodeposition of the GO\/PVK nanocomposite was done using cyclic voltammetric (CV) technique in a standard three electrode measuring cell with platinum wire as the counter electrode, Ag\/AgCl wire as the reference electrode, and the bare or PS-coated ITO substrate as the working electrode. The solution for electropolymerization was prepared by mixing 0.1 M TBAH in ACN (4 mL) with GO\/PVK (8 \u03bcL) at 3:97 (% wt. ratio) as described above. The potential was scanned between 0 V to 1.5 V at 10 mV\/s for 10 CV cycles. After the electrodeposition, the resulting film was washed with ACN thrice, and a monomer free scan was performed by using exactly the same experimental parameters but for 1 CV cycle only. The electrodeposited substrate was dried with nitrogen gas for few minutes.","Dissolution of the Polystyrene Template","The PS particles were removed from the surface after CV electrodeposition by dipping the PS-coated substrate in THF twice for 30 minutes. This step is to create the nanocomposite and electro-patterned film array. The THF will remove the PS particles only and not the electrodeposited film of GO and PVK. Then the substrate was allowed to dry naturally under ambient condition.","The composition of GO and PVK in the electrodeposited nanocomposite film was ascertained using high resolution XPS analysis by determining the C\/N ratio. For instance, from the obtained atomic concentrations of the high resolution scans (C 1s and N 1s), the C\/N ratios of PVK and PVK-GO were calculated. By using the formula ([(C\/N)\u2014(C\/N)]\u2014(C\/N)), the amount of GO on the surface was estimated to be \u02dc3%, which correlates well with the initial 3 wt % loading of GO in solution.","The TGA data shows the formation of the nanocomposite pattern. First, the TGA data for graphene oxide is consistent with the published literature with weight loss between 150\u00b0 C. to 300\u00b0 C. corresponding to CO, CO, and steam release from the most labile functional groups. The weight loss from 450\u00b0 C. to 900\u00b0 C. can be attributed to the removal of more stable oxygen functionalities. The TGA data for the PVK-GO nanocomposites indicated a three-step decomposition process. The first 2 steps are consistent with the thermal degradation of the PVK, corresponding to the degradation of the side chains and polymer backbone, while the observed third decomposition step corresponds to the oxidation and decomposition of GO. The XRD data shows the typical peak for graphene oxide with a diffraction band at 2\u03b8=11.1\u00b0, corresponding to a d spacing of 0.8 nm. The peak at 2\u03b8\u02dc25\u00b0, which is known peak for graphite, has disappeared in the XRD curve for the graphene oxide.","All references cited herein are incorporated by reference.
