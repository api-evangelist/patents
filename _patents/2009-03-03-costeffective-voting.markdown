title: Cost-effective voting
abstract: The subject matter of this specification can be embodied in, among other things, a method that includes receiving an electronic voting request from an originating mobile device at a recipient mobile device. Each mobile device is associated with a member of a voting group. The electronic voting request includes a voting ballot and instructions, that when executed by a processor, perform operations including generating a vote based on information in the voting ballot and transmitting the voting request to at least a portion of other members of the voting group that have not received the voting request. The operations also include receiving votes from the portion of the other members to which the voting request was transmitted and transmitting a tally of the received votes to the originating mobile device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This instant specification relates to communication.","Mobile communication devices such as cellular telephones and personal digital assistants have become increasingly popular. People often rely on these devices to communicate with one another, especially to arrange impromptu gatherings or quickly reach a consensus on an issue. For example, a group of friends may call one another to discuss which movie they are going to see or where they should meet to have dinner.","A popular way of communicating using these devices is by means of Short Message Service (SMS) text messages. These text messages may be transmitted from device to device and are particularly useful in situations where placing or taking a call maybe inappropriate (e.g., in a library). However, many service providers charge a fee for each text message sent and received by the device. Consequently, communicating with a group using SMS messages can be expensive for the user responsible for sending and receiving the bulk of the text messages.","In general, this document describes systems and techniques for cost-effective voting using mobile devices. For example, an SMS text message including a voting request (e.g., a ballot) and forwarding instructions may be propagated among a set of mobile devices in a first sequence. Responses to the ballot may be transmitted among the mobile devices in a second sequence that is different from the first sequence. The result of the vote may be transmitted among the devices in a third sequence that is also different from the first sequence.","For example, an originating device can transmit an SMS text message that includes a ballot and forwarding instructions to a first set of mobile devices. The first set of mobile devices can, in turn, transmit the text message to a second set of mobile devices specified by the forwarding instructions. This forwarding process can be repeated until the message has reached a specified set of mobile devices. Responses to the ballot can be transmitted from a receiving device to a device that transmitted the ballot to the receiving device until, in some cases, the responses reach the originating device. These responses may be tabulated, and an SMS message containing the result of the vote and forwarding instructions may be transmitted to another set of the devices. Then the forwarding process described above may be repeated. Transmitting messages in this way can disperse the cost of transmitting the messages among the mobile devices.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","In general, this document describes systems and techniques for dispersing communication costs across a group. In some implementations, the cost of conducting a vote via text message may be spread across a group of cellular telephone users. For example, a text message may include transmission instructions and a voting request. The text message may be disseminated among a group of devices according to the forwarding instructions. Responses to the voting request may be transmitted from receiving devices to the devices that transmitted the message to the receiving devices. The responses may be tabulated and the result may be broadcast among the participating devices in an order different from the initial transmission order.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","102","102","104","102","102","104"]},"In some implementations, the voting application can access a contacts list associated with the mobile device . The user can select contacts to receive the ballot from the contacts list. In some implementations, in addition to or in place of selecting contacts from a contacts list, the user can manually enter contacts to receive the ballot. For example, the user can select three contacts from a contact list stored on the mobile device , and manually enter a phone number for a fourth person. Each contact, whether entered manually or selected from a contacts list, can be associated with a mobile device.","In some implementations, the voting application can separate mobile devices associated with contacts into voting groups. In the example depicted, the user has selected six contacts to receive the ballot. The voting application has divided recipient devices associated with the selected contacts into two voting groups, with mobile devices , , and  in a first group and mobile devices , , and  in a second group. In some implementations, the voting application can separate recipient devices into more than two groups. In some implementations, the voting application can separate recipient devices into uneven voting groups, with one group having more recipient devices than another.","The voting application can select a voting coordinator for each voting group. In the example depicted, the voting application has selected the mobile device  as the voting coordinator for the first group and the mobile device  as the voting coordinator for the second group. In some implementations, the voting application can select voting coordinators randomly. In some implementations, the voting application can select voting coordinators based on past selections of voting coordinators. For example, a voting group may include first and second mobile devices. If the first mobile device has been selected as a voting coordinator during a previous voting coordinator selection process, the voting coordinator can select the second mobile device as a voting coordinator for the current voting coordinator selection process. As another example, a voting group may include first, second, and third mobile devices. The first mobile device may have been previously selected as a voting coordinator five times. The second mobile device may have been previously selected as a voting coordinator three times. The third mobile device may have been previously selected as a voting coordinator eight times. In this example, the second mobile device can be selected as a voting coordinator for the voting group since it has been previously selected as a voting coordinator the least number of times.","In some implementations, the voting application can select voting coordinators based on the messaging plans of the mobile devices in a voting group. For example, a voting group can include a first mobile device with a messaging plan of 500 messages per month, a second mobile device with a messaging plan of 300 messages per month, and a third mobile device with a messaging plan of 1,000 messages per month. The voting application can select the third mobile device as a voting coordinator for the voting group since the third mobile device has a messaging plan that includes more messages than the other mobile devices in the voting group. In some implementations, the voting application can select voting coordinators based on the number of messages that each mobile device in a voting group has available. For example, a voting group can include first, second, and third mobile devices. The first mobile device may have 130 messages left for the month. The second mobile device may have 20 messages left for the month. The third mobile device may have 87 messages left for the month. The voting application can select the first mobile device as a voting coordinator for the voting group since the first mobile device has more messages left to use in the current month than the other mobile devices in the group.","In some implementations, the voting application can select voting coordinators based on one or more relationships between recipients of a ballot. For example, the users of mobile devices in a voting group may all be co-workers. One of the users may be the head of a department. The mobile device belonging to the head of the department may be selected as a voting coordinator since the other recipients may be more willing to view and respond to a message received from the head of the department than a message received from a co-worker.","In some implementations, the voting application can select voting coordinators based on a cost associated with sending a message for each mobile device. For example, a voting group may include first, second, and third mobile devices. The first mobile device may have to pay a fee of $0.10 for each message sent. The second mobile device may have to pay a fee of $0.12 for each message sent. The third mobile device may have to pay a fee of $0.07 for each message sent. The voting application may select the third mobile device as a voting coordinator for the voting group since the third mobile device pays a lower fee for sending messages than the other mobile devices in the voting group. In some implementations, the voting application can separate the voting groups into subgroups and select a subgroup voting coordinator for each subgroup.","The voting application can create voting inquiry messages that include the ballot to send to the voting coordinators. In addition to the ballot, the voting inquiry messages can include forwarding instructions. The forwarding instructions can indicate to the voting coordinators that the ballot should be forwarded to one or more other mobile devices. For example, the mobile device  can create a voting inquiry message  to send to the mobile device . The voting inquiry message  can include the ballot and forwarding instructions instructing the mobile device  to forward the ballot to the mobile devices  and . In some implementations, the forwarding instructions can instruct a voting coordinator to forward the ballot and additional forwarding instructions to one or more subgroup voting coordinators. The forwarding instructions can indicate subgroup voting coordinators and other subgroup members to allow the voting coordinator to create forwarding instructions for one or more subgroup voting coordinators. In some implementations, the forwarding instructions can instruct a voting coordinator to wait for one or more response messages containing user ballot selections. In some implementations, the forwarding instructions can instruct a voting coordinator to compile the user ballot selections contained in one or more response messages with a ballot selection made by a user of the voting coordinator device into a single response message. The forwarding instructions can instruct the voting coordinator to send the single response message to a mobile device that sent the voting inquiry message that included the forwarding instructions.","The mobile device  can send a voting inquiry message to the voting coordinators. In some implementations, the mobile device  can send the voting inquiry messages as text messages using Short Message Service (SMS) protocol. The voting application can present the received ballot to the user of the mobile device  and may allow the user to select one of the options from the ballot.","The mobile device  and the mobile device , acting as voting coordinators, can each receive a voting inquiry message that includes the ballot from the mobile device . For example, the mobile device  can receive the voting inquiry message . A voting application running on the mobile device  can determine that the voting inquiry message  includes forwarding instructions and extract the forwarding instructions from the voting inquiry message . The forwarding instructions can indicate additional mobile devices to which the mobile device  should forward the ballot. Additionally, the forwarding instructions can indicate if one or more of the additional mobile devices are subgroup voting coordinators and indicate forwarding instructions that should be sent to the subgroup voting coordinators. In the example depicted, the forwarding instructions included in the voting inquiry message  can indicate that the mobile device  should forward the ballot to the mobile devices  and . The mobile device  can create voting inquiry messages to send to the mobile devices  and  that include the ballot. The mobile device  can then send the voting inquiry messages to the mobile devices  and .","In some implementations, a voting coordinator for a voting group may separate the remaining mobile devices in the voting group into one or more subgroups and select subgroup voting coordinators for each of the subgroups. For example, a voting group can include a total of five mobile devices. A voting coordinator for the voting group can separate the other four mobile devices in the voting group into to subgroups of two devices each. The voting coordinator can select a subgroup voting coordinator for each subgroup. The voting coordinator can send a voting inquiry message that includes the ballot and additional forwarding instructions to one or more of the subgroup voting coordinators.","The mobile device  can present a received ballot to a user. The voting application running on the mobile device  can include a GUI that allows the user to select one of the options presented as part of the ballot. In some implementations, the voting application can wait to receive responses from the mobile devices  and  after the user of the mobile device  has selected one of the presented options.","The mobile devices  and  can receive the forwarded voting inquiry messages from the mobile device . A voting application running on each of the mobile devices  and  can present the ballot to a user of each of the mobile devices. Each user can then vote for one of the options presented in the ballot and the mobile devices  and  can send response messages that include the users' selections to the mobile device . For example, the mobile device  can receive a voting inquiry message that includes a ballot from the mobile device . A voting application running on the mobile device  can present the ballot to a user. The ballot can provide several options for a restaurant to have dinner. The user can select one of the restaurants, and the mobile device  can send a response message to the mobile device  indicating the user's selection.","In another example, the mobile device  may be a subgroup voting coordinator for a subgroup. In this example, the mobile device  can send voting inquiry messages including the ballot to one or more other mobile devices as directed by forwarding instructions received from the mobile device . The mobile device  can present the ballot to a user and allow the user to make a selection. The mobile device  can wait for responses from the mobile devices to which the mobile device  had forwarded the ballot. The mobile device  can send a response message to the mobile device  that includes the selection of the user of the mobile device  and the selections of users of the mobile devices to which the mobile device  had forwarded the ballot.","The mobile device  can receive response messages from the mobile devices  and . In some implementations, a voting coordinator will only receive response messages from mobile devices to which the voting coordinator sent a voting inquiry message. For example, in some implementations, the mobile device  will only receive response messages from the mobile devices  and . In some implementations, a mobile device will only send a response message to a device that sent an voting inquiry message to the mobile device. For example, in some implementations, the mobile device  will only send a response message to the mobile device  in response to receiving a voting inquiry message from the mobile device .","The voting application running on the mobile device  can compile selections indicated in one or more response messages with a selection made by a user of the mobile device  into a single response message and send the single response message to the mobile device . For example, the ballot may present several options for restaurants as depicted. A user of the mobile device  can select M&S Grill, a user of the mobile device  can select Betty's Diner, and a user of the mobile device  can also select Betty's Diner. The mobile device  can send a response message to the mobile device  indicating M&S Grill and the mobile device  can send a response message to the mobile device  indicating Betty's Diner. The voting application running on the mobile device  can create a single response message indicating one vote for M&S Grill and two votes for Betty's Diner and send the single response message to the mobile device .","The mobile device  can forward the ballot to the mobile devices  and , receive response messages from the mobile devices  and , and compile the results in the same manner as described above. The mobile device  can send a single response to the mobile device  indicating the selections of users of the mobile devices , , and .","The mobile device  can receive response messages from the voting coordinator mobile devices  and  and tabulate the response messages to determine which option has won the voting. The voting application running on the mobile device  can determine the winner based on selections indicated in the response messages as well as a selection made by the user of the mobile device . The mobile device  can indicate the winning selection to the other mobile devices in the system .","In some implementations, a mobile device associated with a contact selected or input by the user of the mobile device  may have an unlimited messaging plan. For example, the mobile device  may be associated with a text message plan that allows the mobile device  to send an unlimited number of SMS text messages per month.","The mobile device  can select a mobile device with the unlimited messaging plan as a lone voting coordinator. The mobile device  can send a voting inquiry message including a ballot and forwarding instructions to the lone voting coordinator. The forwarding instructions can direct the lone voting coordinator to send voting inquiry message that include the ballot directly to all of the other mobile devices that have been selected to receive the ballot. For example, the mobile device  may be associated with an unlimited messaging plan. The mobile device  can select the mobile device  as a lone voting coordinator. The mobile device  can send a voting inquiry message to the mobile device  that includes a ballot and forwarding instructions directing the mobile device  to send voting inquiry messages that include the ballot to the rest of the mobile devices. Upon receiving the voting inquiry message, the mobile device  can send voting inquiry messages including the ballot directly to each of the mobile devices , , , , and . Since the lone voting coordinator device is associated with an unlimited messaging plan, the lone voting coordinator does not incur extra charges for sending messages to the rest of the recipient mobile devices.","In some implementations, the mobile device  can send a voting inquiry message to a lone voting coordinator that indicates a ballot option selected by the user of the mobile device  along with the ballot and forwarding instructions. This can allow the lone vote coordinator to tabulate the votes once responses are received from one or more recipient mobile devices and send results messages to the mobile devices, including the mobile device , rather than compiling the selections of the other recipient mobile devices and sending a response message to the mobile device  that indicates all of the selections. In some implementations, the lone voting coordinator can compile all of the votes received from the other mobile devices along with the vote of a user of the lone voting coordinator into a single response message and forward the single response message to the mobile device .","In some implementations, one or more of the recipient mobile devices may not have a voting application installed that is needed for interpreting forwarding instructions and displaying a ballot. For example, the mobile device  may not have a voting application installed. When the mobile device  receives a voting inquiry message that includes a ballot and forwarding instructions from the mobile device , the voting inquiry message may include instructions on how to access and install a voting application for interpreting forwarding instructions and displaying a ballot. The user of the mobile device  can choose whether or not to install the voting application. If the user chooses to install the voting application, the voting application can access the previously received voting inquiry message, display the ballot to the user, and follow any forwarding instructions included in the voting inquiry message.","In some implementations, a mobile device may not be capable of accessing and installing the voting application. This may be because the mobile device is an older model mobile device and is not capable of running the voting application software. If a mobile device does not have, or is incapable of running the voting application, a voting inquiry message received by the mobile device can be presented to the user of the mobile device in a user readable format. In some implementations, the user can respond to the voting inquiry message with a standard message, such as a text message. For example, the mobile device  may not be able to run the voting application. The user of the mobile device can indicate a selection by typing in the selection and sending the selection as a text message. A voting application running on the mobile device  can recognize that the mobile device  has responded with a standard text message instead of a response message formatted to interact with the voting application. The mobile device  can select a different voting coordinator for the voting group that includes the mobile device  to ensure that the ballot reaches all of the intended recipient mobile devices in the voting group. In some implementations, the voting application running on the mobile device  can parse the text response from the mobile device  to extract the user's selection from the text message and incorporate the selection with results received from other mobile devices.","In some implementations, a time limit can be specified in a voting inquiry message. For example, the mobile device  can indicate in the voting inquiry message  that mobile device , acting as a voting coordinator, should wait no more than 30 minutes for response messages from the mobile devices  and . In this example, if the mobile device  is not on or does not receive a voting inquiry message, or if the user of the mobile device  chooses to ignore the voting inquiry message, the selections made by the users of the mobile devices  and  can still be propagated back to the mobile device  and tabulated to determine a winning selection.","In some implementations, the time limit can be automatically set by the voting software based on a time of an event or activity indicated in the ballot. For example, a ballot can include the text \u201cDinner at 8:00, where should we go?\u201d If the current time is 6:00 pm, the voting application can set a time limit of 60 minutes so that a winning option can be selected an hour before dinner to allow the recipients of the ballot adequate time to prepare for dinner. In some implementations, the user of the mobile device  can manually indicate a time limit.","In some implementations, if the mobile device  does not receive a response from a voting coordinator within a specified time, the mobile device  can select another mobile device from the same voting group as a new voting coordinator. This ensures that the ballot is sent to all of the intended recipients. For example, the mobile device  may initially select the mobile device  as a voting coordinator and send a voting inquiry message that includes a ballot and forwarding instructions to the mobile device . The mobile device  may be turned off, out of service range, or have voting software disabled. If the mobile device  does not receive a response from the mobile device  within a specified time, the mobile device  can select the mobile device  as a new voting coordinator for the voting group. The mobile device  can send a voting inquiry message that includes the ballot and forwarding instructions to the mobile device . The forwarding instructions can direct the mobile device  to forward the ballot to the mobile device . The specified time can be set in a manner as described above.","In some implementations, a recipient mobile device can include additional information in a response message that includes a vote of a user of the recipient mobile device. The additional information can include details of a messaging plan associated with the recipient mobile device. For example, the mobile device  can send a response message to the mobile device  that indicates that the mobile device  has a messaging plan that allows for 1,000 messages to be sent in a month. In another example, the mobile device  can send a response message to the mobile device  that indicates that the mobile device  has 27 messages available to use for the remainder of the month.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIGS. 1A and 1B"],"b":["100","100","102","100","102","100","102","102"]},"The mobile device  can propagate the results of the vote to the other mobile devices in the system . In some implementations, the mobile device  can select one or more new voting coordinators from each of the previously determined voting groups. For example, the voting application can select the mobile devices  and  as new voting coordinators. In some implementations, the voting application can determine one or more new voting groups and select one or more new voting coordinators from each of the new voting groups. For example, when sending out voting inquiry messages, a first group may have contained mobile devices that did not respond with voting response messages, possibly because the mobile devices were powered down or out of service range. The mobile device  can select new voting groups so that each of the new voting groups includes at least one mobile device that provided a response message in response to a voting inquiry message. One or more previously responsive devices from each of the new voting groups can be selected as a new voting coordinator. This can increase the probability that a results message is forwarded to all of the intended recipient mobile devices.","In some implementations, the voting application running on the mobile device  can verify that the new voting coordinators have the voting application installed and responded to the originally sent voting inquiry. For example, if the mobile device did not send a response message in response to a voting inquiry message, the mobile device  can avoid selecting the mobile device  as a new voting coordinator for the first voting group. In another example, the mobile device  may have responded to a voting inquiry message with a standard text message, indicating that the mobile device does not have a voting application installed. The mobile device  can avoid selecting the mobile device  as a new voting coordinator for the second voting group because the mobile device  may not have the ability to interpret and execute forwarding instructions. Verifying that new voting coordinators have the voting application installed and responded to the originally sent voting inquiry message can increase the probability that a results message is forwarded to all of the intended recipient mobile devices.","The mobile device  can create a results message. The results message can include the results of the vote and forwarding instructions. The mobile device  can send the results message to the new voting coordinators. For example, the mobile device  can send a results message that includes forwarding instructions that indicates Betty's diner as the winning selection to the mobile device . The forwarding instructions can indicate that the mobile device  should forward the results to the mobile device  and the mobile device .","The new voting coordinators can receive a results message that includes voting results and forwarding instructions from the mobile device . A new voting coordinator can extract forwarding instructions from the results message and forward the results to additional mobile devices. For example, the mobile device  can extract forwarding instructions from a results message received from the mobile device . The forwarding instructions can indicate that the mobile device  should forward the results to the mobile devices  and . In some implementations the results message can include no forwarding instructions.","In some implementations, a new voting coordinator can define one or more subgroups and one or more subgroup voting coordinators. In some implementations, forwarding instructions included in a results message received by a new voting coordinator can specify one or more subgroups and one or more subgroup voting coordinators. The new voting coordinator can send a results message that includes the results and additional forwarding instructions to subgroup voting coordinators.","A new voting coordinator can present the results of the vote to a user of the new voting coordinator. Mobile devices that have received a results message from a new voting coordinator or subgroup voting coordinator can present the results of the vote to users.","By selecting a new voting coordinator for a voting group, the voting application can more evenly distribute the cost of sending messages among the mobile devices in the voting group. For example, following the example shown in , the mobile device  can be chosen as the original voting coordinator for the first voting group. As described previously, the mobile device  can send two voting inquiry messages to the mobile devices  and  and can send one response message that includes user selections to the mobile device , for a total of three messages. The mobile device  can be selected as a new voting coordinator for the first voting group. The mobile device  can send one response message to the mobile device  when the mobile device  is acting as the original voting coordinator. Additionally, the mobile device  can send two results messages to the mobile devices  and  when the mobile device  is acting as the new voting coordinator. In an implementation in which mobile devices are charged for each message sent, the users of the mobile devices  and  would each be charged for three messages in this example.","Comparing this example to an implementation in which the same mobile device is chosen as both the original and new voting coordinator demonstrates that the cost of propagating voting inquiry messages, response messages, and results messages among the mobile devices in a voting group can be more evenly distributed when a new voting coordinator is selected so as to be different from an originally selected voting coordinator. For example, in an implementation in which the same mobile device is chosen as both the original and new voting coordinator for a voting group that includes three mobile devices, the voting coordinator device sends a total of 5 messages while the other mobile devices in the voting group each send 1 message. This much less evenly distributes the cost of sending messages among mobile devices in a voting group than an implementation in which a new voting coordinator is selected so as to be different from an originally selected voting coordinator.","In the example depicted in , the mobile device  sends a total of four messages, the mobile devices , ,  and  each send a total of three messages, and the mobile devices  and  each send one message. Additionally, the mobile device  receives a total of two messages, the mobile devices  and  each receive a total of four messages, and the mobile devices , ,  and  each receive a total of two messages. In implementations in which the mobile devices in the system  incur a charge for each message sent and received, the above described process can more evenly distribute the cost of propagating voting inquiry messages, response messages, and results messages among the mobile devices. In an implementation in which the mobile device  sends voting inquiry messages and results messages directly to the recipient mobile devices in the system  and the recipient mobile devices send response messages directly to the mobile device , the mobile device  would send a total of 12 messages and receive a total of six messages while the recipient mobile devices would send a total of one message each and receive a total of two messages each.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","204","206","202","206","208","202","206","210"]},"The GUI  can allow the user to input information for creating a voting ballot. For example, the user can input a question, and input one or more options for others to choose from. The voting application  can include a ballot generator  for creating one or more ballots using information input by the user. The GUI  can display a ballot generated by the ballot generator  to the user and allow the user to vote by selecting an option listed as part of the ballot.","The voting application  can access a contact list  of the mobile device . The voting application  can allow the user to select one or more contacts from the contact list  to receive a ballot generated by the ballot generator . In some implementations, the voting application  can allow the user to manually input one or more contacts to receive a ballot. Each contact, whether selected from the contact list  or input manually by the user, can be associated with a recipient mobile device.","The voting application  can include a grouping module . The grouping module  can separate intended recipients into one or more voting groups as described above with reference to . In some implementations, the grouping module  can separate voting groups into subgroups. The grouping module  can select one or more voting coordinators for a voting group. In some implementations, the grouping module  can select one or more subgroup voting coordinators for a sub group.","The voting application  can create a voting inquiry message that includes a ballot generated by the ballot generator  and forwarding instructions. The forwarding instructions can instruct voting coordinator mobile devices to forward the ballot to other mobile devices in a voting group. The voting application  can access an input\/output interface  of the mobile device  to transmit the voting inquiry message to voting coordinator mobile devices. In some implementations, the voting inquiry message can be transmitted as an SMS text message. The voting application  can also access the input\/output interface  to receive response messages.","The voting application  can include a tabulator  for determining a result of a vote. The tabulator can extract selections made by users of recipient mobile devices from response messages. The tabulator can also access a selection made by the user of the mobile device . The tabulator  can tabulate the selections to determine a winning selection. The voting application  can create a results message that indicates a winning selection as determined by the tabulator . The voting application  can access the input\/output interface  to transmit the results message to recipient mobile devices.","The mobile device  can include a processor  for executing application code and performing instructions. The mobile device  can include memory  for storing the contact list , program code, user input, and other program data. The mobile device  can include additional applications  that can be related or unrelated to the voting application . For example, a photo application may allow a user of the mobile device  to include a photo or graphic in a ballot generated using the ballot generator . In another example, a web browser may allow the user to look up restaurants listed on a ballot and include web links in the ballot.","The mobile device  can transmit a voting inquiry message . The voting inquiry message  can include a ballot, for example, a ballot generated by the ballot generator . The ballot can include an inquiry and a number of options for users of recipient mobile devices to select. The voting inquiry message  can also include forwarding instructions. The forwarding instructions can instruct voting coordinator mobile devices to forward the ballot to other mobile devices in a voting group. The forwarding instructions can also include subgroup and subgroup voting coordinator information.","The voting inquiry message  can be received by a relay device  such as, for example, a cell phone tower. In some implementations, the relay device  can relay the voting inquiry message  to another relay device such as, for example, a second cell phone tower, or a satellite. The voting inquiry message  is transmitted to one or more recipient mobile devices via the relay device  or another relay device.
