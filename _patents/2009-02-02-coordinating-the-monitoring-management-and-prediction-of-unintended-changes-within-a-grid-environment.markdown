A grid change controller within a particular grid environment detects an unintended change within that grid environment. In particular, grid change controller monitors potential change indicators received from multiple disparate resource managers across the grid environment, where each resource manage manages a selection of resources within the grid environment.

No. 11\/031,541, filed Jan. 6, 2005, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","1. Technical Field","The present invention relates in general to improved grid computing and in particular to coordinating overall grid environment error management. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to coordinating the monitoring, management, and prediction of unintended changes within a grid environment.","2. Description of the Related Art","Ever since the first connection was made between two computer systems, new ways of transferring data, resources, and other information between two computer systems via a connection continue to develop. In typical network architectures, when two computer systems are exchanging data via a connection, one of the computer systems is considered a client sending requests and the other is considered a server processing the requests and returning results. In an effort to increase the speed at which requests are handled, server systems continue to expand in size and speed. Further, in an effort to handle peak periods when multiple requests are arriving every second, server systems are often joined together as a group and requests are distributed among the grouped servers. Multiple methods of grouping servers have developed such as clustering, multi-system shared data (sysplex) environments, and enterprise systems. With a cluster of servers, one server is typically designated to manage distribution of incoming requests and outgoing responses. The other servers typically operate in parallel to handle the distributed requests from clients. Thus, one of multiple servers in a cluster may service a client request without the client detecting that a cluster of servers is processing the request.","Typically, servers or groups of servers operate on a particular network platform, such as Unix or some variation of Unix, and provide a hosting environment for running applications. Each network platform may provide functions ranging from database integration, clustering services, and security to workload management and problem determination. Each network platform typically offers different implementations, semantic behaviors, and application programming interfaces (APIs).","Merely grouping servers together to expand processing power, however, is a limited method of improving efficiency of response times in a network. Thus, increasingly, within a company network, rather than just grouping servers, servers and groups of server systems are organized as distributed resources. There is an increased effort to collaborate, share data, share cycles, and improve other modes of interaction among servers within a company network and outside the company network. Further, there is an increased effort to outsource nonessential elements from one company network to that of a service provider network. Moreover, there is a movement to coordinate resource sharing between resources that are not subject to the same management system, but still address issues of security, policy, payment, and membership. For example, resources on an individual's desktop are not typically subject to the same management system as resources of a company server cluster. Even different administrative groups within a company network may implement distinct management systems.","The problems with decentralizing the resources available from servers and other computing systems operating on different network platforms, located in different regions, with different security protocols and each controlled by a different management system, has led to the development of Grid technologies using open standards for operating a grid environment. Grid environments support the sharing and coordinated use of diverse resources in dynamic, distributed, virtual organizations. A virtual organization is created within a grid environment when a selection of resources, from geographically distributed systems operated by different organizations with differing policies and management systems, is organized to handle a job request.","While the open standards defining grid technology facilitate sharing and coordination of diverse resources in dynamic, distributed, virtual organizations, grid standards do not solve all of the problems associated with linking resources with different policies and management systems. In particular, one problem associated with linking resources with different policies and management systems is that each set of resources may detect errors and respond to errors in a different way, if at all. This problem is further compounded when a grid job is distributed among resources managed by different management systems, where each management system may respond to errors in a different way.","Ultimately, the problem of lack of consistency in detecting and managing errors and other changes across a grid environment affects the ability of a grid environment to meet promised performance and quality of service for a grid job because there is not error recovery coordination between the different management systems and there is not a consistent standard for error detection and recovery across the different management systems. In view of the foregoing, there is a need for a centralized grid service that coordinates the monitoring, management, and prediction of not only resource errors, but other unintended changes within the grid environment that effect grid jobs. In particular, there is a need for a grid service enabled to communicate with the resource management systems distributed across the grid environment to monitor unintended changes and coordinate error recovery.","In view of the foregoing, the present invention in general provides for improved grid computing and in particular to coordinating overall grid environment change management. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to coordinating the monitoring, management, and prediction of unintended changes within a grid environment.","In one embodiment, a grid change controller detects an unintended change within the grid environment. In particular, grid change controller monitors potential change indicators received from multiple disparate resource managers across the grid environment, where each resource manage manages a selection of resources within the grid environment. The grid change controller then determines a necessary response to the unintended change within the grid environment and communicates with at least one independent manager within the grid environment to resolve the unintended change, such that the grid change controller facilitates recovery from the unintended change within the grid environment to maintain performance requirements within the grid environment.","In one example, a potential change indicator includes an error in a network layer, an infrastructure layer, or an application layer. In another example, potential change indicator includes an indicator of an unexpected change in a resource configuration of a selection of resources within the grid environment. In yet another example, a potential change indicator includes an error within a particular grid job executing within a particular execution environment.","In determining a necessary response to the unintended change within the grid environment, the grid change controller may determine whether a selection from among the independent managers are enabled to independently control recovery of the grid environment from the unintended change, and if so, initiate the recovery process by the selection of independent managers. Alternatively, the grid change controller may determine whether the grid environment will effect a particular grid job and coordinate the recovery process by at least one independent manager to recover a particular execution environment for the particular grid job from the unintended change. Further, the grid change controller may determine whether to renegotiate for additional or new resources for processing a grid job and communicate with the grid job router that controls resource distribution to facilitate recovery from the unintended change. Additionally, grid change controller may communicate with a system administrator to request aid with recovery from the unintended change.","Referring now to the drawings and in particular to , there is depicted one embodiment of a computer system which may be implemented in a grid environment and in which the present invention may be implemented. As will be further described, the grid environment includes multiple computer systems managed to provide resources. Additionally, as will be further described, the present invention may be executed in a variety of computer systems, including a variety of computing systems, mobile systems, and electronic devices operating under a number of different operating systems managed within a grid environment.","In one embodiment, computer system  includes a bus  or other device for communicating information within computer system , and at least one processing device such as processor , coupled to bus  for processing information. Bus  may include low-latency and higher latency paths connected by bridges and adapters and controlled within computer system  by multiple bus controllers. When implemented as a server system, computer system  typically includes multiple processors designed to improve network servicing power.","Processor  may be a general-purpose processor such as IBM's PowerPC\u2122 processor that, during normal operation, processes data under the control of operating system and application software accessible from a dynamic storage device such as random access memory (RAM)  and a static storage device such as Read Only Memory (ROM) . The operating system may provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to the user. In one embodiment, application software contains machine executable instructions that when executed on processor  carry out the operations depicted in the flowcharts of  and others operations described herein. Alternatively, the steps of the present invention might be performed by specific hardware components that contain hardwired logic for performing the steps, or by any combination of programmed computer components and custom hardware components.","The present invention may be provided as a computer program product, included on a machine-readable medium having stored thereon the machine executable instructions used to program computer system  to perform a process according to the present invention. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d as used herein includes any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor  or other components of computer system  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Common forms of non-volatile media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, a hard disk, magnetic tape or any other magnetic medium, a compact disc ROM (CD-ROM) or any other optical medium, punch cards or any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a programmable ROM (PROM), an erasable PROM (EPROM), electrically EPROM (EEPROM), a flash memory, any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other medium from which computer system  can read and which is suitable for storing instructions. In the present embodiment, an example of a non-volatile medium is mass storage device  which as depicted is an internal component of computer system , but will be understood to also be provided by an external device. Volatile media include dynamic memory such as RAM . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire or fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio frequency or infrared data communications.","Moreover, the present invention may be downloaded as a computer program product, wherein the program instructions may be transferred from a remote virtual resource, such as a virtual resource , to requesting computer system  by way of data signals embodied in a carrier wave or other propagation medium via a network link  (e.g. a modem or network connection) to a communications interface  coupled to bus . Virtual resource  may include a virtual representation of the resources accessible from a single system or systems, wherein multiple systems may each be considered discrete sets of resources operating on independent platforms, but coordinated as a virtual resource by a grid manager. Communications interface  provides a two-way data communications coupling to network link  that may be connected, for example, to a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that provide access to network . In particular, network link  may provide wired and\/or wireless network communications to one or more networks, such as network , through which use of virtual resources, such as virtual resource , is accessible as provided within a grid environment . Grid environment  may be part of multiple types of networks, including a peer-to-peer network, or may be part of a single computer system, such as computer system .","As one example, network  may refer to the worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use a particular protocol, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), to communicate with one another. Network  uses electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link  and through communication interface , which carry the digital data to and from computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information. It will be understood that alternate types of networks, combinations of networks, and infrastructures of networks may be implemented.","When implemented as a server system, computer system  typically includes multiple communication interfaces accessible via multiple peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus bridges connected to an input\/output controller. In this manner, computer system  allows connections to multiple network computers.","Additionally, although not depicted, multiple peripheral components and internal\/external devices may be added to computer system , connected to multiple controllers, adapters, and expansion slots coupled to one of the multiple levels of bus . For example, a display device, audio device, keyboard, or cursor control device may be added as a peripheral component.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware depicted in  may vary. Furthermore, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the depicted example is not meant to imply architectural limitations with respect to the present invention.","With reference now to , a block diagram illustrates one embodiment of the general types of components within a grid environment. In the present example, the components of a grid environment  include a client system  interfacing with a grid management system  which interfaces with server clusters , servers , workstations and desktops , data storage systems , and networks . For purposes of illustration, the network locations and types of networks connecting the components within grid environment  are not depicted. It will be understood, however, that the components within grid environment  may reside atop a network infrastructure architecture that may be implemented with multiple types of networks overlapping one another. Network infrastructure may range from multiple large enterprise systems to a peer-to-peer system to a single computer system. Further, it will be understood that the components within grid environment  are merely representations of the types of components within a grid environment. A grid environment may simply be encompassed in a single computer system or may encompass multiple enterprises of systems.","It will be understood that grid environment  may be provided by a grid vendor, where a cost for use of resources within grid environment  may be calculated based on the amount of time required for a grid job to execute or the actual amount of resources used, for example. In addition, it will be understood that grid environment  may include grid resources supplied by a single grid vendor, such as a particular business enterprise, or multiple vendors, where each vendor continues to monitor and manage the vendor's group of resources, but grid management system  is able to monitor unintended changes across all the resources, regardless of which vendors provide which resources. Further, it will be understood that although resource discovery mechanisms for discovering available grid resources are not depicted, client system  or grid management system  may discover grid resources advertised from local and global directories available within and outside of grid environment .","The central goal of a grid environment, such as grid environment  is organization and delivery of resources from multiple discrete systems viewed as virtual resource . Client system , server clusters , servers , workstations and desktops , data storage systems , networks  and the systems creating grid management system  may be heterogeneous and regionally distributed with independent management systems, but enabled to exchange information, resources, and services through a grid infrastructure enabled by grid management system . Further, server clusters , servers , workstations and desktops , data storage systems , and networks  may be geographically distributed across countries and continents or locally accessible to one another.","In the example, client system  interfaces with grid management system . Client system  may represent any computing system sending requests to grid management system . In particular, client system  may send virtual job requests (or requests for a quote (RFQs) and jobs to grid management system . Further, while in the present embodiment client system  is depicted as accessing grid environment  with a request, in alternate embodiments client system  may also operate within grid environment .","While the systems within virtual resource  are depicted in parallel, in reality, the systems may be part of a hierarchy of systems where some systems within virtual resource  may be local to client system , while other systems require access to external networks. Additionally, it is important to note, that systems depicted within virtual resources  may be physically encompassed within client system .","To implement grid environment , grid management system  facilitates grid services. Grid services may be designed according to multiple architectures, including, but not limited to, the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA). In particular, grid management system  refers to the management environment which creates a grid by linking computing systems into a heterogeneous network environment characterized by sharing of resources through grid services.","According to an advantage of the invention, grid management system  may include a centralized grid change manager, as will be further described, that monitors grid environment  for potential indicators of unintended changes within grid environment , determines whether it is necessary to resolve an unintended change within grid environment , attempts to resolve the unintended changes within the grid environment by communicating with other modules within the grid environment, and performs predictive analysis of the reliability of grid environment  to handle grid jobs, wherein the policies used to accept grid jobs may be adjusted based on the reliability factors in an attempt to avoid detrimental unintended changes in grid environment .","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrates one example of an architecture that may be implemented in a grid environment. As depicted, an architecture  includes multiple layers of functionality. As will be further described, the present invention is a process which may be implemented in one or more layers of an architecture, such as architecture , which is implemented in a grid environment, such as the grid environment described in . It is important to note that architecture  is just one example of an architecture that may be implemented in a grid environment and in which the present invention may be implemented. Further, it is important to note that multiple architectures may be implemented within a grid environment.","Within the layers of architecture , first, a physical and logical resources layer  organizes the resources of the systems in the grid. Physical resources include, but are not limited to, servers, storage media, and networks. The logical resources virtualize and aggregate the physical layer into usable resources such as operating systems, processing power, memory, I\/O processing, file systems, database managers, directories, memory managers, and other resources.","Next, a web services layer  provides an interface between grid services  and physical and logical resources . Web services layer  implements service interfaces including, but not limited to, Web Services Description Language (WSDL), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and eXtensible mark-up language (XML) executing atop an Internet Protocol (IP) or other network transport layer. Further, the Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OSGI) standard  builds on top of current web services  by extending web services  to provide capabilities for dynamic and manageable Web services required to model the resources of the grid. In particular, by implementing OGSI standard  with web services , grid services  designed using OGSA are interoperable. In alternate embodiments, other infrastructures or additional infrastructures may be implemented a top web services layer .","Grid services layer  includes multiple services, that implemented together, may perform part of the management services provide by grid management system . For example, grid services layer  may include grid services designed using OGSA, such that a uniform standard is implemented in creating grid services. Alternatively, grid services may be designed under multiple architectures. Grid services can be grouped into four main functions. It will be understood, however, that other functions may be performed by grid services.","First, a resource management service  manages the use of the physical and logical resources. Resources may include, but are not limited to, processing resources, memory resources, and storage resources. Management of these resources includes scheduling jobs, distributing jobs, and managing the retrieval of the results for jobs. Resource management service  monitors resource loads and distributes jobs to less busy parts of the grid to balance resource loads and absorb unexpected peaks of activity. In particular, a user may specify preferred performance levels so that resource management service  distributes jobs to maintain the preferred performance levels within the grid.","Second, information services  manages the information transfer and communication between computing systems within the grid. Since multiple communication protocols may be implemented, information services  manages communications across multiple networks utilizing multiple types of communication protocols.","Third, a data management service  manages data transfer and storage within the grid. In particular, data management service  may move data to nodes within the grid where a job requiring the data will execute. A particular type of transfer protocol, such as Grid File Transfer Protocol (GridFTP), may be implemented.","Finally, a security service  applies a security protocol for security at the connection layers of each of the systems operating within the grid. Security service  may implement security protocols, such as Open Secure Socket Layers (SSL), to provide secure transmissions. Further, security service  may provide a single sign-on mechanism, so that once a user is authenticated, a proxy certificate is created and used when performing actions within the grid for the user.","Multiple services may work together to provide several key functions of a grid computing system. In a first example, computational tasks are distributed within a grid. Data management service  may divide up a computation task into separate grid services requests of packets of data that are then distributed by and managed by resource management service . The results are collected and consolidated by data management system . In a second example, the storage resources across multiple computing systems in the grid are viewed as a single virtual data storage system managed by data management service  and monitored by resource management service .","An applications layer  includes applications that use one or more of the grid services available in grid services layer . Advantageously, applications interface with the physical and logical resources  via grid services layer  and web services , such that multiple heterogeneous systems can interact and interoperate.","With reference now to , there is depicted a block diagram of the components of a grid change manager for monitoring and managing unintended changes within the overall grid environment that may effect grid job performance in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. In particular, grid management system  may include a grid change manager . Grid change manager monitors grid environment  to detect potential indicators of unintended changes and then coordinates resolution of the unintended changes in an effort to maintain the expected performance of a particular grid job within grid environment . Unintended changes may include, but are not limited to, errors and exceptions detected within the network, infrastructure, and application layers within grid environment , unexpected changes in the grid resource configuration within grid environment , and errors within the grid job itself executing within grid environment . The overall grid environment may refer to the current state of the configuration and total resource usage within the grid environment and may refer to the status of those resources within a specific execution environment for a grid job.","In particular, grid change manager  includes an environmental change accumulation controller  to coordinate monitoring grid environment  and the jobs executing within grid environment  for unintended changes. In one example, environmental change accumulation controller  may monitor unintended changes in grid environment  by directly monitoring resource usage and job workload within grid environment . In another example, environmental change accumulation controller  may monitor unintended changes in grid environment  by tracking multiple homogeneous and heterogeneous grid modules within grid management system  that monitor and manage grid resources within grid environment .","Environmental change accumulation controller  may track changes at multiple levels within grid environment . In one example, environmental change accumulation controller  may track grid jobs for error conditions which might have occurred at the application, network, or infrastructure level in which the grid job executes. In another example, environment change accumulation controller  may track resources and the configuration of the grid environment as a whole for unintended configuration changes that may effect the grid job executing within grid environment .","In addition, in monitoring and tracking grid environment  and executing grid jobs within grid environment , environmental change accumulation controller  may maintain information that describes the current job workload within grid environment  and the results of the current jobs executing within specific execution environments within grid environment . Current job workload description data  may include, but is not limited to, data such as job execution state, job criticality factors, a job to resource dependency chart, and job input and output data.","Further, environmental change accumulation controller  may access and store the current performance and quality of service agreements for grid environment  and the job description and request for quote agreed to for the job from other modules and databases within grid environment . Environmental change accumulation controller  stores all gathered data in a historical reliability analysis database  for use by a predictive analysis controller  in predicting the reliability of grid environment .","In addition, grid change manager  includes an autonomic coordination controller . Autonomic coordination controller  determines whether an autonomic manager of a job execution environment within grid environment  can manage error recovery of detected unintended changes. In particular, grid change manager  may maintain an autonomic manager database  that describes the available autonomic managers and the management range within grid environment  of each autonomic manager. As will be further described with reference to , autonomic managers within grid management system  may manage the detection and recovery from unintended changes, and in particular errors, detected within a particular execution environment within grid environment . Thus, autonomic coordination controller  may act as an intermediary that passes unintended change information between an autonomic manager of an execution environment and other modules within grid management system  that detect changing conditions within grid environment  that may effect the execution environment managed by the autonomic manager. In another example, autonomic coordination controller  may specifically direct an autonomic manager to respond to and resolve the unintended change.","If grid change manager  determines an autonomic manager cannot correct an unintended change within grid environment , grid change manager  initiates a change determination controller  to handle resolution of the unintended change if necessary. First, change determination controller  determines whether an unintended change will affect any particular grid job executing, thus making a determination whether any error recovery is necessary. In particular, change determination controller  may access the performance and quality of service requirements for the grid environment and may also access the current request for quote (RFQ) information for the job to determine if the unintended change will effect promised performance and quality of service by the grid environmental overall or will effect the specific performance requirements specified in the RFQ for the job. In one example, an RFQ is the request, by the client, describing the performance and workload specifications for a grid job. When a grid environment agrees to the RFQ for the grid job, then the grid environment may agree to maintain certain performance and quality of service requirements for the grid job during execution.","If change determination controller  determines that an unintended change will affect a particular currently executing grid job, then change determination controller  will identify the grid state and the dependencies of a particular job. As previously described, environmental change accumulation controller  may maintain grid state and dependencies in job workload description database . In addition, when change determination controller  identifies an unintended change that will affect a particular grid job performance, change determination controller  may access additional grid state and dependency information. Grid state may indicate grid usage including, but not limited to, percentage of resources in use, other unintended changes currently being processed, on-demand resources available, current jobs executing, future jobs waiting to execute, and other data that indicates the functional state of grid environment . Dependency information may indicate job dependencies including, but not limited to, resource usage dependencies, data usage dependencies, related job dependencies, and other requirements that will hinder a grid job from completion if not maintained or met. In one example, a grid job includes a batch of transactions, the results of which are required for a final transaction to be completed, such that related job dependencies are created.","Next, change determination controller  may communicate with the grid autonomic managers to determine if one or more of the autonomic managers can recover from the grid change. If one or more of the autonomic managers cannot recover from the grid change, then a resource negotiation controller  may coordinate with a grid router to allocate resources for a grid job to resolve the unintended change that affects the grid job. In one example, a grid router is responsible for receiving RFQs for a job and determining which resources will satisfy that request. In another example, responsive to receiving an RFQ, the grid router may request access to additional resources outside grid environment  for handling a particular job in the form of an RFQ. For example, grid router may send an RFQ to another grid computing farm requesting a sale of a particular type of grid resource for the time period remaining to complete a grid job that the grid router promised to complete within a particular period of time.","An administration coordination controller  within grid change manager  determines whether to update a system administrator with the unintended changes within grid environment . In one example, multiple system administrators may have access to adjust selections of the resources and resource characteristics within grid environment . In particular, administration coordination controller  may determine whether an unintended change is of a sufficient complexity or impact that notifying a system administrator of the unintended change within grid environment  is necessary. For example, administration coordination controller  may determine to always alert a system administrator able to reconfigure network resources any time a network resource related unintended change is detected.","A predictive analysis controller  within grid change manager  may predict future unintended changes in grid environment  and may predict the reliability of grid environment  based on monitored grid operational history. Based on the predicted reliability of grid environment , the business policies used for determining whether grid environment  can handle a grid job or will accept a grid job may be adjusted to compensate for the predicted reliability of grid environment  to handle the grid job. It will be understood that predictive analysis controller  may also operate independent of grid change manager  and may perform predictive analysis of different ranges of grid environments from a particular execution environment to multiple independent grid environments.","First, predictive analysis controller  monitors whether grid jobs are completed according to the performance and quality of service promised for each grid job. In addition, predictive analysis controller  monitors when unintended changes arise and monitors whether and how each unintended change is resolved. As previously described, grid change manager  may initiate environmental change accumulation controller  to monitor for unintended changes and then may initiate autonomic coordination controller , change determination controller , resource negotiation controller , and administrative coordination controller  to attempt to resolve the unintended change in grid environment .","Second, predictive analysis controller  calculates a reliability factor based upon previous reliability and based upon the monitored unintended changes and reliability of the grid environment in meeting performance and quality of service promises. In particular, the reliability factor may be effected monitored historic job execution data, event data, environmental data, and job criticality factors. In one example, predictive analysis controller  determines that grid environment  has a low reliability factor for handling grid jobs requiring database processing because the last ten jobs requiring database processing were not executed within the promised completion time because of a repetitive error. Based on the reliability factor for handling grid jobs requiring database processing, predictive analysis controller  may recommend changing business policies for grid environment  to avoid or redirect grid jobs requiring database processing until a system administrator or autonomic modules is able to correct the repetitive error.","Referring now to , there is depicted a block diagram of an example of a grid change manager interacting with other grid modules within a grid environment to detect and manage changes within the grid environment in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, grid management system  includes multiple modules, including a grid change manager . In the example, grid change manager  communicates with multiple disparate grid modules to monitor and manage changes within grid environment . It is important to note that each of the grid modules described within grid management system  may be viewed as logical representations of multiple physical instances of each grid module. In addition, it is important to note that additional adapters, mappers, and other conversion mechanisms, although not depicted, may be included within grid management system  to enable grid change manager  to receive and send communications using multiple, disparate protocols, data types, and network layers.","In one example, grid change manager  communicates with grid policy manager  to access the policy applied within grid environment  by grid management system . Grid policy may include, for example, business policies for determining whether to accept grid jobs and determining whether to farm out grid jobs to other grid environments and performance policies for directing performance and quality of service requirements for grid environment .","In addition, grid change manager  communicates with grid policy manager  to redirect the policy applied within grid environment  based on reliability factors calculated by predictive analysis controller . Grid change manager  may redirect policy within grid policy manager  as applied, for example, to a current grid job execution environment, to a future grid job execution environment, or to the overall grid environment.","Grid change manager  may initiate change recovery workflows by grid automatic managers . Grid autonomic managers  may include multiple change management and recovery management agents within grid environment . In one example, grid autonomic managers  include grid network managers that continuously monitor the network status of the multiple networks incorporated into grid environment  to detect network events indicating that action is needed. In another example, grid autonomic managers  include a resource usage manage that monitors all the resources within grid environment  during job execution and resource utilization to detect when resources need to be reallocated or additional resources are needed.","In addition, grid change manager  communicates with a grid functional verification agent . Grid functional verification agent  performs testing and verification of security compliance of each resource within grid environment  before the resource is allocated for a specific job execution.","Grid change manager  also communicates with grid performance and monitoring agents . Grid performance and monitoring agents  include multiple controllers, grid modules, and managing agents distributed within grid management system  to monitor and manage grid resources. In particular, grid performance and monitoring agents  may include multiple disparate types of monitoring and managing agents that communicate in multiple disparate protocols and manage and monitor resources at different architectural levels. For example, one grid monitoring agent may monitor a particular type of network resources, while another grid monitoring agent may monitor a particular type of software resource. Advantageously, grid change manager  is enabled to detect and map communications received and sent to the disparate types of grid performance and monitoring agents , regardless of the protocol or layer of monitoring and managing.","In addition, grid change manager  communicates with a grid job routing manager . Grid job routing manager  may determine how to route jobs within grid management system  and also manage grid job queuing, grid job scheduling, and compilation of a result for a grid job. In addition, grid job routing manager  may receive requests for a bid for a grid job in the form of an RFQ, determine whether the resources within grid environment  can process the grid job, and return an offer to process the grid job. Further, if an unintended change that affects a grid job is detected, grid job routing manager  and grid change manager  may communicate to re-negotiate the RFQ with the client requesting the grid job or with an outside grid resource farm providing resources.","Grid change manager  may distribute change conditions and resolution requests to administrative modules . In addition, grid change manager  may distribute predictive reliability factors of grid environment  to administrative modules . Administrative modules  may include both autonomic and human administrator controlled systems that enable administrative control over the configuration of at least portions of the resources within grid environment .","With reference now to , there is depicted a block diagram of a high level logic flowchart of a process and program for performing predictive analysis to predict reliability factors for a grid environment in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, the process starts at block  and thereafter proceeds to block . Block  depicts accumulating overall actual grid performance and specific grid job performance data. Next, block  depicts accumulating unintended changes data. Thereafter, block  depicts monitoring the recovery results achieved when the grid change manager responds to unintended changes data. Next, block  depicts comparing the actual grid performance and specific job performance with grid policies, performance agreements, and quality of service agreements for the grid environment in view of the unintended changes and recovery results achieved in respond to the unintended changes and in view of the historical performance and reliability factors. Next, block  depicts calculating multiple current reliability factors and predicted impacts on the overall grid environment and the specific execution environments based on the comparisons. Thereafter, block  depicts determining recommended grid policy changes based on the calculated reliability factors. Then, block  depicts updating the administrator and grid policy modules with the reliability factors and recommended policy changes, and the process ends.","Referring now to , there is depicted a high level logic flowchart of a process and program for coordinating change recovery through multiple modules within a grid environment in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As illustrated, the process starts at block  and thereafter proceeds to block . Block  depicts a grid change manager analyzing each of the current grid job execution environments. Next, block  depicts a determination whether there is an unintended change in a grid job execution environment. If there is not an unintended change detected within a grid job execution environment, then the process continues and returns to block . If there is an unintended change detected within a grid job execution environment, then the process passes to block .","Block  depicts a determination whether the unintended change condition is recoverable by an autonomic manager within the specific grid environment. If the unintended change condition is recoverable by an autonomic manager within the specific grid environment, then the process passes to block . Block  depicts initiating the autonomic engine workflow to handle the unintended change condition, and the process continues to block . Otherwise, at block , if the unintended change condition is not recoverable by an autonomic manager in the specific grid environment, then the process passes to block .","Block  depicts a determination whether the unintended change within the grid environment has any effect on the execution of a grid job. If the unintended change within the grid environment does not have an effect on the execution of a grid job, then the process continues to block . If the unintended change in the grid environment does have an adverse effect on the execution of a grid job, then the process passes to block .","Block  depicts identifying the grid state and grid job resource dependencies associated with the effected grid job. Next, block  depicts coordinating with the grid automatic managers to determine if the autonomic managers can recover from the unintended change. Thereafter, block  depicts a determination whether autonomic managers can control recovery from the unintended change. If the autonomic managers can control recovery from the unintended change, then the process continues to block . Otherwise, if the autonomic managers cannot control recovery from the unintended change, then the process passes to block . Block  depicts coordinating with the grid router for allocating new resources for the job. Next, block  depicts a determination whether a new RFQ is initiated by the router. If a new RFQ is initiated by the router, then the process continues. If a new RFQ is not initiated by the router, then the process passes to block . Block  depicts using the existing RFQ information for renegotiating for resources, and the process continues to block .","It is important to note that while the processes described in  are described with reference to a grid change manager automatically performing the functions of the process, in alternate embodiments, steps within the process may be performed through human intervention.","While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The novel features believed aspect of the invention are set forth in the appended claims.
