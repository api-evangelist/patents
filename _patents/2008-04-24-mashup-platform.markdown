{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO OTHER APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/926,040 entitled AUTOMATIC PAGE LAYOUT filed Apr. 24, 2007 which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","In addition to traditional text-based content, users are increasingly seeking out other forms of relevant content, such as images, videos, and maps. One way that entities such as search companies determine what types of results to provide is to construct whitelists. If the query provided by the user includes a term appearing on a whitelist, then results of the content type for which the whitelist was constructed will be among those returned. For example, a search company might manually maintain a list of celebrities, famous locations, and the names of other things that users might want images of. If a user includes a whitelisted term in a query (e.g., \u201cColiseum\u201d), a mixture of image and text results will be provided. If the query does not include a word on the whitelist, only text results will be provided. Unfortunately, maintaining a whitelist is typically a cumbersome and error prone process. It is infeasible to list every possible concept in each of the appropriate whitelists. And, if no entry is included in the whitelist for a term, then no image results will be returned even if though relevant images may exist and be desirable to the user. Another approach is to maintain a list of several different content repositories (e.g., a text repository, a video repository, and a photograph repository) and whenever a query is received, to perform a search on each of those repositories. One problem with such an approach is that it requires the maintaining of and access to vast repositories of content. It is also potentially very inefficient. An additional problem with both approaches is that it can be difficult to arranges results of different content types.","A system is configured to receive a query. The system determines subject type concepts associated with the query. A subject type concept is a concept included in a concept hierarchy. The system finds candidate modules that correspond to the associated concepts. The system selects a plurality of modules from the candidate modules to be delivered on a page.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process; an apparatus; a system; a composition of matter; a computer program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium; and\/or a processor, such as a processor configured to execute instructions stored on and\/or provided by a memory coupled to the processor. In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. In general, the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention. Unless stated otherwise, a component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task may be implemented as a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. As used herein, the term \u2018processor\u2019 refers to one or more devices, circuits, and\/or processing cores configured to process data, such as computer program instructions.","A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments, but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","108","104","106"]},"As described in more detail below, crawler  performs tasks such as tagging the documents stored in index  with subject type concepts and with information type concepts (also referred to herein as \u201cinfotypes\u201d). Crawler  also performs and stores the results of frequency and cooccurrence counts. Crawler  may be a single device, or its functionality may be provided by multiple devices. For example, elements typically used in conjunction with a crawler to create an index, such as an indexer, are described herein as being provided by crawler , but may also be performed by separate devices or components and the techniques described herein adapted accordingly. For example, in some embodiments cooccurrence counts are performed by concept lighting engine .","Documents in collection  can include, but are not limited to text files, multimedia files, and other content. In some embodiments, collection  includes documents found on an intranet. Also included in collection  are a variety of concept data sources -. In the example shown, source  is the set of web pages known collectively as Wikipedia (and available, e.g., at http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org). Source  is a directory of automobile makes and models, and source  is a taxonomy of pharmaceuticals. In some cases, such as with Wikipedia, the pages are used both as concept data sources, and are also included in group  and are crawled accordingly. In other cases, such as with the directory of automobile makes and models, the information may be restricted or otherwise not available to crawler , and the concept data source will serve only as a concept data source and not be included in group .","Concept data sources - each provide information that conveys some kind of relation between concepts and can be used as a source of concepts and also as a source of hierarchical relations between at least some of those concepts. For example, suppose a sample entry in automobile directory  is: \u201c2008 Honda Civic Sedan XL.\u201d Using the techniques described herein it is possible to extract hierarchical information from the entry, for example that the \u201c2008 Sedan XL\u201d is a type of \u201cHonda Civic,\u201d and that a \u201cHonda Civic\u201d is manufactured by \u201cHonda.\u201d Pages within Wikipedia typically refer to their conceptual parents by link. For example, the Wikipedia page on the topic of \u201cAstronomy\u201d has a link to its parent (typically by labeling the parent as its \u201ccategory\u201d), the more general subject of \u201cScience.\u201d The Wikipedia page on the topic of \u201cIndia\u201d includes a link to \u201cSouth Asian Countries,\u201d which includes a link to \u201cAsian Countries\u201d which includes a link to \u201cCountries by Continent.\u201d The entries in the pharmaceutical taxonomy are likewise related to one another in a manner that can be harvested using the techniques described herein.","For each of the concept data sources -, one or more arc generators  are used to parse the respective concept data source, extract concepts and relations between concepts, and store the information in a common format () that can be consumed by aggregator . For example, a Wikipedia arc generator is configured to obtain and parse Wikipedia data made available as a single XML file. From the XML file, pairs of concepts\u2014an article and a category to which it belongs\u2014are extracted. Another arc generator is configured to parse the automobile directory (e.g., provided as a spreadsheet) and generate arcs accordingly, such as by knowing that for each line of the spreadsheet, the first column (year) should be combined with the last column to form \u201c2008 Sedan XL,\u201d which has as its parent the second and third column (\u201cHonda Civic\u201d), which has as its parent just the second column (\u201cHonda\u201d). As used herein, an arc is a directional edge between two concepts. A concept is a word n-gram with meaning. One relation between concepts as used herein is an \u201cis a\u201d (\u201ccontaining\u201d) relation. For example, \u201cPhysics:Science\u201d is an arc that means \u201cphysics is a science\u201d (\u201cscience contains physics\u201d). As described in more detail below, additional relations may also be employed, such as by homonym and synonym arcs. Other directed relations between arcs that convey meaning may also be employed, and the techniques described herein adapted as applicable. For example, case variants and tokenization can be handled through the use of flags.","The respective content of concept data sources - may change at various times, and arc generators  are configured to obtain and process fresh versions of data from their corresponding concept data sources as applicable so that files  reflect the most currently known concepts and relations from those sources. For example, Wikipedia () changes frequently, while the content of the pharmaceutical taxonomy  may change very infrequently. As such, in various embodiments, arc generators  periodically process their respective sources according to a schedule appropriate to the source (e.g., with the Wikipedia arc generator running weekly, and the pharmaceutical arc generator running monthly). Editorial list  is a manually maintained list of arcs and relations used, for example, to designate a fixed set of top level concepts (also referred to herein as \u201cverticals\u201d) and to ensure that those top level concepts are not moved underneath one another or omitted.","Aggregator  aggregates the source-specific arc files  extracted by their respective arc generators  and the editorial list of arcs  and creates as output arc list  and vertex list . As described in more detail below, arc list  is a list of edges and properties that will be used to construct a concept hierarchy . Each time aggregator  runs, the newly constructed arc list  replaces any previously constructed arc list. Vertex list  is a persistent list of globally unique concepts that monotonically increases\u2014maintaining a set of stable concept identifiers over the iterations of aggregator 's processing, and growing only when a concept not previously seen is encountered by aggregator , which is then appended to the list.","As described in more detail below, hierarchy builder  constructs hierarchy  using arc list  and additional information such as a list of subtree preferences  and information obtained from index . The subtree preferences list  includes rules to be considered by hierarchy builder  when evaluating arc list . In various embodiments hierarchy  is stored as a list of pairs of concepts, a weight, and optionally other arc attributes such as homonym and synonym indicators. The weight is a rank indicating whether the arc is the primary arc between a concept and a parent (\u201c1\u201d) or whether the arc is an additional arc (e.g., \u201c2\u201d or \u201c3\u201d) that was inserted into the hierarchy after the primary arc was selected.","In some embodiments hierarchy builder  constructs hierarchy  by building a directed graph based on the information it receives, and then extracting a directed minimum spanning tree (\u201cDMST\u201d) from that graph (in which every concept (also referred to herein as a \u201cnode\u201d) present in the tree except the root has exactly one parent, and no cycles or orphans are present). A variety of techniques for finding a minimum spanning tree have been developed. One example is the Chu\/Liu-Edmonds algorithm.","Hierarchy builder  optionally employs a DAG builder , which inserts additional nodes into the DMST to form a directed acyclic graph (\u201cDAG\u201d) of concepts. An optional interface allows an administrator to view why nodes are placed in the hierarchy where they are and to audit the effects of making changes to the rules used in constructing the hierarchy. For example, if certain nodes are not consistently being placed under appropriate parents, an administrator can make additions to the subtree preferences list  or add entries to editorial arc list  as applicable. For example, an administrator may use the interface to specify that when B has C as a parent and A has a choice of parent B or C, A should select B as its parent so that a deeper hierarchy is created. This property of A, B, and C is sometimes referred to as transitive reduction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["124","202","204","118","206","210","118","212","120","130","202","212"]},"One factor that can be considered in the determination of which candidate parent is the best, is what score is assigned (e.g., by an administrator) to each of the candidate parents' concept source (referred to herein as an \u201carc rank\u201d score). Typically, the arcs provided by specialized concept sources (such as the automobile directory) are preferred over more general concept sources (such as Wikipedia). In the example shown in , a lower arc rank score indicates a better (preferred) source. In some embodiments, arc rank generators  are configured with what arc rank score should be assigned their respective arcs, and those scores are included in the source specific arc rank files . In other embodiments, aggregator  is configured by an administrator with a list of sources and their respective scores.","Wikipedia as a source has a score of 20, as indicated in region . The automobile directory is considered a \u201cbetter\u201d source of information than Wikipedia for its specialized information on automobiles, and therefore, each of the arcs that are contributed to arc list  by its arc list  receive a score of 10, as indicated in region . The editorial arc list is intended to override entries in arc list  provided by source specific arc lists  and has an even better (lower preference order) score as indicated in region . As described in more detail below, a graph constructed from the data shown in  would include a leaf \u201cHonda Civic RX\u201d which is a \u201cHonda Civic\u201d which is made by \u201cHonda\u201d which is a \u201cCar Manufacturer(s)\u201d which is contained by \u201cKosmix Autos.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["126","104","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","i":"Felidae Puma P. concolor","b":"128"},"In the example shown in FIG. C\u2014a portion of aggregated arc list \u2014each of the lines was provided by the Wikipedia arc list . The Wikipedia arc generator  is configured to recognize disambiguation pages when parsing the Wikipedia source XML file and record as arcs the ambiguous term and each of the disambiguated options in the arc list  as a pair, along with a \u201chom\u201d (for homonym) flag. Each disambiguated word is given a separate entry in the vertex file, such as the \u201cJaguar_animal\u201d line shown in . The Wikipedia arc generator  is also configured to recognize redirection pages when parsing the Wikipedia source XML file and records as arcs each of the synonyms and the main entry (\u201ccougar\u201d) in the arc list  as a pair, along with a \u201csyn\u201d (for synonym) flag. In some embodiments different weights are given to homonyms and\/or synonyms over normal arcs instead of or in addition to the use of flags.","In some embodiments aggregator  is configured to remove homonym arcs in which the ambiguous term and the disambiguated term do not begin with the same word, so that the over generation of homonym arcs is reduced. For example, since \u201cMac OS Jaguar\u201d does not begin with \u201cJaguar,\u201d it is removed (or omitted, as applicable) from arc list . As another example, Wikipedia offers \u201cFiona Apple\u201d as a disambiguation of \u201cApple.\u201d Such an arc would likewise be deleted or omitted from arc list .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2D","b":["130","282","128"]},"In contrast, entry  states that any chain of arcs (with up to 3 levels distance) that includes a parent of \u201ccountries by continent\u201d is to be preferred. In some embodiments entries in the subtree preferences list are applicable at all depths and the depth column is omitted. What entries should be included in the subtree preferences list (and what scores\/depths should be assigned) is generally subjective, can be refined over time, such as by evaluating logs. The subtree preferences provide a mechanism for an administrator to remove or favor a potentially large number of arcs without having to manually enter rules for each arc. For example, by preferring \u201ccountries by continent,\u201d all countries listed in Wikipedia will tend to be grouped under countries by continent (possibly at varying depth levels), and an administrator need not specify a rule for each country.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":"130"},"The process begins at  when a graph of arcs of concepts is received. In some embodiments the graph includes the XML representation of Wikipedia. In some embodiments the graph comprises an arc list such as arc list . Other sources of arcs of concepts, at least some of which can be connected to form a graph (irrespective of whether that graph contains some orphans or cycles) may also be used, as applicable. For example, in some embodiments a graph or portions thereof is received from a third party at .","At , weights associated with the arcs in the graph are generated. As described in more detail below, a variety of techniques can be used, individually and in combination, to generate weights at . For example, arc rank scores, Boolean values, cooccurrence scores, mutual information, etc., can be used to form a single weight or a vector of weights at .","At , a directed minimum spanning tree is extracted from the graph received at . In some embodiments preprocessing is performed, such as to remove orphan nodes which cannot be reached from the root, and the directed minimum spanning tree is extracted from the preprocessed graph rather than the graph as received at . One way of constructing a DMST is as follows. For each node in the graph, a single parent is selected, such as by using the vector of weights generated at  to evaluate candidate parents. By biasing the selection of parents toward the best parent (e.g., the one with the lowest source score), an attempt is made to preserve the consistency of the \u201cis a\u201d\/containing relationship up the DMST, such as that calculus is a form of mathematics. Next, any cycles in the graph are detected by hierarchy builder . An example of a cycle is an arc from \u201cships\u201d to \u201cboats\u201d and another from \u201cboats\u201d to \u201cships\u201d both being present in the graph. Sometimes cycles are created in Wikipedia data because two nodes are imputed to have a hierarchical relationship when they are in fact peers. For example a node \u201cBert\u201d may have as a parent \u201cErnie\u201d and vice versa. Hierarchy builder  runs a process to reduce the number of cycles. The selection of a best parent, the detection of cycles, and the reduction of cycles continues iteratively until an acyclic tree is formed. As described in more detail below, optional post processing can be performed on the acyclic tree.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["402","124","404","402","404"]},"In various embodiments, some values included in the vector of weights are read in from files, and others are provided by additional processes (e.g., plugins) which calculate and provide scores. The first portion of the vector of weights to compare between the two candidates is the \u201cvariance\u201d score, indicated in column . The variance score indicates the number of internal links which point to the candidate parent. Both candidate parents have a score of three, meaning that the vectors are tied, so the next portion of the vector is evaluated.","The next portion of the vector of weights to compare between the two candidates is the \u201cvertical correction\u201d score, indicated in column . In some embodiments the construction of a DMST is performed twice. The first time it is run, the vertical correction score is zero. The second time it is run, a vertical correction score is determined by a process that attempts to keep nodes that are peers grouped together under the same parent. For example, suppose that 95% of house plants are placed under \u201cbotany,\u201d but 5% select as best parents \u201chealth\u201d on the first run. The vertical correction process is configured to detect the discrepancy and will indicate that a \u201cbotany\u201d parent should be selected by returning a nonzero score in column  (such as a Boolean value) during the second run. In various embodiments, normalization and\/or a threshold is applied so that in cases such as a 60\/40 split, the vertical correction process does not attempt to group peers under the same parent. In the example shown, both candidates have a score of zero. The vectors are tied, so the next portion of the vector is evaluated.","The next portion of the vector of weights to compare between the two candidates is the \u201ctemplates\u201d score, indicated in column . The value for the templates score is provided by a process that evaluates nodes against groups or lists of concepts and attempts to keep those groups together. If concepts are present in multiple groups, the process attempts to keep the most number of groups, or the most important groups together, etc., as applicable. The lists\/groups may be provided by a third party and\/or configured by an administrator or otherwise obtained. For example, Wikipedia provides set information for certain entries which can be scraped by crawler . Examples of groups include a list of the planets in the solar system, a list of human diseases, a list of the seven dwarves, British Commonwealth countries, etc. In the example shown, Ronald Reagan appears in a list of United States presidents. As such, a score of one is present in column  for \u201cU.S. President\u201d but not for \u201cActor.\u201d Since there is no longer a tie between the two vectors, \u201cU.S. President\u201d would be selected as the best parent for the concept \u201cRonald Reagan.\u201d If both values in column  were equal, however, the next portion of the vector would be evaluated, and so on, until the tie was broken. In the example shown, the remaining columns are as follows. Column  reports whether a process evaluating the loaded subtree preferences list  has determined that a positive or negative preference exists for the arc. If no such preference is found, column  reports a zero. If a preference is found, it is indicated in some embodiments as a positive or negative value. Column  is the arc rank score described previously.","Columns , , and  report various statistics about the presence of the concept and its candidate parent within the documents stored in index .","The \u201cocc\u201d column () includes a score that represents a frequency count for the concept. A frequency count indicates the frequency of the occurrence of the concept within the pages in index . The frequency count is determined in some embodiments by crawler  using vertex list  to scan through each of the documents in index  and increment the \u201cocc\u201d for the concept for each page in the index that includes at least one occurrence of the concept. The \u201cpocc\u201d column similarly represents a frequency count for the candidate parent.","The \u201ccooc\u201d column includes a score that represents the cooccurrence of the concept and candidate parent in the pages in index . Cooccurrence scores are determined in some embodiments by crawler  evaluating the cooccurrence of concepts which are connected by an arc (e.g., are present in arc list ). Techniques such as using a running window of words can also be employed to avoid quadratic blowup.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":"130"},"The process begins at  when vertex list  is loaded, allowing hierarchy builder  to map concept names (e.g. human readable concept names) to concept IDs. At , a graph is built using arc list \u2014for example by connecting pairs of concepts together and storing any associated properties. If duplicate arcs are encountered, the properties of the duplicate arcs are merged. For example, if one line in arc list  reads Physics:Science:20 and another line in arc list  reads Physics:Science:10, the arcs are \u201cmerged\u201d with the best weight being preserved (e.g., Physics:Science:10). If one source indicates that an arc is a homonym arc, and another source indicates that the arc is a synonym arc, the arcs are merged and both flags are set for the merged arc. At  subtree preferences list  is loaded, as are any applicable case variance or tokenization variance information.","At , a DMST is constructed. First a best parent is selected for each node by performing a local decision comparing vectors of weights. Next, cycles are detected. One way of detecting cycles is to traverse the graph, marking each node as \u201cseen\u201d as it is visited. If a node is reached again during the traversal, a cycle has been located. For each cycle, an evaluation is made between the cost of removing an arc and the cost of adding an incident arc, and selecting the appropriate arcs whose addition\/removal have the lowest associated cost. In some embodiments the comparison is a difference of vectors, and is computed by replacing the values in the vectors with minwise elements. As stated previously, the selection of a single parent, the detection of cycles, and the reduction of cycles continues until each node (except the root) has exactly one parent. In some embodiments post processing is performed, such as vertical correction.","At  the DMST is extended to a DAG using additional arcs. For example, at  synonym arcs are inserted into the DMST, as are homonym arcs, so long as acyclicity is preserved. In some cases, additional concept arcs are included in the DAG where doing so would not result in the formation of a cycle. For example, including \u201cActor\u201d as a second parent of \u201cRonald Reagan\u201d will not result in a cycle and will preserve the \u201cis a\u201d relationship up the hierarchy. However, the insertion of other arcs (not previously shown) such as between \u201cRonald Reagan\u201d and \u201cHollywood Walk of Fame\u201d might be inappropriate, e.g. because the \u201cis a\u201d\/containing relation would be skewed away (e.g. if the parent of \u201cHollywood Walk of Fame\u201d is \u201cLandmarks\u201d\u2014Ronald Reagan is not a Landmark). One way of inserting additional arcs into the DMST is to first globally rank the omitted arcs. Rules can be used such as that additional arcs will be inserted into the DAG, in the globally ranked order, so long as the arc to be inserted is of a smaller depth than the existing single parent for the node, or that arcs can be inserted within the same vertical but only one additional arc may be added into a different vertical from the existing single parent, or that additional arcs must have a threshold cooccurrence score before they are placed into the DAG.","In some embodiments at least some orphan nodes are placed back into the DMST at . One way of placing orphans is to perform a search using the orphan as an input to the query categorization techniques described in more detail below. If the results are sufficiently dense, the orphan can be placed in the appropriate place in the DAG. Similarly, the hierarchy of concepts can be expanded by crawling the documents  for word n-grams and also attempting to place them into the DAG by using the word n-grams as an input to the query categorization techniques described in more detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["602","604","608","610","612","614","618"]},"Tagging Documents with Concepts",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["128","130","106"]},"One way of tagging a document in index  with subject type concepts is as follows. For each concept in vertex list , use the concept as a search query against the documents in index . Evaluate the results using standard text match and link scoring techniques (e.g., by examining the number of occurrences of the query on the page, the page title, the link text, metadata, whether the concept appears in bold, etc). Such techniques, which measure how well the text of a query matches a document are collectively referred to herein as \u201ctext match scoring\u201d techniques producing \u201ctext match scores\u201d although more than just the text of the document may be evaluated by such techniques.","For any particular page, the concept (query) which results in the highest text match score for the page is that page's top concept. The concept which results in the second highest text match score for the page is that page's second concept, etc. Any given document may include thousands of concepts from vertex list . Thus in some embodiments a threshold is applied and the document is tagged with its resulting top n concepts, such as the top 30 concepts.","Websites typically have common elements across the various pages that are included in that site. For example, a news website may include a left or right navigational section that includes the terms, \u201cHealth,\u201d \u201cFinance,\u201d \u201cWorld News,\u201d etc. The site may also include a prominent logo on every page. In some embodiments such common elements are identified and ignored or stripped during indexing so that text match scores are not skewed by the prolific presence of those common elements. Identifying and ignoring or stripping common elements allows text match scores and infotype rules to be applied specifically to the distinct content of each document.","One way of tagging a document in index  with an infotype is to determine whether any rules associated with those infotypes is satisfied by the document. For example, documents hosted by a known image hosting service (e.g., stock-photo library), or having an image with a certain minimum pixel size may be indicative of an image type document (e.g., a document having one or more informative images), and be tagged as having an infotype \u201cimages.\u201d Conversely, documents with discouraging ALT text (e.g., \u201cadvertisement\u201d), a standard advertisement size or location, and generic filenames suggestive of being merely decorative or formatting elements (e.g., \u201cpixel.gif\u201d, \u201cfooter.jpg\u201d) indicate that while including an image, the document is unlikely to be of interest to a user seeking images and are not tagged with the \u201cimages\u201d infotype.","Documents hosted by a known news site (e.g., www.wsj.com), having a title indicative of a news source (e.g., \u201cBreaking News\u201d), or including a copyright notice from a known news agency\/newswire (e.g., \u201cAssociated Press\u201d) are tagged as being of infotype news. Documents with a title that includes words such as \u201cevent,\u201d \u201ccalendar,\u201d \u201cupcoming,\u201d etc., are tagged with the \u201cevents\u201d infotype.

(E.g., take a union of all of the concepts tagged to all of the results.) Next, for each concept in the union (also referred to herein as the \u201ccandidate concepts\u201d list), assign that concept a score equal to the sum of the text match scores of each of the documents in the results which includes the concept in its list of top concepts. In some embodiments the text match scores are normalized. Suppose, for example, that only the top 100 results are used (and the remaining 250 results are discarded). The best result is assigned a score of 1. Each of that result's top concepts (e.g., topics T1, T5, and T20) receives a score of 1 from the result. Suppose that the next best result is assigned a score of 0.99. Each of that result's top concepts (e.g., topics T1, T2, and T3) receives a score of 0.99 from that result, and so on. After evaluating the first two results, topic T1 has a score of 1.99, topics T2 and T3 have a score of 0.99, and topics T5 and T20 have a score of 1. In some embodiments the voting scores are not weighted, but instead each concept receives one count for every result that listed that concept as one of its top concepts. Other voting techniques can also be used as applicable.","At , for each concept (e.g., the candidate concepts) the expected number of documents that the query and the concept would occur in at random is determined. This is referred to as an \u201cexpected cooccurrence\u201d and is computed as follows in some embodiments.

For example, a relation can be determined between a summation of the affinity scores of the children under a parent, and the number of paths that can be taken from the parent to its children and used as a measure of how well the query matched that parent concept. A score determined in such a manner is referred to herein as a \u201cdensity score.\u201d A density function is any function that relates node scores and some kind of volume, such as the number of children (or leaf level concepts), under a parent.

For example, the query \u201cjaguar\u201d is likely to have comparable density scores under the \u201cSports,\u201d \u201cNature,\u201d and \u201cTransportation\u201d verticals. If the user provides a query such as \u201clease a jaguar,\u201d the \u201cTransportation\u201d vertical is most likely the user's intent. In some embodiments the final concepts returned at  include an indication of whether an ambiguity was detected and if so, what are each of the disambiguated meanings of the query.","Lower ambiguity (within a vertical) can also be determined. One way of determining lower ambiguity is, for any node in the tree, to determine the density of its children. For example, suppose a node has ten children. The density scores of each of the ten children are compared. If the density scores of some children are considerably different from the density scores of other children, then the query can be said to be ambiguous at the level of the node being evaluated. In some embodiments if a threshold number of children (e.g., 90% as opposed to 50%) have similar scores, then the query is not considered to be ambiguous at the level of the node being evaluated.","Another technique for determining ambiguity is as follows. A list of contexts is determined by taking all homonyms of all high confidence concepts. All nodes in the DAG are marked with their nearest context. For each context, a parent node is determined. In some embodiments this is done by taking the highest node that has, as descendents, only nodes from within this context. Only one such node will exist because the homonym which provides the context follows only one path upwards (the tree path). The density of these representative parent nodes are compared and if the densities are similar in more than one context the query is ambiguous in those contexts, else its non ambiguous and belongs in the context with the highest density.","Typically, ambiguity that occurs across verticals or contexts indicates that the query has at least two different fundamental meanings, such as jaguar as a mammal and jaguar as an automobile. When ambiguity occurs within a vertical (e.g., a parent node has two dense children and several sparse children), one possible cause is that the query is not ambiguous, but only implicates certain children. For example, suppose a query lights \u201cIndia\u201d and \u201cFrance\u201d under a \u201cCountries\u201d parent, but does not light other countries under the \u201cCountries\u201d parent. One reason for this is that India and France are both valid \u201canswers,\u201d or matches to the query, while the other countries are not.","In some cases, a concentration of lights (i.e., dense areas) of a hierarchy does not imply an ambiguity but instead implies a surprise. Suppose a famous baseball player, \u201cJohnny Stocks\u201d was recently involved in a scandal involving the use of steroids. If a query of \u201cJohnny Stocks\u201d is performed, concepts such as \u201cbaseball,\u201d \u201cJohnny Stocks,\u201d and the team to which Johnny Stocks belongs might light, each under the \u201cSports\u201d vertical. Another concept that might also light is a \u201csteroids\u201d concept, which is located under a parent of \u201cPharmaceuticals\u201d which is in turn located under the \u201cHealth\u201d vertical. In this example, the lighting of the \u201csteroids\u201d concept is referred to as a \u201csurprise.\u201d The steroids concept is consistent with the meaning of the other results (e.g., the concept of baseball) even though it is in a different vertical. One way of identifying surprises (e.g., at ) is as follows. If a node has a low affinity score, it is likely to be a mistake and is removed from the list of candidate concepts. A surprise, in contrast, has a high affinity score. Any identified surprises are returned in some embodiments at  along with any selected final concepts.","At , concepts are grouped and named. One way of grouping and naming concepts is to determine how broad a parent node is. If the parent has mostly dense children, the parent is used to name a group that includes all of its children. For example, if 80% of the children under the node \u201cActors\u201d light, in some embodiments the \u201cActors\u201d node is selected as a concept to be associated with the query, e.g. at  in the process shown in . If, in contrast, only a few children light, the parent will not be used to group the child nodes, and each is associated with the query.","In some embodiments grouping is performed as follows.

As described in more detail below, different templates can also be used based on factors such as the concepts with which the query is associated and whether a sponsor has requested that users be presented with a page that includes some kind of branding information. An administrator can use a template to govern whether any specific modules must be included in the rendered page (such as a section dedicated to traditional web results as provided by a particular search company), whether modules should be selected automatically from among a specific group of modules (e.g., that at least one calculator module be shown, but not more than two), whether modules should be selected automatically from the entire pool of available modules, and any additional constraints, such as that a logo must appear in a specific page location. A template can be used as a top-down filter that is used to control what is ultimately displayed on the page. Some additional examples of how modules can be selected and displayed include only showing a module if it has a quality greater than a particular threshold, showing a module in a specific location, etc. The page template can thus control the location, rank, whether to show or not to show a module, and can also customize the look of the module, such as its background color or title.","In the example shown in , an administrator has created a single template that is to be used for all queries, irrespective of the concepts associated with those queries.

Region  of the page is a page block that is used to display advertisements. A page block is a portion of a page that includes rules governing the modules that can be placed within that block. A page block on a page can also specify a concept filter. A concept filter for a concept A indicates that only modules which have the concept A in their path to the root should be shown. Similar Boolean expressions can be used such as A and B or (C and D) where A, B, C, and D are concepts. Another example is the prohibition on more than two calculators could be implemented across the entire page, or the prohibition could only apply to a single page block. In the example shown, the administrator has specified that up to four advertisements may be displayed simultaneously in page block .","The template specifies that a minimum of six modules and a maximum of ten modules be included in the page, but allows all of the modules to be chosen automatically using the techniques described herein and does not supply any additional constraints on the selection of those modules.","Modules - were automatically selected based on the \u201cbuy a jaguar query\u201d provided by the user.

If the user clicks on the address, the user is taken to the dealer's web page. In the example shown, \u201cMountain View, Calif.\u201d was determined to be the location of the user based on the user's IP address.

Wikipedia module  is passed a URL and a whole number. The URL specifies the Wikipedia page that the snippet is to be drawn from (e.g., \u201cen.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jaguar_(car)\u201d) and the whole number specifies how long the snippet should be (e.g., 7 lines).","While the user's query, \u201cbuy a jaguar,\u201d could be considered an ambiguous one, the most likely intent of the user is not to purchase a mammal (or sports team). In the example shown, the user's query has been automatically disambiguated using the techniques described herein (e.g., by noting that the inclusion of the word \u201cbuy\u201d in the query makes the query considerably more likely to be associated with the car concept than any other meaning of \u201cjaguar\u201d). Module  provides the user with the ability to explore other concepts which it has determined to be of possible interest to the user. For example, by selecting link , the user will be taken to an automatically generated page about the Jaguar XF.

In some embodiments, whenever an ambiguous query is received, prior to being presented with any other modules, the user is first presented with module  and asked to indicate which meaning of the ambiguous term is intended by the user.

In some embodiments another technique, such as the use of a single XML document, is used to store page templates. Any node in subject hierarchy  can have associated with it one or more page templates. In some embodiments templates are managed by product managers who create templates that are appropriate for the verticals they oversee. For example, a template tagged to the health node might favor the inclusion of modules that provide \u201cdefinitions\u201d (e.g., a Wikipedia module, a physicians' desk reference module, etc.), while a template tagged to the travel vertical might favor the inclusion of more map modules. The root node of subject hierarchy  has a default template that is used if no other template is selected. In various embodiments, page templates are contributed by community members, such as users who are interested in a particular topic. Other community editors can edit the page templates or provide their own page templates for concepts.","In addition to the selection and layout of modules, page templates allow for the customization of such page features as background color, the use of cascading style sheets, etc. The templates stored in template database  are tagged with one or more categories with which they are intended to be used. Instructions can also be included in a template with respect to the customization of specific modules. For example, the Wikipedia snippet module () can be used by a variety of different page templates. Suppose the manager of a Health vertical wishes Wikipedia to return 10 lines of text, while the manager of a Transportation vertical only wishes Wikipedia to return 5 lines of text. A single implementation of the module can be used in both circumstances by having the respective page templates for those verticals provide different parameters to the Wikipedia snippet module (e.g., show 10 lines vs. show 5 lines; make the text blue vs. white; make the widget 100 pixels wide vs. 200 pixels wide; etc.).","At runtime, mashup engine  creates a reverse index that loads into memory a mapping between the page templates and the concepts to which they are mapped. A similar mapping is made between module specifications stored in module database  and the concepts to which the modules they are mapped. Many thousands of modules, or more, may be described by module specifications stored in module database . The modules are created by third parties and submitted for use with system  by their creators, or selected for inclusion by a curator of database . Modules can provide virtually any user experience about virtually any concept. RSS feeds, calculators, images, videos, sounds, interactive maps, and games are examples of types of modules.","Each module specification includes a variety of information about the module, such as the name of the module; a description of the module; whether the module can accept any predefined parameters such as query, zipcode, parsed concept, etc.; the maximum time that content for the module should be cached; a minimum and maximum width for the module if it is to be displayed on a page in overview mode; a minimum and maximum width for the module if it is to be displayed on a page in detail mode; the concepts to which the module is tagged (typically configured by an administrator when the module specification is first created); the module's preferred location within a column if selected; etc. In various embodiments, the concept is tagged with subject type concepts, infotypes, or both.","The module specification can also include a group of user-defined tags that allow the modules to be arbitrarily grouped. For example, one administrator might tag certain modules as being \u201cyellow,\u201d \u201chorizontal,\u201d or provided by the \u201cAcme Corporation.\u201d","A module specification can also specify a set of conditions that must be present for a module to be selected, such as that a location specific module should only be shown if the location of the user is known, or that a module only be shown at certain times of the day (e.g., during the opening hours of a business who maintains the module) or just before certain holidays or events such as annual sporting events. Another example of a condition that a module may require is that the query appear in the name of the module. For example, suppose one of the widgets defined in module database  provides a list of Irish Setters currently available for adoption from an Irish Setter dog rescue group. The module specification may require that a user's query include the term \u201cIrish Setter\u201d in order for the module to be shown, irrespective of the categories with which the query is associated.","If the module requires information from an external source, the module specification also stores a description of how the information is to be fetched\u2014such as which protocols are to be used, and how any strings are to be formatted. The module specification also stores whether results for the module should be cached (and if so for how long) or if they should be fetched anew each time the module is considered for inclusion on a page such as page . For example, a blog or news widget might have an expiry term of ten minutes. Generally, an attempt is made to cache external services to control the amount of traffic that is sent to those services\u2014both reducing the impact on the resources of the external source and also to improve efficiency. Additionally, if an external site is responding slowly to requests for information or if it becomes unavailable, it may nonetheless be possible to present modules that make use of the external site if sufficient information from the external site is available in the cache. Some modules are JavaScript code and are not rendered until runtime on client . In some embodiments the JavaScript code is cached in module cache .","In some embodiments system  is configured to communicate with an advertisement server (not shown). Page templates may specify page blocks that can include advertising modules, that 20-30% of the page's space should be dedicated to monetization, the specific advertisements\/monetization widgets that should be selected by mashup engine , etc. Historical information such as the number of advertising clicks received when a particular module was displayed last time can be used to determine which monetization modules, if any, should be shown on page . In some embodiments if a shopping intent is detected (e.g., \u201cbuy new shoes,\u201d), more space may be allocated to monetization units.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0129"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 18"],"b":["1700","1700","1700","1700"]},"The process begins at  when a query is received. For example, at  \u201cWhat color is an Irish setter,\u201d is received by application tier  from client . At , categories associated with the query are determined. For example, at , mashup engine  provides the query to lighting system  which determines that the main concept associated with the query is \u201cdog.\u201d Lighting system  provides a portion of hierarchy  that includes the node \u201cdog\u201d to mashup engine , along with a set of weights that describe how closely the query matched the portions of the hierarchy provided.","At , candidate modules to be provided to the user are located. Suppose only one page template is present in template database  and that it specifies, for any query, that somewhere between 6 and 10 modules be presented on the page and does not specify any additional constraints on the modules. At , the concept, \u201cdog\u201d as received from lighting system  is used to locate modules in modules database . Suppose twenty modules have \u201cdog\u201d as a tag, and several additional modules have as tags the parent concept, \u201cpets.\u201d At , system  determines which modules of those identified should be displayed to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0133","num":"0132"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 19"],"b":"1700"},"The process begins at  when a query is received. At  the received query is optionally annotated. In some embodiments the query annotation is performed by mashup engine  and is performed using word lists. Query annotation is typically used in the identification of a context of a query. For example in the query, \u201cI want pictures of a black dog,\u201d the phrase \u201cpictures of\u201d indicates an intent of the user (to find pictures) and \u201cblack dog\u201d is the concept for which pictures are sought. Similarly, in the query \u201cwhere can I buy a new pair of shoes,\u201d the user's intent is found in the phrase \u201cwhere can I buy\u201d and the object of that intent is \u201cshoes.\u201d A query of \u201cwhat is a platypus\u201d reveals a definition intent (\u201cwhat is a\u201d) with a subject of \u201cplatypus.\u201d Once any intents are identified, the annotated query (e.g., in which \u201cpictures of a spider bite\u201d becomes \u201cspider bite\u201d+images) is provided to lighting system .","At , one or more concepts are received. For example, at  lighting system  provides mashup engine  with any concepts and surprises associated with the query as determined using the techniques described herein, along with the scores associated with those concepts.","At  a page template is selected. One way of selecting a page template is to perform a bottom up search as follows. Locate the first received concept of the query (i.e., the main concept) in subject hierarchy . If there is a page template tagged to the concept, use that template. If not, locate the second received concept of the query (e.g., the first concept's parent) and determine whether that concept has a template. If so, the parent template is used. If not, the hierarchy is traversed higher and higher until a node with a template tagged to it is reached. Every query will have at least one available template because the root node has a page template whose requirements all relate to layout and do not relate to conditions for being selected. If a node has multiple templates available, the first template is evaluated to determine whether any conditions it may have are satisfied. If so, the template is selected. If not, the next template at that level is evaluated. If none of the templates at a level have their conditions satisfied, the templates at the node's parent are evaluated, and so on.","One reason that a concept may have multiple templates is that one template is a default and a second template is part of an advertising or other branding campaign. For example, suppose a news corporation has a partnership with the operator of system . Visitors who arrive on a landing page provided by system  (e.g., a page generated for the concept of \u201chealth\u201d) by selecting a link from a page on the news corporation's site are to be shown a page such as is shown in , but with the logo of the news corporation in one corner, along with a link back to the news corporation's website. Such users are identified in some embodiments by a string such as \u201cpartnerID=XYZ\u201d being provided by the referring site, where XYZ is the identity of the partner.","Users of system  who do not arrive from news corporation site will not have a partnerID string equal to XYZ and will be presented with a page constructed from the default health template instead. Other factors which can also be used to determine which template will be used for a user are the user's location (such as can be approximated from the user's IP address), and a probability, such as that 90% of users receive a first template and 10% of users receive a second template during A\/B testing. In some embodiments, a page defined in template database  has multiple modes\u2014such as an overview version and a detail version. Different templates may also be selected at the same node based on the user's platform. A mobile user who submits a query may receive a page with fewer modules, or with mobile-phone friendly modules than a PC-based user who submits the same query.","Other techniques for selecting a page template can also be used at  and can be used in combination with the technique described above. For example, a query white list can be constructed so that when a query containing a certain term is received, a custom template is used. One example of this is a sponsored product page. Suppose a query of \u201cibuprofen\u201d is received. If \u201cibuprofen\u201d is present on a whitelist, instead of using a \u201cDrugs\u201d template or a \u201cHealth\u201d template, a template that describes a page branded with the logo of a particular manufacturer of ibuprofen may be selected instead.","If both overview and detail versions of a page template exist, in some embodiments one of the determinations made at  is whether the intent of the query implicates one or the other of the versions. For example, a query of \u201cspider bite pictures\u201d indicates that a user is likely to want to view many pictures and the detailed version of page may be automatically selected over the overview page.","At , mashup engine  determines an initial list of candidate modules to be considered for inclusion in page . This process is also referred to herein as \u201cmodule lighting.\u201d In some embodiments the candidate list of modules is selected by determining a location in subject hierarchy  associated with the query, and examining whether any modules are tagged at the same level of the hierarchy. If so, they are added to the candidate list of modules. Additional modules can be added to the candidate list of modules by traversing up or down levels in the hierarchy. Typically, the lower in the tree a module is tagged, the more narrow or specific that module will be. For example, a \u201cdog breed selector\u201d widget that shows various images of dogs and provides information about their temperaments and size is an example of a widget that is likely to be tagged to the concept dog. If the query received at  relates to a specific kind of dog, the dog breed selector widget is likely to be of more relevance to the user than a much more general \u201canimal viewer\u201d widget that is tagged at the animal level.","Some modules may be generic to the category structure. For example, a web results module or news module is a generic module that is applicable to virtually any topic. (E.g., health news, news about airplanes, news about Ronald Reagan, etc.) Assorted techniques can be used to light such modules, such as by performing an offline precomputation of the recall of the module with respect to all concepts and using the results to determine whether to show the generic module or not.","Modules can also be tagged with recall information, and that information can be used to determine whether the query received from client  should be passed to the module or whether the query should be transformed first. For example, an image module is likely to have very poor recall for certain kinds of queries, such as tail queries, which contain several infrequently used words. Based on the recall information, assorted query transformations can be used, as explained in more detail below. Other examples of categories of queries for which recall information may be stored by a module include navigational queries (e.g., as determined by a white list), broad queries, and ambiguous queries (e.g., as identified by lighting system ).","Infotypes can also be used when determining whether to light generic modules. For example, if the query is about a celebrity, the query may be determined to be \u201cimage worthy.\u201d If a query lights the image infotype, then modules tagged with the image infotype may be lit, or have their lighting scores increased as a result. The concept, \u201chonesty,\u201d however is not an image-worthy quote and as such a general image module would not be considered.","As mentioned previously, modules may have associated constraints that are taken into consideration at . For example, a stock ticker module may require that a user provide a query that includes the word, \u201cstock\u201d for it to be shown. Modules can also have an \u201cand\u201d requirement that requires two different concepts to both be implicated in the query. For example, a travel insurance calculator may require that both \u201ctravel\u201d and \u201cinsurance\u201d be returned at  in order for it to be shown. A module may also have as a constraint that it only be selected if another specific module is selected, or that if another specific module is selected, it not be selected. A module can have multiple sizes associated with it or can take a size in which it must be rendered. Modules can be dropped or moved if they don't fit the layout for the page. Hence an additional constraint is that the module should fit the layout of the page.","In some embodiments a threshold is applied during module lighting to remove modules that light up due to low scoring concepts. For example, there may exist concepts that are lit but which have very low affinity with the query. In such cases these modules attached to such low scoring concepts would not be relevant to the query and are dropped from the list of candidate modules. As an example, suppose the received query is \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d Many concepts are lit, of which \u201cAmerican media\u201d is an example of a low scoring concept, having a query to text affinity score of 0.4 and density score of 0. In this case the \u201cAmerican media\u201d concept will get dropped because the threshold is set to 1.","Module to concept affinity is a weight specified when the module is first added to the module database. The weight is used to rank the module against the other modules tagged to the same concept. One example of how the score can be computed is: module worthiness score=module to concept affinity*(query to concept affinity+density score). Suppose there exist two modules, called bmicalc1 and bmicalc2, respectively, which are both tagged to the same concept. The module to concept affinity score will help select one over the other. And, if the module worthiness score is very low (e.g., less than 0.61), the module is removed from the candidate list. A variant to the score function is score=module to concept affinity*(w1*query to concept affinity+w2*density score) to indicate a weighted average and where w1 and w2 are the weights. Another variant to the score function takes into consideration past information such as module performance (turn-around-time), user feedback (e.g. click through rate). Score=module to concept affinity*(w1*query to concept affinity+w2*density score+w3*performance_score+w4*click_through_rate).","The above variants are scoring functions that are used for un-cached modules and\/or for modules where data is not yet available, and is also referred to as a pre-scoring function. For a cached module this scoring function is not run because the score is retrieved from the cache. The pre-scoring function assists in selecting modules for which external calls are made to get data. Modules' scores are adjusted after data is made available for them. As described in more detail below, a post-scoring function is used at  to combine the quality score (if any) with the pre-score, and any other scores. This score is then used to finally rank modules before returning them back for rendering.","At , an intersection is determined between the candidate modules selected at  and any requirements on modules specified by the page template. Typically, if a module requested by a page template is not also selected as a candidate module at , that module will not be included in the page. However, an administrator may specify, e.g., using a \u201cforce\u201d option, that a particular module must be included in the page, irrespective of any scores it receives during module lighting.","At , optional preprocessing is performed as described in more detail below. One example of preprocessing that can be performed at  is a determination of the best inputs to send to a candidate module that accepts input. For example, instead of sending a query of \u201cmy twelve year old child has diabetes,\u201d a query of \u201cjuvenile diabetes\u201d or just \u201cdiabetes\u201d may be sent to some modules. Another example of preprocessing that can be performed at  is the offline computation of the recall of the module with respect to all concepts.","At , the query is forwarded to each of the candidate modules that is configured to receive as input a query. In some cases, module results may be present in a cache. If so, the module cache is queried. If results for the module are not present in the cache, in some embodiments an external call is made, and the results may be cached for later use, as applicable.","At , postprocessing is performed. Two different types of post processing can be performed at . One form of post processing is an evaluation of the results obtained from modules (either via the module cache or via the external query) at . This form of post processing is also referred to herein as evaluating the quality of the results provided by the module and is described in more detail below.","The other form of postprocessing that can be performed at  is content transformation. Suppose a module chooses to render itself with a white background. At , one of the post processing actions that can be taken is to search for the existence of \u201cbg=white\u201d or \u201cbg=0xFFF,\u201d and then replace the detected string with \u201cbg=red\u201d or \u201cbg=0xF00\u201d as applicable, switching the background of the module from white to red. Caption text can be similarly modified, such as by substituting one company name with another, by removing captions, or by adding captions, such as the caption shown at  in .","Content reduction can also be performed at . For example, a module may provide more information than a product manager chooses to have rendered on a page. At  instructions in the page template can be used to remove unwanted portions of the module as applicable.","At , the remaining candidate modules are ranked and sorted. A variety of techniques can be used to score\/rank the modules. In addition to density, text affinity, module to concept affinity and other pre-scores, one factor that can be considered is the response time of the module. A module that provides results quickly may be ranked higher than one that provides results slowly, even if the slower module is otherwise a better match with the query. In some embodiments, each time a module is queried, a response time is stored in a log. The log can be evaluated periodically to determine an average response time, or a running average response time, etc. Another factor that can be considered is feedback. One measure of how useful a module is to a user is whether the user interacts with the module, and if so, for how long. Such information can be collected and stored in a log for use at . For example, implicit feedback (e.g., clickthrough rates) can be collected. Explicit feedback can be collected by allowing the user to select \u201cdon't show this again\u201d or \u201cthis is helpful\u201d buttons under each module, by performing polls, AB testing, etc. Another factor that can be considered is the timeliness of the module. For example, an April 15 countdown timer widget may be of little interest to a user in September, even if the query indicates a strong interest in tax information. In March, however, the widget may receive a considerably higher score. Another factor that can be considered is whether the module is maintained by an individual (e.g., a hobbyist or amateur developer) or whether the module is supplied by a professional organization.","In some embodiments system  maintains information about specific users, such as through the use of cookies. In that case, one of the factors that can be considered at  is whether the user has previously seen a module, whether the user previously indicated that the module was useful or not, etc. Other usage information can also be considered, such as past queries. For example, suppose a user consistently queries for natural remedies-type health information and then performs a query of \u201cheadache\u201d\u2014the results page may be skewed toward natural remedies for a headache, while another user (or a new user for whom no historical data is known) may be shown a page that is more weighted to over-the-counter remedies for headaches. In some embodiments a plugin is used to capture information about the user and to provide the information to system .","Monetization considerations can also be made at . Some page templates reserve a portion of the page's real estate for things that generate money, such as advertisements. Within that space, different kinds of monetization modules compete for space. Examples of monetization modules include CPC modules (e.g. Google\/Yahoo ads), TPM modules (visual ads), CPA modules (e.g. flight booking widgets\/where a company performs an action on the backend). Based on the query and what lights up, different monetization modules compete for the monetization real estate in the same way that content modules compete for content real estate. In some embodiments monetization modules are confined to a particular region of the page (e.g., banner area, right side), in some embodiments monetization modules may appear anywhere on the page but may not take up more than a fixed number of slots (e.g., 3) or total space (e.g., 30%), etc.","Techniques such as A\/B testing can be used to keep track of which layout and module selections generate more revenue, such as whether a banner region and no skyscraper should be shown, or whether both should be shown, and whether an advertisement should be shown at the bottom of the screen. Each combination can be tried and compared against other combinations. As another example, suppose that lighting system  is aware that a query is related to the concept, \u201cherbs.\u201d An advertising analysis engine (not shown) can be configured to keep track of different concepts and which modules monetize best for those queries. For example, it may be the case that for an \u201cherbs\u201d query, advertisements provided by one advertising entity do not monetize as well as advertisements provided by another.","In some embodiments the percentage of the page dedicated to monetization may also change and can be dynamically returned based on the query. If the query has commercial intent (\u201cbuy cheap tickets\u201d) then there will be more monetization as the user is indicating they are looking for advertisements\u2014they want to buy tickets.","At , layout optimization is performed so that the page ultimately provided to the user is free of excessive gaps of space. For example, suppose a total of ten modules are ultimately selected to be returned to a user on page . At , the arrangement of those ten modules is determined.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0161","num":"0160"},"figref":["FIG. 20A","FIG. 20A"],"b":"1700"},"One technique for improving the layout of the page shown in  is to perform the following process. First, determine the total number of modules to be presented on the page and divide by the number of columns. This gives an indication of an equal distribution. Next, determine how much the proposed layout deviates from the equal distribution. This deviation is referred to herein as a layout quality score. If the layout quality score exceeds a threshold (i.e., the layout is not considered optimal) a fixing process is performed. One example of a fixing function is to identify the column with the highest number of modules and move the bottom module from that column to the column with the lowest number of modules. The layout quality is reevaluated and if necessary the fixing function is applied again, iteratively, until any additional movements are not possible\u2014either due to page template constraints (e.g., against moving certain modules, such as advertisements) or due to any additional movements having no improvement effect.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0163","num":"0162"},"figref":["FIG. 20B","FIG. 20B"],"b":["1702","1710"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0163"},"figref":["FIG. 20C","FIG. 20A"],"b":["3","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0164"},"figref":["FIG. 20D","FIG. 20C"],"b":"3"},"Providing Information to Modules",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0167","num":"0166"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 21","FIG. 19","FIG. 19","FIG. 21"],"b":["2102","1914","2106","1918","1700"]},"The process begins at  when a determination is made of what query to send to a module. For many modules, such as modules that provide traditional text based web results, the originally-supplied query (e.g., as received from client ) is provided to the module. As mentioned previously, many modules do not accept queries or other input parameters and the processing at  is not performed. However, some queries, when sent to some modules, will not result in the best user experience.","One example of a query that can result in poor results from a module is where a \u201ctail query\u201d (e.g. one that is very specific and has many non-stop words) is sent to a photo or video hosting site through a module that provides a frontend to the site. A query of \u201cmy son Fred is six and he has diabetes\u201d is very unlikely to match any videos hosted by the site. In such circumstances, a query transformation can be performed so that more relevant (or in some cases, any reasonable) results are returned.","A query can be transformed in a variety of ways. One way of transforming a query is to send a shorter portion of the query. In the Fred example, one example transformation is to send just the word \u201cdiabetes.\u201d The word \u201cdiabetes\u201d is selected by picking the word n-gram in the query that contributed the most to the selection of the query's main concept. Another way of transforming a query is to send the top concept associated with the query instead of the query itself. Again using the Fred example, a top concept for the query might be \u201cjuvenile diabetes.\u201d Yet another way of transforming a query is to send one or more synonyms for terms in the query. For example, if the query received from client  is \u201cfeline,\u201d in some embodiments a synonym (e.g., \u201ccat\u201d) is selected from a list of synonyms and sent as a query instead. As another example, suppose a user submits a query of \u201crooster comb injection.\u201d Rooster comb, given as an injection, is a treatment that some individuals use for arthritis. The tissue of a rooster comb includes hyaluronic acid\u2014a synonym. Thus in some embodiments a query of \u201cbuy some rooster comb for an injection\u201d might be transformed into \u201cbuy some hyaluronic acid\u201d at .","Another example of a query that can result in poor results from a module is as follows. One meaning of the string, \u201cJSON,\u201d is \u201cJavaScript Object Notation.\u201d JSON is also a frequent misspelling of the name \u201cJason.\u201d Suppose a user is interested in finding information having to do with JavaScript and provides as a query \u201cJSON.\u201d If the query is passed, as is, to a video module, it is likely that many of the videos returned will be about people named Jason and not about JavaScript. One way of addressing this problem is through the use of query augmentation. The video site with which the video module communicates has its own hierarchy into which videos can be classified, and accepts as command line \u201chints,\u201d a category that should be searched. By sending the appropriate category along with the query, more appropriate results can be obtained. In some embodiments a mapping is maintained between at least some of the concepts in subject hierarchy  and the concepts in the external video site. For example, while JSON may have as its main concept \u201cJavaScript\u201d in hierarchy , a hierarchy maintained by a video site is likely to be much smaller. A mapping between JavaScript (in hierarchy ) and Technology (in the video taxonomy) may be used so that the query provided to the video module is \u201cJSON:Technology.\u201d","In some embodiments a ConceptDF is precomputed for every concept with respect to a module. The information can be used to determine a query transformation. For example, suppose a user is seeking \u201cfunny quotes by Kosmo Kramer.\u201d A module is described in module database  that takes as input the name of a television show or movie and provides as output quotes from the show\/movie. Sending the module the query, or even a shortened version of the query (i.e., the concept, \u201cKosmo Kramer\u201d) will not provide any results because Kosmo Kramer is not the name of a show\/movie. By examining the ConceptDF for the concept's parent, however, it is determined that the concept \u201cSeinfeld\u201d when passed to the module does provide results. Thus in some embodiments the ConceptDF is considered when transforming a query (and\/or when determining what parameters to send to a module). Similarly, suppose another module in module database  provides current information on assorted financial indices. Sending the module a query of \u201cJohnny Stocks\u201d (the baseball player) is likely to result in a fairly high recall. However, since the top concepts for Johnny Stocks are \u201cbaseball\u201d and \u201cathlete\u201d the query will not be sent because those concepts have no recall or extremely low recall for the module.","At , the query determined at  is sent to the module.","At , results returned by the module are evaluated, for example, to determine whether the query provided at  yielded better results than the one originally received; to determine whether the received results are of sufficiently high quality to merit including the module in page ; etc. In various embodiments, the processing performed at  is performed for all queries, irrespective of whether the originally received query is transformed or not.","A variety of techniques can be used to evaluate the results at . One example is to use a recall ratio. A recall ratio is a ratio between the number of results for a module (for example, images) and the number of web results in our index. If the recall ratio of a module is small, then the module does not likely produce good results. If the recall ratio is high, then the module likely produces good results.","Another example is to use text scoring on the results. For any module, the number of times the given query has occurred in the results is determined. If that number is small, then the module likely does not produce good results. If the number is large, then the module likely produces good results.","A combination function can also be employed so that results with extremely high recall ratios are not penalized for having low text scores and vice versa.","Yet another example is to use pattern matching on the results.
