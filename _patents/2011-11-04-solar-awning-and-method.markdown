{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","CROSS REFERENCE TO OTHER PATENT APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","None.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to solar energy systems and, more specifically, to a mountable solar powered system which conveniently provides shade and quiet lighting at any desired location without the need for additional wiring.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Retractable awnings have been utilized in various fashions over time. Typically, retractable awnings have been fastened to stationary objects like homes to provide protection from ultraviolet rays. These awnings have provided shade for people on the exterior of the home, like on a patio, and also help control interior temperature by blocking the heat from the sun from radiating inside the home. However, prior art awnings do not inherently provide lighting for night time use, which would require outdoor lights, power cables, and so forth, assuming power is readily available without the need for generators.","Solar power systems are often greatly preferred due to the absence of noise created by fuel operated generators. In some cases, including off-grid recreational use, noise is a consideration of importance whereas generators may be less desirable or undesirable.","Solar systems may also be considerably less costly than other types of power sources in more remote areas where power from centralized generators is unavailable. In some cases, the cost to continuously transport and store fuel greatly enhances the cost desirability of solar systems. For military uses in difficult regions, transporting fuel can be very costly as well as dangerous, making solar powered systems a very viable energy alternative.","In rugged off-grid areas, islands, regions without roads, deserts, and the like, solar power can be a more desirable source of energy both in terms of reliability and cost.","However, problems with prior art solar systems include being difficult to pack up, cumbersome to set up or break down, bulky, inadequately protected during transport, and\/or undesirably inefficient for collecting solar energy during operation.","The following patent references are related to solar power supply systems and\/or solar power features and\/or awnings.","U.S. Pat. No. 2,015,993 to F. Drake, issued Oct. 1, 1935, discloses a rolling universal window screen of a type to be moved horizontally across a window opening. A roller housing containing a spring roller on which the screen cloth is wound is adapted to be fastened on the side frame of the window opening. U.S. Pat. No. 2,015,993 is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","U.S. Pat. No. 8,018,098, to Y. J. Lu, issued Sep. 13, 2011, discloses a solar power supply system and its applying device. The power supply system includes a receiving unit, a control block and a storage unit. After the receiving unit receives solar power, the control block is used for storing the solar power into the storage unit. If a user wants to use a portable information processing device or other portable products, the portable solar power supply system supplies electric power to the device or product.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,410,362, to E. J. Simburger, issued Jun. 25, 2002, discloses a flexible thin film solar cell. A clear thermal emissive coating, such as clear polyimide, is deposited directly upon a thin film solar cell forming a flexible thin film solar cell. The thin film solar cell can be deposited on another thermal emissive coating used as a substrate during thin film solar cell semiconductor processing so that resulting flexible thin film solar cell can be illuminated on the top side and eject heat from both sides suitable for forming a solar cell array over a curved surface such as a power sphere nanosatellite with thermal regulation. U.S. Pat. No. 6,410,362 is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The above listed references do not show the features of the present invention, which provides an easily stored and, if desired, transportable awning that also provides quiet lighting at night. The above references do not show a solar awning that is quickly deployed and just as quickly stowed away for use at another time or another location. Accordingly, those of skill in the art will appreciate the present invention which addresses the above discussed problems.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved solar powered awning.","Another possible object of the present invention is to provide a large solar collecting array in a deployable and retractable arrangement.","Another possible object of the invention is to provide for solar energy storage and access that can be easily packaged and deployed for use in diverse environments.","Another possible object of the invention is to provide overhead lighting integrated into an awning system.","Another possible object of the invention is to provide an easily stowable\/deployable solar power and shade system which is protected from damage when the solar power system is in storage and shipping configuration.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following descriptions, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein, by way of illustration and example, an embodiment of the present invention is disclosed. However, it will be understood that the present invention is not limited to the above and\/or other objects of the invention.","The present invention comprises an easily mountable and\/or transportable solar awning to provide a shade during the day and at nighttime a lighted region at a desired location.","In one embodiment, the solar awning comprises a spool housing and a flexible sheet of flexible solar light array material rolled into a spool within the spool housing.

It is to be understood, however, that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or manner.","Turning now to the drawings, and more particularly  and , there are shown two different embodiments of lighted solar awning system , connected to cargo container  of vehicle . Awning system  provides a readily available deployable\/retractable shaded region during the day and lighted region at night. Awning system  is easily transportable.","While the present invention is especially useful in transportable configurations, the present invention could also be utilized to enhance a gazebo or other outdoor structure in a yard to provide shading and lighting for outdoor parties and the like. The present invention is especially useful for setting up camp meeting areas where campers, such as boy scouts and the like, can meet and work on activities during the day or at night without the need for generators. An embodiment of lighted solar awning system  could also be used with a wall, side of a house, or other similar structure. Accordingly, while the present invention is described in terms of cargo truck applications it will be understood that the present invention has many other applications.","Referring to , , , and , flexible solar light array material  provides an awning, as discussed in more detail hereinafter. Flexible solar light array material  is stored in spool housing , which is part of spool assembly , which is shown in more detail in . Spool housing  may be secured to cargo container  in many ways.","In one embodiment, spool housing  may simply be bolted to cargo container  utilizing bolts or other fasteners . Other means of securing spool housing  to container  may comprise welding, snap press fit, hanging or hooking the spool housing  along a \u201cV\u201d channel on container  which mates to a channel on spool housing , mounting spool housing  in a recessed portion of container , and the like. In another embodiment, additional supports (not shown) other than supports  may be utilized to support spool housing  adjacent to cargo container  and\/or allow spool housing  to be positioned separately from cargo container .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIGS. 6 and 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["22","86","80","82","84","88","86"]},"Wiring  may be utilized to supply charger\/battery device  for storing collected solar power. Switch  may be a manual switch, automatic switch, remotely controlled switch, or the like. When turned on, switch  connects to wiring harness , which in turn supplies LED array  with power for lighting purposes. Wiring harness  may also be built into flexible solar light array material . Other configurations might utilize switches built into the array which might be switched on or automatically turn on at night.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["22","23","96","98","23","99"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["20","22","24","26","22","12","24","22","22","12"]},"As discussed above, flexible solar light array  is a sheet of flexible solar voltaic sheeting that has been augmented with an attached array of light emitting diode lights (LED) . Spool assembly  comprises spool housing , which in one possible embodiment includes therein spring and lever action release and retraction mechanism  as the spooling mechanism. It will be noted that details for one possible embodiment for spring and lever action and retraction mechanism  for use in spool assembly  is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 2,015,993 which as discussed above, is incorporated herein by reference. However, as also discussed above, the present invention is not limited to this particular type of spooling mechanism.","In one embodiment, spool housing  carries charger\/battery device , which is wired to flexible solar light array material  and built in LED light array  via internal electrical connection , which may include rotary electrical connector . Various suitable types of rotary electrical connectors are readily commercially available to permit electrical connection to the rolling flexible solar light array material .","Electrical connectors , , and  may be built into spool housing  wherever desired, and electrically connected to the charger\/battery device  (for clarity of illustration, the electrical connections are not shown in the figures). If desired, charger\/battery device  may also comprise an inverter to provide A\/C power to connectors , , and or . Or, DC power may be utilized. If desired, a switch  may be mounted on spool housing  and\/or provide for remote, programmed, or automatic control of the array. If desired, multiple switches may be utilized to turn on selected groups of LEDs.","The exposed longitudinal edge  of flexible solar light array material  extends out of spool housing  via slot . If desired, cables or handles, e.g., graphite cables (not shown), may be built into flexible solar light array material , such as at the sides, to provide structural reinforcement and carry the loads applied thereto.","Because flexible solar light array material  is relatively thin, a considerable amount of the material can be rolled up into a relatively small spool housing . However, spool housing  can be made larger to accommodate larger arrays to provide relatively large areas of shade and lighting.","Accordingly, spool assembly  is a self-contained unit which can be utilized in a wide variety of circumstances where it is desired to provide areas of shade and lighting and\/or electrical outlets.","Once spool assembly  is secured to the vehicle or cargo container or otherwise mounted, the user grabs flexible solar light array material  on exposed longitudinal edge  and pulls it outward. In one embodiment, spring and lever action release and retraction mechanism  cams out of the way and allows for the free release of flexible solar array . Easing of the pulling force allows main tension spring mechanism  to begin to pull flexible solar array  back towards spool assembly . A small downward movement of flexible solar array  pushes spring and lever action release and retraction mechanism  down to catch the set pin and lock main tension spring mechanism  from further retraction.","In another embodiment of the invention, a spooling mechanism might comprise a reversible motor and sprocket drive mechanism. In another embodiment, a hand crank could be utilized to provide the same function.","Referring again to , after spool assembly  is mounted to the desired object, support, or the like, and flexible solar light array material  is unrolled and extended, supports , such as poles, braces, guide wires, and\/or the like, are secured in support pole bases  or otherwise to thereby support and secure the awning in accordance with one embodiment of solar awning system .","Referring to , flexible graphite strength members are utilized as supports . In this example, supports  may be attachable as support members at the sides of flexible solar light array material  to provide support therefor. In this embodiment, flexible solar light array material  could be secured on opposite ends using flexible graphite strength supports  similar to traditional tent systems. Spool housing  attaches to vehicle or other object as previously described herein. Supports  may fit into slots along the peripheral edges of flexible solar light array material  and can then be secured within pole bases  on the ground. This construction causes flexible solar light array material  to be curved, providing flexible solar light array material  longer access to solar energy as the sun moves throughout the day. Additionally, this embodiment may provide additional shelter from the sun UV rays because flexible solar light array material  forms an awning with not only a ceiling, but also a partial wall.","Once it is set up, awning system  provides a large shaded area underneath, as depicted in , , , and . Electrical energy is provided to power or charge ancillary equipment from outlets , , and . LED lights  can be powered by the rechargeable battery when flexible solar light array material  is no longer capturing solar energy.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention is presented for purposes of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed; and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the accompanying claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The drawings constitute a part of this specification and include exemplary embodiments of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms.
