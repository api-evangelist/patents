{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIPTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the invention were developed under Contract No. DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/326,139, filed Dec. 14, 2011, entitled OPTICALLY TRANSDUCED MEMS MAGNETOMETER, to Nielson, et al., the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","The present invention generally relates to Micro Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) sensors, and more particularly to vibratory gyroscopes.","Gyroscopes are used as sensors for sensing angular velocity or angular acceleration generated by rotation of a movable body. Both mechanical and vibratory gyroscopes are common in the art with vibratory gyroscopes typically formed using MEMS manufacturing processes which generally utilize semiconductor fabrication techniques. Vibratory gyroscopes typically drive a suspended proof mass, such as a tuning fork, etc., to mechanically resonate in a first dimension relative to a support and when the gyroscope experiences a rotation, the Coriolis effect couples energy from the from the excited resonance to an orthogonal (sensed) dimension. A rotation rate (e.g., \u00b0\/sec) is then determined from the measured amplitude of the coupled energy.","The Coriolis force for a vibratory gyroscope is of the form F=2mQ\u2212V, where Q is the angular velocity experienced by the gyroscope, in is the mass weight of the proof mass, and V is the vibratory velocity. Larger mass is therefore advantageous for improved measurement sensitivity. For typical device operation, a change in capacitance between the proof mass and support resulting from the Coriolis force is measured, for example by converting the magnitude of the capacitance to a voltage and\/or determining a voltage required to eliminate the movement of the proof mass in the second dimension. In order to improve a sensing capacity of the vibratory gyroscope, capacitive coupling between the suspended proof mass and the support is made large by minimizing the spacing between the proof mass and the support in at least the sensed dimension.","As the artisan will appreciate, it is difficult to fabricate a proof mass having large mass and also a large capacitive coupling factor. To provide adequate capacitance, gap spacing between capacitively coupled faces of the suspended proof mass and the support have been driven down to nanometers using advanced thin film techniques (e.g., conformal depositions, anisotropic plasma etches, etc.). However, pursuit of such thin film micromachining techniques have limited the mass dimensions significantly in the thickness direction (out of the plane of the MEMS device), typically to tens of microns. Even where advanced wafer bonding and transferred substrate techniques are employed, a released proof mass will generally have a thickness no more than a few hundred microns (\u03bcm). As such, the proof mass dimensions are limited by the finite surface area available in a given substrate and\/or stress in the thin films.","While deep substrate etches have long been utilized in bulk micromachining techniques, as yet, anisotropic etch performance limits lateral dimensions of deep trenches to many tens of microns. As this large lateral dimension significantly limits capacitive coupling, bulk micromachined vibratory gyroscopes have yet to achieve advantageous performance metrics.","Embodiments of the present invention include a bulk micromachined vibratory gyro in which a proof mass has a bulk substrate thickness for a large proof mass and high inertial sensitivity.","In embodiments, optical displacement transduction is performed with multi-layer sub-wavelength gratings for high sensitivity and low cross-talk with non-optical drive elements. In embodiments, the vibratory gyro includes a plurality of multi-layer sub-wavelength gratings for measuring motion of the proof mass induced by drive forces and\/or moments and induced by the Coriolis Effect when the gyro experiences a rotation. For example, a width of the multi-layer grating apertures along a dimension of the plane of the support is to vary in response to the rotation. In certain embodiments, the vibratory gyro includes a plurality of multi-layer sub-wavelength gratings. Phase between the layers of the multi-layer grating may be varied across the plurality such that manufacturing tolerances may be accounted for by selecting from the plurality of multi-layer gratings, one grating having the best performance.","In embodiments, a bulk micromachined vibratory gyro includes at least one capacitive drive element. A plurality of drive electrodes may further be utilized in a bulk micromachined vibratory gyro where a face of the proof mass opposes a first and second electrically independent face of the support with at least one of the first and second electrically independent support faces to capacitively impart the drive force to a face of the proof mass. In further embodiments, both the first and second electrically independent support faces are driven by different signals to capacitively impart a torque on the suspended proof mass, for example to maximize orthogonality of the drive and sense modes to further reduce cross-talk.","Described herein are bulk micromachined vibratory gyros. In the following description, numerous details are set forth, however, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known methods and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, to avoid obscuring the present invention. Reference throughout this specification to \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, function, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. Thus, the appearances of the phrase \u201cin an embodiment\u201d in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, functions, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. For example, a first embodiment may be combined with a second embodiment anywhere the two embodiments are not mutually exclusive.","The terms \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201cconnected,\u201d along with their derivatives, may be used herein to describe structural relationships between components. It should be understood that these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other. Rather, in particular embodiments, \u201cconnected\u201d may be used to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact with each other. \u201cCoupled\u201d my be used to indicated that two or more elements are in either direct or indirect (with other intervening elements between them) physical or electrical contact with each other, and\/or that the two or more elements co-operate or interact with each other (e.g., as in a cause and effect relationship).","The terms \u201cover,\u201d \u201cunder,\u201d \u201cbetween,\u201d and \u201con\u201d as used herein refer to a relative position of one material layer with respect to other layers. As such, for example, one layer disposed over or under another layer may be directly in contact with the other layer or may have one or more intervening layers. Moreover, one layer disposed between two layers may be directly in contact with the two layers or may have one or more intervening layers. In contrast, a first layer \u201con\u201d a second layer is in contact with that second layer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIGS. 1B and 1C","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","100","105","101","106"]},"As further illustrated in , the bulk micromachined vibratory gyro  includes at least one deformable diffractive optical structure (e.g., a multi-layer grating A) disposed on a top side (or alternatively a bottom side) of the gyro  for optical domain transduction of the proof mass displacement. Transduction in the optical domain enables the proof mass to be bulk machined for larger mass dimensions without suffering performance loss that would otherwise occur if capacitive sensing was employed. Furthermore, with the deformable diffractive optical structures disposed only on a top and\/or backside of the device, the entire perimeter of a proof mass becomes available for motion control rather than functionally dividing the proof mass perimeter between motion sense and control. Transduction in the optical domain also enables the bulk micromachined gyroscope  to be fabricated simultaneously with the Lorentz magnetometer described in the above referenced U.S. Patent Application, entitled OPTICALLY TRANSDUCED MEMS MAGNETOMETER, to Nielson, et al. A multi-axis inertial sensor of superior sensitivity may be provided with both inertial and magnetic sensing functions provided by multiple such optically transduced MEMS devices monolithically integrated on a same substrate. As such, in certain advantageous embodiments, one or more of the MEMS bulk micromachined gyroscopes described herein are provided in combination with one or more MEMS magnetometers.","In embodiments, a bulk micromachined vibratory gyro includes a support and at least one proof mass suspended from the support. Examples of more than one proof mass include a tuning fork vibratory gyroscope. It is understood that based on the illustrative single proof mass embodiments provided herein, one of skill in the art may readily adapt a conventional thin film tuning fork vibratory gyro design, or other multi-mass gyro known in the art, to incorporate one or more of the techniques described herein, such as optical domain transduction, bulk machining, etc.","In the exemplary embodiment depicted in , the support  forms a frame completely surrounding a proof mass . As further shown in , both the support  and the proof mass  have at least a bulk substrate thickness, T. As such, the proof mass  and the support  have substantially the same thickness with minor thickness differences between the two arising from differences in the thin film processing over the substrate  for one or the other of the proof mass  and the support . For example, one or more layers of thin film materials such as silicon dioxide, polysilicon, silicon nitride, electrode metallization, (layers  and  in ) etc. utilized in the fabrication of the bulk micromachined vibratory gyro  may be present to differing extents between the support  and the proof mass .","Generally, the bulk substrate thickness, T may vary depending on convention for the material selected for the substrate  (). While, the substrate  may generally be any material suitable for semiconductor device fabrication, in advantageous embodiments a bulk substrate composed of a poly or single crystalline material such as, but is not limited to, silicon, germanium, silicon-germanium, or a III-V compound semiconductor material is utilized. In embodiments, the substrate  has conductivity sufficient for a voltage applied for capacitive drive of the proof mass to pass through the entire bulk substrate thickness T without detrimental voltage drop. For example, impurity doped substrates may be utilized, as known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the substrate  is a semiconductor (silicon) on insulator (SOI) substrate having a buried insulator layer  (e.g., silicon dioxide) spanning the entire area of the substrate , as known in the art. For such embodiments, the bulk substrate thickness T includes both a base semiconductor substrate portion A disposed below the buried layer , and also an overlying semiconductor substrate portion B. Generally, the bulk substrate thickness, T is to be at least 500 \u03bcm. In a preferred embodiment where the substrate material is silicon (e.g., a single crystal silicon wafer), the bulk substrate thickness, T will be approximately 700 \u03bcm (i.e. between about 650 \u03bcm and about 750 \u03bcm). With T being nearly 1 mm, structural integrity of the proof mass  is substantially greater than for a thin film proof mass and therefore the proof mass  may also have very large lateral (in-plane) dimensions, for example 4-10 mm on a side for a mass in the 0.001 to 1 gram range.","As shown in , delineation of the proof mass  from the support  is by the trench  that is nearly continuous with the only discontinuities occurring at a flexure anchor point. As further shown in , the trench  has a lateral gap dimension, G, defining the critical dimension and aspect ratio of the trench . As the trench  passes completely through the substrate , the trench  is at least 500 \u03bcm deep (e.g., as measured from a bottom side of the substrate ) and approximately 700 \u03bcm deep for the exemplary silicon substrate embodiments. Because the lateral gap dimension, G, does not limit sensing sensitivity, the dimension may be whatever is sufficient for the amount of proof mass displacement induced in the drive mode and\/or otherwise needed for a given deep trench etch process. Generally, the lateral gap dimension, G, is microns wide. In exemplary silicon substrate embodiments, the lateral gap dimension, G, is between 20 \u03bcm and 60 \u03bcm for an aspect ratio between about 20:1 and 30:1, which is readily attainable using conventional anisotropic silicon etching techniques known in the art.","While a proof mass may generally have any shape, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , the proof mass  is substantially square having first parallel opposite sides A, A extending lengthwise along the x-dimension and second parallel opposite sides A, A extending lengthwise orthogonal to the first opposite sides A, A, along the y-dimension. The bulk substrate thickness, T, is therefore orthogonal to the first and second opposite sides, extending out of plane in the z-dimension. As such, the trench  defines faces of the proof mass which extend in the z-dimension through the bulk thickness at the opposite sides A, A, A, A. Separated from the proof mass faces by the trench  are opposing support faces which further include a drive element along their entire lengths (in the x and y dimensions of ). In advantageous embodiments, the entire thicknesses (z-dimension in ) of the support faces function as a drive element interface utilized for drive of the proof mass .","In an embodiment, each face of the proof mass opposes a plurality of electrically independent faces of the support. At least one of the electrically independent faces of the support is to impart the drive force or moment to the proof mass via capacitive coupling with a face of the proof mass. This capacitive coupling is illustrated in  by electric field \u03b5, which in the preferred embodiment extends through the bulk substrate thickness, T. For the preferred SOI embodiments, capacitive drive is provided across the entire bulk substrate thickness T with conductive vias  passing through the buried insulator layer  to electrically couple the base semiconductor substrate portion A with the overlying semiconductor substrate portion B, as shown in . It should be noted that while capacitive sensing requires a small lateral gap dimension, G, for high displacement sensitivity, a small lateral gap dimension is not required for capacitively driving the proof mass given the relatively larger AC amplitude of a drive voltage.","In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , the support  includes first and second electrically independent support faces B, C and B, and C opposing adjacent lengths of the proof mass (A and A). Each side of the proof mass A, A, A and A therefore faces a pair of electrically independent support faces B, C, B,C, B,C, and B,C. As such, any one of these electrically independent support faces may function as an independent drive electrode A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B when powered by a signal applied via pads D, E, D, E, D, E, D,E, respectively. Each electrically independent support face therefore occupies approximately one half of the x and y dimensional lengths of the proof mass. As shown in , B, and C, the drive electrodes extend along the lateral (in-plane) lengths of the proof mass, even subjacent\/adjacent the multi-layer gratings (e.g., multi-layer grating A depicted).","For the exemplary embodiment where the drive mode is the in x-dimension, at least one of the support faces B, C and B, and C is to capacitively impart the drive force to the proof mass  during operation. In embodiments where ones of the electrically independent support faces on a given side of the support are driven with different drive signals, a torque may be imparted on the proof mass. This additional degree of motion control can, for example, be utilized in a feedback loop to actively account for variation in the structural characteristics between the flexures A, B, C, and D resulting from manufacturing tolerances, or to decouple the proof mass from sources of cross-talk external to a packaged gyro, such as vibration or other environmental factors.","The proof mass  is attached to the support  via at least one flexure to oscillate in a drive mode relative to the support  in response to a drive force. In the illustrative embodiment, the proof mass  is to oscillate in the plane of the support  only, with oscillation modes out of the plane suppressed by the flexure(s). In other words, the drive mode oscillation is along one of the x-dimension and the y-dimension and the sense mode oscillation is along the other of the x-dimension and the y-dimension. For the sake of clarity of description, the drive mode is defined to be in the x-dimension and the sense mode is in the y-dimension, however the opposite configuration may also be practiced. As shown, the proof mass  is attached to the support  by four flexures, A, B, C, and D, coupling each of four corners of the proof mass  to each of four corners of the support  where the first opposite sides A, A intersect with the second opposite sides A, A. The four flexures A, B, C, and D, being defined by the trench , also have the bulk substrate thickness.","In an embodiment, the deformable diffractive optical structure employed for optical transduction of proof mass displacement is a multi-layer grating A. In the exemplary embodiment, each grating in the multi-layer gratings (e.g. A and A) is a sub-wavelength grating, however chirped gratings and other forms known in the art may also be employed. As shown in , the multi-layer grating A includes a first grating A formed in the support  and cantilevered over the trench  to be disposed over a second grating A formed in the proof mass . The first grating A may alternatively be formed in the proof mass  and cantilevered over the trench  to be disposed over the second grating A formed in the support . Alternatively, both gratings may be cantilevered off their respective bulk supports. Each of the first and second gratings A and A may be formed in either the substrate , or as illustrated in , in a thin film layer , , respectively, which is formed on the substrate . Exemplary thin film materials include silicon dioxide, silicon nitride and polysilicon, as well as any other material known in the art having adequate thermal stability structural integrity for the geometries and functions described herein.","Grating aperture dimensions vary with displacement of the proof mass  relative to the support . Depending on the dimension along which the grating is aligned, aperture dimensions vary either in response to drive signal (e.g., in x-dimension) or in the sense mode (e.g., y-dimension) in response to a rotation of the gyro . While first-order gratings with feature dimensions significantly larger than a wavelength of light used for the optical transduction (i.e., the operating wavelength) may be used, near field multi-layer gratings are preferred as being capable of modulating the intensity and polarization of an incident light in response to much smaller displacements of the grating elements. Near field multi-layer gratings having line elements of the gratings separated by distances which are less than the operating wavelength are known to modulate the intensity of reflected or transmitted zero orders even when displacement in-plane of the grating is only fractions of a wavelength. For a detailed description of such near field multi-layer gratings, the interested reader is referred to the commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,173,764 and 7,339,738 to Carr et al., and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes. The sub-wavelength displacement sensitivity possible with the near field multi-layer grating, when provided with the increased proof mass dimensions provided by bulk micromachining, a level of inertial sensitivity heretofore unknown can be achieved.","In an embodiment, a bulk machined vibratory gyro includes a plurality of near field multi-layer gratings. In an embodiment, at least one multi-layer grating having apertures aligned with each in-plane dimension is disposed at each corner of the proof mass . As shown in , the gyro  includes a first plurality of multi-layer gratings  having aperture lengths extending along the x-dimension in a one dimensional array across the side A of the proof mass (and across the electrically independent support face B). A second plurality of multi-layer gratings  is in a one dimensional array across the orthogonal side A of the proof mass. Additional multi-layer grating arrays  and  are present on the opposite proof mass sides A, A. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , a second one dimensional multi-layer grating array  is disposed at a second end of the side A, opposite the first plurality of multi-layer gratings . With each side of the proof mass  and support  having two one dimensional multi-layer grating arrays (,  and , and , ), each flexure A, B, C, and D is adjacent to a multi-layer grating arrayed along each of the in-plane dimensions. Sensitivity to forces and moments experienced by the proof mass  is maximized with the multi-layer grating arrays disposed in the corners of the proof mass .","In an embodiment, across the plurality of arrayed multi-layer gratings, line elements in the gratings of each multi-layer grating have a same pitch, but an alignment offset between the gratings is different across the plurality of multi-layer gratings so that phase between the overlapping gratings is modulated across the plurality of multi-layer gratings.  illustrates an expanded plan view  of a portion of the bulk micromachined vibratory gyro . The expanded plan view  illustrates multi-layer gratings A, B, C, arrayed in the x-dimension, and multi-layer gratings A and B, arrayed in the y-dimension. Inset within , cross-sectional views A and B further illustrate two multi-layer gratings A and B. The cross-sectional view A illustrates line elements in the first grating A with a first pitch P, defining a period of the first grating A. Similarly, line elements in the second grating A have a second pitch P. The pitches Pand Pmay be substantially equal to each other, but are not necessarily so. Alignment between the first and second gratings A and A defines a phase \u03c6for the first multi-layer grating A.","In the cross-sectional view B, line elements in the first grating B have the first pitch P. Similarly, line elements in the second grating B have the second pitch P. As such, between the two multi-layer gratings A and B, the pitches of respective gratings are equal. Alignment between the first and second gratings B and B is however different from that between the gratings A and A to define a phase \u03c6for the second multi-layer grating B that is different from the phase \u03c6. In one exemplary embodiment, the difference in phase between adjacent ones of the arrayed gratings is 10-20 nm so that over the eight multi-layer gratings arrayed in each of two dimensions at the corners of the proof mass , phase is varied by 80-150 nm. Varying the phase \u03c6 across an arrayed plurality of multi-layer gratings enables an inertial sensing system incorporating the bulk micromachined vibratory gyro  to undergo a functional test where gratings in each array may be binned out to identify the grating having a phase, \u03c6, that satisfies predetermined threshold criteria, for example results in the greatest displacement induced modulation of (zeroth order) light intensity. Variation in the fabrication process may therefore be accounted for to advantageously improve sensitivity. In an alternate embodiment, more than one multi-level grating may be utilized for displacement transduction. For example, differential measurements may be performed and\/or a comb filter or other filtering may be applied to combine outputs from more than one multi-level grating in each array and remove common mode noise, etc. as known in the art of electrical signal conditioning.","As further depicted in the expanded plan view  in , and in  showing an expanded plan view  of the multi-layer grating A, the trench  is serpentine in the region of the arrayed multi-layer gratings, with a portion of the trench  passing under (represented by dashed lines) the first grating A cantilevered from the support . Notably, the dimensions of the serpentine are much smaller than those of the proof mass, in contrast to conventional devices which rely on capacitive sensing (and therefore often have comb structures with lengths on the order of the proof mass dimensions). For example, in the exemplary embodiment where the proof mass dimensions in the x-y plane are over 4 mm on a side, the trench  serpentines by 150-200 \u03bcm in delineation of the proof mass platform upon which the second grating (e.g., second grating A) is formed.  further illustrates apertures  and intervening line elements  having major lengths in an x-y plane parallel to the plane of the support to define the first grating period along the x-dimension and therefore to transduce drive mode displacement. On orthogonal sides of the proof mass  (e.g., A and\/or A) similar apertures and intervening line elements have major lengths defining the first grating period along the y-dimension to transduce sense mode displacement of the proof mass . As shown in , the second grating comprises a similar plurality of regularly spaced line elements in a second plane parallel to the plane of the support separated in the z-dimension from the first line elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B","b":["300","100","300","124","144","154","300","302","310","304","124"]},"For the exemplary linear grating, light having a specific wavelength (i.e., operating wavelength) is diffracted into modes that emerge along multiple discrete angles. For the preferred near field grating embodiments where the multi-layer gratings are \u201csub-wavelength,\u201d the light source  is to emit an incident light beam  at a wavelength that is greater than the pitch of the grating (either the first grating A or second grating A, although in the preferred embodiment where the both the first and second grating have the same pitch, the wavelength is greater than the pitch of both first and second gratings). The sub-wavelength grating has only a zeroth-order mode and a surface wave mode. When optically coupled, varying the offset between the two gratings allows for modulation of the light between transmission and reflection in the zeroth order mode.","Exemplary detectors  include a PIN photodiode, an active pixel sensor (APS), or the like. In one near field embodiment, the first photodetector -1 is to measure an intensity of zeroth-order light modulated by the multi-layer grating A, though other orders may also be sensed. The first photodetector -1 (i.e., a position sensing detector) is to detect the light portion -1 reflected off the multi-layer grating A. A second detector -2 (i.e., a reference detector) is to detect a light portion -2 of the light  reflected off a reference surface outside the multi-layer grating A (i.e., the reference light portion -2 bypasses the multi-layer grating A). The reference detector -2 provides an electrical output signal which can be combined with the electrical output signal of the detector -1 to substantially remove any common-mode noise (i.e., noise due to the light source or other factors which is common to both reflected light portions -1 and -2) and thereby improve a sensitivity for sensing relative displacement of the second grating A disposed on the proof mass. In alternate embodiments of the present invention where a transmitted light portion is detected, a reference detector can be similarly used to detect a portion of the incident light beam  which bypasses the multi-layer grating A. As further illustrated in , the inertial sensor  includes a detector -1 communicatively coupled to a feedback controller  (e.g., logic circuits of an FPGA or ASIC) that is further communicatively coupled to a drive element controller  (e.g., a drive voltage source) which operate together to maintain the proof mass  in a state of resonance (e.g., in the x-dimension).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["300","120","102","302","310","310","304","304","304","304","318","318","304"]},"For the exemplary embodiments employing a plurality of multi-layer gratings arrayed with varying phases for both drive and sense modes, each multi-layer grating having a particular phase is paired with a light source  and at least one optical detector , for example an array of LEDs or VCSELs may be disposed over the each array of multi-layer gratings.
