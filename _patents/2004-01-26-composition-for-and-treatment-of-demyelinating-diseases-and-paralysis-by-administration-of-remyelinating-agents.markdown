{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/442,171 filed on Jan. 24, 2003, and U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/500,316, filed on Sep. 5, 2003, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.","This invention relates generally to compositions, compounds that can be used to treat demyelinating diseases and conditions and\/or reduce paralysis in a patient.","Inflammation is a response of vascularized tissues to infection or injury and is affected by adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelial cells of blood vessels and their infiltration into the surrounding tissues. In normal inflammation, the infiltrating leukocytes release toxic mediators to kill invading organisms, phagocytize debris and dead cells, and play a role in tissue repair and the immune response. However, in pathologic inflammation, infiltrating leukocytes are over-responsive and can cause serious or fatal damage. See, e.g., Hickey, (Academic Press 1990).","The integrins are a family of cell-surface glycoproteins involved in cell-adhesion, immune cell migration and activation. Alpha-4 integrin is expressed by all circulating leukocytes except neutrophils, and forms heterodimeric receptors in conjunction with either the beta-1 (\u03b2) or beta-7 (\u03b2) integrin subunits; both alpha-4 beta-1 (\u03b1\u03b2) and alpha-4 beta-7 (\u03b1\u03b2) play a role in migration of leukocytes across the vascular endothelium (Springer et al., 1994, 76: 301-14; Butcher et al., 1996, 272: 60-6) and contribute to cell activation and survival within the parenchyma (Damle et al., 1993; 151: 2368-79; Koopman et al., 1994, 152: 3760-7; Leussink et al., 2002, 103: 131-136). \u03b1\u03b2is constitutively expressed on lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, basophils and eosinophils.","Alpha-4 beta-1 (also known as very late antigen-4, VLA-4), binds to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (Lobb et al., 1994, 94: 1722-8), which is expressed by the vascular endothelium at many sites of chronic inflammation (Bevilacqua et al., 1993 11: 767-804; Postigo et al., 1993 144: 723-35). \u03b1\u03b2has other ligands, including fibronectin and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components.","The alpha-4 beta-7 dimer interacts with mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM-1), and mediates homing of lymphocytes to the gut (Farstad et al., 1997 150: 187-99; Issekutz, 1991 147: 4178-84). Expression of MAdCAM-1 on the vascular endothelium is also increased at sites of inflammation in the intestinal tract of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Briskin et al., 1997 151: 97-110).","Adhesion molecules such as alpha-4 integrins are potential targets for therapeutic agents. For instance, the VLA-4 receptor of which alpha-4 integrin is a subunit is an important target because of its interaction with a ligand residing on brain endothelial cells. Diseases and conditions resulting from brain inflammation have particularly severe consequences. In another example, the alpha-4 beta-7 integrin dimer is an important target due to its involvement in lymphocyte homing and pathological inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract.","Alpha-4 beta-1 integrin is expressed on the extracellular surface of activated lymphocytes and monocytes, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute inflammatory brain lesions and blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) (Coles et al., 1999 46(3): 296-304). Agents against alpha-4 integrin have been tested for their anti-inflammatory potential both in vitro and in vivo. See Yednock et al., 1992, 356: 63-66; U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,299 to Bendig et al., issued Nov. 24, 1998, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,809 to Thorsett et al., issued Dec. 14, 1999. The in vitro experiments demonstrate that alpha-4 integrin antibodies block attachment of lymphocytes to brain endothelial cells. Experiments testing the effect of alpha-4 integrin antibodies on animals having the artificially induced condition simulating multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), have demonstrated that administration of anti-alpha-4 integrin antibodies prevents inflammation of the brain and subsequent paralysis in the animals. Collectively, these experiments identify anti-alpha-4 integrin antibodies as potentially useful therapeutic agents for treating multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory diseases and disorders.","To date, no therapies have been discovered which inhibit or prevent demyelination let alone agents that promote remyelination. For example, multiple sclerosis impacts human health and costs for maintaining health more than any other demyelinating disease. No effective treatment exists for MS. It is a disease that afflicts primarily young adults (i.e., mean age of 30) with an incidence of 1 case per 1,000 individuals. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is the major animal model used for studying MS. However, unlike with EAE, MS is an autoimmune disease with an unknown cause. Disease progression is characterized by an influx of immune cells into the central nerve system that eventually results in edema, demyelination, axonal damage and loss.","New compounds, compositions and methods for using these compounds and compositions to inhibit demyelination, to promote remyelination and\/or treat paralysis associated with demyelination are needed and continue to be sought out for the treatment of diseases such as MS, as well as other demyelinating diseases linked with inflammation.","Based on the above, new compositions and methods of treating these diseases are needed which will effectively treat or inhibit these diseases such that patients can achieve long life spans and better quality of life.","The invention relates to methods of promoting remyelination of nerve cells in a mammal comprising administering to the mammal a remyelination agent in a remyelinating effective amount. Preferably, the mammal in the methods of the present invention is a human, and the human suffers from a condition that demyelinates cells.","Conditions which demyelinate cells according to the invention include multiple sclerosis, congenital metabolic disorder, a neuropathy with abnormal myelination, drug induced demyelination, radiation induced demyelination, a hereditary demyelinating condition, a prion induced demyelinating condition, encephalitis induced demyelination, or a spinal cord injury. Preferably the condition is multiple sclerosis.","The invention further relates to a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a remyelinating agent, which prevents demyelination and\/or promotes remyelination when administered to a subject in need thereof.","In the methods and compositions of the invention, the remyelinating agent may be an antibody, an immunologically active fragment of an antibody, a compound, or combinations thereof. The antibody or immunologically active fragment thereof is preferably natalizumab (ANTEGREN\u00ae) or an immunologically active fragment thereof.","In the methods and compositions of the invention, the remyelinating agent may be a small compound of formula I, IA, IB, IC, II, IIA, or IIB.

A \u201creference sequence\u201d is a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison; a reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence given in a sequence listing, such as a polynucleotide sequence of  or , or may comprise a complete DNA or gene sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least 20 nucleotides in length, frequently at least 25 nucleotides in length, and often at least 50 nucleotides in length. Since two polynucleotides may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete polynucleotide sequence) that is similar between the two polynucleotides, and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two polynucleotides, sequence comparisons between two (or more) polynucleotides are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two polynucleotides over a \u201ccomparison window\u201d to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A \u201ccomparison window\u201d, as used herein, refers to a conceptual segment of at least 20 contiguous nucleotide positions wherein a polynucleotide sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of at least 20 contiguous nucleotides and wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a comparison window may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman, 2: 482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, 48: 443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, () 85: 2444 (1988) (each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by inspection, and the best alignment (i.e., resulting in the highest percentage of sequence similarity over the comparison window) generated by the various methods is selected. The term \u201csequence identity\u201d means that two polynucleotide sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide basis) over the window of comparison. The term \u201cpercentage of sequence identity\u201d is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. The terms \u201csubstantial identity\u201d as used herein denotes a characteristic of a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the polynucleotide comprises a sequence that has at least 85 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, more usually at least 99 percent sequence identity as compared to a reference sequence over a comparison window of at least 20 nucleotide positions, frequently over a window of at least 25-50 nucleotides, wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to the polynucleotide sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the window of comparison. The reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence.","As applied to polypeptides, the term \u201csequence identity\u201d means peptides share identical amino acids at corresponding positions. The term \u201csequence similarity\u201d means peptides have identical or similar amino acids (i.e., conservative substitutions) at corresponding positions. The term \u201csubstantial identity\u201d means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 95 percent sequence identity or more (e.g., 99 percent sequence identity). Preferably, residue positions that are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. The term \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d means that two peptide sequences share corresponding percentages of sequence similarity.","The term \u201csubstantially similar\u201d as used herein is intended to mean any polypeptide that has an alteration in the sequence such that a functionally equivalent amino acid is substituted for one or more amino acids in the polypeptide, thus producing a change that has no or relatively little effect on the binding properties of the polypeptide. For example, one or more amino acid residues within the sequence can be substituted by another amino acid of a similar polarity or similar size.","The term \u201csubstantially pure\u201d means an object species is the predominant species present (i.e., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species in the composition), and preferably a substantially purified fraction is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least about 50 percent (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. Generally, a substantially pure composition will comprise more than about 80 to 90 percent of all macromolecular species present in the composition. Most preferably, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular species.","For purposes of classifying amino acids substitutions as conservative or non-conservative, amino acids are grouped as follows: Group I (hydrophobic sidechains): norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile; Group II (neutral hydrophilic side chains): cys, ser, thr; Group III (acidic side chains): asp, glu; Group IV (basic side chains): asn, gin, his, lys, arg; Group V (residues influencing chain orientation): gly, pro; and Group VI (aromatic side chains): trp, tyr, phe. Conservative substitutions involve substitutions between amino acids in the same class. Non-conservative substitutions constitute exchanging a member of one of these classes for another.","Amino acids from the variable regions of the mature heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins are designated Hx and Lxx respectively, where \u201cx\u201d is a number designating the position of an amino acids according to the scheme of Kabat et al., SPII(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987) and (1991)) (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cKabat\u201d incorporated by reference in their entirety). Kabat lists many amino acid sequences for antibodies for each subclass, and list the most commonly occurring amino acid for each residue position in that subclass. Kabat uses a method for assigning a residue number to each amino acid in a listed sequence, and this method for assigning residue numbers has become standard in the field. Kabat's scheme is extendible to other antibodies not included in the compendium by aligning the antibody in question with one of the consensus sequences in Kabat. The use of the Kabat numbering system readily identifies amino acids at equivalent positions in different antibodies. For example, an amino acid at the L50 position of a human antibody occupies the equivalence position to an amino acid position L50 of a mouse antibody.","The term \u201creagent\u201d or \u201cagent\u201d is used to denote a biologically active molecule that binds to a ligand receptor. For example, antibodies or fragments thereof which immunoreact with the VLA-4 receptor or VCAM-1 can be useful to promote remyelination and\/or reduces paralysis in a subject in a statistically significant amount. Peptides, or peptidomimetics or related compounds, which can act to bind the cell surface receptor, are also contemplated, and can be made synthetically by methods known in the art. Other reagents that react with a VLA-4 receptor as discussed herein or as apparent to those skilled in the art are also contemplated.","A \u201cremyelinating agent\u201d as used herein refers to any agent that promotes remyelination and\/or reduces paralysis in a subject in a statistically significant amount. Preferably, such agents include immunoglobulins (e.g., antibodies, antibody fragments, and recombinantly produced antibodies or fragments), polypeptides (e.g., soluble forms of the ligand proteins for integrins) and small molecules, which when administered in an effective amount inhibits demyelination and\/or promotes remyelination in a patient. Such may also result in the reduction of paralysis when administered in an effective amount to the patient. These agents can be selected from anti-alpha4 integrin agents (preferaply anti-alpha4 beta 1 antagonists) and anti-VCAM-1 agents. However, with reference to the present invention, such anti-alpha4 integrin and anti-VCAM-1 agents only include those which when administered in an effective amount inhibits demyelination and\/or promotes remyelination and\/or reduces paralysis.","The term \u201canti-alpha-4 integrin agent\u201d as used herein refers to any agent that binds specifically to an integrin comprising an alpha-4 subunit and inhibits activity of the integrin. The term \u201cintegrin antagonist\u201d includes any agent that inhibits alpha-4 subunit-containing integrins from binding with an integrin ligand and\/or receptor. Preferably, the integrin antagonist inhibits the alpha-4 beta-1 dimer from binding to its cognate ligand(s). Such antagonists can include anti-integrin antibodies or antibody homolog-containing proteins, as well as other molecules such as soluble forms of the ligand proteins for integrins. Soluble forms of the ligand proteins for alpha-4 subunit-containing integrins include soluble VCAM-1, VCAM-1 fusion proteins, or bifunctional VCAM-1\/Ig fusion proteins. For example, a soluble form of an integrin ligand or a fragment thereof may be administered to bind to integrin, and preferably compete for an integrin binding site on cells, thereby leading to effects similar to the administration of antagonists such as anti-integrin (e.g., VLA-4) antibodies. In particular, soluble integrin mutants that bind ligand but do not elicit integrin-dependent signaling are included within the scope of the invention.","By \u201cnatalizumab\u201d or \u201cANTEGREN\u00ae\u201d is meant a humanized antibody against VLA-4 as described in commonly owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,840,299 and 6,033,665, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Also contemplated herein are other VLA-4 specific antibodies. Such remyelinating antibodies and immunoglobulins. include but are not limited to those immunoglobulins described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,602,503 and 6,551,593, published U.S. Application No. 20020197233 (Relton et al.), and as further discussed herein.","The term \u201cefficacy\u201d as used herein in the context of a chronic dosage regime refers to the effectiveness of a particular treatment regime. Efficacy can be measured based on change the course of the disease in response to an agent of the present invention. For example, in the treatment of MS, efficacy can be measured by the frequency of relapses in relapsing-remitting MS, and by the presence or absence of new lesions in the central nervous system as detected using methods such as MRI.","The term \u201csuccess\u201d as used herein in the context of a chronic treatment regime refers to the effectiveness of a particular treatment regime. This includes a balance of efficacy, toxicity (e.g., side effects and patient tolerance of a formulation or dosage unit), patient compliance, and the like. For a chronic administration regime to be considered \u201csuccessful\u201d it must balance different aspects of patient care and efficacy to produce the most favorable patient outcome.","The terms \u201cspecifically binds\u201d or \u201cbinds specifically\u201d as used herein refer to the situation in which one member of a specific binding pair will not show any significant binding to molecules other than its specific binding partner (e.g., an affinity of about 1000\u00d7 or more for its binding partner). In the present invention, the small compounds, such as N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperzain-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester, will not show significant binding to any polypeptide other than an alpha-4 integrin or a receptor comprising an alpha-4 integrin. For example, the small compounds used in the methods of the invention that bind to an alpha-4 integrin with a binding affinity of greater than 0.3 nM are said to bind specifically to an alpha-4 integrin.","The terms \u201celicits an immune response\u201d and \u201celicits a host immune response\u201d as used herein refer to the production of an immune response to a receptor comprising an alpha-4 integrin in a subject upon introduction of an agent of the invention to the subject. An immune response in the subject can be characterized by a serum reactivity with an alpha-4 integrin receptor that is at least twice that of an untreated subject, more preferably three times the reactivity of an untreated subject, and even more preferably at least four times the reactivity of an untreated subject, with serum immunoreactivity measured using a serum dilution of approximately 1:100.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient\u201d is intended to mean any compound used in forming a part of the formulation that is intended to act merely as a carrier, i.e., not intended to have biological activity itself. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient as used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such carrier.","The terms \u201ctreating\u201d, and \u201ctreatment\u201d and the like are used herein to generally mean obtaining a desired pharmacological and physiological effect. More specifically, the reagents described herein which are used to treat a subject with a demyelinating disease or condition to do one or more of the following: (1) prevent demyelination; (2) inhibit demyelination; (3) promote remyelination; (4) slow or halt paralysis; and (5) reduce\/reverse paralysis. Thus, the effect may be prophylactic in terms of preventing or partially preventing a disease, symptom or condition thereof and\/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure of a disease, condition, symptom or adverse effect attributed to the disease depending on the condition or disease being treated. The term \u201ctreatment\u201d, as used herein, covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal, particularly a human, and includes: (a) preventing the disease from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development; or (c) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease and\/or its symptoms or conditions. The invention is directed towards treating a patient's suffering from disease related to pathological inflammation. The present invention is involved in preventing, inhibiting, or relieving adverse effects attributed to pathological inflammation and demyelination over long periods of time and\/or are such caused by the physiological responses to inappropriate inflammation present in a biological system over long periods of time.","By \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is meant an amount of agent, reagent, or combination of reagents disclosed herein that when administered to a mammal is sufficient to promote remyelination of mammalian cells and\/or reduce paralysis in an animal in a statistically significant amount.","By the term \u201cremyelinating effective amount\u201d is meant an amount of an agent, reagent, or composition effective to inhibit demyelination and\/or promote remyelination in a subject and\/or reduce paralysis. The \u201cremyelinating effective amount\u201d will vary depending on the compound or composition, the specific disease to be treated and its severity, and the age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated.","By \u201cchronic administration\u201d is meant administration of an agent, reagent, or combination therapy of the invention in an amount and periodicity to result in one or more of the following: (1) reduce paralysis in a subject with a demyelinating disease or condition, (2) halt progression of paralysis in a subject with a demyelinating disease or condition; (3) promote remyelination in a subject with a demyelinating disease or condition; and (4) prevent demyelination in a subject with a demyelinating disease or condition. Administration is preferably biweekly, weekly, monthly, or every other month, but can be daily. More preferably the treatment is weekly or monthly and is administered for 6 months to several years or the remainder of the patient's life depending on the disease or condition being treated.","Additional definitions relevant to the compounds of Formulae I, IA, IB, IC, II, IIA, and IIB are as defined therein.","2. General Aspects of the Invention","The present invention is based on the surprising result that chronic administration of an emerging class of new compounds known as selective adhesion molecule inhibitors (SAMIs) provides appropriate control of the inflammatory response in such a manner as to promote remyelination. Existing inhibitors have not provided such control over the inflammatory response, and disease continues to progress. What the inventors have shown herein is that a class of small compounds, preferably exemplified by the compounds of formula I and II, preferably formula IB, IC, and IIB, is useful in treating such pathological inflammation. These small compounds can be administered using a chronic dosage regime or a short-term dosage regime. However, the chronic dosage regime is preferred to maintain the suppression of the pathological inflammation. Thus, in order to realize some of the more important advantages of the invention, the levels of remyelinating agents agent need to be maintained over a number of months or even years.","In a general sense, the method of the invention does not involve any particular mode of administration, since the mode of administration is dependent upon the form of the active agent and the formulation developed to administer the active agent. Modes of administration include oral, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, subdural, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intraarterial, or intralesional routes of administration), topical, localized (e.g., surgical application or surgical suppository), rectal, and pulmonary (e.g., aerosols, inhalation, or powder). Preferably, the route of administration is parenteral. The route of administration is based on the composition being administered (e.g., immunoglobulin being administered intravenously versus small compound being administered orally), tissue targeting (e.g., intrathecal administration to target the site of a spinal cord injury), and the like, as would be known to the artisan of ordinary skill.","Additionally, the remyleniating agents can be combined with other compounds or compositions used to treat, ameliorate or palliate symptoms associated with demyelination conditions or diseases. Furthermore, the compounds disclosed herein can be administered alone or in combination with other agents, such as other remyelinating agents, including antibodies and immunologically active fragments thereof (e.g., natalizumab). When administered in combination, the small compounds may be administered in the same formulation as these other compounds or compositions, or in a separate formulation. When administered in combination, the remyelinating agent antibodies are generally administered in a separate formulation than the small compound remyelinating agents, other compounds, and compositions. When administered in combinations, the remyelinating agents may be administered prior to, following, or concurrently with the other compounds and compositions used to treat, ameliorate, or palliate symptoms. The general concept of the invention relates to introducing relatively constant amounts of an active agent to a patient's circulatory system over a period of months or years. This chronic administration of a remyelinating agent is one that provides appropriate control over pathological inflammation being maintained at a constant level over a period of time. By maintaining therapeutic levels of an active agent for a period of time, pathological inflammation can be chronically suppressed in the patient.","In a very specific sense, the invention involves obtaining and maintaining a receptor saturation level in a human patient of a dimer comprising alpha-4 integrin in a range of from about 65% to 100%, more preferably between 75% and 100%, and even more preferably between 80-100%. These receptor saturation levels are maintained at these levels chronically (e.g., over a period of 6 months or so) to allow for continued suppression of pathological inflammation.","In general, the remyelinating agents may be selected from agents that specifically bind to an alpha-4-integrin or binds specifically an alpha-4-integrin. For example, the small compounds used in the methods of the invention may be selected from compounds that have a binding affinity for alpha-4-integrin of 0.3 to 3 nM. Also, antibodies such as natalizumab, which have a binding affinity for alpha-4-integrin of about 0.2 to about 0.4 nM, may also selected.","In another aspect of the invention, the compounds and compositions described herein can be used to inhibit immune cell migration from the bloodstream to the central nervous system in the instance of, for example, multiple sclerosis, or to areas which result in inflammatory-induced destruction of the myelin. Preferably, these agents or reagents inhibit immune cell migration in a manner that inhibits demyelination and that further may promote remyelination. The agents or reagents may also prevent demyelination and promote remyelination of the central nervous system for congenital metabolic disorders in which infiltrating immune cells affect the development myelin sheath, mainly in the CNS. The reagents preferably also reduce paralysis when administered to a subject with paralysis induced by a demyelinating disease or condition.","3. Indications for Treatment","Inflammatory diseases that are included for treatment by the compositions, compounds and methods disclosed herein include generally conditions relating to demyelination. Histologically, myelin abnormalities are either demyelinating or dysmyelinating. Demyelination implies the destruction of myelin. Dysmyelination refers to defective formation or maintenance of myelin resulting from dysfunction of the oligodendrocytes. Preferably, the compositions and methods disclosed herein are contemplated to treat diseases and conditions relating to demyelination and aid with remyelination. Additional diseases or conditions contemplated for treatment include meningitis, encephalitis, and spinal cord injuries and conditions generally which induce demyelination as a result of an inflammatory response. The compounds, compositions and methods disclosed herein are not directed towards diseases and conditions wherein there is, for example, a genetic defect leading to improper myelin formation, e.g., dysmyelination.","The compositions, compounds and cocktails disclosed herein are contemplated for use in treating conditions and diseases associated with demyelination. Diseases and conditions involving demyelination include, but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, congenital metabolic disorders (e.g., phenylketonuria, Tay-Sachs disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Gaucher's disease, Hurler's syndrome, Krabbe's disease and other leukodystrophies), neuropathies with abnormal myelination (e.g., Guillain Barr\u00e9, chronic immune demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), multifocal CIDP, anti-MAG syndrome, GALOP syndrome, anti-sulfatide antibody syndrome, anti-GM2 antibody syndrome, POEMS syndrome, perineuritis, IgM anti-GD1b antibody syndrome), drug related demyelination (e.g., caused by the administration of chloroquine, FK506, perhexiline, procainamide, and zimeldine), other hereditary demyelinating conditions (e.g., carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein, Cockayne's syndrome, congenital hypomyelinating, congenital muscular dystrophy, Farber's disease, Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Refsum disease, prion related conditions, and Salla disease) and other demyelinating conditions (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis or spinal cord injury) or diseases.","There are various disease models that can be used to study these diseases in vivo. For example, animal models include but are not limited to:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Disease Model","Species"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["EAE","Mouse, rat, guinea pig"]},{"entry":["Myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)","Rat"]},{"entry":"induced EAE"},{"entry":["TNF-\u03b1 transgenic model of demyelination","Mouse"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"The most common demyelinating disease is multiple sclerosis, but many other metabolic and inflammatory disorders result in deficient or abnormal myelination. MS is a chronic neurologic disease, which appears in early adulthood and progresses to a significant disability in most cases. There are approximately 350,000 cases of MS in the United States alone. Outside of trauma, MS is the most frequent cause of neurologic disability in early to middle adulthood.","The cause of MS is yet to be determined. MS is characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination and gliosis (scarring). Demyelination may result in either negative or positive effects on axonal conduction. Positive conduction abnormalities include slowed axonal conduction, variable conduction block that occurs in the presence of high- but not low-frequency trains of impulses or complete conduction block. Positive conduction abnormalities include ectopic impulse generation, spontaneously or following mechanical stress and abnormal \u201ccross-talk\u201d between demyelinated exons.","T cells reactive against myelin proteins, either myelin basic protein (MBP) or myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) have been observed to mediate CNS inflammation in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Patients have also been observed as having elevated levels of CNS immunoglobulin (Ig). It is further possible that some of the tissue damage observed in MS is mediated by cytokine products of activated T cells, macrophages or astrocytes.","Today, 80% patients diagnosed with MS live 20 years after onset of illness. Therapies for managing MS include (1) treatment aimed at modification of the disease course, including treatment of acute exacerbation and directed to long-term suppression of the disease; (2) treatment of the symptoms of MS; (3) prevention and treatment of medical complications, and (4) management of secondary personal and social problems.","The onset of MS may be dramatic or so mild as to not cause a patient to seek medical attention. The most common symptoms include weakness in one or more limbs, visual blurring due to optic neuritis, sensory disturbances, diplopia and ataxia. The course of disease may be stratified into three general categories: (1) relapsing MS, (2) chronic progressive MS, and (3) inactive MS. Relapsing MS is characterized by recurrent attacks of neurologic dysfunction. MS attacks generally evolve over days to weeks and may be followed by complete, partial or no recovery. Recovery from attacks generally occurs within weeks to several months from the peak of symptoms, although rarely some recovery may continue for 2 or more years.","Chronic progressive MS results in gradually progressive worsening without periods of stabilization or remission. This form develops in patients with a prior history of relapsing MS, although in 20% of patients, no relapses can be recalled. Acute relapses also may occur during the progressive course.","A third form is inactive MS. Inactive MS is characterized by fixed neurologic deficits of variable magnitude. Most patients with inactive MS have an earlier history of relapsing MS.","Disease course is also dependent on the age of the patient. For example, favourable prognostic factors include early onset (excluding childhood), a relapsing course and little residual disability 5 years after onset. By contrast, poor prognosis is associated with a late age of onset (i.e., age 40 or older) and a progressive course. These variables are interdependent, since chronic progressive MS tends to begin at a later age that relapsing MS. Disability from chronic progressive MS is usually due to progressive paraplegia or quadriplegia (paralysis) in patients. In one aspect of the invention, patients will preferably be treated when the patient is in remission rather then in a relapsing stage of the disease.","Short-term use of either adrenocorticotropic hormone or oral corticosteroids (e.g., oral prednisone or intravenous methylprednisolone) is the only specific therapeutic measure for treating patients with acute exacerbation of MS.","Newer therapies for MS include treating the patient with interferon beta-1b, interferon beta-1a, and COPAXONE\u00ae (formerly known as copolymer 1). These three drugs have been shown to significantly reduce the relapse rate of the disease. These drugs are self-administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously.","However, none of the current treatment modalities inhibit demyelination, let alone promotes or allows spontaneous remyelination or reduces paralysis. One aspect of the invention contemplates treating MS with agents disclosed herein either alone or in combination with other standard treatment modalities.","3.2. Congenital Metabolic Disorders","Congenital metabolic disorders include phenylketonuria (PKU) and other aminoacidurias, Tay-Sachs disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Gaucher's disease, Hurler's syndrome, Krabbe's disease and other leukodystrophies that impact the developing sheath as described more fully below.","PKU is an inherited error of metabolism caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Loss of this enzyme results in mental retardation, organ damage, unusual posture and can, in cases of maternal PKU, severely compromise pregnancy. A model for studying PKU has been discovered in mice. Preferably infants identified with PKU are sustained on a phenylalanine free or lowered diet. An aspect of the invention would be to combine such diets with the compounds and compositions disclosed herein to prevent demyelination and remyelinate cells damaged due to PKU.","Classical Tay-Sachs disease appears in the subject at about age 6 months and will eventually result in the death of the subject by age 5 years. The disease is due to the lack of the enzyme, hexoaminidase A (hex A), which is necessary for degrading certain fatty substances in the brain and nerve cells. The substances in the absence of the enzyme accumulate and lead to the destruction of nerve cells. Another form of hex A enzyme deficiency occurs later in life and is referred to as juvenile, chronic and adult onset forms of hex A deficiency. Symptoms are similar to those that characterize classical Tay-Sachs disease. There is also an adult onset form of the enzyme deficiency. Currently there is no cure or treatment for the disease\/deficiency, only the preventative measure of in utero testing of the fetus for the disease. Thus, the compounds and compositions disclosed herein may be useful in ameliorating or preventing the destruction of the cells.","Niemann-Pick disease falls into three categories: the acute infantile form, Type B is a less common, chronic, non-neurological form, and Type C is a biochemically and genetically distinct form of the disease. In a normal individual, cellular cholesterol is imported into lysosomes for processing, after which it is released. Cells taken from subjects with Niemann-Pick have been shown to be defective in releasing cholesterol from lysosomes. This leads to an excessive build-up of cholesterol inside lysosomes, causing processing errors. NPC1 was found to have known sterol-sensing regions similar to those in other proteins, which suggests it plays a role in regulating cholesterol traffic. No successful therapies have been identified for Types A and C forms of Neumann-Pick. For Type C, patients are recommended to follow a low-cholesterol diet. Thus, the compounds and compositions disclosed herein may be useful in ameliorating or preventing the destruction of the cells.","Gaucher's disease is an inherited illness caused by a gene mutation. Normally, this gene is responsible for an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase that the body needs to break down the fat, glucocerebroside. In patients with Gaucher's disease, the body is not able to properly produce this enzyme and the fat cannot be broken down. Like Tay-Sachs disease, Gaucher's disease is considerably more common in the descendants of Jewish people from Eastern Europe (Ashkenazi), although individuals from any ethnic group may be affected. Among the Ashkenazi Jewish population, Gaucher's disease is the most common genetic disorder, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 450 persons. In the general public, Gaucher's disease affects approximately 1 in 100,000 persons.","In 1991, enzyme replacement therapy became available as the first effective treatment for Gaucher's disease. The treatment consists of a modified form of the glucocerebrosidase enzyme given intravenously. It is contemplated that the compositions and compounds disclosed herein can be used alone or more preferably in combination with glycocerebrosidase administration to treat the disease in an afflicted subject.","Hurler's syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type I, is a class of overlapping diseases. These genetic diseases share in common the cellular accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in fibroblasts. The diseases are genetically distinguishable. Fibroblast and bone marrow transplantation does not seem to be helpful, thus compounds and compositions useful in ameliorating disease severity and progression are needed. The compounds and compositions disclosed herein may be administered to a subject to ameliorate disease progression and\/or severity.","Krabbe's disease (also known as Globoid cell leukodystrophy) is an autosomal recessive condition resulting from galactosylceramidase (or galactocerebrosidase) deficiency, a lysosomal enzyme that catabolises a major lipid component of myelin. Incidence in France is an estimated 1:150,000 births. The disease leads to demyelination of the central and peripheral nervous system. Onset generally occurs during the first year of life and the condition is rapidly progressive, but juvenile, adolescent or adult onset forms have also been reported, with a more variable rate of progression. Diagnosis is established from enzyme assay (galactosylceramidase deficiency). There are several natural animal models (mouse, dog, monkey). Krabbe's disease, like all leukodystrophies, has no known cures or effective treatments. One embodiment of the instant invention is to use the compositions and compounds disclosed herein to treat or ameliorate Krabbe's disease and other leukodystrophies.","Leukodystrophies are a group of genetically determined progressive disorders that affect the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. They include adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), Aicardi-Goutiers syndrome, Alexander's disease, CACH (i.e., childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination or vanishing white matter disease), CADASIL (i.e., cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), Canavan disease (spongy degeneration), Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX), Krabbe's disease (discussed above), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, ovarioleukodystrophy syndrome, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (X-linked spastic paraglegia), Refsum disease, van der Knaap syndrome (vaculating leukodystrophy with subcortical cysts) and Zellweger syndrome. None of the diseases have effective treatments let alone cures. Consequently, means of treating or ameliorating the symptoms of the disease, such as by using the compositions and compounds disclosed herein, is needed.","3.3. Neuropathies with Abnormal Myelination","A variety of chronic immune polyneuropathies exist which result in demyelination in the patient. The age of onset for the conditions varies by condition.

Drugs that are responsible for demyelination include but are not limited to chloroquine, FK506, perhexiline, procainamide, and zimeldine.","Radiation also can induce demyelination. Central nervous system (CNS) toxicity due to radiation is believed to be cause by (1) damage to vessel structures, (2) deletion of oligodendrocyte-2 astrocyte progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes, (3) deletion of neural stem cell populations in the hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex, and generalized alterations of cytokine expression. Most radiation damage results from radiotherapies administered during the treatment of certain cancers. See for review Belka et al., 2001 85: 1233-9. However, radiation exposure may also be an issue for astronauts (Hopewell, 1994 14: 433-42) as well as in the event of exposure to radioactive substances.","Patients who have received drugs or been exposed accidentally or intentionally to radiation may experience a benefit by administered one of the compounds or compositions disclosed herein to prevent demyelination or to promote remyelination.","3.5. Hereditary Conditions Involving Demyelination","Additional inherited syndromes\/diseases that result in demyelination include Cockayne's syndrome, congenital hypomyelinating, Farber's disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Peliszaeus-Merzbacher disease, Refsum, prion related conditions and Salla disease.","Cockayne's syndrome (CS) is a rare inherited disorder in which people are sensitive to sunlight, have short stature and have the appearance of premature aging. In the classical form of Cockayne's syndrome (Type I), the symptoms are progressive and typically become apparent after the age of one year. An early onset or congenital form of Cockayne's syndrome (Type II) is apparent at birth. Interestingly, unlike other DNA repair diseases, Cockayne's syndrome is not linked to cancer. CS is a multi-system disorder that causes both profound growth failure of the soma and brain and progressive cachexia, retinal, cochlear, and neurologic degeneration, with a leukodystrophy and demyelinating neuropathy without an increase in cancer. After exposure to UV (e.g., sunlight), subjects with Cockayne's syndrome can no longer perform transcription-coupled repair. Two genes defective in Cockayne's syndrome, CSA and CSB, have been identified so far. The CSA gene is found on chromosome 5. Both genes code for proteins that interacts with components of the transcriptional machinery and with DNA repair proteins.","To date, no cures or effective treatments for patients with this disease have been identified. Thus, one aspect of the invention is treatment of this disease with the compounds and compositions disclosed herein.","Congenital hypomyelination has several names including congenital dysmyelinating neuropathy, congenital hypomyelinating polyneuropathy, congenital hypomyelination (Onion Bulb) polyneuropathy, congenital hypomyelination neuropathy, congenital neuropathy caused by hypomyelination, hypomyelination neuropathy and CHN. Hereditary peripheral neuropathies, among the most common genetic disorders in humans, are a complex, clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that produce progressive deterioration of the peripheral nerves. Congenital hypomyelination is one of a group of disorders. This group includes hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome, and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy. There are no known cures or effective treatments for any of these disorders.","Farber's disease has several names include: Farber lipogranulomatosis, ceremidase deficiency, acid ceramidase deficiency, AC deficiency, N-laurylsphingosine deacylase deficiency, and N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase. As certain names reveal, the disease occurs due to a deficiency of acid ceramidase (also known as N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase, ASAH). The lack of the enzyme results in an accumulation of non-sulfonated acid mucopolysaccharide in the neurons and glial cells. Patients with the disease usually die before the age of 2 years.","Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A. It is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that affect growth of the myelin sheath. There are three forms of MLD: late infantile, juvenile, and adult. In the late infantile form, which is the most common, onset of symptoms begins between ages 6 months and 2 years. The infant is usually normal at birth, but eventually loses previously gained abilities. Symptoms include hypotonia (low muscle tone), speech abnormalities, loss of mental abilities, blindness, rigidity (i.e., uncontrolled muscle tightness), convulsions, impaired swallowing, paralysis, and dementia. Symptoms of the juvenile form begin between ages 4 and 14, and include impaired school performance, mental deterioration, ataxia, seizures, and dementia. In the adult form, symptoms, which begin after age 16, may include impaired concentration, depression, psychiatric disturbances, ataxia, tremor, and dementia. Seizures may occur in the adult form, but are less common than in the other forms. In all three forms mental deterioration is usually the first sign.","Peliszaeus-Merzbacher disease (also known as perinatal sudanophilic leukodystrophy) is an X-linked genetic disorder that causes an abnormality of a proteolipid protein. The abnormality results in an infant's death typically before the age of one year. There are no known treatments or cures for the disease.","Refsum disease (also referred to as phytanic acid oxidase deficiency, heredopathia atactica polyneuritiformis or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy IV, HMSN IV) is caused by mutations in the gene, which encodes phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (PAHX or PHYH). The major clinical features are retinitis pigmentosa, chronic polyneuropathy and cerebellar signs. Phytanic acid, an unusual branched chain fatty acid (3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-hexadecanoic acid) accumulates in the tissues and body fluids of patients with the disease and is unable to be metabolised due to the lack of PAHX. Plasmapheresis performed once or twice monthly effectively removes the acid from the body and permits liberalization of dietary restrictions limiting phytanic acid intake.","Prion related conditions include Gerstmann-Straussler disease (GSD), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), familial fatal insomnia and aberrant isoforms of the prion protein can act as infectious agents in these disorders as well as in kuru and scrapie (a disease found in sheep). The term prion derives from \u201cprotein infectious agent\u201d (Prusiner, 216: 136-44, 1982). There is a proteolytic cleavage of the prion related protein (PRP) which results in an amyloidogenic peptide that polymerises into insoluble fibrils","Salla disease and other types of sialurias are diseases involving problems with sialic acid storage. They are autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorders that may present as a severe infantile form (i.e., ISSD) or as a slowly progressive adult form that is prevalent in Finland (i.e., Salla disease). The main symptoms are hypotonia, cerebellar ataxia and mental retardation. These conditions and diseases are also contemplated for palliative or ameliorating treatments.","3.6. Other Demyelinating Conditions","Other conditions that result in demyelination include post-infectious encephalitis (also known as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, ADEM), meningitis and injuries to the spinal cord. The compositions and compounds disclosed herein are also contemplated for use in treating these other demyelinating conditions.","4. Remyelinating Agents","According to the present invention, the remyelinating agents can be selected from agents that specifically bind to alpha-4-integrins. Various types of agents with the ability to bind to and inhibit alpha-4 integrin may be remyelinating agents and thus may be used in the practice of the invention. Many such alpha-4-integrin antagonists have been identified and characterized, and specific agents are described below. These alpha-4-integrin antagonists may be screened for remyelination activity. Specifically, these agents may include both small compounds and polypeptides (e.g., immunoglobulins). Given the teachings disclosed herein, one skilled in the art will be able to identify other agents that will be able to inhibit the alpha-4-comprising integrin dimers in a manner that biologically mimics or is similar to the specifically described agents to inhibit demyelination and\/or promote remyelination and\/or reduce paraylsis. The present invention is intended to include the chronic administration of such agents. As it is also contemplated to include combinations of agents, discussion of agents other than small compounds is also provided.","4.1.

The compounds can be administered by a variety of routes, including, but not limited to, oral, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, subdural, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intraarterial, or intralesional routes of administration), topical, intranasal, localized (e.g., surgical application or surgical suppository), rectal, and pulmonary (e.g., aerosols, inhalation, or powder). Accordingly, these compounds are effective as both injectable and oral compositions. The compounds can be administered continuously by infusion or by bolus injection. Preferably, the compounds are administered by parenteral routes. More preferably, the compounds are administered by intravenous routes. Such compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art.","The actual amount of the compound of the subject invention, i.e., the active ingredient, will depend on a number of factors, such as the severity of the disease, i.e., the condition or disease associated with demyelination or the paralysis associated with demyelination to be treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of administration, and other factors.","Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD\/ED. Compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred.","The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range which includes the IC(i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. The effective blood level of the compounds of the subject invention is preferably greater than or equal to 10 ng\/ml.","The amount of the pharmaceutical composition administered to the patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as \u201ctherapeutically effective dose.\u201d Amounts effective for this use will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the inflammation, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.","The compositions administered to a patient are in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described supra. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.","The active compound is effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically or therapeutically effective amount. The therapeutic dosage of the compounds of the present invention will vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. For example, for intravenous administration, the dose will typically be in the range of about 20 \u03bcg to about 500 \u03bcg per kilogram body weight, preferably about 100 \u03bcg to about 300 \u03bcg per kilogram body weight. Suitable dosage ranges for intranasal administration are generally about 0.1 pg to 1 mg per kilogram body weight. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. Typically, the clinician will administer the compound until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect.","When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the subject invention are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions, which contain as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of the subject invention above, associated with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. The excipient employed is typically one suitable for administration to human subjects or other mammals. In making the compositions of this invention, the active ingredient is usually mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within a carrier which can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.","In preparing a formulation, it may be necessary to mill the active compound to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it ordinarily is milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size is normally adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh.","Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.","The quantity of active compound in the pharmaceutical composition and unit dosage form thereof may be varied or adjusted widely depending upon the particular application, the manner or introduction, the potency of the particular compound, and the desired concentration. The term \u201cunit dosage forms\u201d refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. The concentration of therapeutically active compound may vary from about 1 mg\/ml to 1 g\/ml.","Preferably, the compound can be formulated for parenteral administration in a suitable inert carrier, such as a sterile physiological saline solution. For example, the concentration of compound in the carrier solution is typically between about 1-100 mg\/ml. The dose administered will be determined by route of administration. Preferred routes of administration include parenteral or intravenous administration. A therapeutically effective dose is a dose effective to produce a significant decrease in demyelination and a notable increase in remyelination. Preferably, the amount is sufficient to produce a statistically significant amount of remyelination in a subject.","By way of example, for preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.","The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer, which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.","The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as corn oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.","Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. The compositions may be administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face mask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.","The compounds of this invention can be administered in a sustained release form. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the protein, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (e.g., poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) as described by Langer et al., 15: 167-277 (1981) and Langer, 12: 98-105 (1982) or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., 22: 547-556, 1983), non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra), degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (i.e. injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988).","The compounds of this invention can be administered in a sustained release form, for example a depot injection, implant preparation, or osmotic pump, which can be formulated in such a manner as to permit a sustained release of the active ingredient. Implants for sustained release formulations are well-known in the art. Implants may be formulated as, including but not limited to, microspheres, slabs, with biodegradable or non-biodegradable polymers. For example, polymers of lactic acid and\/or glycolic acid form an erodible polymer that is well-tolerated by the host. The implant is placed in proximity to the site of protein deposits (e.g., the site of formation of amyloid deposits associated with neurodegenerative disorders), so that the local concentration of active agent is increased at that site relative to the rest of the body.","The following formulation examples illustrate pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention.","Hard gelatin capsules

The mixture is then cooled until solid.","Another preferred formulation employed in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices (\u201cpatches\u201d). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,252, issued Jun. 11, 1991, herein incorporated by reference. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.","Direct or indirect placement techniques may be used when it is desirable or necessary to introduce the pharmaceutical composition to the brain. Direct techniques usually involve placement of a drug delivery catheter into the host's ventricular system to bypass the blood-brain barrier. One such implantable delivery system used for the transport of biological factors to specific anatomical regions of the body is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,472, which is herein incorporated by reference.","Indirect techniques, which are generally preferred, usually involve formulating the compositions to provide for drug latentiation by the conversion of hydrophilic drugs into lipid-soluble drugs. Latentiation is generally achieved through blocking of the hydroxy, carbonyl, sulfate, and primary amine groups present on the drug to render the drug more lipid soluble and amenable to transportation across the blood-brain barrier. Alternatively, the delivery of hydrophilic drugs may be enhanced by intra-arterial infusion of hypertonic solutions which can transiently open the blood-brain barrier.","According to one aspect of the invention, the compound may be administered alone, as a combination of compounds, in combination with remyelinating and\/or anti-alpha-4-antibodies, or in combination with an anti-inflammatory agent, which is typically used to treat conditions and diseases associated with demyelination. When administered in combination, the small compounds may be administered in the same formulation as these other compounds or compositions, or in a separate formulation. When administered in combinations, the remyelinating agents may be administered prior to, following, or concurrently with the other compounds and compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are found in Mace Publishing Company, Philadelphia, Pa., 17th ed. (1985).","In order to enhance serum half-life, the compounds may be encapsulated, introduced into the lumen of liposomes, prepared as a colloid, or other conventional techniques may be employed which provide an extended serum half-life of the compounds. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728 and 4,837,028 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.","Polymer Conjugates","Compounds of the present invention may be formulated and administered as polymer conjugates. Polymer conjugates may exhibit benefits over non-conjugated polymers, such as improved solubility and stability.","As such, single polymer molecules may be employed for conjugation with the compounds of the present invention, although it is also contemplated that more than one polymer molecule can be attached as well. The conjugated compounds of the present invention may find utility in both in vivo as well as non-in vivo applications. Additionally, it will be recognized that the conjugating polymer may utilize any other groups, moieties, or other conjugated species, as appropriate to the end use application. By way of example, it may be useful in some applications to covalently bond to the polymer a functional moiety imparting UV-degradation resistance, or antioxidation, or other properties or characteristics to the polymer. As a further example, it may be advantageous in some applications to functionalize the polymer to render it reactive and enable it to cross-link to a drug molecule and to enhance various properties or characteristics of the overall conjugated material. Accordingly, the polymer may contain any functionality, repeating groups, linkages, or other constitutent structures which do not preclude the efficacy of the conjugated the compounds of the present invention composition for its intended purpose.","Illustrative polymers that may usefully be employed to achieve these desirable characteristics are described supra, as well as in PCT WO 01\/54690 (to Zheng et al.) incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The polymer may be coupled to the compounds of the present invention (preferably via a linker moiety) to form stable bonds that are not significantly cleavable by human enzymes. Generally, for a bond to be not \u201csignificantly\u201d cleavable requires that no more than about 20% of the bonds connecting the polymer and the compounds of the present invention to which the polymer is linked, are cleaved within a 24 hour period, as measured by standard techniques in the art including, but not limited to, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).","The compounds of the present inventions are conjugated most preferably via a terminal reactive group on the polymer although conjugations can also be branched from non-terminal reactive groups. The polymer with the reactive group(s) is designated herein as \u201cactivated polymer\u201d. The reactive group selectively reacts with reactive groups on the compounds of the present invention. The activated polymer(s) is reacted so that attachment may occur at any available functional group on compounds of the present invention. Amino, carbon, free carboxylic groups, suitably activated carbonyl groups, hydroxyl, guanidyl, oxidized carbohydrate moieties, amino, carbon and mercapto groups of the compounds of the present invention (if available) can be used as attachment sites.","Generally, about 1.0 to about 10 moles of activated polymer per mole of the compounds of the present invention, depending on concentration, is employed. The final amount is a balance between maximizing the extent of the reaction while minimizing non-specific modifications of the product and, at the same time, defining chemistries that will maintain optimum activity, while at the same time optimizing the half-life of the compounds of the present invention. Preferably, at least about 50% of the biological activity of the compounds of the present invention is retained, and most preferably 100% is retained.","The reactions may take place by any suitable art-recognized method used for reacting biologically active materials with inert polymers. Generally, the process involves preparing an activated polymer and thereafter reacting the compounds of the present invention with the activated polymer to produce a soluble compound suitable for formulation. This modification reaction can be performed by several methods, which may involve one or more steps. The polymeric substances included herein are preferably water-soluble at room temperature. A non-limiting list of such polymers includes polyalkylene oxide homopolymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polypropylene glycols, polyoxyethylenated polyols, copolymers thereof and block copolymers thereof, provided that the water solubility of the block copolymers is maintained.","In the preferred practice of the present invention, polyalkylene glycol residues of C-Calkyl polyalkylene glycols, preferably polyethylene glycol (PEG), or poly(oxy)alkylene glycol residues of such glycols are advantageously incorporated in the polymer systems of interest. Thus, the polymer to which the compounds of the present invention are attached may be a homopolymer of polyethylene glycol (PEG) or is a polyoxyethylated polyol, provided in all cases that the polymer is soluble in water at room temperature. Non-limiting examples of such polymers include polyalkylene oxide homopolymers such as PEG or polypropylene glycols, polyoxyethylenated glycols, copolymers thereof and block copolymers thereof, provided that the water solubility of the block copolymer is maintained.","Examples of polyoxyethylated polyols include, but are not limited to, polyoxyethylated glycerol, polyoxyethylated sorbitol, polyoxyethylated glucose, or the like. The glycerol backbone of polyoxyethylated glycerol is the same backbone occurring naturally in, for example, animals and humans in mono-, di-, and triglycerides. Therefore, this branching would not necessarily be seen as a foreign agent in the body.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing list is merely illustrative and that all polymer materials having the qualities described herein are contemplated. The polymer need not have any particular molecular weight, but it is preferred that the molecular weight be between about 300 and 100,000, more preferably between 10,000 and 40,000. In particular, sizes of 20,000 or more are most effective at preventing loss of the product due to filtration in the kidneys.","Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and related polyalkylene oxides (PAO's) are known in the art as being usefull adjuncts for the preparation of drugs. See for example, PCT WO 93\/24476. PEG has also been conjugated to proteins, peptides and enzymes to increase aqueous solubility and circulating life in vivo as well as reduce antigenicity. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,298,643 and 5,321,095, both to Greenwald et al. PCT WO 93\/24476 discloses using an ester linkage to covalently bind an organic molecule to water-soluble polyethylene glycols. Thus, the compounds of the invention are preferably administered as polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives.","As such, the compounds or conjugates of this invention may contain one or more polyethylene glycol (PEG) substituents covalently attached thereto. Such conjugates demonstrate improved serum half-life, as compared to compounds lacking polyethylene glycol substituents. Without being limited to any theory, the improved serum half-life is believed to be associated with the covalent conjugation of at least one polyethylene glycol entity onto the structure of the compound.","The term \u201cPEG\u201d refers to polymers comprising multiple oxyalkylene units. Such polymers are optionally mono-capped with a substituent preferably selected from alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl, and substituted aryl. Inclusive of such polymers are those diamino capped polyoxyalkylene polymers which are known in the art as Jeffamines\u00ae. Still further, such polymers can optionally contain one or more non-oxyalkylene units such as the commercially available poly[di(ethylene glycol)adipates, poly[di(ethylene glycol)phthalate diols, and the like.","By PEG derivative is meant a polyethylene glycol polymer in which one or both of the terminal hydroxyl groups found in polyethylene glycol itself has been modified. Examples of suitable modifications include replacing one or both hydroxyl group(s) with alternative functional groups, which may be protected or unprotected, with low molecular weight ligands, or with another macromolecule or polymer. Modification of the terminal hydroxyl groups in the polyethylene glycol may be achieved by reacting the polyethylene glycol with compounds comprising complementary reactive functional groups, including functional groups which are able to undergo a reaction with the hydroxyl groups in polyethylene glycol. The PEG derivatives of the compounds of this invention may contain one or more polyethylene glycol (PEG) substituents covalently attached thereto by a linking group.","\u201cLinking group\u201d or \u201clinker\u201d refers to a group or groups that covalently links a non-PEG substituted compound of the present invention with one or more PEG groups. Each linker may be chiral or achiral, linear, branched or cyclic and may be homogenous or heterogeneous in its atom content (e.g., linkers containing only carbon atoms or linkers containing carbon atoms as well as one or more heteroatoms present on the linker.","The PEG group or groups are covalently attached to the linker using conventional chemical techniques providing for covalent linkage of the PEG group to the linker. The linker, in turn, may be covalently attached to the otherwise, non-PEG substituted compounds of the present invention. Reaction chemistries resulting in such linkages are well known in the art. Such reaction chemistries involve the use of complementary functional groups on the linker, the non-PEG substituted compound of the present invention and the PEG groups. Preferably, the complementary functional groups on the linker are selected relative to the functional groups available on the PEG group for bonding or which can be introduced onto the PEG group for bonding. Again, such complementary functional groups are well known in the art.","Such polymers have a number average molecular weight of from about 100 to 100,000; preferably from about 1,000 to 50,000; more preferably from about 10,000 to about 40,000.","5. Immunoglobulins","In one specific embodiment, the agents of the invention are immunoglobulins the when administered to a patient inhibit demyelination and\/or promote remyelination and\/or reduce paralysis. These immunoglobulins may be selected from immunoglobulins that selectively bind to an alpha-4 integrin or a dimer comprising alpha-4 integrin, such as alpha-4 beta-1, or bind VCAM-1. Preferably, the immunoglobulins bind alpha-4 beta-1 and inhibits alpha-4 beta-1 activity. The immunoglobulins are preferably antibodies or fragments thereof.","By \u201cantibodies\u201d is meant to include complete immunoglobulins such as IgG1 (or any IgG subclass) or IgM, or inhibitors derived from antibodies, such as natalizumab (ANTEGREN\u00ae).","By \u201cantibody homolog\u201d is meant to include intact antibodies consisting of immunoglobulin light and heavy chains linked via disulfide bonds. The term \u201cantibody homolog\u201d is also intended to encompass a protein comprising one or more polypeptides selected from immunoglobulin light chains, immunoglobulin heavy chains and antigen-binding fragments thereof which are capable of binding to one or more antigens (i.e., integrin or integrin ligand). The component polypeptides of an antibody homolog composed of more than one polypeptide may optionally be disulfide-bound or otherwise covalently crosslinked. Accordingly, therefore, \u201cantibody homologs\u201d include intact immunoglobulins of types IgA, IgG, IgE, IgD, IgM (as well as subtypes thereof, e.g., IgG1), wherein the light chains of the immunoglobulin may be of types kappa or lambda. \u201cAntibody homologs\u201d also includes portions of intact antibodies that retain antigen-binding specificity, for example Fab fragments, Fab\u2032 fragments, F(ab\u2032)fragments, Fv fragments, scFv fragments, heavy and light chain monomers or dimers or mixtures thereof.","When the agent of the invention is an antibody, a monoclonal antibody is the preferred antibody. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different epitopes, each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single epitope on the antigen. A second advantage of monoclonal antibodies is that they are synthesized by means that are uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins, e.g., by phage display or isolation from a hybridoma. Although the present invention intends to encompass both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies as agents of the invention, monoclonal antibodies are preferred as they are highly specific, and the invention is thus discussed primarily in terms of monoclonal antibodies.","\u201cNative antibodies and immunoglobulins\u201d are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 Daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one and (V) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and heavy chain variable domains (Clothia et al., 1985, 186: 651-63; Novotny et al., 1985, 82: 4592-6).","In addition, other antibodies can be identified using techniques available in the art. For example, monoclonal antibodies of the present invention can be produced using phage display technology. Antibody fragments, which selectively bind to an alpha-4 integrin or a dimer comprising an alpha-4 integrin, are then isolated. Exemplary preferred methods for producing such antibodies via phage display are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,225,447; 6,180,336; 6,172,197; 6,140,471; 5,969,108; 5,885,793; 5,872,215; 5,871,907; 5,858,657; 5,837,242; 5,733,743 and 5,565,332.","A \u201cvariant\u201d antibody refers herein to an immunoglobulin molecule that differs in amino acid sequence from a \u201cparent\u201d antibody amino acid sequence by virtue of addition, deletion and\/or substitution of one or more amino acid residue(s) in the parent antibody sequence. The parent antibody or immunoglobulin can be a polyclonal antibody, monoclonal antibody, humanized antibody, primatized\u00ae antibody or any antibody fragment. In the preferred embodiment, the variant comprises one or more amino acid substitution(s) in one or more hypervariable region(s) of the parent antibody. For example, the variant may comprise at least one, e.g., from about one to about ten, and preferably from about two to about five, substitutions in one or more hypervariable regions of the parent antibody. Ordinarily, the variant will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity with the parent antibody heavy or light chain variable domain sequences, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or homology with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the parent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. No N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or homology. The variant retains the ability to bind the receptor and preferably has properties that are superior to those of the parent antibody. For example, the variant may have a stronger binding affinity, enhanced ability to activate the receptor, etc. To analyze such properties, one should compare a Fab form of the variant to a Fab form of the parent antibody or a full-length form of the variant to a full-length form of the parent antibody. The variant antibody of particular interest herein is one which displays at least about 10 fold, preferably at least about 20 fold, and most preferably at least about 50 fold, enhancement in biological activity when compared to the parent antibody. The \u201cparent\u201d antibody herein is one that is encoded by an amino acid sequence used for the preparation of the variant. Preferably, the parent antibody has a human framework region and has human antibody constant region(s). For example, the parent antibody may be a humanized or human antibody. An \u201cisolated\u201d antibody is one that has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibodies will be prepared by at least one purification step.","5.1. Monoclonal Antibodies","Monoclonal antibodies can also be produced using the conventional hybridoma methods or genetically engineered. These methods have been widely applied to produce hybrid cell lines that secrete high levels of monoclonal antibodies against many specific antigens, and can also be used to produce monoclonal antibodies of the present invention. For example, mice (e.g., Balb\/c mice) can be immunized with an antigenic alpha-4 epitope by intraperitoneal injection. After sufficient time has passed to allow for an immune response, the mice are sacrificed and the spleen cells obtained and fused with myeloma cells, using techniques well known in the art. The resulting fused cells, hybridomas, are then grown in a selective medium, and the surviving cells grown in such medium using limiting dilution conditions. After cloning and recloning, hybridomas can be isolated that secrete antibodies (for example, of the IgG or IgM class or IgG1 subclass) that selectively bind to the target, alpha-4 or a dimer comprising an alpha-4 integrin. To produce agents specific for human use, the isolated monoclonal can then be used to produce chimeric and humanized antibodies. Antibodies can also be prepared that are anti-peptide antibodies. Such anti-peptide antibodies would be prepared against peptides of alpha-4 integrin.","The term \u201cchimeric\u201d, when referring to an agent of the invention, means that the agent is comprised of a linkage (chemical cross-linkage or covalent or other type) of two or more proteins having disparate structures and\/or having disparate sources of origin. Thus, a chimeric alpha-4 integrin antagonist may include one moiety that is an alpha-4 integrin antagonist or fragment and another moiety that is not an alpha-4 integrin antagonist.","A species of \u201cchimeric\u201d protein is a \u201cfusion\u201d or \u201cfusion protein\u201d refers to a co-linear, covalent linkage of two or more proteins or fragments thereof via their individual peptide backbones, most preferably through genetic expression of a polynucleotide molecule encoding those proteins. Thus, preferred fusion proteins are chimeric proteins that include a remyelinating antibody or fragment thereof covalently linked to a second moiety that is not original to the remyelinating antibody (i.e., which derives from another immuoglobulin or polypeptide). Preferred fusion proteins of the invention may include portions of intact antibodies that retain antigen-binding specificity, for example, Fab fragments, Fab\u2032 fragments, F(ab\u2032)fragments, Fv fragments, scFv fragments, heavy chain monomers or dimers, light chain monomers or dimers, dimers consisting of one heavy and one light chain, and the like.","The most preferred fusion proteins are chimeric and comprise a remyelinating moiety fused or otherwise linked to all or part of the hinge and constant regions of an immunoglobulin light chain, heavy chain, or both. Thus, this invention features a molecule which includes: (1) remyelinating moiety, (2) a second peptide, e.g., one which increases solubility or in vivo life time of the remyelinating moiety, e.g., a member of the immunoglobulin super family or fragment or portion thereof, e.g., a portion or a fragment of IgG, e.g., the human IgG1 heavy chain constant region, e.g., CH2, CH3, and hinge regions. Specifically, a \u201cremyelinating moiety\/Ig fusion\u201d is a protein comprising a biologically active remyclinating moiety of the invention. A species of remyelinating agents is an \u201cintegrin\/Fc fusion\u201d which is a protein comprising an remyelinating immunoglobulin of the invention linked to at least a part of the constant domain of an immunoglobulin. A preferred Fc fusion comprises an remyelinating immunoglobulin of the invention linked to a fragment of an antibody containing the C terminal domain of the heavy immunoglobulin chains.","The term \u201cfusion protein\u201d also means a remyelinating moiety that is chemically linked via a mono- or hetero-functional molecule to a second moiety that is not a remyelinating moiety (resulting in a \u201cchimeric\u201d molecule) and is made de novo from purified protein as described below. Thus, one example of a chemically linked, as opposed to recombinantly linked, chimeric molecule that is a fusion protein may comprise: (1) an alpha-4 integrin subunit targeting moiety, e.g., a VCAM-1 moiety capable of binding to VLA-4) on the surface of VLA-4 bearing cells; (2) a second molecule which increases solubility or in vivo life time of the targeting moiety, e.g., a polyalkylene glycol polymer such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). The alpha-4 targeting moiety can be any naturally occurring alpha-4 ligand or fragment thereof, e.g., a VCAM-1 peptide or a similar conservatively substituted amino acid sequence.","Chimeric, primatized\u00ae and humanized antibodies can be produced from non-human antibodies, and can have the same or similar binding affinity as the antibody from which they are produced. Techniques developed for the production of chimeric antibodies (Morrison et al., 1984 81: 6851; Neuberger et al., 1984 312: 604; Takeda et al., 1985 314: 452) by splicing the genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from, for example, a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used; such antibodies are within the scope of this invention. For example, a nucleic acid encoding a variable (V) region of a mouse monoclonal antibody can be joined to a nucleic acid encoding a human constant (C) region, e.g., IgG1 or IgG4. The resulting antibody is thus a species hybrid, generally with the antigen binding domain from the non-human antibody and the C or effector domain from a human antibody.","Humanized antibodies are antibodies with variable regions that are primarily from a human antibody (the acceptor antibody), but which have complementarity determining regions substantially from a non-human antibody (the donor antibody). See, e.g., Queen et al., 1989 86: 10029-33; WO 90\/07861; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,054,297; 5,693,761; 5,585,089; 5,530,101 and 5,224,539. The constant region or regions of these antibodies are generally also from a human antibody. The human variable domains are typically chosen from human antibodies having sequences displaying a high homology with the desired non-human variable region binding domains. The heavy and light chain variable residues can be derived from the same antibody, or a different human antibody. In addition, the sequences can be chosen as a consensus of several human antibodies, such as described in WO 92\/22653.","Specific amino acids within the human variable region are selected for substitution based on the predicted conformation and antigen binding properties. This can be determined using techniques such as computer modeling, prediction of the behavior and binding properties of amino acids at certain locations within the variable region, and observation of effects of substitution. For example, when an amino acid differs between a non-human variable region and a human variable region, the human variable region can be altered to reflect the amino acid composition of the non-human variable region. Several examples of humanizing anti-alpha-4 antibodies are described herein.","By \u201chumanized antibody homolog\u201d is meant an antibody homolog, produced by recombinant DNA technology, in which some or all of the amino acids of a human immunoglobulin light or heavy chain that are not required for antigen binding have been substituted for the corresponding amino acids from a nonhuman mammalian immunoglobulin light or heavy chain. A \u201chuman antibody homolog\u201d is an antibody homolog in which all the amino acids of an immunoglobulin light or heavy chain (regardless of whether or not they are required for antigen binding) are derived from a human source.","In a specific embodiment, the antibodies used in the chronic dosage regime of the present invention are humanized antibodies as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,299, which is incorporated herein by reference.","In another embodiment, transgenic mice containing human antibody genes can be immunized with an antigenic alpha-4 structure and hybridoma technology can be used to generate human antibodies that selectively bind to alpha-4.","Chimeric, human and\/or humanized antibodies can be produced by recombinant expression, e.g., expression in human hybridomas (Cole et al., Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985)), in myeloma cells or in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Alternatively, antibody-coding sequences can be incorporated into vectors suitable for introducing into the genome of animal thereby producing a transgenic animal. One example would be to produce such antibodies in the milk of a transgenic animal such as a bovine. See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,849,992 and 5,304,489. Suitable transgenes include trangenes having a promoter and\/or enhancer from a mammary gland specific gene, for example casein or \u03b2-lactoglobulin.","5.1.1. Humanized and Primatized\u00ae Antibodies","In one embodiment of the invention, humanized (and primatized\u00ae) immunoglobulins (or antibodies) specific for the alpha-4 subunit of VLA-4 are provided, which when administered in an effective amount inhibit demyelination and\/or promote remyelination and\/or reduce paralysis. Humanized and primatized\u00ae antibodies are antibodies of animal (typically mammalian) origin that have been modified using genetic engineering techniques. The techniques are used to replace constant region and\/or variable region framework sequences with juman sequences, while retaining the original antigen specificity of the antibody. Humanized and primatized\u00ae antibodies are commonly derived from rodent (e.g., mouse and hamster) antibodies with specificity for human antigens (e.g., human VCAM-1 or human VLA-4). By reshaping the donor antibody (the antibody from the animal to which the antigen was administered) to have sequences from the animal to which the antibody will be administered for therapeutic purposes, there will be a reduced host response in the animal upon administration of the antibody. Only the Fc regions or all but the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) can be replaced with acceptor domains, wherein the acceptor is the animal to whom the reshaped antibody is to be administered (e.g., mammals such as humans, domesticated animals, agricultural animals and the like).","Antibodies that bind to the alpha-4 subunit of VLA-4 which when administered to a patient in an effective amount inhibit demylination are preferred. More preferred are those antibodies which when administered in an effective amount induce remyelination and\/or reduce paralysis in a subject wherein the subject is suffering from a demyelinating disease or condition.","Typically, CDRs of a murine antibody are transplanted onto the corresponding regions in a human antibody, since it is the CDRs (i.e., three in antibody heavy chains, three in light chains) that are the regions of the mouse antibody (or any other animal antibody), which bind to a specific antigen. Transplantation of CDRs is achieved by genetic engineering, whereby CDR DNA sequences are determined by cloning of murine heavy and light chain variable (V) region gene segments, and are then transferred to corresponding human V regions by site directed mutagenesis. In the final stage of the process, human constant region gene segments of the desired isotype (usually gamma I for CH and kappa for CL) are added and the humanized heavy and light chain genes are co-expressed in mammalian cells to produce soluble humanized antibody.","The transfer of these CDRs to a human antibody confers on this antibody the antigen binding properties of the original murine antibody. The six CDRs in the murine antibody are mounted structurally on a V region \u201cframework\u201d region. The reason that CDR-grafting is successful is that framework regions between mouse and human antibodies may have very similar 3-D structures with similar points of attachment for CDRS, such that CDRs can be interchanged. Such humanized antibody homologs may be prepared, as exemplified in, e.g., Jones et al., 1986, 321: 522-5; Riechmann et al., 1988, 332: 323-7; Queen et al., 1989, 86: 10029; and Orlandi et al., 1989, 86: 3833.","Nonetheless, certain amino acids within framework regions are thought to interact with CDRs and to influence overall antigen binding affinity. The direct transfer of CDRs from a murine antibody to produce a recombinant humanized antibody without any modifications of the human V region frameworks often results in a partial or complete loss of binding affinity. In several cases, it appears to be critical to alter residues in the framework regions of the acceptor antibody (e.g., human antibody) in order to obtain binding activity.","Queen et al., 1989 (supra) and WO 90\/07861 (Protein Design Labs) have described the preparation of a humanized antibody that contains modified residues in the framework regions of the acceptor antibody by combining the CDRs of a murine MAb (anti-Tac) with human immunoglobulin framework and constant regions. One solution to solve the problem of the loss of binding affinity without any modifications of the human V region framework residues involves two key steps. First, the human V framework regions are chosen by computer analysts for optimal protein sequence homology to the V region framework of the original murine antibody. In the second step, the tertiary structure of the murine V region is modeled by computer in order to visualize framework amino acid residues that are likely to interact with the murine CDRs. These murine amino acid residues are then superimposed on the homologous human framework. For additional detail, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,693,762; 5,693,761; 5,585,089; and 5,530,101 (Protein Design Labs).","Certain alpha-4 subunit-containing integrin antagonists useful in the present invention include chimeric and humanized recombinant antibody homologs (i.e., intact immunoglobulins and portions thereof) with B epitope specificity that have been prepared and are described in U.S. Pat.

The humanized light chain comprises three complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) having amino acid sequences from the corresponding complementarity determining regions of a mouse 21.6 immunoglobulin light chain, and a variable region framework from a human kappa light chain variable region framework sequence except in at least position the amino acid position is occupied by the same amino acid present in the equivalent position of the mouse 21.6 immunoglobulin light chain variable region framework. The humanized heavy chain comprises three complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) having amino acid sequences from the corresponding complementarity determining regions of a mouse 21.6 immunoglobulin heavy chain, and a variable region framework from a human heavy chain variable region framework sequence except in at least one position the amino acid position is occupied by the same amino acid present in the equivalent position of the mouse 21.6 immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework. See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,840,299 and 6,033,665","Fragments of an isolated alpha-4 integrin antagonist (e.g., fragments of antibody homologs described herein) can also be produced efficiently by recombinant methods, by proteolytic digestion, or by chemical synthesis using methods known to those of skill in the art. In recombinant methods, internal or terminal fragments of a polypeptide can be generated by removing one or more nucleotides from one end (for a terminal fragment) or both ends (for an internal fragment) of a DNA sequence which encodes for the isolated hedgehog polypeptide. Expression of the mutagenized DNA produces polypeptide fragments. Digestion with certain endonucleases can also generate DNAs, which encode an array of fragments. DNAs that encode fragments of a protein can also be generated by random shearing, restriction digestion, or a combination thereof. Protein fragments can be generated directly from intact proteins. Peptides can be cleaved specifically by proteolytic enzymes, including, but not limited to plasmin, thrombin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, or pepsin. Each of these enzymes is specific for the type of peptide bond it attacks. Trypsin catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in which the carbonyl group is from a basic amino acid, usually arginine or lysine. Pepsin and chymotrypsin catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds from aromatic amino acids, such as tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. Alternative sets of cleaved protein fragments are generated by preventing cleavage at a site which is susceptible to a proteolytic enzyme. For instance, reaction of the \u03b5-amino acid group of lysine with ethyltrifluorothioacetate in mildly basic solution yields blocked amino acid residues whose adjacent peptide bond is no longer susceptible to hydrolysis by trypsin. Proteins can be modified to create peptide linkages that are susceptible to proteolytic enzymes. For instance, alkylation of cysteine residues with \u03b2-haloethylamines yields peptide linkages that are hydrolyzed by trypsin (Lindley, 1956, 178: 647). In addition, chemical reagents that cleave peptide chains at specific residues can be used. For example, cyanogen bromide cleaves peptides at methionine residues (Gross et al., 1961, 83: 1510). Thus, by treating proteins with various combinations of modifiers, proteolytic enzymes and\/or chemical reagents, the proteins may be divided into fragments of a desired length with no overlap of the fragments, or divided into overlapping fragments of a desired length.","5.1.1.1. Natalizumab And Related Humanized Antibodies","The invention provides for a method of using humanized immunoglobulins that specifically bind to a VLA-4 ligand either alone or in combination to promote remyelination. One preferred antibody for use in such methods of treatment and in medicaments includes that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,299 assigned to Elan Pharmaceuticals, which is herein incorporated in its entirety. Another aspect contemplates the use of fragments of these antibodies with remyelinating activity as assessed in vivo.","The humanized antibodies comprise a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain. In one aspect, the humanized light chain can comprise three complementarity determining regions (i.e., CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) having amino acid sequences from the corresponding complementarity determining regions of a mouse 21-6 immunoglobulin light chain, and a variable region framework from a human kappa light chain variable region framework sequence except in at least one position selected from a first group consisting of positions L45, L49, L58 and L69, wherein the amino acid position is occupied by the same amino acid present in the equivalent position of the mouse 21.6 immunoglobulin light chain variable region framework.","The humanized heavy chain comprises three complementarity determining regions (i.e., CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) having amino acid sequences from the corresponding complementarity determining regions of a mouse 21-6 immunoglobulin heavy chain, and a variable region framework from a human heavy chain variable region framework sequence except in at least one position selected from a group consisting of H27, H28, H29, H30, H44, H71, wherein the amino acid position is occupied by the same amino acid present in the equivalent position of the mouse 21-6 immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework. The immunoglobulins specifically bind to VLA-4 with an affinity having a lower limit of about 10Mand an upper limit of about five times the affinity of the mouse 21-6 immunoglobulin.","Usually, the humanized light and heavy chain variable region frameworks are from RE1 and 21\/28\u2032CL variable region framework sequences respectively. When the humanized light chain variable region framework is from RE1, at least two framework amino acids are replaced. One amino acid is from the first group of positions described supra. The other amino acids are from a third group consisting of positions L104, L105 and L107. This position is occupied by the same amino acid present in the equivalent position of a kappa light chain from a human immunoglobulin other than RE1.","Some humanized immunoglobulins have a mature light chain variable region sequence designated La or Lb, or a mature heavy chain variable region sequence designated Ha, Hb or Hc (). Preferred humanized immunoglobulins include those having a La light chain and an Ha, Hb or Hc heavy chain ().","The humanized immunoglobulins have variable framework regions substantially from a human immunoglobulin (termed an acceptor immunoglobulin) and complementarity determining regions substantially from a mouse immunoglobulin termed mu MAb 21.6 (referred to as the donor immunoglobulin). The constant region(s), if present, are also substantially from a human immunoglobulin. The humanized antibodies exhibit a specific binding affinity for VLA-4 of at least 10, 10, 10, or 10M. Usually the upper limit of binding affinity of the humanized antibodies for VLA-4 is within a factor of three or five of that of mu MAb 21.6 (about 10M). Often the lower limit of binding affinity is also within a factor of three or five of that of mu MAb 21.6.","Humanized antibodies can be produced as exemplified, for example, with the mouse MAb 21.6 monoclonal antibody. The starting material for production of humanized antibodies is mu MAb 21.6. The isolation and properties of this antibody are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,655 (assigned to Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Briefly, mu MAb 21.6 is specific for the alpha-4 subunit of VLA-4 and has been shown to inhibit human lymphocyte binding to tissue cultures of rat brain cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the numbering convention of Kabat.","The next step involved selecting human antibodies to supply framework residues. The substitution of mouse CDRs into a human variable domain framework is most likely to result in retention of their correct spatial orientation if the human variable domain framework adopts the same or similar conformation to the mouse variable framework from which the CDRs originated. This is achieved by obtaining the human variable domains from human antibodies whose framework sequences exhibit a high degree of sequence identity with the murine variable framework domains from which the CDRs were derived. The heavy and light chain variable framework regions can be derived from the same or different human antibody sequences. The human antibody sequences can be the sequences of naturally occurring human antibodies or can be consensus sequences of several human antibodies. See Kettleborough et al., 4: 773 (1991); Kolbinger et al., 6: 971 (1993).","Suitable human antibody sequences are identified by computer comparisons of the amino acid sequences of the mouse variable regions with the sequences of known human antibodies. The comparison is performed separately for heavy and light chains but the principles are similar for each. This comparison reveals that the mu 21.6 light chain shows greatest sequence identity to human light chains of subtype kappa 1; the mu 21.6 heavy chain shows greatest sequence identity to human heavy chains of subtype one, as defined by Kabat, supra. Thus, light and heavy human framework regions are usually derived from human antibodies of these subtypes, or from consensus sequences of such subtypes. The preferred light and heavy chain human variable regions showing greatest sequence identity to the corresponding regions from mu MAb 21.6 are from antibodies RE1 and 21\/28\u2032CL respectively.","Computer modeling can then be used to further enhance the humanized antibody's ability to bind to its cognate antigen. The unnatural juxtaposition of murine CDR regions with human variable framework region can result in unnatural conformational restraints, which, unless corrected by substitution of certain amino acid residues, lead to loss of binding affinity. The selection of amino acid residues for substitution is determined, in part, by computer modeling. Computer hardware and software for producing three-dimensional images of immunoglobulin molecules are widely available. In general, molecular models are produced starting from solved structures for immunoglobulin chains or domains thereof. The chains to be modeled are compared for amino acid sequence similarity with chains or domains of solved three dimensional structures, and the chains or domains showing the greatest sequence similarity is\/are selected as starting points for construction of the molecular model. For example, for the light chain of mu MAb 21.6, the starting point for modeling the framework regions, CDR1 and CDR2 regions, was the human light chain RE1. For the CDR3 region, the starting point was the CDR3 region from the light chain of a different human antibody HyHEL-5. The solved starting structures are modified to allow for differences between the actual amino acids in the immunoglobulin chains or domains being modeled, and those in the starting structure. The modified structures are then assembled into a composite immunoglobulin. Finally, the model is refined by energy minimization and by verifying that all atoms are within appropriate distances from one another and that bond lengths and angles are within chemically acceptable limits.","As noted supra, the humanized antibodies of the invention comprise variable framework regions substantially from a human immunoglobulin and complementarity determining regions substantially from a mouse immunoglobulin termed mu MAb 21.6. Having identified the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of mu MAb 21.6 and appropriate human acceptor immunoglobulins, the next step is to determine which, if any, residues from these components should be substituted to optimize the properties of the resulting humanized antibody. In general, substitution of human amino acid residues with murine should be minimized, because introduction of murine residues increases the risk of the antibody eliciting a HAMA response in humans. Amino acids are selected for substitution based on their possible influence on CDR conformation and\/or binding to antigen. Investigation of such possible influences is by modeling, examination of the characteristics of the amino acids at particular locations, or empirical observation of the effects of substitution or mutagenesis of particular amino acids.","When an amino acid differs between a mu MAb 21.6 variable framework region and an equivalent human variable framework region, the human framework amino acid should usually be substituted by the equivalent mouse amino acid if it is reasonably expected that the amino acid:\n\n","Other candidates for substitution are acceptor human framework amino acids that are unusual for a human immunoglobulin at that position (e.g., amino acids at positions L104, L105 and L107 of mu MAb 21.6). These amino acids can be substituted with amino acids from the equivalent position of more typical human immunoglobulins. Alternatively, amino acids from equivalent positions in the mouse MAb 21.6 can be introduced into the human framework regions when such amino acids are typical of human immunoglobulin at the equivalent positions.","In general, substitution of all or most of the amino acids fulfilling the above criteria is desirable. Occasionally, however, there is some ambiguity about whether a particular amino acid meets the above criteria, and alternative variant immunoglobulins are produced, one of which has that particular substitution, the other of which does not. The humanized antibodies will usually contain a substitution of a human light chain framework residue with a corresponding mu MAb 21.6 residue in at least 1, 2 or 3, and more usually 4, of the following positions: L45, L49, L58 and L69. The humanized antibodies also usually contain a substitution of a human heavy chain framework residue in at least 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and sometimes 6, of the following positions: H27, H28, H29, H30, H44 and H71. Optionally, H36 may also be substituted. In preferred embodiments when the human light chain acceptor immunoglobulin is RE1, the light chain also contains substitutions in at least 1 or 2, and more usually 3, of the following positions: L104, L105 and L107. These positions are substituted with the amino acid from the equivalent position of a human immunoglobulin having a more typical amino acid residues. Appropriate amino acids to substitute are shown in .","Usually the CDR regions in humanized antibodies are substantially identical, and more usually, identical to the corresponding CDR regions in the mu MAb 21.6 antibody. Occasionally, however, it is desirable to change one of the residues in a CDR region. For example, Example 4 identifies an amino acid similarity between the mu MAb 21.6 CDR3 and the VCAM-1 ligand. This observation suggests that the binding affinity of humanized antibodies might be improved by redesigning the heavy chain CDR3 region to resemble VCAM-1 even more closely. Accordingly, one or more amino acids from the CDR3 domain can be substituted with amino acids from the VCAM-1 binding domain. Although not usually desirable, it is sometimes possible to make one or more conservative amino acid substitutions of CDR residues without appreciably affecting the binding affinity of the resulting humanized immunoglobulin.","Other than for the specific amino acid substitutions discussed above, the framework regions of humanized immunoglobulins are usually substantially identical, and more usually, identical to the framework regions of the human antibodies from which they were derived. Of course, many of the amino acids in the framework region make little or no direct contribution to the specificity or affinity of an antibody. Thus, many individual conservative substitutions of framework residues can be tolerated without appreciable change of the specificity or affinity of the resulting humanized immunoglobulin. However, in general, such substitutions are undesirable.","Production of Variable Regions. Having conceptually selected the CDR and framework components of humanized immunoglobulins, a variety of methods are available for producing such immunoglobulins. Because of the degeneracy of the code, a variety of nucleic acid sequences will encode each immunoglobulin amino acid sequence. The desired nucleic acid sequences can be produced by de novo solid-phase DNA synthesis or by PCR mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant of the desired polynucleotide. Oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis is a preferred method for preparing substitution, deletion and insertion variants of target polypeptide DNA. See Adelman et al., 2: 183 (1983). Briefly, the target polypeptide DNA is altered by hybridizing an oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation to a single-stranded DNA template. After hybridization, a DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that incorporates the oligonucleotide primer, and encodes the selected alteration in the target polypeptide DNA.","Selection of Constant Region. The variable segments of humanized antibodies produced as described supra are typically linked to at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Human constant region DNA sequences can be isolated in accordance with well-known procedures from a variety of human cells, but preferably immortalized B-cells (see Kabat et al., supra, and WO 87\/02671) (each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety). Ordinarily, the antibody will contain both light chain and heavy chain constant regions. The heavy chain constant region usually includes CH1, hinge, CH2, CH3, and CH4 regions.","The humanized antibodies include antibodies having all types of constant regions, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA and IgE, and any isotype, including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. When it is desired that the humanized antibody exhibit cytotoxic activity, the constant domain is usually a complement-fixing constant domain and the class is typically IgG. When such cytotoxic activity is not desirable, the constant domain may be of the IgGclass. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype.","5.1.1.2. Other Anti-VLA-4 Antibodies","Other anti-VLA-4 antibodies include but are not limited to HP1\/2, HP-2\/1, HP2\/4, L25, and P4C2. These antibodies may also be administered in an effective amount to inhibit demylination and\/or promote remyelination and\/or reduce paralysis in a patient as one skilled in the art as discussed herein and as generally known in the art would readily appreciate.","Frequently, monoclonal antibodies created in mice are later humanized to avoid the human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) immune response in a human subject injected with a mouse antibody. This occurs by CDR grafting or reshaping. Thus, typically the antibodies are first mouse monoclonal antibodies that through CDR grafting or reshaping become humanized, as discussed above for the 21.6 antibody.","Specifically, the humanized antibodies have specificity for VLA-4 and have the ability to promote remyelination, prevent demyelination and\/or reduce paralysis. These antibodies are derived from sources (e.g., mouse typically) that at least one or more of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the variable domains are derived from a donor non-human anti-VLA-4 antibody, and in which there may or may not have been minimal alteration of the acceptor antibody heavy and\/or light variable framework region in order to retain donor antibody binding specificity. Preferably, the antigen binding regions of the CDR-grafted heavy chain variable domain comprise the CDRs corresponding to positions 31-35 (CDR1), 50-65 (CDR2) and 95-102 (CDR3). In a preferred embodiment, the heavy chain further includes non-human residues at framework positions 27-30 (Kabat numbering). The heavy chain can further include non-human residues at framework position 75 (Kabat numbering). The heavy chain can further include non-human residues at framework position(s) 77-79 or 66-67 and 69-71 or 84-85 or 38 and 40 or 24 (Kabat numbering). Preferably, the antigen binding regions of the CDR-grafted light chain variable domain comprise CDRs corresponding to positions 24-34 (CDR1), 50-56 (CDR2) and 89-97 (CDR3). In a preferred embodiment, the light chain further includes non-human residues at framework positions 60 and 67 (Kabat numbering). These residue designations are numbered according to the Kabat numbering (Kabat et al., 5ed. 4 vol. , U.S. Department of Health Human Services, NIH, USA (1991)).","Synthesis and Humanization of Mouse Antibody HP1\/2.

Although Tyr-80 is invariant in subgroup IIC other sequenced murine Vregions have other aromatic amino acids at this position, although none have Trp. The majority of human and murine Vs have an arginine residue at Kabat position 94. The presence of Asp-94 in HP1\/2 Vis extremely rare; there is only one reported example of a negatively charged residue at this position. Proline at Kabat position 113 is also unusual but is unlikely to be important in the conformation of the CDRs because of its distance from them. The amino acids making up CDR1 have been found in three other sequenced murine Vregions.

No. 6,602,503, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Various combinations of the above light and heavy chains can be prepared based on computer modeling as known in the art.","Additional antibodies that recognize and bind to alpha-4 integrin are known in the art. These include but are not limited to GG5\/3 (Keszthelyi et al., 47(4): 1053-1059 (1996)), FW3-218-1 (ATCC No.: HB-261; an IgG2b antibody against sheep alpha 4 integrin), and R1-2 (ATCC No.: HB-227; IgG2b antibody developed in ). Whether the antibodies are developed in mouse or other animals, each of the sequences can be genetically engineered such that they are humanized based on what is known in the art and with the aid of computer modeling. The anti-alpha-4 integrin humanized antibodies can then be assessed for their ability to promote remyelination and\/or inhibit demyelination and\/or reduce paralysis based on the in vitro and in vivo assays disclosed herein.","5.2. Antibody Fragments","Also contemplated for use in treating disorders and conditions involving demyelination are antibody fragments of antibodies that bind to anti-alpha-4 or VCAM-1 such that they inhibit VLA-4 and VCAM-1 interaction. Antibody fragments include Fab, F(ab\u2032), scFv and Fv fragments which can be used in the compositions disclosed herein.","The term \u201cFab fragment\u201d as used herein refers to a partial antibody molecule containing a single antigen-binding region, which consists of a portion of both the heavy and light chains of the molecule.","The term \u201cF(ab\u2032)fragment\u201d as used herein refers to a partial antibody molecule containing both antigen binding regions, and which consists of the light chains and a portion of the heavy chains of the molecule.","The term \u201cFv fragment\u201d as used herein refers to the portion of the antibody molecule involved in antigen recognition and binding.","The term \u201cscFv\u201d as used herein refers to single chain Fv (scFv) fragments. These scFv fragments are recombinant antibody derivatives that consist only of the variable domains of antibody heavy and light chains connected by a flexible linker. scFv antibody fragments comprise the Vand Vdomains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the scfv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun in vol. 113, 269-315 (Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York 1994).","Also included in antibody fragments are diabodies. The term \u201cdiabodies\u201d refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V) connected to a light chain variable domain (V) in the same polypeptide chain (V-V). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93\/11161; and Hollinger et al., 1993 90: 6444-8.","Antibody fragments also include linear antibodies. The expression \u201clinear antibodies\u201d when used throughout this application refers to the antibodies described in, e.g., Zapata et al., 1995 8(10): 1057-62. Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (V-C1-V-C1), which form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.","Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments, called \u201cFab\u201d fragments, each with a single antigen binding site, and a residual \u201cFc\u201d fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab\u2032)fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.","Several mouse anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibodies have been previously described. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,602,503, 6,033,665, and 5,840,299, as further discussed herein and which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety; Sanchez-Madrid et al., 1986, 16: 1343-9; Hemler et al., 1987, 262: 11478-85; Pulido et al., 1991, 266: 10241-45; Issekutz et al., 1991, 147: 109 (TA-2 MAb)). These anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibodies and other anti-VLA-4 antibodies (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,507\u2014Biogen, Inc. and references cited therein) capable of recognizing the alpha and\/or beta chain of VLA-4 will be useful in the methods of treatment according to the present invention. AntiVLA-4 antibodies that will recognize the VLA-4 alpha-4 chain epitopes involved in binding to VCAM-1 and fibronectin ligands (i.e., antibodies which can bind to VLA-4 at a site involved in ligand recognition and block VCAM-1 and fibronectin binding) are preferred. Such antibodies have been defined as B epitope-specific antibodies (B1 or B2) (Pulido et al., 1991, supra) and are also anti-VLA-4 antibodies according to the present invention.","Fully human monoclonal antibody homologs against VLA-4 are another preferred binding agent that may block or coat VLA-4 ligands in the method of the invention. In their intact form these may be prepared using in vitro-primed human splenocytes, as described by Boerner et al., 1991, 147: 86-95. Alternatively, they may be prepared by repertoire cloning as described by Persson et al., 1991, 88: 2432-36 or by Huang et al., 1991, 141: 227-236. U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,230 (Aug. 25, 1998, \u201cProcess for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies and their use\u201d) describes preparation of human monoclonal antibodies from human B cells. According to this process, human antibody-producing B cells are immortalized by infection with an Epstein-Barr virus, or a derivative thereof, that expresses Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2). EBNA2 function, which is required for immortalization, is subsequently shut off, which results in an increase in antibody production. Additional methods are known in the art.","For yet another method for producing fully human antibodies, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,650, which describes transgenic non-human animals capable of producing heterologous antibodies and transgenic non-human animals having inactivated endogenous immunoglobulin genes. Endogenous immunoglobulin genes are suppressed by antisense polynucleotides and\/or by antiserum directed against endogenous immunoglobulins. Heterologous antibodies are encoded by immunoglobulin genes not normally found in the genome of that species of non-human animal. One or more transgenes containing sequences of unrearranged heterologous human immunoglobulin heavy chains are introduced into a non-human animal thereby forming a transgenic animal capable of functionally rearranging transgenic immunoglobulin sequences and producing a repertoire of antibodies of various isotypes encoded by human immunoglobulin genes. Such heterologous human antibodies are produced in B-cells, which are thereafter immortalized, e.g., by fusing with an immortalizing cell line such as a myeloma or by manipulating such B-cells by other techniques to perpetuate a cell line capable of producing a monoclonal, heterologous, fully human antibody homolog. Large non-immunized human phage display libraries may also be used to isolate high affinity antibodies that can be developed as human therapeutics using standard phage technology.","Following the early methods for the preparation of true \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d (i.e., where the entire constant and entire variable regions are derived from different sources), a new approach was described in EP 0239400 (Winter et al.) whereby antibodies are altered by substitution (within a given variable region) of their complementarity determining regions (CDRs) for one species with those from another. This process may be used, for example, to substitute the CDRs from human heavy and light chain Ig variable region domains with alternative CDRs from murine variable region domains. These altered Ig variable regions may subsequently be combined with human Ig constant regions to created antibodies, which are totally human in composition except for the substituted murine CDRs. Such CDR-substituted antibodies would be predicted to be less likely to elicit an immune response in humans compared to true chimeric antibodies, because the CDR-substituted antibodies contain considerably less non-human components. The process for humanizing monoclonal antibodies via CDR \u201cgrafting\u201d has been termed \u201creshaping\u201d (Riechmann et al., 1988, 332: 323-7; and Verhoeyen et al., 1988, 239: 1534-6).","5.3. Antibody Purification","When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al., 10: 163-7 (1992) describe a procedure for isolating antibodies, which are secreted to the periplasmic space of Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. In instances when the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.","The antibody composition prepared from the cells is preferably subjected to at least one purification step prior to LPHIC. Examples of suitable purification steps include hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human \u03b31, \u03b32, or \u03b34 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., 1983 62: 1-13). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human \u03b33 (Guss et al., 1986 5: 1567-75). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX\u2122 resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE\u2122, chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.","Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminant(s) is subjected to LPHIC. Often, the antibody composition to be purified will be present in a buffer from the previous purification step. However, it may be necessary to add a buffer to the antibody composition prior to the LPHIC step. Many buffers are available and can be selected by routine experimentation. The pH of the mixture comprising the antibody to be purified and at least one contaminant in a loading buffer is adjusted to a pH of about 2.5-4.5 using either an acid or base, depending on the starting pH. Preferably, the loading buffer has a low salt concentration (i.e., less than about 0.25 M salt).","The mixture is loaded on the HIC column. HIC columns normally comprise a base matrix (e.g., cross-linked agarose or synthetic copolymer material) to which hydrophobic ligands (e.g., alkyl or aryl groups) are coupled. A preferred HIC column comprises an agarose resin substituted with phenyl groups (e.g., a Phenyl SEPHAROSE\u2122 column). Many HIC columns are available commercially. Examples include, but are not limited to, Phenyl SEPHAROSE 6 FAST FLOW\u2122 column with low or high substitution (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, AB, Sweden); Phenyl SEPHAROSE\u2122 High Performance column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, AB, Sweden); Octyl SEPHAROSE\u2122 High Performance column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, AB, Sweden); FRACTOGEL\u2122 EMD Propyl or FRACTOGEL\u2122 EMD Phenyl columns (E. Merck, Germany); MACRO-PREP\u2122 Methyl or MACRO-PREP\u2122 t-Butyl Supports (Bio-Rad, California); WP HI-Propyl (C)\u2122 column (J. T. Baker, New Jersey); and TOYOPEARL\u2122 ether, phenyl or butyl columns (TosoHaas, Pa.).","The antibody is eluted from the column using an elution buffer, which is normally the same as the loading buffer. The elution buffer can be selected using routine experimentation. The pH of the elution buffer is between about 2.5-4.5 and has a low salt concentration (i.e., less than about 0.25 M salt). It has been discovered that it is not necessary to use a salt gradient to elute the antibody of interest; the desired product is recovered in the flow through fraction, which does not bind significantly to the column.","The LPHIC step provides a way to remove a correctly folded and disulfide bonded antibody from unwanted contaminants (e.g., incorrectly associated light and heavy fragments). In particular, the method provides a means to substantially remove an impurity characterized herein as a correctly folded antibody fragment whose light and heavy chains fail to associate through disulfide bonding.","Diagnostic or therapeutic formulations of the purified protein can be made by providing the antibody composition in the form of a physiologically acceptable carrier, examples of which are provided below.","To remove contaminants (e.g., unfolded antibody and incorrectly associated light and heavy fragments) from the HIC column so that it can be re-used, a composition including urea (e.g., 6.0 M urea, 1% MES buffer pH 6.0, 4 mM ammonium sulfate) can be flowed through the column. Other methods are known in the art.","5.4. Immunoglobulin Formulations","Antibodies and immunoglobulins having the desired therapeutic effect may be administered in a physiologically acceptable carrier to a subject. The antibodies may be administered in a variety of ways including but not limited to parenteral administration, including subcutaneous, subdural, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intraarterial, or intralesional routes of administration, localized (e.g., surgical application or surgical suppository), and pulmonary (e.g., aerosols, inhalation, or powder) and as described further below.","Depending upon the manner of introduction, the immunoglobulins may be formulated in a variety of ways. The concentration of therapeutically active immunoglobulin in the formulation (i.e., a formulation sufficient to inhibit demyelination and\/or promote remyelination) may vary from about 1 mg\/ml to 1 g\/ml. Preferably, the immunoglobulin composition, when administered to a subject in need thereof, reaches a blood level of immunoglobulin in the subject of about 10 ng\/ml or more.","Preferably, the immunoglobulin is formulated for parenteral administration in a suitable inert carrier, such as a sterile physiological saline solution. For example, the concentration of immunoglobulin in the carrier solution is typically between about 1-100 mg\/ml. The dose administered will be determined by route of administration. Preferred routes of administration include parenteral or intravenous administration.","For parenteral administration, the antibodies of the invention can be administered as injectionable dosages of a solution or suspension of the substance in a physiologically acceptable diluent with a pharmaceutical carrier which can be a sterile liquid such as water and oils with or without the addition of a surfactant and other pharmaceutically preparations are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, and mineral oil. In general, glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. The antibodies of this invention can be administered in the form of a depot injection or implant preparation, which can be formulated in such a manner as to permit a sustained release of the active ingredient. A preferred composition comprises monoclonal antibody at 5 mg\/mL, formulated in aqueous buffer consisting of 50 mM L-histidine, 150 mM NaCl, adjusted to pH 6.0 with HCl.","A therapeutically effective dose is a dose effective to produce a significant decrease in demyelination and a notable increase in remyelination. Preferably, the amount is sufficient to produce a statistically significant amount of remyelination in a subject.","According to an important feature of the invention, an immunoglobulin that recognizes and binds to VLA-4 may be administered alone, or in combination with an anti-inflammatory agent, which is typically used to treat conditions and diseases associated with demyelination. Administration of anti-inflammatory agents can occur prior to, concurrent with or after administration with the immunoglobulin.","A therapeutically effective amount of a remyelinating antibody or immunoglobulin, e.g., natalizumab, can be estimated by comparison with established effective doses for known antibodies, taken together with data obtained for natalizumab in both in vivo and in vitro models. Preferably the data is from inhibition of demyelination studies. As is known in the art, adjustments in the dose may be necessary due to immunoglobulin degeneration or metabolism, systemic versus localized delivery, as well as the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, drug interactions and the severity of the condition of the subject to whom the immunoglobulin is administered. Such adjustments may be made and appropriate doses determined by one of skill in the art through routine experimentation.","Therapeutic formulations of the immunoglobulin are prepared for storage by mixing the immunoglobulin having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers (16ed., A. Osol, Ed., 1980 and more recent editions), in the form of lyophilized cake or aqueous solutions. Acceptable immunoglobulin carriers, excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic, nontherapeutic and\/or non-immunogenic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and\/or nonionic surfactants such as Tween, Pluronics or polyethylene glycol (PEG). Specific examples of carrier molecules include but are not limited to glycosaminoglycans (e.g., heparin sulfate), hyaluronic acid, keratan-sulfate, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, heparan sulfate and dermatin sulfate, perlecan and pentopolysulfate.","Pharmaceutical compositions comprising immunoglobulins can also include if desired, pharmaceutically acceptable, non-toxic carriers or diluents, which are vehicles commonly used to formulated pharmaceutical compositions for animal or human administration. The diluent is selected so as not to affect the biological activity of the combination. Examples include but are not limited to distilled water, physiological phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solutions, dextrose solution, and Hank's solution.","The agents of the invention can be formulated into preparations for injections by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol. The formulations may also contain conventional additives, such as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives.","The immunoglobulins may also be utilized in aerosol formulation to be administered via inhalation or pulmonary delivery. The agents of the present invention can be formulated into pressurized acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen and the like.","The immunoglobulin also may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization (e.g., hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-methylmethacylate microcapsules), in colloidal drug delivery systems (e.g., liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in supra.","The immunoglobulin to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. The immunoglobulin ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution.","Therapeutic immunoglobulin compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle or similar sharp instrument.","Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the protein, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (e.g., poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) as described by Langer et al., 15: 167-277 (1981) and Langer, 12: 98-105 (1982) or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., 22: 547-556, 1983), non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra), degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (i.e., injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988).","While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37\u00b0 C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for immunoglobulin stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S\u2014S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, developing specific polymer matrix compositions, and the like.","Sustained-release immunoglobulin compositions also include liposomally entrapped immunoglobulin. Liposomes containing the immunoglobulin are prepared by methods known per se. See, e.g., Epstein et al., 82: 3688-92 (1985); Hwang et al., 77: 4030-4 (1980); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045; 4,544,545; 6,139,869; and 6,027,726. Ordinarily, the liposomes are of the small (about 200 to about 800 Angstroms), unilamellar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mole percent (mol. %) cholesterol; the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal immunoglobulin therapy.","The immunoglobulins of this invention can be administered in a sustained release form, for example a depot injection, implant preparation, or osmotic pump, which can be formulated in such a manner as to permit a sustained release of the active ingredient. Implants for sustained release formulations are well-known in the art. Implants are formulated as microspheres, slabs, etc. with biodegradable or non-biodegradable polymers. For example, polymers of lactic acid and\/or glycolic acid form an erodible polymer that is well-tolerated by the host. The implant is placed in proximity to the site of protein deposits (e.g., the site of formation of amyloid deposits associated with neurodegenerative disorders), so that the local concentration of active agent is increased at that site relative to the rest of the body.","In addition, immunoglobulins which prevent demyelination and\/or induce remyelination may be provided by administering a polynucleotide encoding a whole or partial antibody (e.g., a single chain Fv) to a subject. The polynucleotide is administered to a subject in an appropriate vehicle to allow the expression of the immunoglobulin in the subject in a therapeutically effective amount.","A typical daily dosage might range for immunoglobulins ranges from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to up to about 10 mg\/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned herein. Typically, the clinician will administer immunoglobulin until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays.","A \u201cstable\u201d antibody or antibody fragment formulation is one in which the protein therein essentially retains its physical stability and\/or chemical stability and\/or biological activity upon storage. Various analytical techniques for measuring protein stability are available in the art and are reviewed in 247-301, (Vincent Lee Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., Pubs. 1991) and A. Jones, 10: 29-90 (1993), for example. Stability can be measured at a selected temperature for a selected time period. Preferably, the formulation is stable at room temperature (about 30\u00b0 C.) or at 40\u00b0 C. for at least 1 month and\/or stable at about 2-8\u00b0 C. for at least 1 year for at least about 2 years. Furthermore, the formulation is preferably stable following freezing (to, e.g., \u221270\u00b0 C.) and thawing of the formulation.","A protein \u201cretains its physical stability\u201d in a pharmaceutical formulation if it shows no signs of aggregation, precipitation and\/or denaturation upon visual examination of color and\/or clarity, or as measured by UV light scattering or by size exclusion chromatography.","A protein \u201cretains its chemical stability\u201d in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the chemical stability at a given time is such that the protein is considered to still retain its biological activity as defined below. Chemical stability can be assessed by detecting and quantifying chemically altered forms of the protein. Chemical alteration may involve size modification (e.g., clipping) that can be evaluated using size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE and\/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI\/TOF MS), for example. Other types of chemical alteration include charge alteration (e.g., occurring as a result of deamidation) that can be evaluated by, e.g., ion-exchange chromatography.","An immunoglobulin \u201cretains its biological activity\u201d in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the biological activity of the immunoglobulin at a given time is within about 10% (within the errors of the assay) of the biological activity exhibited at the time the pharmaceutical formulation was prepared as determined in an antigen-binding assay, for example.","5.5. Routes of Administration of Immunoglobulin Compositions","As discussed briefly above, the pharmaceutical compositions discussed supra can be administered for prophylactic and\/or therapeutic treatments of multiple sclerosis or other demyelination related disorders. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a patient suspected of, or already suffering from a disease such as multiple sclerosis, in an amount sufficient to promote remyelination. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a therapeutically- or pharmaceutically-effective dose.","The pharmaceutical compositions will be administered by parenteral, topical, intravenous, oral, or subcutaneous, intramuscular local administration, such as by aerosol or transdermally, for prophylactic and\/or therapeutic treatment. Although the proteinaceous substances of this invention may survive passage through the gut following oral administration (p.o.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intravenous (i.v.), intramuscular (i.m.), intraperitoneal administration by depot injection; or by implant preparation are preferred.","The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered in a variety of unit dosage forms depending upon the method of administration. For example, unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration include powder, tablets, pills, capsules, and lozenges.","Effective doses of the compositions of the present invention, for the treatment of the above described conditions will vary depending upon many different factors, including means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, and other medicaments administered. Thus, treatment dosages will need to be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy. These compositions may be administered to mammals for veterinary use and for clinical use in humans in a manner similar to other therapeutic agents, i.e., in a physiologically acceptable carrier. In general, the administration dosage will range from about 0.0001 to 100 mg\/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 0.5 mg\/kg of the host body weight.","In a preferred treatment regime, the antibody is administered by intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection at a dose from 1 to 5 mg antibody per kilo of patient bodyweight. The dose is repeated at interval from 2 to 8 weeks. Within this range, the preferred treatment regimen is 3 mg antibody per kilo of bodyweight repeated at a 4-week interval.","6. Drug Combinations","As stated previously, no previously described drug or drug combination was identified as stopping the progressive loss of neurologic function for demyelinating diseases. Some drugs existed which suppressed immune-mediated inflammation and can also decrease the relapse rate of multiple sclerosis. These and other drugs used to treat symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis and demyelination-associated conditions and diseases are also contemplated for use in combination with the compounds and compositions disclosed herein. Selection of one or more agent to be utilized in a cocktail and\/or combination with the compounds and compositions disclosed herein will be dependent on the management of the disease. For example, in MS, disease management can be categorized into two groups: (1) treatment designed to arrest the disease process, and (2) symptomatic management. Various combinations of drugs can be used in category (D). For example, the compounds and compositions disclosed herein can be administered with immunosuppressant agents to further inhibit the influx of immune cells and thereby demyelinating activity. For example, immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids maybe used.","The remyelinating agents (e.g., anti-alpha-4 integrin antibodies, small compound alpha-4 integrin antagonists and the like) can be combined with other compounds or compositions used to treat, ameliorate or palliate symptoms associated with demyelinating conditions or diseases.","Other agents utilized to treat, ameliorate or palliate symptoms associated with demyelination conditions or diseases, including multiple sclerosis, include but are not limited to: muscle relaxants (e.g., diazepam, cyclobenzaprine, clonazepam, clonidine, primidone, and the like), anticholinergics (e.g., propantheline, dicyclomine, and the like), central nervous system stimulants (e.g., pemoline), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, naproxen and ketoprofen), interferons, immune globulin, glatiramer (COPAXONE\u00ae), mitoxantrone (NOVANTRONE\u00ae), misoprostol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (e.g., pirfenidone, infliximab and the like) and corticosteroids (e.g., glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids).","Common agents for treating multiple sclerosis include interferon beta-1b (BETASERON\u00ae), interferon beta-1a (AVONEX\u00ae) high-dose interferon beta-1a (REBIF\u00ae), glatiramer (COPAXONE\u00ae), immune globulin, mitoxantrone (NOVANTRONE\u00ae), corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone and the like). Other corticosteroids may also be used and include but are not limited to cortisol, cortisone, fludrocortisone, prednisolone, 6\u03b1-methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, and betamethasone.","Dosage forms of the agents to be used in combination with the compounds and compositions disclosed herein would vary depending on the subject and drug combination being utilized. For example, interferons are typically administered as follows: Interferon beta-1a (Avonex\u00ae) is administered 30 \u03bcg once a week; interferon beta-1a is administered at about 22 \u03bcg or 44 \u03bcg three times a week; and interferon beta-1b (Betaseron\u00ae) is administered at 250 \u03bcg on alternate days (Durelli et al., 359: 1453-60, 2002). Typically the interferons are administered for relapsing or remitting multiple sclerosis. Thus, in combination with the remyelinating agents disclosed herein, preferred ranges of interferons may include about 0.1 \u03bcg to about 250 \u03bcg and more preferably about 0.5 \u03bcg to about 50 \u03bcg, depending on the manner in which the agent is administered in conjunction with the other remyelinating compounds and compositions disclosed herein.","Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) contemplated for use with this invention include but are not limited to non-selective COX inhibitors and selective COX-2 inhibitors. Non-selective COX inhibitors include but are not limited to salicylic acid derivatives (e.g., aspirin, sodium salicylates, choline magnesium trisalicylate, salsalate, diflunisal, sulfasalazine, and olsalazine), para-aminophenol derivatives (e.g., acetaminophen), indole and indene acetic acids (e.g., tolmetin, diclofenac, and ketorolac), heteroaryl acetic acids (e.g., abuprofen, naproxen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, fenprofen, and oxaprozin), anthranilic acids or fenamates (e.g., mefenamic acid and meclofenamic acid), enolic acids (e.g., oxicams such as piroxicam and meloxicam), and alkanones (e.g., nabumetone). Selective COX-2 inhibitors include diaryl-substituted furanones (e.g., rofecoxib), diaryl-substituted pyrazoles (e.g., celecoxib), indole acetic acids (e.g., etodolac), and sulfonanilides (e.g., nimesulide). NS are oftentimes administered in combination with interferon to lessen the flu-like symptoms experienced by patients receiving, for example, Avonex\u00ae. Common NS include naproxen, ibuprofen and ketoprofen. Paracetamol is also frequently administered to patients. See, Reess et al., 2002 8: 15-8.","Glatiramer acetate (COPAXONE\u00ae) is a synthetic molecule that inhibits activation of myelin basic protein-reactive T cells and induces a T-cell repertoire characterized by anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, glatiramer can access the central nervous system (CNS), whereas interferon-beta cannot (Dhib-Jalbut, 2002 58: S3-9; Weinstock-Guttman et al., 2000 59: 401-10).","Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione synthetic agent, which has been shown to be effective for treating secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS). However, use of this drug is again limited by its cumulative cardiotoxicity (Weinstock-Guttman et al., 2000).","Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) may be a key cytokine in demyelination (Walker et al., 2001 7: 305-12). Thus use of agents that antagonize TNF-\u03b1 function or inhibit its synthesis may be useful in combination with the agents and compounds disclosed herein. This can include anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibodies (e.g., infliximab) as well as agents such as pirfenidone. Pirfenidone is a non-peptide drug, which has been shown to decrease synthesis of TNF-\u03b1 and to block receptors for TNF-\u03b1. Id.","The long mainstay in most demyelinating conditions and diseases has been the use of ACTH, glucocorticoids and corticoid steroids. These agents are used for their anti-edema and anti-inflammatory effects. ACTH is commonly administered to a subject at 80 U given intravenously in 500 mL of 5% dextrose and water over 6-8 hours for 3 days. It may also be administered at 40 U\/ml intramuscularly at a dose of 40 U every 12 hours for 7 days, with the dose then reduced every 3 days. See, S. Hauser, \u201cMultiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases,\u201d in 2287-95 (13ed., Isselbacher et al., ed. 1994). Methylprednisolone is typically administered slowly in 500 ml D5W over 6 hours, preferably in the morning. Common dosages include 1000 mg daily for 3 days, 500 mg daily for 3 days and 250 mg daily for 3 days. Id. A methylprednisolone-prednisone combination is also commonly administered. Typically 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone is administered over three days followed by oral prednisone at 1 mg\/kg per day for 14 days. Thus, for use in combination with the compounds and compositions disclosed herein, the steroids may be administered in amounts ranging from about 1 to about 1000 mg\/kg over about 1 to 14 days, as needed.","A side effect in demyelinating conditions such as MS, is fatigue and decreased cognitive function. Agents such as amantadine hydrochloride and pemoline have been frequently used to treat fatigue associated with MS (Geisler et al., 1996 53: 185-8).","The benefit of such combination therapies is that it may lessen the class-specific and agent-specific side effects currently encountered with some of the drugs. Class-specific side effects of interferon-beta include fever, chills, myalgias, arthralgias and other flu-like symptoms beginning 2-6 hours after injection and typically resolving 24 hours post injection. Occasionally interferon-beta also induces transient worsening of preexisting MS symptoms. Agent specific side effects include injection-site reactions with interferon beta-1b. Management of these effects can be accomplished by tailoring the dose and time of administration, prescribing appropriate combinations of acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids. See, Munschauer et al., 1997 19: 883-93.","Thus, combinations of drugs that can lessen the quantity of a particular drug administered may reduce adverse side effects experienced by a patient.","When administered in combination, the small compound remyelinating agents may be administered in the same formulation as these other compounds or compositions, or in a separate formulation. When administered in combination, the remyelinating immunoglobulins are generally administered in a separate formulation than the other compounds and compositions. When administered in combinations, the remyelinating agents may be administered prior to, following, or concurrently with the other compounds and compositions used to treat, ameliorate, or palliate symptoms.","7. Chronic Administration Dosage Regimens","The chronic treatment regimen of the present invention provides that an alpha-4 integrin agent (e.g., small molecule or immunoglobulin) at a level that will maintain sufficient receptor saturation to suppress pathological inflammation in a patient in need of such. The methods of the invention entails administration once per every two weeks or once a month to once every two months, with repeated dosings taking place over a period of at least six months, and more preferably for a year or longer. The methods of the invention involve obtaining and maintaining a receptor saturation level in a human patient of a dimer comprising alpha-4 integrin (e.g., VLA-4) in a range of from about 65% to 100%, more preferably between 75%, to 100%, and even more preferably between 80-100%. These receptor saturation levels are maintained at these levels chronically (e.g., over a period of 6 months or so) to allow for continued suppression of pathological inflammation.","In a specific embodiment, the remyelinating agent is an antibody, preferably a humanized or human antibody, and the dosing is on a monthly basis. In another specific embodiment, the remyelinating agent is a compound of formula I, IA, IB, IC, II, IIA, or IIB as defined above. Levels of receptor saturation can be monitored to determine the efficacy of the dosing regime, and physiological markers measured to confirm the success of the dosage regime. As a confirmation, serum levels of the antibody can be monitored to identify clearance of the antibody and to determine the potential effect of half-life on the efficacy of the treatment.","For treatment with an agent of the invention, the dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to 100 mg\/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg\/kg, of the host body weight. For example dosages can be 1 mg\/kg body weight or 10 mg\/kg body weight. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half-life of the agent in the patient. The dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. For immunoglobulin administration, each dosing injection is generally between 2.0 to 8.0 mg\/kg dosage. For a compound administration, each dosing injection is generally between 1.0 to 50.0 mg\/kg dosage. In accordance with the teachings provided herein, effective dosages can be monitored by obtaining a fluid sample from a patient. For this, generally a blood serum or cerebrospinal fluid sample is taken and integrin receptor saturation is determined using methods well known in the art. Ideally, a sample is taken prior to initial dosing; subsequent samples are taken and measured prior to and\/or after each treatment.","As an alternative to chronic administration comprised of repeated individual dosings, a remyelinating agent can be administered as a sustained release formulation, provided the dosage is such that the levels of receptor saturation remain sufficient to suppress inflammation. For example, controlled release systems can be used to chronically administer a remyelinating agent within the scope of this invention. Discussions of appropriate controlled release dosage forms may be found in Lesczek Krowczynski, -1987 (CRC Press, Inc.).","The various controlled release technologies cover a very broad spectrum of drug dosage forms. Controlled release technologies include, but are not limited to physical systems and chemical systems. Physical systems include, but not limited to, reservoir systems with rate-controlling membranes, such as microencapsulation, macroencapsulation, and membrane systems; reservoir systems without rate- controlling membranes, such as hollow fibers, ultra microporous cellulose triacetate, and porous polymeric substrates and foams; monolithic systems, including those systems physically dissolved in non-porous, polymeric, or elastomeric matrices (e.g., non-erodible, erodible, environmental agent ingression, and degradable), and materials physically dispersed in non-porous, polymeric, or elastomeric matrices (e.g., non-erodible, erodible, environmental agent ingression, and degradable); laminated structures, including reservoir layers chemically similar or dissimilar to outer control layers; and other physical methods, such as osmotic pumps, or adsorption onto ion-exchange resins.","Chemical systems include, but are not limited to, chemical erosion of polymer matrices (e.g., heterogeneous, or homogeneous erosion), or biological erosion of a polymer matrix (e.g., heterogeneous, or homogeneous). Additional discussion of categories of systems for controlled release may be found in Agis F. Kydonieus, 1980 (CRC Press, Inc.).","The methods of the invention can be used to treat a patient that is affected with a disorder involving or arising from pathological inflammation, or to prophylactically treat a patient at risk for a particular disorder. The dosage regimens necessary for prophylactic versus therapeutic treatment can vary, and will need to be designed for the specific use and disorder treated.","In some methods, two or more agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies with different binding specificities, a monoclonal antibody and a compound as disclosed herein) are administered concurrently, in which case the dosage of each agent administered falls within the ranges indicated. Combination therapies can also occur where the agents are administered consecutively to the patient with a desired time interval been periods of administration. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring receptor saturation levels or by following other indicia of the disease process.","Those of skill will readily appreciate that dose levels can vary as a function of the specific agent, the severity of the symptoms and the susceptibility of the subject to side effects. Some of the specific agents are more potent than others. Preferred dosages for a given agent are readily determinable by those of skill in the art by a variety of means. A preferred means is to measure the physiological potency of a given agent.","In prophylactic applications, pharmaceutical compositions are chronically administered to a patient susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of, a particular disease in an amount sufficient to eliminate or reduce the risk or delay the outset of the disease. Such an amount is defined to be a prophylactically effective dose. In patients with multiple sclerosis in remission, risk may be assessed by NMR imaging or, in some cases, by pre-symptomatic indications observed by the patient.","Effective dosage regimes of the compositions of the present invention, for the treatment of the above described conditions will vary depending upon many different factors, including means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, and other medicaments administered. Thus, treatment dosages will need to be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy. In general, each administration of the dosage regimen will range from about 0.0001 to about 100 mg\/kg, usually about 0.01 to about 50, and more usually from about 0.1 to about 30 mg\/kg of the host body weight.","The remyelinating agents of the invention can be used with effective amounts of other therapeutic agents against acute and chronic inflammation. Such agents include other antagonists of adhesion molecules (e.g., other integrins, selectins, and immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily members (see Springer, (1990) 346:425-433; Osborn (1990) 62:3; and Hynes (1992) 9:11)). Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins consisting of an \u03b1 chain (120-180 kDa) and a \u03b2 chain (90-110 kDa), generally having short cytoplasmic domains. For example, three important integrins, LFA-1, Mac-1 and P150,95, have different alpha subunits, designated CD11a, CD11b and CD11c, and a common beta subunit designated CD18. LFA-1 (\u03b1\u03b2) is expressed on lymphocytes, granulocyte and monocytes, and binds predominantly to an Ig-family member counter-receptor termed ICAM-1 and related ligands. ICAM-1 is expressed on many cells, including leukocytes and endothelial cells, and is up-regulated on vascular endothelium by cytokines such as TNF and IL-1. Mac-1 (\u03b1\u03b2) is distributed on neutrophils and monocytes, and also binds to ICAM-1. The third \u03b2integrin, P150,95 (\u03b1\u03b2), is also found on neutrophils and monocytes. The selectins consist of L-selectin, E-selectin and P-selectin.","Other anti-inflammatory agents that can be used in combination with the remyelinating agents include antibodies and other antagonists of cytokines, such as interleukins IL-1 through IL-13, tumor necrosis factors \u03b1 and \u03b2 (TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2), interferons \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, tumor growth factor Beta (TGF-\u03b2), colony stimulating factor (CSF) and granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Other anti-inflammatory agents include antibodies and other antagonists of chemokines such as MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, RANTES, exotaxin and IL-8. Other anti-inflammatory agents include NS, steroids and other small molecule inhibitors of inflammation. Timing and sequence of administration, formulations, routes of administration and effective concentrations of agents for combined therapies are as described above for the humanized antibodies against alpha-4 integrin, the small compounds against alpha-4 integrin, and the drug combinations.","8. Testing Reagents","Reagents can be tested in vitro and in vivo. Many in vitro models exist to test whether a reagent binds to the alpha-4 subunit, as would be known in the art. Testing whether the reagent has activity in vivo at promoting remyelination and inhibiting demylination can be performed using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model. EAE is an inflammatory condition of the central nervous system with similarities to multiple sclerosis (Paterson, , eds. Miescher and Mueller-Eberhard, 179-213, Grune and Stratton, N.Y. 1976).","EAE may be induced in rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of a CD4-positive T-cell clone specific for myelin basic protein. Inflammation is initiated within 4 to 12 hours; endogenous monocytes and lymphocytes infiltrate inflamed vessels in the brain stem and spinal cord, leading to paralysis of the tail and hind limbs by day 4 or 5.","Sections of EAE brain can be tested for their ability to support leukocyte attachment using, for example, an in vitro binding assay described in Stamper and Woodruff, 144: 828-833 (1976). Reagents against leukocyte adhesion receptors can be examined for inhibitory activity in the in vitro section assay described in Example 4. As shown in Tables 12 and 13, the attachment of U937 cells (a human monocytic cell line) was almost completely blocked by antibodies against human VLA-4 integrin. The remyelinating antibodies produced significantly greater blocking effect as compared to antibodies against other adhesion molecules.","Surprisingly, antibodies that selectively inhibit the fibronectin binding activity of \u03b1integrin (P4G9 and HP1\/7) enhanced U937 attachment to the EAE vessels. These results suggest that fibronectin-binding activity of \u03b1integrin is not directly involved in U937 adhesion to EAE vessels in vitro. Tables 12 and 13 also show that antibodies against many other leukocyte adhesion receptors were without effect on U937 or lymphocyte binding to EAE vessels.","Given the in vitro results using the \u03b1\u03b2reagents described above, the effect of these antibodies on the progression of EAE can also be tested in vivo by measuring the delay in the onset of paralysis or reduction in severity of the paralysis. The protective effect of one of the antibodies useful in the present invention, HP2\/1, is provided in Example 4.","Additional reagents effective for inhibiting leukocyte binding to brain endothelial cells and thereby potentially that inhibit demyelination or promote remyelination can be identified by use of adhesion assays. Using HP2\/1 or N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester as a control for example, other antibodies or reagents can be screened for their ability to inhibit the binding of lymphocytes to a known ligand for \u03b1\u03b2integrin. Several additional reagents can be identified that inhibit adhesion by targeting the \u03b1subunit of the VLA-4 leukocyte cell surface receptor.","Monoclonal antibodies useful in the methods and compositions of the present invention include for example HP2\/1, TY21.6, TY21.12, and L25 as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,665, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. These antibodies react with the a chain of VLA-4 and block binding to VCAM-1, fibronectin and inflamed brain endothelial cells, but do not affect the activity of the other members of the \u03b2integrin family.","Other reagents which selectively react against the VLA-4\/VCAM-1 target can also be used. For example, an antibody which interacts with the VCAM-1 binding domain VLA-4 (\u03b1) in conjunction with the \u03b2chain that blocks only lymphocyte migration into sites of inflammation, such as the brain during multiple sclerosis, can be used to promote remyelination. This reagent further would not affect matrix interactions (mediated by all members of the \u03b2integrins) nor would it affect normal intestinal immunity (mediated by \u03b1\u03b2). The production of this and other such reagents are well within the skill of the art.","9.

Compounds which bind in this assay can be used to assess VCAM-1 levels in biological samples by conventional assays (e.g., competitive binding assays). This assay is sensitive to ICvalues as low as about 1 nM.","The activity of \u03b1\u03b2, integrin was measured by the interaction of soluble VCAM-1 with Jurkat cells (e.g., American Type Culture Collection Nos. TIB 152, TIB 153, and CRL 8163), a human T-cell line which expresses high levels of \u03b1\u03b2integrin. VCAM-1 interacts with the cell surface in an \u03b1\u03b2integrin-dependent fashion (Yednock et al., 1995, 270:28740).","Recombinant soluble VCAM-1 was expressed as a chimeric fusion protein containing the seven extracellular domains of VCAM-1 on the N-terminus and the human IgGheavy chain constant region on the C-terminus. The VCAM-1 fusion protein was made and purified by the manner described by Yednock, supra.","Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine as described by Yednock, supra.","Jurkat cells were incubated with 1.5 mM MnCland 5 \u03bcg\/mL 15\/7 antibody for 30 minutes on ice. Mnactivates the receptor to enhance ligand binding, and 15\/7 is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an activated\/ligand occupied conformation of \u03b1\u03b2integrin and locks the molecule into this conformation thereby stabilizing the VCAM-1\/\u03b1\u03b2integrin interaction. Yednock et al., supra. Antibodies similar to the 15\/7 antibody have been prepared by other investigators (Luque et al., 1996, 271:11067) and may be used in this assay.","Cells were then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with candidate compounds, in various concentrations ranging from 66 \u03bcg\/mL to 0.01 \u03bcg\/mL using a standard 5-point serial dilution. 15 \u03bcL soluble recombinant VCAM-1 fusion protein was then added to Jurkat cells and incubated for 30 minutes on ice. (Yednock et al., supra.).","Cells were then washed two times and resuspended in PE-conjugated goat F(ab\u2032)anti-mouse IgG Fc (Immunotech, Westbrook, Me.) at 1:200 and incubated on ice, in the dark, for 30 minutes. Cells were washed twice and analyzed with a standard fluorescence activated cell sorter (\u201cFACS\u201d) analysis as described in Yednock et al., supra.","Compounds having an ICof less than about 15 \u03bcM possess binding affinity to \u03b1\u03b2.","When tested in this assay, each of the compounds of Examples 1-381 (or the corresponding carboxylic acids of the ester compounds, i.e., the prodrugs) has an ICof 15 \u03bcM or less.","The following describes an in vitro assay to determine the plasma levels needed for a compound to be active in the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (\u201cEAE\u201d) model, described in the next example, or in other in vivo models.","Log-growth Jurkat cells are washed and resuspended in normal animal plasma containing 20 \u03bcg\/ml of the 15\/7 antibody (described in the above example).","The Jurkat cells are diluted two-fold into either normal plasma samples containing known candidate compound amounts in various concentrations ranging from 66 \u03bcg\/mL to 0.01 \u03bcg\/mL, using a standard 12 point serial dilution for a standard curve, or into plasma samples obtained from the peripheral blood of candidate compound-treated animals.","Cells are then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (\u201cPBS\u201d) containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 1 mM each of calcium chloride and magnesium chloride (assay medium) to remove unbound 15\/7 antibody.","The cells are then exposed to phycoerythrin-conjugated goat F(ab\u2032)anti-mouse IgG Fc (Immunotech, Westbrook, Me.), which has been adsorbed for any non-specific cross-reactivity by co-incubation with 5% serum from the animal species being studied, at 1:200 and incubated in the dark at 4\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes.","Cells are washed twice with assay medium and resuspended in the same. They are then analyzed with a standard fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis as described in Yednock et al., 1995, 270: 28740.","The data is then graphed as fluorescence versus dose, e.g., in a normal dose-response fashion. The dose levels that result in the upper plateau of the curve represent the levels needed to obtain efficacy in an in vivo model.","This assay may also be used to determine the plasma levels needed to saturate the binding sites of other integrins, such as the \u03b1\u03b2integrin, which is the integrin most closely related to \u03b1\u03b2(Palmer et al., 1993, 123: 1289).","Accordingly, the above-described assay may be performed with a human colon carcinoma cell line, SW 480 (ATTC #CCL228) transfected with cDNA encoding \u03b1integrin (Yokosaki et al., 1994, 269:26691), in place of the Jurkat cells, to measure the binding of the \u03b1\u03b2integrin. As a control, SW 480 cells which express other a and \u03b2subunits may be used.","Using this assay, the plasma levels necessary to obtain efficacy in in vivo models for \u03b1\u03b2and \u03b1\u03b2have been established for compounds of the present invention tested in this assay.","Accordingly, another aspect of this invention is directed to a method for treating a disease in a mammalian patient, which disease is mediated by \u03b1\u03b2, and which method comprises administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention. Such compounds are preferably administered in a pharmaceutical composition described herein above. Effective daily dosing will depend upon the age, weight, condition of the patient which factors can be readily ascertained by the attending clinician. However, in a preferred embodiment, the compounds are administered from about 20 to 500 \u03bcg\/kg per day.","Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis is an experimentally induced, cell-mediated, autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that serves as an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Infiltrates typically consist of lymphocytes and macrophages, although polymorphonuclear cells are occasionally observed (Traugott et al., 1985 91: 240-54; Traugott et al., 1986 99: 395-410). EAE is actively induced in susceptible animals by injection with homogenized CNS antigens in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). EAE can also be passively transferred by activated myelin-specific T cells from an actively immunized animal (Paterson, 1960, 111: 119-36). Susceptibility to disease depends not only on the inducing antigen and animal species used, but it is also affected by age, sex and commercial source of the animals (Tsunoda et al., 1996, 55: 673-86).","Just as in MS, clinical EAE can manifest in several different forms. In some models animals develop an acute, monophasic illness followed by spontaneous recovery. In other models, however, animals will develop a chronic relapsing disease, characterized by recurrent clinical attacks with intermittent periods of recovery (Tsunoda et al., 1996). A chronic progressive form of EAE can be induced in adult Hartley guinea pigs by immunization with whole CNS in adjuvant (Wisniewski et al., 1983, & 42: 243-55; Karlik et al., 1986, 36: 1112-4; Karlik et al., 1993, 30: 326-31), in which the animals show progressive worsening of clinical symptoms without periods of recovery or remission. Histologically, large confluent plaques of demyelination accompany continuous mononuclear CNS infiltration.","Materials & Methods: Animals and Induction of EAE. Female Hartley guinea pigs (Charles River Canada, St. Constant, Quebec) were maintained in a controlled light environment and allowed food and water ad libitum. EAE was induced in 50 animals (200-250 g) via nuchal, intradermal injection of 0.6 mL of a 1:1 mixture of homogenized, isologous CNS tissue and complete Freund's adjuvant, with an additional 10 mg\/mL of (Difco). Animals were assessed daily by a blinded observer using a 4-point clinical scale as follows: 0=no abnormality; 0.5=more than one consecutive day of weight loss; 1=ataxia and poor righting reflex; 2=hind limb paresis, urinary incontinence, fecal impaction; 3=paralysis; 4=terminal paralysis.","Treatment Regimes. N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester is a small molecule that binds with high affinity to human and guinea pig 4 integrin (ICfor inhibition of cell adhesion to VCAM=1 nm). Disease in animals was considered chronic by day 40 post immunization, and thus the treatment period began at this time, and lasted for 10, 20, 30 or 40 days. Animals received either 0.5 mL saline (vehicle for N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester; n=20) or 30 mg\/kg N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester (n=25) twice a day. With the dosing regimen, receptor saturation levels of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester (>10 nm) were maintained at all times. One subgroup of animals received N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester for 30 days, and then treatment was withdrawn and the animals were maintained for an additional 10 days (n=5). All treatments were administered subcutaneously.","Animal Sacrifice and Histological Analysis. Untreated, chronic EAE animals (n=5) were sacrificed on day 40, as well as non-EAE controls (n=5). Following each 10-day treatment interval, 5 animals from each group were sacrificed (0.25 mL sodium pentobarbital), blood samples were collected for FACS analysis (see below), and the brain and spinal cord dissected and sectioned. Three spinal sections were used, corresponding to lumbar, thoracic and cervical regions of the cord. The brain was cut into five transverse sections. The first three proximal sections were combined in one block, and the last two distal sections in another. Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Five nm sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) or solochrome-R-cyanlin (SCR) and evaluated by a blinded observer in each of four categories: (1) meningeal inflammation, (2) perivascular infiltration, (3) encephalitis or (4) myelitis and demyelination (Table 6). The combined pathological score represents the total score (out of a potential 20) from all 5 CNS sections in each animal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1796","num":"2574"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00032","num":"00032"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 6"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Pathological Scoring Scale"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["M:","Inflammatory reaction in the meninges"]},{"entry":["0:","no changes"]},{"entry":["1:","perivascular and\/or meningeal infiltration by mononuclear cells,"]},{"entry":[{},"1-3 vessels involved"]},{"entry":["2:","4-6 vessels involved"]},{"entry":["3:","6+ vessels involved"]},{"entry":["4:","dense infiltration of meninges with nearly all or all blood"]},{"entry":[{},"vessels involved"]},{"entry":["P:","Parenchymal perivascular infiltration"]},{"entry":["0:","no changes"]},{"entry":["1:","1-3 parenchymal vessels infiltrated in Virchow-Robin spaces"]},{"entry":["2:","4-6 vessels involved"]},{"entry":["3:","6+ vessels involved"]},{"entry":["4:","virtually all or all vessels involved"]},{"entry":["E:","Encephalitis or myelitis"]},{"entry":["0:","no invasion of the neural parenchyma; microglial or inflammatory"]},{"entry":[{},"cells invading neural parenchyma"]},{"entry":["1:","a few scattered cells"]},{"entry":["2:","invasion by cells from several perivascular cuffs"]},{"entry":["3:","large areas of neural parenchyma involved"]},{"entry":["4:","virtually the entire section is infiltrated"]},{"entry":["D:","Demyelination, remyelination and myelin debris"]},{"entry":["0:","no demyelination"]},{"entry":["1:","single focus of subpial demyelination or myelin debris"]},{"entry":["2:","several small foci of demyelination"]},{"entry":["3:","one large confluent area of demyelination"]},{"entry":["4:","several large confluent areas of demyelination"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"To quantify the abnormalities observed in the spinal cord, sections stained with H-E were divided into 12 representative pie-shaped areas.

Quantitative abnormalities were compared using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks. In each case, p<0.05 was considered significant. A linear regression was performed on the mean cell counts in the spinal cord.","RESULTS: Clinical Reversal. Animals began to show clinical signs of disease on day 9 post immunization, and continued through to day 40. At this point the disease was considered to be chronic. The treatment period began on day 40 and lasted a minimum of 10 days to a maximum of 40 days. While animals that received saline showed a continued clinical profession until the end of the experiment, animals treated with N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester began to show a clinical reversal commencing 2-3 days following the initial treatment (). In several animals that had an established clinical score of 2 before treatment began, N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester reversed the paresis, and the animals were able to use their hind limbs throughout the treatment period (i.e., reversion to a clinical score of 1). Depending on the duration of treatment, some animals that had previously shown signs of disease appeared completely disease-free while receiving N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester. Over the course of the treatment period, the mean clinical scores of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester-treated animals were significantly lower than that of saline-treated animals (p<0.001, Mann Whitney rank sum test).","N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester-treated group, there was a small transient increase centered on day 54 post immunization (). Two animals showed a moderate fluctuation in the degree of clinical symptoms; they wavered from a complete absence of clinical signs (score of 0) to a very slight ataxia (score of 1). None of the animals, however, escaped from treatment, as we have observed previously with antibodies to \u03b1integrin, where the animal stops responding to the therapy altogether due to guinea pig rejection of the murine or humanized antibody. There were no ancillary problems, (such as injection site inflammation), with treatment of animals for extended periods of time with N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester.","In one subgroup of animals, N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester was administered for 30 days, and then removed and the animals were maintained on saline injections for the final 10 days of the experiment. Once N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester was withdrawn, clinical progression returned, similar to the clinical course of animals that received saline for the duration of the treatment period (). Between day 70 and day 80 post immunization, the mean clinical score of post-N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester-treated animals was significantly greater than that of animals which received N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester throughout the treatment period (p<0.05, Mann Whitney rank sum test). In summary, N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester was successfully administered for up to 40 days without any adverse side effects, and it maintained a reversal of the clinical deficits associated with chronic progressive EAE.","RESULTS: Reversal of Pathological Abnormalities. Pathological abnormalities were evaluated on H-E and SCR stained brain and spinal sections. In , panels on the left are SCR stained sections, which stains myelin blue (\u00d740). Panels on the right are high magnification (\u00d7250) H-E stained sections taken from the dorsal medial region of the corresponding SCR photo (). The sections shown in panels A and B of  were taken from a normal guinea pig, and show neither inflammation nor demyelination. By day 40 post immunization, chronic animals had extensive meningeal and perivascular inflammation, as well as one or more large subpial plaques of demyelination (). The density of infiltrating cells was markedly increased (). The observed pathological abnormalities became more extreme as the disease progressed. At day 60 post-immunization, control animals that received 20 days of saline treatment had severe meningeal infiltration, large areas of myelitis, and focal demyelination (, F). By day 80 post-immunization, virtually the entire spinal sections were infiltrated and demyelinated, including invasion of some areas of gray matter (, J). In contrast, animals that received 20 days of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester treatment had much smaller areas of demyelination at day 60 post immunization, and there was a paucity of meningeal and perivascular cell invasion (, H). After 40 days of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester treatment, the pathological recovery was greater still; animals showed almost no meningeal and perivascular infiltration, and the myelin remained intact (, L).","A total of five blocks from each animal were scored by a blinded observer, and the combined pathological score represents the total score from all five sections in each of the four categories (meningeal inflammation, perivascular infiltration, myelitis and demyelination; ). Over the course of the treatment period, animals that received N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester showed a significant decrease in mean pathological score in all four categories with respect to saline-treated animals (p<0.001, two way ANOVA). When N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester was removed, and animals were maintained for an additional 10 days without treatment, the mean combined pathological score in all four categories was significantly higher than animals that continued to receive the small molecule for the duration of the treatment period (; p<0.05, Kruskal Wallis ANOVA on ranks with SNK test).","RESULTS: Quantitation of Pathological Abnormalities. The pathological reversal scored qualitatively above was quantitatively confirmed in the spinal cord. The mean number of cells was calculated from 12 representative 0.12 mm areas on H-E stained sections of lumbar, thoracic and cervical cord, and combined to examine the whole spinal cord (). All untreated EAE animals had significantly higher cell counts than non-EAE animals, indicating that cellular infiltration increased during disease, as expected (p<0.001, two-way ANOVA). A significant reduction in cell number was observed after as little as 10 days of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester treatment, and was maintained through 20, 30 and 40 days of treatment with respect to saline-treated animals (p<0.001, two-way ANOVA). Furthermore, the mean cell counts of animals treated for 20, 30 or 40 days with N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester were significantly lower than that of chronic control animals (p<0.05, Kruskal Wallis ANOVA on ranks with SNK test), and after 40 days of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester treatment, the mean cell count in the spinal cord was not different than that of non-EAE animals. A linear regression of these means demonstrates a progressive loss of inflammatory cells in the spinal cord (r=0.90). From the slope of this line, we can calculate a rate of cell loss of 8 cells\/mm\/day. After removal of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester, in animals that were maintained on saline for an additional 10 days, a significant increase in the mean number of cells was again observed (p<0.05, ANOVA on ranks with SNK test).","RESULTS: Quantitative PCR. Quantitative PCR was performed on lumbar sections of spinal cord to assess levels of IL-2, IL-10 and MCP-1, and the results compliment the pathological reversal already discussed. In saline-treated animals, the amount of IL-2 increased through the chronic phase of disease. In contrast, animals receiving N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester had almost no detectable IL-2 RNA. Following the withdrawal of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester, the amount of IL-2 in the spinal cord returned to levels comparable to saline-treated animals. Similar results were seen regarding IL-10 and MCP-1. A significant reduction in cytokine RNA levels was evident during treatment, followed by a return to high levels after removal of the inhibitor ().","RESULTS: FACS Analysis. As determined by FACS analysis, treatment of EAE animals with N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester caused a large increase in the percentage of \u03b1integrin bright lymphocytes in the circulation, compared to saline-treated animals. These results suggest that lymphocytes activated by peripheral immunization were unable to enter the CNS in the presence of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester, and accumulated in the circulation (). Consistent with this suggestion, the percentage of \u03b1integrin bright lymphocytes in the circulation returned to saline-treated levels when N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester was removed and CNS inflammation returned (). There were no discernable subpopulations of \u03b1integrin low and high monocytes; however, the general expression of \u03b1integrin on circulating monocytes increased in EAE animals (). This increase was not affected by N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester, further suggesting that the peripheral immune reaction was not inhibited by the treatment.","The model of immune cell influx into the central nervous system being blocked by inhibiting alpha-4 beta-1 (\u03b1\u03b2) integrin (VLA-4) blocks was studied to determine whether the presence of inflammatory cells suppresses spontaneous myelin repair in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Paralyzed guinea pigs were treated in an advanced, demyelinated stage of EAE with the \u03b1\u03b2specific inhibitor, N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester (Piraino et al., 2002, 131:147-159), and we found that: (1) 87% of plaques showed evidence of remyelination after 40 days of treatment; (2) myelin repair occurred in 50% of the total lesion area; and (3) 50% of the animals regained motor function. There was no significant repair or gain of motor function in vehicle treated animals. These results indicate that prolonged inhibition of CNS inflammation, in the absence of targeted myelin repair, can facilitate mechanisms of spontaneous remyelination.","Methods.","Animals and Disease Induction. Female Hartley guinea pigs (200-250 g, Charles River Canada, St. Constant, Quebec) were maintained in a light and temperature controlled environment and allowed food and water ad libitum. EAE was induced via nuchal, intradermal injection of 0.6 mL of a 1:1 mixture of homogenized, isologous CNS tissue and complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco, Detroit, Mich.), with an additional 10 mg\/mL of (Difco). Animals began to show clinical signs of disease on day 9, and were considered chronic by day 40 post immunization. Animals were weighed and assessed daily by a blinded observer using a 4-point clinical scale as follows: 0\u2014no abnormality; 0.5\u2014more than one consecutive day of weight loss; 1\u2014ataxia and poor righting reflex; 2\u2014hind limb paresis, urinary incontinence, fecal impaction; 3\u2014paralysis; and 4\u2014terminal paralysis.","Treatment Criteria. Animals were chosen for treatment based on severity of disease, according to two criteria: (1) animals must have been in the chronic stages of disease (i.e., at least day 40 post immunization); and (2) animals must have attained a clinical score of 2 before the start of the treatment period (i.e., hind limb paresis). In our past experience with this chronic progressive model of EAE, 95% of chronic animals with clinical scores of 2 showed moderate to severe demyelination in the spinal cord, ranging from several small foci of demyelination to one or more large confluent plaques. Adherence to these criteria optimized the potential for myelin loss before the treatment period began.","Treatment Regimes. Animals that met both treatment criteria were treated for intervals of 10, 20, 30 or 40 days. N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfon)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester is a small molecule (molecular weight \u02dc500 Da) that binds with high affinity to human and guinea pig \u03b1integrin (ICfor inhibition of cell adhesion to high density VCAM-1 in the presence of 100% serum=1-10 nm). Animals received either saline (n=16) or N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfon)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester (30 mg\/kg, n=12) twice daily during the treatment period. With this dosing regimen, receptor-saturating levels of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester (>10 nm) were maintained at all times. Both treatments were administered subcutaneously. Additionally, a cohort of animals was sacrificed within days of receiving a clinical score of 2 to serve as a baseline \u201cd0\u201d control.","Tissue Collection and Processing. Following sacrifice (0.25 mL sodium pentobarbital), animals were exsanguinated, and the CNS was dissected and sectioned. Three spinal cord sections were used, corresponding to lumbar, thoracic and cervical regions of the cord. Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Five \u03bcm cross-sections were stained with solochrome-R-cyanin, a qualitative myelin stain, and examined by light microscopy for evidence of demyelination (absence of blue stain) and remyelination (areas of pale blue stain within lesions).","From each of the lumbar, thoracic and cervical sections, a 5 mm piece of spinal cord from the distal end was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4\u00b0 C. A 0.5 mm slice from the center of each cross section was then divided into dorsal and ventral halves. These slices were post-fixed in osmium tetroxide and embedded in epoxy resin. One micron cross sections stained with toluidine blue were examined by light microscopy for evidence of demyelination and remyelination. Areas containing lesions were further sectioned for electron microscopy, and thin sections were stained with potassium permanganate and ethanolic uranyl acetate and examined in a Philips EM 300 microscope.","Histological Analysis. Spinal cord pathology was quantified using a method modified from McGavern et al., 1999, 58: 492-504. Images from a mean of 12 cross-sections per animal were captured at 40\u00d7 magnification using a Nikon Coolpix 995 digital camera. Sigma Scan Pro image analysis software (SPSS Inc.) was used to calculate both the total lesion area and the remyelinated lesion area within each cross section (in arbitrary units). These areas were summed to yield an overall estimation for the entire spinal cord, and the area of remyelination was expressed as a percentage of the total lesion area.","Results and Discussion. The primary aim in this study was to determine if extended inhibition of immune cell migration into the CNS would allow spontaneous remyelination of existing spinal cord lesions. The guinea pig model of EAE exhibits non-remitting, progressive disease following immunization with whole CNS homogenate (Wisniewski et al., 1983, 42: 243-255; Karlik et al., 1986, 36: 1112-4; Karlik et al., 1993, 30: 326-331). Acute paralysis begins after approximately 10 days, with notable demyelination by day 20 (Karlik et al., 1986, 36: 1112-4; Karlik et al., 1993, 30: 326-331). After 40 days, 95% of animals exhibiting full bilateral hind limb paralysis have moderate to severe demyelination throughout the brainstem and spinal cord. It is important to note that animals at this stage of disease never relapse or remit, nor do they spontaneously recover. In the current study, treatment was only initiated when an animal reached this stage\u2014at least 40 days post immunization and exhibiting full bilateral hind limb paralysis (clinical score 2). Animals then received either the small molecule inhibitor of \u03b1\u03b2integrin N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester or vehicle (saline) for intervals of 10, 20, 30 or 40 days.  shows representative light micrographs of solochrome-R-cyanin stained spinal cord sections (). In controls (day \u201c0\u201d of treatment), extensive demyelination was evident in every animal; lesions were typically devoid of intact myelin, exhibiting dense immune cell infiltration with foamy macrophages containing phagocytosed myelin debris at their leading edge (, B). In the shortest treatment interval (10 days), saline- and N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester-treated animals continued to show large areas of demyelination in the spinal cord, with minimal evidence of myelin pallor. In contrast, after 20 days of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester therapy, many lesions exhibited diffuse pale blue staining, analogous to classically described shadow plaques that are indicative of remyelination in MS patients (). Plaques within saline control animals that remained devoid of myelin (). By day 40 of treatment, a striking difference in the overall myelin appearance between the two treatment groups was observed. The majority of lesions in the N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester-treated animals presented as shadow plaques (), while lesions in control animals showed little, if any, blue staining ().","To better define the change in histological appearance, tissue samples were examined with higher resolution, both by light and electron microscopy (EM) (). In 30-day saline-treated animals, toluidine blue-stained semithin sections showed areas of normal myelin (), as well as areas of severe demyelination and axonal loss (). Small transition zones between these two areas contained thinly sheathed axons of relatively small caliber (), which may represent recently demyelinated axons attempting repair. There was also frequent evidence of axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration, both within lesions and within normally myelinated areas. In animals that received N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester (), the areas of thinly myelinated axons were greatly expanded, and the axons tended to be of larger caliber, indicating a more general reparative response, often throughout the lesioned area. Electron microscopy confirmed the observations. Thick wraps of myelin around large caliber axons, representative of \u201cnormal\u201d compact myelin, are shown in . In animals receiving 40 days of saline treatment, lesioned areas showed myelin paucity where large axons were fully demyelinated (). In contrast, treatment with N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester resulted in the appearance of the multiple thin myelin layers around large caliber axons, representing a state of remyelination (). Therefore, it appears that prolonged administration of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester allowed for spontaneous remyelination in the spinal cord of animals with chronic progressive EAE.","In order to quantify the effect of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester, the percentage of plaques exhibiting evidence of remyelination was determined. The number of lesions showing myelin pallor was divided by the total number of lesions within cross sections of spinal cord taken throughout its length from each animal () (for the method see Warrington et al., 2000, 97: 6820-5). After 20, 30 and 40 days of saline treatment, the mean percentage of plaques exhibiting remyelination was between 10 and 20%; there was no significant change over time in the incidence of myelin pallor in these animals (). In contrast, after 20 days of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester administration, the frequency of shadow plaques in the spinal cord was increased over saline-treated animals, reaching 68%; after 30 and 40 days, the incidence was 77% and 87%, respectively (p<0.001, 2-way ANOVA with Tukey test). These values are significantly higher than those at the initiation of treatment (day 0 and day 10) (p<0.05, 2-way ANOVA with Tukey test), indicating that the compound increased the incidence of remyelination in a time-dependent manner. Since the percentage of plaques showing evidence of remyelination did not significantly increase past day 20, it appears that remyelination was largely initiated in a synchronous manner between days 10 and 20 of treatment day ().","The overall degree of plaque remyelination in the spinal cord was also measured.  shows a representative spinal cord section with a large demyelinated lesion in the ventral horn. Total lesion area was determined for each animal by tracing all lesions within all spinal cord sections and summing the areas. Likewise, the total area of remyelination was measured by tracing regions of myelin pallor.  plot the total lesion area against the percentage of remyelination. In saline-treated animals, lesions rarely show any evidence of repair, with means ranging between 2 and 11%, and there were no significant differences over the 40-day treatment period (). In contrast, after 20, 30 or 40 days of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester treatment, the majority of lesions identified show a variable degree of remyelination ranged from 2 to 100% in the majority of lesions (mean area of remyelination approximately 50%) (). (p<0.001, 2-way ANOVA with Tukey test). Therefore while lesions were evident in all animals throughout the 40-day treatment period, N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester increased the incidence and percentage of remyelination. Furthermore, evidence of remyelination in N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester-treated animals is consistent with an observed regain of motor function. The starting point for treatment was a clinical score of 2, which denotes full bilateral hind limb paralysis. In 50% of N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester-treated animals, paralysis was reversed to a clinical score of 1, indicating that animals regained significant use of their hind limbs (p<0.05, Mann Whitney rank sum test). Functional recovery was never observed in control animals.","Spontaneous remyelination, by definition, is myelin repair in the absence of therapeutic intervention specifically designed to stimulate remyelination (Miller et al., 1995, 32: 230-245). Spontaneous repair is well documented in animal models of demyelination involving acute toxic damage, as with cuprizone, lysolecithin or ethidium bromide (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1990, 12: 569-576), and in models of viral encephalitis (Miller et al., 1995, 32: 230-245) or in models with broad immunosuppression or immune cell depletion (Rodriguez et al., 1992, 42: 348-57; and Murray et al., 2001, 124: 1403-16). In these instances, remyelination can be complete within several weeks. N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester is a small molecule that interferes with \u03b1\u03b2integrin activity on immune cells, and was designed as a disease-limiting agent to prevent inflammatory cell infiltration of the brain, rather than as an agent to directly promote myelin repair (Piraino et al., 2002, 131:147-159). Since the guinea pig model of CP-EAE is a non-episodic disease that does not normally exhibit repair, the finding that a disease-limiting agent can, by itself, promote spontaneous remyelination is significant. These results indicate that the inflammatory environment itself suppresses or overwhelms normal repair mechanisms, and may eventually lead to their exhaust. Although there was microscopic evidence of remyelination in saline-treated animals, it did not attain significant levels, and was never accompanied by clinical remission. Thus, it appears that by suppressing immune cell infiltration, N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester prevented attack of newly formed myelin and allowed repair.","Induced remyelination of the CNS has indeed been achieved by a number of means, including administration of myelin glycolipids (Raine et al., 1978, (). 43: 43-53; Traugott et al., 1982, 56: 65-73), CNS-specific antiserum, purified immunoglobulins (Warrington et al., 2001, 108:121-5), or growth factors (Yao et al., 1995, 92: 6190-4). It has also recently been shown that serum-derived human monoclonal antibodies (IgM) can promote remyelination apparently through direct stimulation of oligodendrocytes (Warrington et al., 2000, 97: 6820-6825; Bieber et al., 2002, 37: 241-9; Mitsunaga et al., 2002, 16: 1325-1327). Transplantation of both embryonic and adult neural stem cells has also led to generation of oligodendrocytes and new myelin synthesis in deficient models (Halfpenny et al., 2002, 1: 31-40). While these studies have shown that the CNS is capable of repair, it is important to note that therapeutically induced remyelination does not stop ongoing disease. The Notch pathway, for example, has recently been implicated as an inhibitor of myelination in MS, reflecting the interaction between oligodendrocytes, glial cells and on-going inflammation (John et al., 2002, 8: 1115-21). In an inflammatory disorder such as MS, the CNS would still be vulnerable to attack.","Remyelinating antibodies, such as natalizumab, reverse disease pathology in EAE by inhibiting the otherwise continuous influx of new inflammatory cells. Cells that have already entered the CNS are cleared by normal apoptotic mechanisms (Hyduk et al., 1998, 57: 602-614). Consistent with these observations, N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester has been demonstrated to progressively reduce immune cell infiltrates and their associated inflammatory mediators with increasing duration of treatment (Piraino et al., 2002, 131:147-159). In a controlled trial for relapsing MS, natalizumab demonstrated that treatment over a six-month period led to fewer inflammatory brain lesions and fewer relapses as compared with subjects treated with the placebo. Therapy was well tolerated during the trial, and there was an improved perception of well being among natalizumab-treated patients (Miller et al., 2003, 348: 15-23). Thus, agents such as anti-\u03b1integrin antibody therapy and compounds such as N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperzain-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester will not only serve as a disease-limiting factor in MS, but also as an agent permissive for CNS repair.","While the present invention has been described with reference to the specific embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.

The 5\u2032-end PCR-primers (Table 8), which hybridize to the DNA sequences coding for the beginnings of the leader sequences, were designed to create the DNA sequences essential for efficient translation (Kozak, 196: 947-950 (1987)), and to create a HindIII restriction sites for cloning into an expression vector. The 3\u2032-end primers (Table 8), which hybridize to the DNA sequences coding for the ends of J regions, were designed to create the DNA sequences essential for splicing to the constant regions, and to create a BamHI site for cloning into an expression vector. The products of PCR amplification were digested with HindIII and BamHI, cloned into a pUC19 vector, and sequenced to confirm that no errors had occurred during PCR amplification.

Mouse 21.6 Vregion was identified as belonging to mouse Vregion subgroup 2c as defined by Kabat. Individual mouse heavy chain variable regions were identified that have as much as 93.3% identity to the mouse 21.6 Vregion (17.2.25\u2032CL and 87.92.6\u2032CL). Mouse 21.6 Vregion was most similar to human Vregions of subgroup 1 as defined by Kabat et al., supra. Individual human Vregions were identified that had as much as 64.7% identity to the mouse 21.6 Vregion. The FRs from one of the most similar human variable regions, 21\/28\u2032CL, was used in the design of reshaped human 21.6 Vregion.","Substitution of Amino Acids in Framework Regions.","(A) Light Chain. The next step in the design process for the reshaped human 21.6 Vregion was to join the CDRs from mouse 21.6 Vregion to the FRs from human RE1 (Palm et al., 356: 167-191 (1975). In the first version of reshaped human 21.6 Vregion (La), seven changes were made in the human FRs (Table 10, ). At positions 104, 105, and 107 in FR4, amino acids from RE1 were substituted with more typical human J region amino acids from another human kappa light chain (Riechmann et al., 332:323-327 (1988)).","At position 45 in FR2, the lysine normally present in RE1 was changed to an arginine as found at that position in mouse 21.6 Vregion. The amino acid residue at this position was thought to be important in the supporting the CDR2 loop of the mouse 21.6 Vregion.","At position 49 in FR2, the tyrosine normally present in RE1 was changed to a histidine as found at that position in mouse 21.6 Vregion. The histidine at this position in mouse 21.6 Vregion was observed in the model to be located in the middle of the binding site and could possibly make direct contact with antigen during antibody-antigen binding.","At position 58 in FR3, the valine normally present in RE1 was changed to an isoleucine as found at that position in mouse 21.6 Vregion. The amino acid residue at this position was thought to be important in the supporting the CDR2 loop of the mouse 21.6 Vregion.","At position 69 in FR3, the threonine normally present in RE1 was changed to an arginine as found at that position in mouse 21.6 Vregion. The arginine at this position in mouse 21.6 Vregion was observed in the model to be located adjacent to the CDR1 loop of mouse 21.6 Vregion and could possibly make direct contact with the antigen during antibody-antigen binding.","A second version of reshaped human 21.6 Vregion (termed Lb) was designed containing the same substitutions as above except that no change was made at position 49 in FR2 of RE1. ().","(B) Heavy Chain. The next step in the design process for the reshaped human 21.6 Vregion was to join the CDRs from mouse 21.6 Vregion to the FRs from 21\/28\u2032CL (Dersimonian et al., 139: 2496-2501 (1987)). In the first version of reshaped human 21.6 V region (Ha), five changes were made in the human framework regions (Table 11, ). The five changes in the human FRs were at positions 27, 28, 29, 30, and 71.","At positions 27, 28, 29, and 30 in FR1, the amino acids present in human 21\/28\u2032CL were changed to the amino acids found at those positions in mouse 21.6 Vregion. Although these positions are designated as being within FR1 (Kabat et al., supra), positions 26 to 30 are part of the structural loop that forms the CDR1 loop of the Vregion. It is likely, therefore, that the amino acids at these positions are directly involved in binding to antigen. Indeed, positions 27 to 30 are part of the canonical structure for CDR1 of the Vregion as defined by Chothia et al., supra.","At position 71 in FR3, the arginine present in human 21\/28\u2032CL was changed to a alanine as found at that position in mouse 21.6 Vregion. Position 71 is part of the canonical structure for CDR2 of the Vregion as defined by Chothia et al., supra. From the model of the mouse 21.6 variable regions, it appears that the alanine at position 71 is important in supporting the CDR2 loop of the Vregion. A substitution of an arginine for an alanine at this position would very probably disrupt the placing of the CDR2 loop.","A second version (Hb) of reshaped human 21.6 Vregion contains the five changes described above for version Ha were made plus one additional change in FR2.","At position 44 in FR2, the arginine present in human 21\/28\u2032CL was changed to a glycine as found at that position in mouse 21.6 Vregion. Based on published information on the packing of V-Vregions and on the model of the mouse 21.6 variable regions, it was thought that the amino acid residue at position 44 might be important in the packing of the V-Vregions.","Reshaped human 21.6 V region version Hc was designed to make the CDR3 loop look more similar to human VCAM-1. Both mouse 21.6 antibody and human VCAM-1 bind to the \u03b1\u03b2integrin. The CDR3 loop of the Vregion of antibodies is the most diverse of the six CDR loops and is generally the most important single component of the antibody in antibody-antigen interactions (Chothia et al., supra; Hoogenboom & Winter, 227: 381-388 (1992); Barbas et al., 89: 4457-4461 (1992)). Some sequence similarity was identified between the CDR3 of mouse 21.6 Vregion and amino acids 86 to 94 of human VCAM-1, particularly, between the YGN (Tyrosine-Glycine-Asparagine) sequence in the CDR3 loop and the FGN (i.e., Phenylalanine-Glycine-Asparagine) sequence in VCAM-1. These sequences are thought to be related to the RGD (i.e., Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) sequences important in various cell adhesion events (Main et al., 71: 671-678 (1992)). Therefore, at position 98 in CDR3, the tyrosine present in mouse 21.6 Vregion was changed to a phenylalanine as found in the sequence of human VCAM-1.","Possible substitution at position 36 in FR2 was also considered. The mouse 21.6 Vchain contains an unusual cysteine residue at position 36 in FR2. This position in FR2 is usually a tryptophan in related mouse and human sequences (Table 11). Although cysteine residues are often important for conformation of an antibody, the model of the mouse 21.6 variable regions did not indicate that this cysteine residue was involved either directly or indirectly with antigen binding so the tryptophan present in FR2 of human 21\/28\u2032CL Vregion was left unsubstituted in all three versions of humanized 21.6 antibody.","Construction of Reshaped Human 21.6 Antibodies. The first version of reshaped human 21.6 Vregion (resh21.6Va) was constructed from overlapping PCR fragments essentially as described by Daugherty et al., 19: 2471-2476 (1991). The mouse 21.6 Vregion, adapted as described supra and inserted into pUC19, was used as a template. Four pairs of primers, APCR1-vla1, vla2-vla3, vla4-vla5, and vla6-vla7 were synthesized (Table 9). Adjacent pairs overlapped by at least 21 bases. The APCR1 primer is complementary to the pUC19 vector. The appropriate primer pairs (0.2 \u03bcmoles) were combined with 10 ng of template DNA, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus) in 50 \u03bcl of PCR buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 200 \u03bcM dNTPs, and 1.5 mM MgCl. Each reaction was carried out for 25 cycles. After an initial melt at 94\u00b0 C. for 5 min, the reactions were cycled at 94\u00b0 C. for 1 min, 55\u00b0 C. for 1 min, and 72\u00b0 C. for 2 min, and finally incubated at 72\u00b0 C. for a further 10 min. The ramp time between the primer-annealing and extension steps was 2.5 min. The products of the four reactions (A, B, C, and D) from the first round of PCR reactions were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1845","num":"2623"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00035","num":"00035"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"399pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 9"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"PCR primers for the construction of reshaped human 21.6 variable regions"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"399pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"0pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A.

The products of these reactions were termed E and F. The pairs of PCR primers used were APCR1-vla3 and vla4-vla7, respectively. PCR products E and F were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated and then assembled in a third round of PCR reactions by their own complementarity in a two step-PCR reaction similar to that described above using APCR1 and vla7 as the terminal primers.

Two sets of primers were synthesized (Table 9). Each PCR reaction was essentially carried out under the same conditions as described above. In a first PCR reaction, mutagenic primer 21.6VLb2 was used to destroy a StyI site (Thr-ACC-97 to Thr-ACA-97) to yield resh21.6VLa2. Then, in a second PCR reaction, mutagenic primer 21.6VLb1 (His-49 to Tyr-49) was used with pUC-resh21.6VLa2 as template DNA. The PCR product was cut with StyI and BamHI and subcloned into pUC-resh21.6VLa2, cleaved with the same restriction enzymes.

In vitro Analysis of Lymphocyte Binding to Inflamed Endothelium in Sections of EAE Brain. Following the procedure described in Yednock et al., 356: 63-66 (1992), brains were removed from rats with EAE on day 5 of disease (first day of tail\/hind limb paralysis). The brains were quickly frozen, sectioned, and overlayed with lymphoid cell suspensions (methods as described above for tumor injected brains). Human U937 cells bound selectively to inflamed vessels in the rat EAE brains. Pretreatment of the U937 cells with the anti-VLA-4 antibody, HP2\/1, completely inhibited their binding to inflamed vessels in an adjacent section of EAE brain.","As shown in Table 12, binding of human U937 cells to inflamed vessels in EAE brain was inhibited by reagents against VLA-4 (anti-\u03b1, HP2\/1; and anti-\u03b22, AIIB2), but not by antibodies against numerous other adhesion receptors.

Effect of In Vivo Administration of Anti-VLA-4 Antibody. Anti-VLA-4 was administered to rats (intraperitoneal administration) in order to determine the effect of the antibody on the progression of EAE. For Table 14 below, in each experiment, the T-cell clone was administered on day 0. On day 2, animals received an intraperitoneal injection of PBS, the indicated amount of purified anti-\u03b1integrin, or the indicated amount of purified control antibody. All antibodies were mouse IgG. Disease was defined by complete tail or tail and hind limb paralysis. In animals that developed disease, paralysis began on day 4 or 5, peaked on day 5 or 6, and steadily diminished thereafter. Two additional experiments gave comparable results. Circulating levels and differential counts of white blood cells were indistinguishable between HP2\/1-treated and PBS control animals when measured on days 3, 4 and 7 (day 3 is one day after antibody administration and one day before the earliest onset of paralysis). Bulk quantities of HP2\/1 were purchased from AMAC; MOPC from Sigma; OX-1 and OX-7 from Bioproducts for Science.","Brains were removed from several diseased EAE and healthy anti-\u03b1integrin-treated EAE rats from experiments 2 and 3 on day 6.

TY21.6 and 21.12 were raised against the human B cell line, Ramos (obtained from the ATCC). 10Ramos cells, homogenized in Freund's complete adjuvant, were injected into a Balb\/c mouse (intraperitoneal administration). Fourteen days later, the animal was boosted with another 10Ramos cells (homogenized in Freund's incomplete adjuvant, administered i.p.). After an additional 14 days, the animal was injected with 2\u00d710living Ramos cells (intravenous administration). Three days after the final boost, the spleen was removed, the splenocytes were isolated, fused with the SP\/2 myeloma, and plated on approximately 2,000 wells. Supernatants were screened for their ability to inhibit the human B cell line Ramos binding to VCAM-1 transfected L-cells. VCAM-1 transfected L cells were produced using standard techniques: VCAM-1 cDNA was isolated by PCR; primers were synthesized based on the published sequence and template RNA was isolated from TNF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The isolated cDNA was transfected into mouse L cells and clones expressing high levels of VCAM-1 message were isolated. For adhesion assays, VCAM-1 L cells were plated on 96 well plates and allowed to reach confluency. U937 cells were fluorescently labeled with PKH26 (Zynaxis Cell Science, Inc., Malvern, Pa.), pretreated with hybridoma supernatants for 30 minutes on ice (200,000 cells\/sample), and added to individual VCAM-1 wells. Adhesion was allowed to occur for 30 minutes at room temperature, the wells were then washed to remove unbound cells, and the remaining cells were lysed with 40 \u03bcl of 0.1% Triton. 20 \u03bcl of the extract was analyzed on a Pandex plate reader to determine the degree of fluorescence (i.e., the number of cells bound). The degree of binding was determined by the percent of fluorescence relative to the fluorescence associated with the total number of input cells\/well (i.e., 200,000 U937 cells). Two individual hybridomas were identified as potent blockers of Ramos binding to VCAM-1 and were stabilized as clones. The antibodies were designated as TY21.6 and TY21.12.","It was determined that both antibodies react with \u03b1integrin since the antibodies precipitated two protein bands from a lysate of cell surface-labeled human lymphocytes. These proteins were 150 and 130 kD in molecular weight, which corresponds to the known molecular weights of the \u03b1and \u03b2integrin chains, respectively. Identical bands were precipitated in a parallel sample by a commercially available, well-characterized antibody against human \u03b1integrin (HP2\/1 antibody). No other protein bands were detected. These results suggest that 21.6 and 21.12 react with the \u03b1\u03b2integrin complex.","The TY21.6 and 21.12 antibodies were further characterized by FACS analysis, using standard methods for staining cells by indirect immunofluorescence. Both antibodies react with the human B cell line, JY (which expresses \u03b1integrin, but only low levels of \u03b2). Both antibodies fail to react with human K562 cells or with human neutrophils (which express \u03b2but very low levels of \u03b1integrin). Finally, both antibodies react with mouse L cells transfected with human \u03b1\u03b2integrin (produced as described above for VCAM-1 transfected L cells, using the human T cell line Jurkat for template RNA), but not with control transfected L cells. An identical pattern of reactivity was obtained with HP2\/1, whereas a well-characterized antibody against \u03b2integrin (AIIB2) did not react with JY, but did react with K562 and neutrophils. Thus, TY21.6 and TY21.12 selectively react with \u03b1integrin.","B. Functional Characterization of TY21.6, TY21.12 and L25. All three antibodies, TY21.6, TY21.12 and L-25 (Clayberger et al., 138: 1510-1514 (1987)); effectively inhibit human lymphocyte binding to TNF-stimulated rat brain EC. Primary rat brain EC, or rat brain EC clones (described above) were plated on 96 well tissue culture plates. EC in some of the wells were stimulated with TNF (as described above) for 4-24 hours. Jurkat, U937, or Ramos cells were fluorescently labeled (as described above), pretreated with the indicated antibody, and then added to individual wells (200,000 cells\/well; triplicate wells\/antibody treatment).
