receptors (LXRs). The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of the invention and methods of utilizing those compositions for modulating the activity of liver X receptor. In particular, pyrazole isomers and derivatives are provided for modulating the activity of LXRs.","Nuclear receptors are a superfamily of regulatory proteins that are structurally and functionally related and are receptors for, e.g., steroids, retinoids, vitamin D and thyroid hormones (see, e.g., Evans (1988) 240:889-895). These proteins bind to cis-acting elements in the promoters of their target genes and modulate gene expression in response to ligands for the receptors.","Nuclear receptors can be classified based on their DNA binding properties (see, e.g., Evans, supra and Glass (1994) 15:391-407). For example, one class of nuclear receptors includes the glucocorticoid, estrogen, androgen, progestin and mineralocorticoid receptors which bind as homodimers to hormone response elements (HREs) organized as inverted repeats (see, e.g., Glass, supra). A second class of receptors, including those activated by retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, vitamin D, fatty acids\/peroxisome proliferators (i.e., peroxisome proliferator activated receptors or PPARs) and ecdysone, bind to HREs as heterodimers with a common partner, the retinoid X receptors (i.e., RXRs, also known as the 9-cis retinoic acid receptors; see, e.g., Levin et al. (1992) 355:359-361 and Heyman et al. (1992) 68:397-406).","RXRs are unique among the nuclear receptors in that they bind DNA as a homodimer and are required as a heterodimeric partner for a number of additional nuclear receptors to bind DNA (see, e.g., Mangelsdorf et al. (1995) 83:841-850). The latter receptors, termed the class II nuclear receptor subfamily, include many which are established or implicated as important regulators of gene expression.","There are three RXR genes (see, e.g., Mangelsdorf et al. (1992) 6:329-344), coding for RXR\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, all of which are able to heterodimerize with any of the class II receptors, although there appear to be preferences for distinct RXR subtypes by partner receptors in vivo (see, e.g., Chiba et al. (1997) 7:3013-3020). In the adult liver, RXR\u03b1 is the most abundant of the three RXRs (see, e.g., Mangelsdorf et al. (1992) 6:329-344), suggesting that it might have a prominent role in hepatic functions that involve regulation by class II nuclear receptors. See also, Wan et al. (2000) 20:4436-4444.","Orphan Nuclear Receptors","Included in the nuclear receptor superfamily of regulatory proteins are nuclear receptors for whom the ligand is known and those which lack known ligands. Nuclear receptors falling in the latter category are referred to as orphan nuclear receptors. The search for activators for orphan receptors has led to the discovery of previously unknown signaling pathways (see, e.g., Levin et al., (1992), supra and Heyman et al., (1992), supra). For example, it has been reported that bile acids, which are involved in physiological processes such as cholesterol catabolism, are ligands for the franesoid X receptor (FXR).","Because it is known that products of intermediary metabolism act as transcriptional regulators in bacteria and yeast, such molecules may serve similar functions in higher organisms (see, e.g., Tomkins (1975) 189:760-763 and O'Malley (1989) 125:1119-1120). For example, one biosynthetic pathway in higher eukaryotes is the mevalonate pathway, which leads to the synthesis of cholesterol, bile acids, porphyrin, dolichol, ubiquinone, carotenoids, retinoids, vitamin D, steroid hormones and farnesylated proteins.","LXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2","LXR\u03b1 is found predominantly in the liver, with lower levels found in kidney, intestine, spleen and adrenal tissue (see, e.g., Willy, et al. (1995) Gene Dev. 9(9):1033-1045) LXR\u03b2 is ubiquitous in mammals and was found in nearly all tissues examined. LXRs are activated by certain naturally occurring, oxidized derivatives of cholesterol (see, e.g., Lehmann, et al. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272(6):3137-3140). LXR\u03b1 is activated by oxycholesterol and promotes cholesterol metabolism (Peet et al. (1998) Cell 93:693-704). Thus, LXRs appear to play a role in, e.g., cholesterol metabolism (see, e.g., Janowski, et al. (1996) Nature 383:728-731).","Nuclear Receptors and Disease","Nuclear receptor activity has been implicated in a variety of diseases and disorders, including, but not limited to, hypercholesterolemia (see, e.g., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 00\/57915), osteoporosis and vitamin deficiency (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,316,5103), hyperlipoproteinemia (see, e.g., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 01\/60818), hypertriglyceridemia, lipodystrophy, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see, e.g., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 01\/82917), atherosclerosis and gallstones (see, e.g., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 00\/37077), disorders of the skin and mucous membranes (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,184,215 and 6,187,814, and International Patent Application Publication No. WO 98\/32444), acne (see, e.g., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 00\/49992), and cancer, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (see e.g., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 00\/17334). Activity of nuclear receptors, including LXRs, FXRs and PPARs, and orphan nuclear receptors, has been implicated in physiological processes including, but not limited to, bile acid biosynthesis, cholesterol metabolism or catabolism, and modulation of cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) transcription (see, e.g., Chiang et al. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:10918-10924), HDL metabolism (see, e.g., Urizar et al. (2000) 275:39313-39317 and International Patent Application Publication No. WO 01\/03705), and increased cholesterol efflux and increased expression of ATP binding cassette transporter protein (ABC) (see, e.g., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 00\/78972).","Thus, there is a need for compounds, compositions and methods of modulating the activity of nuclear receptors, including LXRs, FXRs, PPARs and orphan nuclear receptors. Such compounds are useful in the treatment, prevention, inhibition or amelioration of one or more symptoms of diseases or disorders in which nuclear receptor activity is implicated.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a compound according the following formulas Ia-d,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"101.26mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08703805-20140422-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2","21","3"]},"Compounds for use in compositions and methods for modulating the activity of nuclear receptors are provided.

Nevertheless, such terms are also used to convey corresponding multivalent moieties under the appropriate structural circumstances clear to those skilled in the art. For example, while an \u201calkyl\u201d moiety generally refers to a monovalent radical (e.g. CH\u2014CH\u2014), in certain circumstances a bivalent linking moiety can be \u201calkyl,\u201d in which case those skilled in the art will understand the alkyl to be a divalent radical (e.g., \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014), which is equivalent to the teen \u201calkylene.\u201d (Similarly, in circumstances in which a divalent moiety is required and is stated as being \u201caryl,\u201d those skilled in the art will understand that the term \u201caryl\u201d refers to the corresponding divalent moiety, arylene.) All atoms are understood to have their normal number of valences for bond formation (i.e., 4 for carbon, 3 for N, 2 for O, and 2, 4, or 6 for S, depending on the oxidation state of the S). On occasion a moiety may be defined, for example, as (A)-B\u2014, wherein a is 0 or 1. In such instances, when a is 0, the moiety is B\u2014, and when a is 1 the moiety is A-B\u2014. Similarly, CalkylORincludes both \u2014ORand C-C\u2014OR, and \u2014[C(R)]\u2014 is a bond when m is 0. In the instances when a moiety is a divalent radical, there is no implied limitation on the location of the two bonds connecting the linking radical to its two supporting chemical units. For example, for a divalent cyclohexyl radical, the cyclohexyl can be connected either through two separate chemical bonds to two distinct carbons atoms within the ring; or the two bonds can be connected to the same carbon atom in the ring. In an illustrative example, if a divalent cyclopropyl radical connects connect two phenyl rings together, this definition encompasses both 1,2-diphenylcyclopropyl and 1,1-diphenylcyclopropyl units.","As used herein the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example, \u201ca compound\u201d refers to one or more of such compounds, while \u201cthe enzyme\u201d includes a particular enzyme as well as other family members and equivalents thereof as known to those skilled in the art.

In some cases, nuclear receptors can act through second messenger signaling pathways, and the invention would apply to these actions as well. The activation can be similar in degree to that provided by a natural hormone for the receptor, or can be stronger (optionally referred to as a \u201cstrong agonist\u201d), or can be weaker (optionally referred to as a \u201cweak agonist\u201d or \u201cpartial agonist\u201d). An example of a hormone for a nuclear receptor is thyroid hormone, which is a natural hormone for the thyroid receptor. A \u201cputative agonist\u201d is an agent to be tested for agonist activity.","Partial agonists or partial antagonists bind to receptors and yield a response less than that of a full agonist at saturating ligand concentrations. A partial agonist will block binding of a full agonist and suppress receptor activity to the level induced by the partial agonist alone. For example, partial agonists bind to receptors and induce only part of the changes in the receptors that are induced by agonists. The differences can be qualitative or quantitative. Thus, a partial agonist can induce some of the conformation changes induced by agonists, but not others, or it may only induce certain changes to a limited extent. Some of these compounds are naturally produced. For example, many plant estrogens (phytoestrogens), such as genistein, can behave as partial estrogen receptor agonists.","An \u201cantagonist for a nuclear receptor\u201d is an agent that reduces or blocks activity mediated by the receptor in response to an agonist of the receptor. The activity of the antagonist can be mediated, e.g., by blocking binding of the agonist to the receptor, or by altering receptor configuration and\/or activity of the receptor. A \u201cputative antagonist\u201d is an agent to be tested for antagonist activity.","A \u201cnuclear receptor\u201d is a receptor that activates or represses transcription of one or more genes in the nucleus (but can also have second messenger signaling actions), typically in conjunction with other transcription factors. The nuclear receptor is activated by the natural cognate ligand for the receptor. Nuclear receptors are ordinarily found in the cytoplasm or nucleus, rather than being membrane-bound. Nuclear receptor is a member of a superfamily of regulatory proteins that are receptors for, e.g., steroids, retinoids, vitamin D and thyroid hormones. These proteins bind to cis-acting elements in the promoters of their target genes and modulate gene expression in response to a ligand therefor. Nuclear receptors may be classified based on their DNA binding properties. For example, the glucocorticoid, estrogen, androgen, progestin and mineralocorticoid receptors bind as homodimers to hormone response elements (HREs) organized as inverted repeats. Another example are receptors, including those activated by retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, vitamin D, fatty acids\/peroxisome proliferators and ecdysone, that bind to HREs as heterodimers with a common partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Among the latter receptors is LXR.","As used herein, an orphan nuclear receptor is a nuclear receptor for which the natural ligand is unknown.","As used herein, liver X receptor or LXR refers to a nuclear receptor implicated in cholesterol biosynthesis.

Thus, the term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to a metabolic precursor of a compound of the invention that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject in need thereof, but is converted in vivo to an active compound of the invention. Prodrugs are typically rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the invention, for example, by hydrolysis in blood. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., \u201cPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\u201d A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed.

The term \u201cprodrug\u201d is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers which release the active compound of the invention in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of a compound of the invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound of the invention in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound of the invention. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, those of skill in this art, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, can design prodrugs of the compound (see, e.g., Nogrady (1985) , Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392). Prodrugs include compounds of the invention wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the compound of the invention is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively.

See, e.g., LeRoith, D. et al., (eds.), DIABETES MELLITUS (Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, Pa. U.S.A. 1996). According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes mellitus is estimated to affect approximately 6% of the world population. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased risk and premature mortality due to an increased risk for macrovascular and macrovascular diseases, including nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease and coronary heart disease. Therefore, control of glucose homeostasis is a critically important approach for the treatment of diabetes.","There are two major forms of diabetes: type 1 diabetes (formerly referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes or IDEM); and type 2 diabetes (formerly referred to as noninsulin dependent diabetes or NIDDM).","Type 2 diabetes is a disease characterized by insulin resistance accompanied by relative, rather than absolute, insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes can range from predominant insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to predominant insulin deficiency with some insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. In insulin resistant individuals, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect. When inadequate amounts of insulin are present to compensate for insulin resistance and adequate control of glucose, a state of impaired glucose tolerance develops. In a significant number of individuals, insulin secretion declines further and the plasma glucose level rises, resulting in the clinical state of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes can be due to a profound resistance to insulin stimulating regulatory effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues: muscle, liver and adipose tissue. This resistance to insulin responsiveness results in insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in liver. In Type 2 diabetes, free fatty acid levels are often elevated in obese and some non-obese patients and lipid oxidation is increased.","Premature development of atherosclerosis and increased rate of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases are characteristic features of patients with diabetes. Hyperlipidemia is an important precipitating factor for these diseases. Hyperlipidemia is a condition generally characterized by an abnormal increase in serum lipids, e.g., cholesterol and triglyceride, in the bloodstream and is an important risk factor in developing atherosclerosis and heart disease. For a review of disorders of lipid metabolism, see, e.g., Wilson, J. et al., (ed.), Disorders of Lipid Metabolism, Chapter 23, Textbook of Endocrinology, 9th Edition, (W. B. Sanders Company, Philadelphia, Pa. U.S.A. 1998). Hyperlipidemia is usually classified as primary or secondary hyperlipidemia. Primary hyperlipidemia is generally caused by genetic defects, while secondary hyperlipidemia is generally caused by other factors, such as various disease states, drugs, and dietary factors. Alternatively, hyperlipidemia can result from both a combination of primary and secondary causes of hyperlipidemia. Elevated cholesterol levels are associated with a number of disease states, including coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, carotid artery disease, strokes, cerebral arteriosclerosis, and xanthoma.","Dyslipidemia, or abnormal levels of lipoproteins in blood plasma, is a frequent occurrence among diabetics, and has been shown to be one of the main contributors to the increased incidence of coronary events and deaths among diabetic subjects (see, e.g., Joslin, E. Ann. Chico. Med. (1927), Vol. 5, pp. 1061-1079). Epidemiological studies since then have confirmed the association and have shown a several-fold increase in coronary deaths among diabetic subjects when compared with non-diabetic subjects (see, e.g., Garcia, M. J. et al., Diabetes (1974), Vol. 23, pp. 105-11 (1974); and Laakso, M. and Lehto, S., Diabetes Reviews (1997), Vol. 5, No. 4, pp. 294-315). Several lipoprotein abnormalities have been described among diabetic subjects (Howard B., et al., Arteriosclerosis (1978), Vol. 30, pp. 153-162).","The compounds of the invention can also be used effectively in combination with one or more additional active diabetes agents depending on the desired target therapy (see, e.g., Turner, N. et al., Prog. Drug Res. (1998), Vol. 51, pp. 33-94; Haffner, S., Diabetes Care (1998), Vol. 21, pp. 160-178; and DeFronzo, R. et al. (eds.), Diabetes Reviews (1997), Vol. 5, No. 4). A number of studies have investigated the benefits of combination therapies with oral agents (see, e.g., Mahler, R., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metal).

(1996), Vol. 13, pp. 365-370; Kwiterovich, P., Am. J. Cardiol (1998), Vol 82 (12A), pp. 3U-17U). These studies indicate that diabetes and hyperlipidemia modulation can be further improved by the addition of a second agent to therapeutic regimen.","Accordingly, the compounds of the invention may be used in combination with one or more of the following therapeutic agents in treating diabetes: sulfonylureas (such as chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, acetohexamide, tolazamide, glyburide, gliclazide, glynase, glimepiride, and glipizide), biguanides (such as metformin), thiazolidinediones (such as ciglitazone, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone), and related insulin sensitizers, such as selective and non-selective activators of PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2\/\u03b4 and PPAR\u03b3; dehydroepiandrosterone (also referred to as DHEA or its conjugated sulphate ester, DHEA-SO4); antiglucocorticoids; TNF\u03b1 inhibitors; \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors (such as acarbose, miglitol, and voglibose), pramlintide (a synthetic analog of the human hormone amylin), other insulin secretogogues (such as repaglinide, gliquidone, and nateglinide), insulin, as well as therapeutic agents discussed above for treating atherosclerosis.","Further provided by this invention are methods of using the compounds of the invention to treat obesity, as well as the complications of obesity. Obesity is linked to a variety of medical conditions including diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Obesity is also a known risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes (See, e.g., Barrett-Conner, E., Epidemol. Rev. (1989), Vol. 11, pp. 172-181; and Knowler, et al., Am. J. Clin. Nutr. (1991), Vol. 53, pp. 1543-1551).","In addition, the compounds of the invention can be used in combination with agents used in treated obesity or obesity-related disorders. Such agents, include, but are not limited to, phenylpropanolamine, phentermine, diethylpropion, mazindol, fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, phentiramine, \u03b2adrenoceptor agonist agents; sibutramine, gastrointestinal lipase inhibitors (such as orlistat), and leptins. Other agents used in treating obesity or obesity-related disorders include neuropeptide Y, enterostatin, cholecytokinin, bombesin, amylin, histamine Hreceptors, dopamine Dreceptor modulators, melanocyte stimulating hormone, corticotrophin releasing factor, galanin and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA).","Evaluation of the Use of the Compounds of the Invention","Standard physiological, pharmacological and biochemical procedures are available for testing the compounds to identify those that possess biological activities that modulate the activity or nuclear receptors, including the LXRs (LXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2). Such assays include, for example, biochemical assays such as binding assays, fluorescence polarization assays, FRET based coactivator recruitment assays (see, generally, Glickman et al, J. Biomolecular Screening (2002), Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 3-10, as well as cell based assays including the co-transfection assay, the use of LBD-Gal 4 chimeras and protein-protein interaction assays, (see, Lehmann. et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1997), Vol. 272, No. 6, pp. 3137-3140.","High throughput screening systems are commercially available (see, e.g., Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, Mass.; Air Technical Industries, Mentor, Ohio; Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, Calif.; Precision Systems, Inc., Natick, Mass.) that enable these assays to be run in a high throughput mode. These systems typically automate entire procedures, including all sample and reagent pipetting, liquid dispensing timed incubations, and final readings of the microplate in detector(s) appropriate for the assay. These configurable systems provide high throughput and rapid start up as well as a high degree of flexibility and customization. The manufacturers of such systems provide detailed protocols for various high throughput systems. Thus, for example, Zymark Corp. provides technical bulletins describing screening systems for detecting the modulation of gene transcription, ligand binding, and the like.","Assays that do not require washing or liquid separation steps are preferred for such high throughput screening systems and include biochemical assays such as fluorescence polarization assays (see, for example, Owicki, J., Biomol. Screen (2000 October), Vol. 5, No 5, pp. 297), scintillation proximity assays (SPA) (see, for example, Carpenter et al., Methods Mol. Biol. (2002), Vol 190, pp. 31-49) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer energy transfer (FRED or time resolved FRET based coactivator recruitment assays (Mukherjee et al., J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. (2002 July); Vol. 81, No. 3, pp. 217-25; (Zhou et al., Mol. Endocrinol. (1998 October), Vol. 12, No. 10, pp. 1594-604). Generally such assays can be preformed using either the full length receptor, or isolated ligand binding domain (LBD). In the case of LXR\u03b1, the LBD comprises amino acids 188-447, for LXR\u03b2 the LDB comprises amino acids 198-461, and for oat, the LBD comprises amino acids 244 to 472 of the full length sequence.","If a fluorescently labeled ligand is available, fluorescence polarization assays provide a way of detecting binding of compounds to the nuclear receptor of interest by measuring changes in fluorescence polarization that occur as a result of the displacement of a trace amount of the label ligand by the compound. Additionally this approach can also be used to monitor the ligand dependent association of a fluorescently labeled coactivator peptide to the nuclear receptor of interest to detect ligand binding to the nuclear receptor of interest.","The ability of a compound to bind to a receptor, or heterodimer complex with RXR, can also be measured in a homogeneous assay format by assessing the degree to which the compound can compete off a radiolabelled ligand with known affinity for the receptor using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA). In this approach, the radioactivity emitted by a radiolabelled compound (for example, [H] 24,25 Epoxycholesterol) generates an optical signal when it is brought into close proximity to a scintillant such as a YSI-copper containing bead, to which the nuclear receptor is bound. If the radiolabelled compound is displaced from the nuclear receptor the amount of light emitted from the nuclear receptor bound scintillant decreases, and this can be readily detected using standard microplate liquid scintillation plate readers such as, for example, a Wallac MicroBeta reader.","The heterodimerization of LXR with RXR\u03b1 can also be measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), or time resolved FRET, to monitor the ability of the compounds provided herein to bind to LXR or other nuclear receptors. Both approaches rely upon the fact that energy transfer from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule only occurs when donor and acceptor are in close proximity. Typically the purified LBD of the nuclear receptor of interest is labeled with biotin then mixed with stoichiometric amounts of europium labeled streptavidin (Wallac Inc.), and the purified LBD of RXR\u03b1 is labeled with a suitable fluorophore such as CY5\u2122. Equimolar amounts of each modified LBD are mixed together and allowed to equilibrate for at least 1 hour prior to addition to either variable or constant concentrations of the sample for which the affinity is to be determined. After equilibration, the time-resolved fluorescent signal is quantitated using a fluorescent plate reader. The affinity of the compound can then be estimated from a plot of fluorescence versus concentration of compound added.","This approach can also be exploited to measure the ligand dependent interaction of a co-activator peptide with a nuclear receptor in order to characterize the agonist or antagonist activity of the compounds disclosed herein. Typically the assay in this case involves the use a recombinant Glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-nuclear receptor ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a synthetic biotinylated peptide sequenced derived from the receptor interacting domain of a co-activator peptide such as the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1). Typically GST-LBD is labeled with a europium chelate (donor) via a europium-tagged anti-GST antibody, and the coactivator peptide is labeled with allophycocyanin via a streptavidin-biotin linkage.","In the presence of an agonist for the nuclear receptor, the peptide is recruited to the GST-LBD bringing europium and allophycocyanin into close proximity to enable energy transfer from the europium chelate to the allophycocyanin. Upon excitation of the complex with light at 340 nm excitation energy absorbed by the europium chelate is transmitted to the allophycocyanin moiety resulting in emission at 665 nm. If the europium chelate is not brought in to close proximity to the allophycocyanin moiety there is little or no energy transfer and excitation of the europium chelate results in emission at 615 nm. Thus the intensity of light emitted at 665 nm gives an indication of the strength of the protein-protein interaction. The activity of a nuclear receptor antagonist can be measured by determining the ability of a compound to competitively inhibit (i.e., IC) the activity of an agonist for the nuclear receptor","In addition, a variety of cell based assay methodologies may be successfully used in screening assays to identify and profile the specificity of compounds of the present invention. These approaches include the co-transfection assay, translocation assays, complementation assays and the use of gene activation technologies to over express endogenous nuclear receptors.","Three basic variants of the co-transfection assay strategy exist, co-transfection assays using full-length nuclear receptor, Co transfection assays using chimeric nuclear receptors comprising the ligand binding domain of the nuclear receptor of interest fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain, and assays based around the use of the mammalian two hybrid assay system.","The basic co-transfection assay is based on the co-transfection into the cell of an expression plasmid to express the nuclear receptor of interest in the cell with a reporter plasmid comprising a reporter gene whose expression is under the control of DNA sequence that is capable of interacting with that nuclear receptor (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,071,773; 5,298,429 and 6,416,957). Treatment of the transfected cells with an agonist for the nuclear receptor increases the transcriptional activity of that receptor which is reflected by an increase in expression of the reporter gene which may be measured by a variety of standard procedures.","For those receptors that function as heterodimers with RXR, such as the LXRs, the co-transfection assay typically includes the use of expression plasmids for both the nuclear receptor of interest and RXR. Typical co-transfection assays require access to the full length nuclear receptor and suitable response elements that provide sufficient screening sensitivity and specificity to the nuclear receptor of interest.","Typically, the expression plasmid comprises: (1) a promoter, such as an SV40 early region promoter, HSV tk promoter or phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk) promoter, CMV promoter, Sr\u03b1 promoter or other suitable control elements known in the art, (2) a cloned polynucleotide sequence, such as a cDNA encoding a receptor, co-factor, or fragment thereof, ligated to the promoter in sense orientation so that transcription from the promoter will produce a RNA that encodes a functional protein, and (3) a polyadenylation sequence. For example and not limitation, an expression cassette of the invention may comprise the cDNA expression cloning vectors, or other preferred expression vectors known and commercially available from vendors such as Invitrogen, (CA), Stratagene, (CA) or Clontech, (CA). Alternatively expression vectors developed by academic groups such as the pCMX vectors originally developed in the Evans lab (Willey et al. Genes & Development 9 1033-1045 (1995)) may also be used.","The transcriptional regulatory sequences in an expression cassette are selected by the practitioner based on the intended application; depending upon the specific use, transcription regulation can employ inducible, repressible, constitutive, cell-type specific, developmental stage-specific, sex-specific, or other desired type of promoter or control sequence.","Alternatively, the expression plasmid may comprise an activation sequence to activate or increase the expression of an endogenous chromosomal sequence. Such activation sequences include for example, a synthetic zinc finger motif (for example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,534,261 and 6,503,7171) or a strong promoter or enhancer sequence together with a targeting sequence to enable homologous or non-homologous recombination of the activating sequence upstream of the gene of interest.","Genes encoding the following full-length previously described proteins, which are suitable for use in the co-transfection studies and profiling the compounds described herein, include human LXR\u03b1 (accession U22662), human LXR\u03b2 (accession U07132), rat FXR (accession U18374), human FXR (accession NM005123), human RXR\u03b1 (accession NM002957), human RXR\u03b2 (accession XM042579), human RXR\u03b3 (accession XM053680), human PPAR\u03b1 (accession X57638) and human PPAR\u03b4 (accession U10375). All accession numbers in this application refer to GenBank accession numbers.","Reporter plasmids may be constructed using standard molecular biological techniques by placing cDNA encoding for the reporter gene downstream from a suitable minimal promoter. For example luciferase reporter plasmids may be constructed by placing cDNA encoding firefly luciferase (typically with SV40 small t intron and poly-A tail, (de Wet et al., (1987) Mol. Cell. Biol. 7 725-735) down stream from the herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter (located at nucleotides residues-105 to 51 of the thymidine kinase nucleotide sequence, obtained for example, from the plasmid pBLCAT2 (Luckow & Schutz (1987) Nucl. Acid. Res. 15 5490-5494)) which is linked in turn to the appropriate response element (RE).","The choice of hormone response element is dependent upon the type of assay to be used. In the case of the use of the full-length LXR\u03b1 or LXR\u03b2 a reporter plasmid comprising a known LXR RE would typically be used, such as for example in a reporter plasmid such as LXREx1-tk-luciferase, (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,661, which is hereby incorporated by reference). In the case of a LXR\u03b1 or LXR\u03b2-LBD-Gal4 fusion, GAL4 Upstream Activating Sequences (UAS) would be used. Typically the GAL4. UAS would comprise the sequence 5\u2032CGGRNNRCYNYNCNCCG-3\u2032, where Y=C or T, R=A or G, and N=A, C, T or G, and would be present as a tandem repeat of 4 copies.","Numerous methods of co-transfecting the expression and reporter plasmids are known to those of skill in the art and may be used for the co-transfection assay to introduce the plasmids into a suitable cell type. Typically such a cell will not endogenously express nuclear receptors that interact with the response elements used in the reporter plasmid.","Numerous reporter gene systems are known in the art and include, for example, alkaline phosphatase (see, Berger, J., et al., Gene (1988), Vol. 66, pp. 1-10; and Kain, S. R., Methods. Mol. Biol. (1997), Vol. 63, pp. 49-60), (3-galactosidase (See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,012, issued Dec. 3, 1991 to Nolan et al., and Bronstein, I., et al., J. Chemilum. Biolum. (1989), Vol. 4, pp. 99-111), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (See, Gorman et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. (1982), Vol. 2, pp. 1044-51), \u03b2-glucuronidase, peroxidase, \u03b2-lactamase (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,741,657 and 5,955,604), catalytic antibodies, luciferases (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,221,623; 5,683,888; 5,674,713; 5,650,289; and 5,843,746) and naturally fluorescent proteins (Tsien, R. Y., Annu. Rev. Biochem. (1998), Vol. 67, pp. 509-44).","The use of chimeras comprising the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the nuclear receptor of interest to a heterologous DNA binding domain (DBD) expands the versatility of cell based assays by directing activation of the nuclear receptor in question to defined DNA binding elements recognized by defined DNA binding domain (see WO95\/18380). This assay expands the utility of cell based co-transfection assays in cases where the biological response or screening window using the native DNA binding domain is not satisfactory.","In general the methodology is similar to that used with the basic co-transfection assay, except that a chimeric construct is used in place of the full length nuclear receptor. As with the full length nuclear receptor, treatment of the transfected cells with an agonist for the nuclear receptor LBD increases the transcriptional activity of the heterologous DNA binding domain which is reflected by an increase in expression of the reporter gene as described above. Typically for such chimeric constructs, the DNA binding domains from defined nuclear receptors, or from yeast or bacterially derived transcriptional regulators such as members of the GAL 4 and Lex A\/Umud super families are used","A third cell based assay of utility for screening compounds of the present invention is a mammalian two-hybrid assay that measures the ability of the nuclear hormone receptor to interact with a cofactor in the presence of a ligand (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,667,973, 5,283,173 and 5,468,614). The basic approach is to create three plasmid constructs that enable the interaction of the nuclear receptor with the interacting protein to be coupled to a transcriptional readout within a living cell. The first construct is an expression plasmid for expressing a fusion protein comprising the interacting protein, or a portion of that protein containing the interacting domain, fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain. The second expression plasmid comprises DNA encoding the nuclear receptor of interest fused to a strong transcription activation domain such as VP16, and the third construct comprises the reporter plasmid comprising a reporter gene with a minimal promoter and GAL4 upstream activating sequences.","Once all three plasmids are introduced into a cell, the GAL4 DNA binding domain encoded in the first construct allows for specific binding of the fusion protein to GAL4 sites upstream of a minimal promoter. However because the GAL4 DNA binding domain typically has no strong transcriptional activation properties in isolation, expression of the reporter gene occurs only at a low level. In the presence of a ligand, the nuclear receptor-VP16 fusion protein can bind to the GAL4-interacting protein fusion protein bringing the strong transcriptional activator VP16 in close proximity to the GAL4 binding sites and minimal promoter region of the reporter gene. This interaction significantly enhances the transcription of the reporter gene which can be measured for various reporter genes as described above. Transcription of the reporter gene is thus driven by the interaction of the interacting protein and nuclear receptor of interest in a ligand dependent fashion.","Any compound which is a candidate for activation of LXR\u03b1 or LXR\u03b2 may be tested by these methods. Generally, compounds are tested at several different concentrations to optimize the chances that activation of the receptor will be detected and recognized if present. Typically assays are performed in triplicate and vary within experimental error by less than 15%. each experiment is typically repeated three or more times with similar results.","Activity of the reporter gene can be conveniently normalized to the internal control and the data plotted as fold activation relative to untreated cells. A positive control compound (agonist) may be included along with DMSO as high and low controls for normalization of the assay data. Similarly, antagonist activity can be measured by determining the ability of a compound to competitively inhibit the activity of an agonist.","Additionally the compounds and compositions can be evaluated for their ability to increase or decrease the expression of genes known to be modulated by LXR\u03b1 or LXR\u03b2 and other nuclear receptors in vivo, using Northern-blot RT PCR or oligonucleotide microarray analysis to analyze RNA levels. Western-blot analysis can be used to measure expression of proteins encoded by LXR target genes. Genes that are known to be regulated by the LXRs include the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCG5, ABCG8, the sterol response element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) gene, stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) and the apolipoprotein apoE gene (ApoE).","Established animal models exist for a number of diseases of direct relevance to the claimed compounds and these can be used to further profile and characterize the claimed compounds. These model systems include diabetic dislipidemia using Zucker (fa\/fa) rats or (db\/db) mice, spontaneous hyperlipidemia using apolipoprotein E deficient mice (ApoE), diet-induced hyperlipidemia, using low density lipoprotein receptor deficient mice (LDLR) and atherosclerosis using both the Apo E() and LDLR() mice fed a western diet. (21% fat 0.05% cholesterol). Additionally LXR or FXR animal models (e.g., knockout mice) can be used to further evaluate the present compounds and compositions in vivo (see, for example, Peet, et al., Cell (1998), Vol. 93, pp. 693-704, and Sinal, et al., Cell (2000), Vol. 102, pp. 731-744).","Administration of the Compounds of the Invention","Administration of the compounds of the invention, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, in pure form or in an appropriate pharmaceutical composition, can be carried out via any of the accepted modes of administration of agents for serving similar utilities. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be prepared by combining a compound of the invention with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient, and may be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granules, ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants, gels, microspheres, and aerosols. Typical routes of administering such pharmaceutical compositions include, without limitation, oral, topical, transdermal, inhalation, parenteral, sublingual, rectal, vaginal, and intranasal. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques.

Compositions that will be administered to a subject or patient take the form of one or more dosage units, where for example, a tablet may be a single dosage unit, and a container of a compound of the invention in aerosol form may hold a plurality of dosage units. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., (Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1990). The composition to be administered will, in any event, contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for treatment of a disease-state associated with the activity of a nuclear receptor in accordance with the teachings of this invention.","A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be in the form of a solid or liquid.

The liquid may be for oral administration or for delivery by injection, as two examples. When intended for oral administration, preferred composition contain, in addition to the present compounds, one or more of a sweetening agent, preservatives, dye\/colorant and flavor enhancer. In a composition intended to be administered by injection, one or more of a surfactant, preservative, wetting agent, dispersing agent, suspending agent, buffer, stabilizer and isotonic agent may be included.","The liquid pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, whether they be solutions, suspensions or other like form, may include one or more of the following adjuvants: sterile diluents such as water for injection, saline solution, preferably physiological saline, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride, fixed oils such as synthetic mono or diglycerides which may serve as the solvent or suspending medium, polyethylene glycols, glycerin, propylene glycol or other solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl paraben; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. Physiological saline is a preferred adjuvant. An injectable pharmaceutical composition is preferably sterile.","A liquid pharmaceutical composition of the invention intended for either parenteral or oral administration should contain an amount of a compound of the invention such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Typically, this amount is at least 0.01% of a compound of the invention in the composition. When intended for oral administration, this amount may be varied to be between 0.1 and about 70% of the weight of the composition. Preferred oral pharmaceutical compositions contain between about 4% and about 50% of the compound of the invention. Preferred pharmaceutical compositions and preparations according to the present invention are prepared so that a parenteral dosage unit contains between 0.01 to 1% by weight of the compound of the invention.","The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be intended for topical administration, in which case the carrier may suitably comprise a solution, emulsion, ointment or gel base. The base, for example, may comprise one or more of the following: petrolatum, lanolin, polyethylene glycols, bee wax, mineral oil, diluents such as water and alcohol, and emulsifiers and stabilizers. Thickening agents may be present in a pharmaceutical composition for topical administration. If intended for transdermal administration, the composition may include a transdermal patch or iontophoresis device. Topical formulations may contain a concentration of the compound of the invention from about 0.1 to about 10% w\/v (weight per unit volume).","The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be intended for rectal administration, in the form, e.g., of a suppository, which will melt in the rectum and release the drug. The composition for rectal administration may contain an oleaginous base as a suitable nonirritating excipient. Such bases include, without limitation, lanolin, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycol.","The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may include various materials, which modify the physical form of a solid or liquid dosage unit. For example, the composition may include materials that form a coating shell around the active ingredients. The materials that form the coating shell are typically inert, and may be selected from, for example, sugar, shellac, and other enteric coating agents. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be encased in a gelatin capsule.","The pharmaceutical composition of the invention in solid or liquid form may include an agent that binds to the compound of the invention and thereby assists in the delivery of the compound. Suitable agents that may act in this capacity include a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody, a protein or a liposome.","The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may consist of dosage units that can be administered as an aerosol. The term aerosol is used to denote a variety of systems ranging from those of colloidal nature to systems consisting of pressurized packages. Delivery may be by a liquefied or compressed gas or by a suitable pump system that dispenses the active ingredients. Aerosols of compounds of the invention may be delivered in single phase, bi-phasic, or tri-phasic systems in order to deliver the active ingredient(s). Delivery of the aerosol includes the necessary container, activators, valves, subcontainers, and the like, which together may form a kit. One skilled in the art, without undue experimentation may determine preferred aerosols.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be prepared by methodology well known in the pharmaceutical art. For example, a pharmaceutical composition intended to be administered by injection can be prepared by combining a compound of the invention with sterile, distilled water so as to form a solution. A surfactant may be added to facilitate the formation of a homogeneous solution or suspension. Surfactants are compounds that non-covalently interact with the compound of the invention so as to facilitate dissolution or homogeneous suspension of the compound in the aqueous delivery system.","The compounds of the invention, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are administered in a therapeutically effective amount, which will vary depending upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed; the metabolic stability and length of action of the compound; the age, body weight, general health, sex, and diet of the patient; the mode and time of administration; the rate of excretion; the drug combination; the severity of the particular disorder or condition; and the subject undergoing therapy. Generally, a therapeutically effective daily dose is from about 0.1 mg to about 20 mg\/kg of body weight per day of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; preferably, from about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg\/kg of body weight per day; and most preferably, from about 0.1 mg to about 7.5 mg\/kg of body weight per day.","Compounds of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, may also be administered simultaneously with, prior to, or after administration of one or more of therapeutic agents described above in the Utility of the Compounds of the Invention. Such combination therapy includes administration of a single pharmaceutical dosage formulation which contains a compound of the invention and one or more additional active agents, as well as administration of the compound of the invention and each active agent in its own separate pharmaceutical dosage formulation. For example, a compound of the invention and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor can be administered to the patient together in a single oral dosage composition such as a tablet or capsule, or each agent administered in separate oral dosage formulations. Where separate dosage formulations are used, the compounds of the invention and one or more additional active agents can be administered at essentially the same time, i.e., concurrently, or at separately staggered times, i.e., sequentially; combination therapy is understood to include all these regimens.","Dosage information for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is well known in the art, since several HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are marketed in the U.S. In particular, the daily dosage amounts of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor may be the same or similar to those amounts which are employed for anti-hypercholesterolemic treatment and which are described in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR). For example, see the 50th Ed. of the PDR, 1996 (Medical Economics Co); in particular, see at page 216 the heading \u201cHypolipidemics,\u201d sub-heading \u201cHMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors,\u201d and the reference pages cited therein.
