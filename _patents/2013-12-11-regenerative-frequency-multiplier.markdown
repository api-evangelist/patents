title: Regenerative frequency multiplier
abstract: A technology is provided for generating an output frequency. An input signal with a defined frequency may be received. The input signal may be split so that a first signal with the defined frequency of the input signal is received at a frequency multiplier and a second signal with the defined frequency of the input signal is received at a frequency mixer. The first signal may be multiplied by N, wherein N is a predefined integer. The first signal may be limited to a predetermined frequency and passed to the frequency mixer. The first signal and the second signal may be mixed to produce at least two mixed signals. A first output signal and a second output signal may be generated based on the at least two mixed signals.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A frequency synthesizer may perform frequency multiplication, frequency division and\/or frequency mixing in order to generate an output signal with a frequency that is related to a frequency of the input signal (F). A frequency multiplier may generate an output signal that is a harmonic (i.e., multiple) of the input signal. For example, the output signal at the frequency multiplier may have a frequency of 2F. A frequency divider may generate an output frequency that is a fraction of the input signal (e.g., the output signal may have a frequency of F\/n, wherein n is an integer). A frequency mixer may mix two signals in order to calculate sum and difference frequency components of the two signals. Frequency multipliers, frequency dividers and\/or frequency mixers may be included in numerous electronic systems in which input frequencies are transformed to output frequencies, such as in radio receivers, global position system (GPS) devices, radar systems, electronic warfare (EW) systems, mobile telephones, satellite receivers, etc.","Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.","As used herein, the term \u201csubstantially\u201d refers to the complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result. For example, an object that is \u201csubstantially\u201d enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context. However, generally speaking the nearness of completion will be so as to have the same overall result as if absolute and total completion were obtained. The use of \u201csubstantially\u201d is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result.","An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Regenerative frequency dividers, as known, may be included in frequency synthesizers and\/or phase locked loops (PLLs) in order to generate an output signal with a frequency that is related to a frequency of an input signal.

For example, regenerative frequency dividers may be used for improving the performance of electronic countermeasures equipment, communications systems and laboratory instruments. In addition, regenerative frequency dividers may be key components in radio frequency (RF) and microwave systems. Furthermore, regenerative frequency dividers may be included in radar systems, electronic warfare (EW) systems, communication systems, etc.","In general, a regenerative frequency divider, as known, is a low-noise, non-linear analog feedback circuit.
