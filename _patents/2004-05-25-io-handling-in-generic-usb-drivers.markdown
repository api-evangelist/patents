title: I/O handling in generic USB drivers
abstract: Techniques are disclosed to provide I/O handling in generic USB drivers. More particularly, a generic USB device driver architecture is described which enables development through a user-mode USB library that accesses a generic kernel-mode driver. The architecture may be utilized to provide efficient development for I/O handling. In a described implementation, a method includes defining a data structure utilized to access a plugged-in device. A pipe policy of the data structure is defined and utilizing to access the plugged-in device through a plurality of routines provided by a generic user-mode library (e.g., a dynamic link library (DLL)). The generic user-mode library is communicatively coupled to a kernel-mode generic device driver. In another described implementation, a separate generic device driver is loaded for each plugged-in device or for each functionality supported by the device.

No. 10\/837,444, entitled \u201cGeneric USB Drivers\u201d, which was filed Apr. 29, 2004.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. \u00a92004 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.","The present invention generally relates to digital communications and, in an implementation, to generic universal serial bus (USB) drivers.","As computers become more commonplace, an ever-increasing number of functionalities are incorporated into a single computer system. Often, the additional functionality is provided by attaching an external device to the computer system. In turn, the external device communicates with the computer system to provide the additional functionality.","The Universal serial bus (USB) has become a standard communication channel for connecting external devices to a computer system. USB allows a number of devices to be connected to a same computer system simultaneously, while providing relatively high bandwidth. For example, the latest commonly available version of USB (e.g., USB 2.0) can transfer up to 480 Mbps (mega bits per second).","Vendors who provide USB devices are generally required to provide device drivers to enable access to these devices. Commonly, a device driver is a program and set of data that allows a computer system to access the device (e.g., read data from the device, write data to the device, send commands to the device, and receive status data from the device).","Currently, most USB device vendors are required to provide kernel-mode device drivers for their devices. Generally, a kernel is the central part of an operating system (OS) which remains active and in control of a computer system while the OS is running. For example, the kernel provides the necessary services (such as memory and process management) to the computer system. As a result, kernel-mode drivers can easily cause an unrecoverable system-wide crash in the event of the smallest of malfunctions (or bugs). Additionally, implementing USB drivers in kernel-mode necessitates investment of time and energy in programming complicated kernel-mode drivers, in addition to extra hardware or software required for testing the kernel-mode driver. Furthermore, when upgrading an OS, incompatible or outdated kernel-mode device driver may cause a crash and prevent a successful system upgrade.","Techniques are disclosed to provide a generic USB driver. More particularly, a generic USB device driver architecture is described, which enables development through a user-mode USB library that communicates with a generic kernel-mode driver.","In a described implementation, a method includes loading a kernel-mode generic device driver in response to a plug-in event of a device. A user software component accesses the device by utilizing routines provided by a generic user-mode library (e.g., a dynamic link library (DLL)) that communicates with the generic device driver.","In another implementation, a separate generic device driver is loaded for each plugged-in device, or for each functionality supported by a device.","In some implementations, articles of manufacture are provided as computer program products. One implementation of a computer program product provides a computer program storage medium readable by a computer system and encoding a computer program.","Moreover, the computer program product encodes a computer program for a computer process executing on a computer system. The computer process loads a kernel-mode generic device driver in response to a plug-in event of a device (as may be detected by a plug and play module). A user software component accesses the device by utilizing routines provided by a generic user-mode library (e.g., a dynamic link library (DLL)).","Other implementations are also described and recited herein.","The following disclosure describes techniques to provide a generic device driver architecture. More specifically, Techniques are disclosed to provide generic USB drivers. More particularly, the architecture utilizes a user-mode USB library which accesses a generic kernel-mode driver. The architecture, in part, reduces the development time of device drivers, improves the end-user experience (e.g., by limiting system-wide crashes whether during normal operations or an upgrade process), and centralize testing and debugging. The architecture may also be utilized to improve input-output (I\/O) handling, security, and power management as will be further discussed herein. Moreover, the techniques discussed herein may be implemented as software, firmware, hardware, and\/or combinations thereof.","Overview of Generic Drivers",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","102","104","102","106","106","106","108","108","104"]},"The user-mode environment  includes a generic USB user-mode library  and a user software component . Accordingly, the user software component  is a user-mode software component in an implementation. The generic USB user-mode library  provides routines (or application programming interfaces (APIs)) which may be utilized by the USB user software component  to communicate with or control the USB device. In an implementation, the generic USB user-mode library  is a DLL. Accordingly, the USB user software component  may manage a USB device from the user-mode environment  by invoking routines in the user mode rather than the kernel mode. A number of exemplary APIs will be further discussed below under the same title.","Such an implementation is envisioned to reduce system-wide crashes because if the USB user software component  (or a routine provided by the generic USB user-mode library ) crashes, the kernel's operation remain unaffected. Additionally, such a system () reduces the development time of device drivers and centralize testing and debugging (in part, because only one computer system is needed to test the USB interface, i.e., even when a user-mode software component crashes, the system remains operational).","In one implementation, data corresponding to the communication interface between USB core stack  and the generic USB driver  is published to developers or otherwise available publicly, as well as information regarding the interface between the USB user software component  and the generic USB user-mode library . In an implementation, the information regarding the interface between the generic USB driver  and the generic USB user-mode library  need not be published","Generic Drivers for Multiple Devices",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","102","104","106","110","112"]},"The system  includes a USB bus  to communicate data (as will be further discussed with reference to  below). A USB bus is but one example and other types of data communication buses (such as a wired or wireless communication bus, e.g., Bluetooth, small computer system interface (SCSI), and the like) may be utilizes in the system .","As illustrated in , the USB bus  is coupled to the USB core stack  (as discussed with respect to ). The USB core stack  is in turn coupled to a physical device object (PDO) to facilitate communication with a USB hub . The USB hub  allows multiple USB devices to be handled in the kernel-mode environment . Accordingly, it is envisioned that the generic USB drivers () may be coupled between the kernel-mode environment  and the user-mode environment .","As illustrated in , multiple PDOs may be utilized to facilitate communication with various drivers (e.g., the generic USB driver  and a USB composite driver ). The user environment  may communicate with each generic USB driver () through functionality discovered and\/or identified by globally unique identifiers (GUID) . Each GUID  uniquely identifies its USB interface\/function. In one exemplary implementation, the format for the GUID key in the OS registry file and\/or driver file (e.g., information file (INF)), such as the Windows OS available through Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., is as follows:\n\n","Accordingly, each GUID  identifies functionality supported by the corresponding device which may be utilized by the USB user-mode software component . For example, a user-mode software component will search for any drivers that expose their GUID of interest to find the device(s) that support the desired functionality. A USB user software component  may then communicate with a USB device through the generic USB user-mode library  as discussed with reference to .","It is envisioned that multiple USB hubs () may be utilized to permit communication with multiple USB devices or functionalities incorporated within a single USB device. For example, a USB hub () may be utilized to allow access to different functionalities within a keyboard with multimedia command buttons, in addition to key stroke buttons or integrated pointing devices (e.g., joystick and or touch pad).","Generic Device Driver Operation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","302","106","306","308","108"]},"The matched generic driver (e.g.,  of ) is loaded () to facilitate communication between the loaded device driver of stage  and a user software component (e.g.,  of ). In a stage , a unique ID is registered (such as discussed with reference to  of ). Finally, the plugged-in device may be accessed () by the user software component through the generic device driver.","In an implementation, it is envisioned that the PNP module matches the extracted device ID to the generic device driver (e.g., where the generic device driver is compatible with the plugged-in device), rather than another device ID. This in turn eliminates the need for loading any additional drivers. Accordingly, in one implementation, a kernel-mode generic device driver is loaded in response to a plug-in event of a device and a user software component accesses the device by utilizing routines provided by the generic user-mode library. The generic user-mode library is communicatively coupled to the generic device driver. The routines may be implemented as APIs (which will be further discussed below under the title \u201cexemplary APIs\u201d). Furthermore, a separate generic device driver may be loaded for each plugged-in device (or functionalities supported by the device).","I\/O Handling in Generic Device Drivers",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","400","112","110","110"]},"For example, the initialization may reset the generic USB device driver's state and behavior to a default and prepare the generic USB device driver to handle further operations. The reading may read data from a specific endpoint on the corresponding device and the writing may write data to a specific endpoint on the corresponding device. The release may clean up all resources claimed during the session that was started with the initialization.","With respect to data length considerations, a USB input (i.e., data from the device to a host or computing system discussed with reference to ) endpoint can transfer anywhere from 0 bytes up to that endpoint's specified maximum packet size at a time, so the software on the host system needs to be prepared to receive up to this maximum size for each packet in the transfer (where a transfer is made up of multiple packets). If a user-mode software component (e.g.,  of ) requests a transfer that is not a multiple of this maximum packet size, then the generic USB device driver may automatically adjust the size of this transfer. Accordingly, if the user software component requests a data transfer with a length insufficient to handle all possible data transfer sizes from the device, the length of the data transfer is increased. This may be accomplished by splitting the client's (the client being the user-mode software component) buffer into at least two separate transfers (this is also referred to as \u201csegmentation\u201d). The first transfer size may be the largest multiple of maximum packet size (\u201cMaxPacket\u201d hereinafter) that is less than the client's requested transfer size. The buffer for this first transfer is the first N*MaxPacket (where this value is the size of this first sub-transfer) of the client's buffer, so no memory copy is required. The second transfer is MaxPacket bytes. The buffer for this second transfer is a newly allocated buffer in an implementation. Once both transfers are complete, the data from the second transfer is copied back into the client's buffer until either the client buffer is full, or a short packet is reached. If any data is left over from the second transfer after the copy, it may or may not be saved away for the next transfer request, based on the pipe policy for that endpoint. It is also envisioned that if there is a short packet in the first transfer, the second transfer may never be issued.","Moreover, a USB host controller, in conjunction with the USB core stack (e.g.,  of ), often may only handle transfer buffers up to a specific size. This size may be different for different host controller implementations. The generic USB device driver takes these size limits into account and if a client's transfer request exceeds this limit, the transfer is split into two or more transfers where all are less than or equal to this limit. In one implementation, there are no buffer copies required to implement this as each sub-transfer's buffer is just a part of the client's original buffer.","As illustrated in , the method  initializes in a stage , e.g., by defining a data structure utilized to access the device. The initialization stage may reset the policy settings to default values (as will be further discussed below with reference to exemplary APIs, such as WinUsb_Initialize). The initialization stage enables the generic user-mode library (e.g., the DLL associated with  of ) to run in one implementation.","The method  defines the pipe policy () which may define the behavior of the generic device driver including, for example, time outs, end of packets, auto recovery from error, packet termination guidelines, short packet handling, partial reads such as used for reading headers prior to the actual data to anticipate the amount of data that is to be transferred, discarding extra data that is of no interest, and\/or raw data handling (which indicates that a user software component is guaranteeing proper data handling), as will be further discussed below with reference to exemplary APIs, such as WinUsb_SetPipePolicy. In an implementation, each endpoint may have a pipe in a generic USB driver that is individually configurable.","Some of these exemplary pipe behavior settings are further discussed below in accordance with various implementations:\n\n","In one implementation, the user software component may then define a first-in, first-out (FIFO) buffer policy () (e.g., for a specific pipe (endpoint)) and start filing the FIFO from the device (), as will be further discussed below with reference to exemplary APIs, such as WinUsb_SetFifoPolicy and WinUSB_StartFifo. The FIFO may then be read (e.g., by calling WinUsb_ReadFifo API discussed below). In one implementation, one FIFO is provided for each pipe. It is also envisioned that data may be read by using WinUsb_ReadPipe. Accordingly, a FIFO is not required for reading data. However, a FIFO may be used for a specific class of devices which may generate data at an arbitrary time, or that constantly streams data, for example.","The pipe is then read or written to in a stage . Moreover, as detailed below, other APIs are available for handling I\/O which enable a user software component to more finely control the I\/O functions. For example, in an implementation, if the device responds with a packet that is too large for the client buffer, the data is added at the beginning of the next transfer (if this option is enabled, for example, by Allow_Partial_Reads).","Exemplary APIs","One or more exemplary APIs are illustrated below which may be utilized in the Microsoft Windows\u00ae environment to provide the routines discussed with reference to . For example, routines (e.g., in generic USB user-mode library  of ) may support the following actions (as will be further discussed below):\n\n","The exemplary APIs discussed below are prefaced by \u201cWinUSB\u201d to indicate that they correspond to a generic USB device driver for the Microsoft Windows\u00ae OS. It is envisioned that other naming conventions may be utilized. Also, a sample call, parameter, and return values for each API is highlighted below.","1.

In an implementation, the generic USB driver will automatically detect when the device needs to be powered back up, and will do so at the appropriate times.","With respect to automatically awakening the computing system, a client (such as  of ) may configure the generic USB device driver's behavior to allow the device to wake the computing system from a low-power state (e.g., standby or hibernation).
