{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to mobile communications and more particularly to a method, system and mobile device for implementing a serverless presence system.","Presence refers to a user's ability and\/or willingness to participate in communications. Presence information, referred to as presence status or presence state, provides an indication of presence. Examples of general presence information are whether a mobile communication device is on or whether the mobile communication device is in communication with a wireless network (e.g., whether the mobile communication device is in coverage area).","Traditionally, presence information is managed by a presence server. When updating presence information, each mobile communication device which shares presence information with the presence server is periodically polled by the server to obtain its current presence status. Alternatively, changes in presence states may be pushed from the mobile communication devices to the presence server. Changes in presence status are then sent to each device in a group of mobile communication devices which share presence information (e.g., as determined by the respective device users). However, a presence server requires its own hardware, infrastructure, overhead and administration adding to the total cost of ownership. There are also privacy concerns with presence servers in regards to how access to presence information is controlled. Thus, there remains a need for improved presence systems.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","The present disclosure provides a method and system in which mobile communication devices within a predefined group to manage and share presence information among themselves without a dedicated presence server (sometimes referred to as peer-to-peer presence), as well as mobile communication devices which are configured to manage and share presence without a dedicated presence server.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of sharing presence information between a group of mobile communication devices configured to communicate over a wireless network, the mobile communication devices defining the group members of the group, the method comprising: sending a data packet from a sending group member to at least one of the other group members; determining a presence status in accordance with whether a delivery acknowledgement is received by the sending group member from each of the other group members to which the data packet was sent within a predetermined duration from the sending of the data packet; storing the determined presence status in memory; and sending a presence update comprising the determined presence status of at least some of the group members to all of the group members","In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a mobile communication device, comprising: a controller for controlling the operation of the device; a communication subsystem connected to the controller configured for at least data communication with a wireless network; the controller being configured for sending a data packet from a sending group member to at least one of the other group members, determining a presence status in accordance with whether a delivery acknowledgement is received by the sending group member from each of the other group members to which the data packet was sent within a predetermined duration from the sending of the data packet, storing the determined presence status in memory, and sending a presence update comprising the determined presence status of at least some of the group members to all of the group members.","In accordance with yet further embodiments, there are provided computer readable mediums having stored thereon executable instructions (e.g., program code) for controlling the above-mentioned mobile communication devices, the executable instructions causing the communication devices to perform the methods described herein.","Reference is first made to  which shows in block diagram form a communication system  in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system  comprises a number of mobile communication devices (mobile devices)  which may be connected to the remainder of system  in any of several different ways. Accordingly, several instances of mobile communication devices  are depicted in  employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices  are connected to a wireless communication network  which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)  and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)  or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments, the mobile communication devices  are configured to communicate over both the WWAN  and WLAN , and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments, the wireless network  may comprise multiple WWANs  and WLANs .","The WWAN  may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example, but not limitation, the WWAN  may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations  (one of which is shown in ) where each of the base stations  provides wireless Radio Frequency (RF) coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN  is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments, the WWAN  conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types: Mobitex Radio Network, DataTAC, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network), EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized) CDMA2000, EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems), HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX), or various other networks. Although WWAN  is described as a \u201cWide-Area\u201d network, that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.","The WWAN  may further comprise a wireless network gateway  which connects the mobile communication devices  to transport facilities , and through the transport facilities  to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines, the public internet, a virtual private network, or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system  may be operated, for example, by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation, university, or governmental department, which allows access to a network  such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources, or the wireless connector system  may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments, the network  may be realised using the internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.","The wireless network gateway  provides an interface between the wireless connector system  and the WWAN , which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices  and other devices (not shown) connected, directly or indirectly, to the WWAN . Accordingly, communications sent via the mobile communication devices  are transported via the WWAN  and the wireless network gateway  through transport facilities  to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system  are received by the wireless network gateway  and transported via the WWAN  to the mobile communication devices .","The WLAN  comprises a wireless network which, in some embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN  in other embodiments such as, for example, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX\u201d), or IEEE 802.20 (also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access). The WLAN  includes one or more wireless RF Access Points (AP)  (one of which is shown in ) that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.","The WLAN  may be a personal network of the user, an enterprise network, or a hotspot offered by an internet service provider (ISP), a mobile network provider, or a property owner in a public or semi-public area, for example. The access points  are connected to an access point (AP) inter-face  which may connect to the wireless connector system  directly (for example, if the access point  is part of an enterprise WLAN  in which the wireless connector system  resides), or indirectly via the transport facilities  if the access point  is a personal Wi-Fi network or Wi-Fi hotspot (in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system , such as a virtual private network (VPN), may be required). The AP interface  provides translation and routing services between the access points  and the wireless connector system  to facilitate communication, directly or indirectly, with the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  may be implemented as one or more servers, and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system  manages communications, including email messages, to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system  also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices  which may connect to the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  allows the mobile communication devices  to access the network  and connected resources and services such as a messaging server  (for example, a Microsoft Exchange\u2122, IBM Lotus Domino\u2122, or Novell GroupWise\u2122 email messaging server) and optionally other servers . The other servers  may comprise a content server for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization's internal servers to the mobile communication devices  in the wireless network , and an application server for implementing server-based applications such as instant messaging (IM) applications.","The wireless connector system  typically provides a secure exchange of data (e.g., email messages, personal information manager (PIM) data, and IM data) with the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments, communications between the wireless connector system  and the mobile communication devices  are encrypted. In some embodiments, communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure, two-way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.","The wireless network gateway  is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile device  over the WWAN  to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system  then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server , content server  or application servers . Conversely, the wireless connector system  sends data packets received, for example, from the messaging server , content server  or application servers  to the Wireless network gateway  which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile device . The AP interfaces  of the WLAN  provide similar sending functions between the mobile device , the wireless connector system  and network connection point such as the messaging server , content server  and application server .","The network  may comprise a private local area network, metropolitan area network, wide area network, the public internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these, alone, or in combination.","A mobile device  may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system  using a computer , such as desktop or notebook computer, via the network . A link  may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile device  and computer  connected to the wireless connector system . The link  may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short-range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection, Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, Firewire\u2122 (also known as an IEEE 1394 interface) connection, or other serial data connection, via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile device  and computer . The short-range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network (PAN) interface. A personal area network is a wireless point-to-point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points. The short-range wireless communication interface may comprise one or a combination of an infrared (IR) connection such as an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) connection, a short-range radio frequency (RF) connection such as one specified by IEEE 802.15.1 or the Bluetooth\u2122 special interest group, or IEEE 802.15.3a, also referred to as UltraWideband (UWB), or other PAN connection.","It will be appreciated that the above-described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only, and that the above-described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","Reference is now made to  which illustrates a mobile device  in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile device  is a two-way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device , in various embodiments the device  may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system with a wireless modem.","The mobile device  includes a rigid case (not shown) housing the components of the device . The internal components of the device  are constructed on a printed circuit board (PCB). The mobile device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem  for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network  to perform communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen  such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, input devices  such as a keyboard and control buttons, flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, speaker , microphone , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The device  may comprise a touchscreen display in some embodiments. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the mobile device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which mobile device  is intended to operate.","The mobile device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations  of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  comprise operating system software , software applications  comprising a group application manager , group applications (or applets) , a group application database , and a presence module . The group application manager , group applications , group application database  and presence module  are typically implemented together as part of a stand-alone software application, but could be implemented as a part of the operating system  or other application  or as separate applications. In some example embodiments, the functions performed by each of the modules , ,  and  may each be realized as a plurality of independent elements, and any one or more of these elements may be implemented as parts of other software applications . The group application database  could be stored with the other data  in other embodiments.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","The software applications  may include a range of applications, including, for example, an email messaging application, address book, calendar application, notepad application, Internet browser application, voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, mapping application, or a media player application, or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display screen ) according to the application.","In some embodiments, the auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS (Global Positioning System) subsystem comprising a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise a pointing or navigational tool (input device) such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel, or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device  such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some embodiments, the mobile device  also includes a removable memory card  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory card interface . Network access typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device  via the memory card , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the mobile device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The mobile device  also stores other data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments, the data  includes service data comprising information required by the mobile device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the mobile device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.","The serial data port  may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (not shown). The serial data port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile device  by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile device  other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","In some embodiments, the mobile device  is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth\u00ae (Bluetooth\u00ae is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile device  to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network  is automatically routed to the mobile device  using the USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network  is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth\u00ae connection to the host computer system for processing.","The mobile device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .","The mobile device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the mobile device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., the voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display screen  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","Referring now to , an example user interface screen for displaying presence status will be described.  illustrates an example main user interface screen  of the group application manager . The main screen  includes a status bar  having a group icon and group name of an associated group. The status bar  also includes a notification area  in which new data notification icons and a wireless coverage indicator icon are displayed. The main screen  also includes an application bar  in which icons for switching to a respective group application  are displayed. Activation of a respective icon in the application bar  causes the respective group application  to become the active group application. The application bar  includes icons for the group applications  which, in the shown embodiment, comprise a location application, list application, conversation application (e.g., chat application), photo application, calendar application, and contact application (shown left to right in ).","The main screen  also includes a user status field . The user status field  is a text entry field  into which the user may enter information to be shared with other group members similar to a status update used in social networking applications. The information which may be entered into the text entry field  is limited in length so as to be relatively short, and in some embodiments is limited to text having a length of up to 140 characters. The information entered in the text entry field  is shared with the other members of the group. Group applications  managed by the group application manager  may contribute further information to the user status field  such as the user's current location which may be contributed by the location application. In the shown embodiment, a location icon  is provided adjacent to the user status field . Activating the location icon  by corresponding input causes the location application to be invoked and a corresponding user interface screen to be displayed on the display screen . The location application displays the device user's location and the location of other group members on a map displayed on the user interface screen. The location application also allows locations on the map to be named. When the device user or group member arrives at or near a named location as determined using GPS or triangulation via base station locations, the location application updates the device user or group member's status to reflect the current location, by appending \u201c@<location>\u201d to the device user or group member's status. In other embodiments, location may be defined by the device user, possibly via the text entry field . In the shown embodiment, the device user's name and location information are provided in the user status field . In the example user interface screen shown in , the user name \u201cSteve\u201d and the status location \u201c@ Home\u201d are displayed. In other embodiments, no location information is provided.","The main screen  also includes a list  of all members of the group with each member having a respective status area (or field) in the list . For each member in the group, a group member name (e.g., of the respective device user), presence status and optionally location information are provided. Location information about group members, when provided, may be determined as described above. In the shown example, there are two group members \u201cVesper\u201d and \u201cHeather\u201d in the list . Vesper has a location of \u201c@ School\u201d whereas Heather has a location of \u201c@ Work\u201d. In addition, the presence of each group member is indicated by the background colour of the respective group member's status area. In the shown embodiment, a grey status area indicates that the respective group member is not available (or offline), whereas a white status area indicates that the respective user is available (or online). In the shown example, \u201cVesper\u201d is available (online) whereas Heather is not available (offline). The indicated (e.g., displayed) presence status is based on stored values maintained by the presence module  as described above.","The indication of presence status is not intended to be limited to any colour scheme of the group member status area, and different colour schemes may be used to indicate presence status in other embodiments. Moreover, the colour of the text within the respective group member status area may be changed in addition to, or instead of, the background colour using a suitable colour scheme.","In yet other embodiments, presence status could be indicated by other means such as a corresponding icon, text label or both, in addition to, or instead of, changing the colour of the group member status area. For example, in some embodiments an antenna icon with a red X through it, or beside it, is displayed in the group member's status area when the respective group member is not available. A different icon could be used in different embodiments. In contrast, no icon is displayed in the group member's status area when the respective group member is available. This scheme uses \u201cavailable\u201d as a default presence status as this tends to be the normal circumstance. Thus, a notification icon is only displayed when a group member is not available. This reduces onscreen notifications and avoids cluttering the user interface screen. A notification icon may be used in addition to, or instead of, changing the colour of the group member status area.","In other embodiments, a first icon may be used when a group member is available and a second icon which is different than the first icon may be used when the group member is unavailable. The first and second icons may have a different pictorial representation, colour, or both. In some embodiments, the first icon may be green to indicate a group member is available and the second icon may be red to indicate that a group member is unavailable.","A user's own presence status is typically indicated in the notification area  by the wireless coverage indicator icon. In some embodiments, when the user is available (e.g. in a wireless coverage area) the wireless coverage indicator icon is an antenna icon displayed in the notification area . When the user is not available (e.g., out of a wireless coverage area) the wireless coverage indicator icon is an antenna icon with an X (possibly a red X) is displayed in the notification area . However, it is possible that a user's presence status could be displayed in the user status field  in addition to, or instead of, the notification area  in a manner similar to the group member presence status. In such cases, the source of the user's presence status displayed in the user status field  would likely be based on whether the mobile device  is in communication with the wireless network  as determined by the wireless communication subsystem  rather than the operations  described below, or possibly a user defined presence status.","While group member presence status has been described in the context of an example main screen , it will be appreciated that other screen layouts for the main screen  are possible and that presence status may be shown in different ways in different user interface screens. Moreover, it will be appreciated that presence status may be provided in other user interface screens of the group application manager  such as, for example, in the user interface screen of a group application  such as the conversation application or location application. Any group application  which provides a group member status area may be configured to provide an indication of the respective group member's presence status, for example by changing the colour of the background of the respective field, changing the colour of the text, changing a representative icon, or any combination thereof, to correspond to the current presence status of the respective group member. Group applications  may also choose to use textual representations of a group member's presence status. For example, in a conversation application, a change in a group member's presence status may result in the addition of a message inline with the existing conversation messages that conveys information about the group member's new presence status (saying, for example, \u201cVesper is now online\u201d).","Referring to , one embodiment of a method of sending presence updates within a predefined group of mobile communication devices in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. The method is implemented by operations  which are performed by the processor  of the mobile device  under the instruction of the presence module  and\/or group application manager . The illustrated operations  are for one mobile device in the group (the sending group member) which sends a presence update. The responses which occur on other mobile devices  in the group (the other group members) will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art and are described below.","The presence module  manages presence status and provides the group application manager  with access to the presence status of group members, for example, for use in group applications which are part of, or connected to, the group application manager . In some embodiments, the presence module  may be part of the group application manager . The presence module  maintains, for each predefined group, a list  of the group members of each respective group along with the presence status of the respective group members (typically excluding the device user's own presences status). Each group member is identified in the list  by a respective user name. In some embodiments, each group member is identified by a respective user name (e.g., Heather or Vesper) and one or both of a personal identification number (PIN) (which is typically not displayed) and a digital image (e.g., thumbnail or avatar). The PIN may be a globally unique number that identifies the mobile device  to the device manufacturer and\/or between device manufacturers. The PIN could alternatively be any other data which allows for the unique identification of a device or the device's user, such as an permanent or relatively permanent IP Address (for example, in accordance with Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) as described in RFC 791 and\/or Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) as described in RFC 2460) or an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) for example. The presence status stored by the presence module  could also be shared with the operating system  and\/or other applications  on the mobile devices  in some embodiments, for example for providing an indication of presence status in other applications  or user interface screens of the mobile devices , or in (re)directing communications to the mobile devices .","In some embodiments, the operations  may be performed in the background even when the group application manager  is not the active application . In such cases, the user interface of the devices  is only updated when the main user interface screen  or other user interface screen providing an indication of presence status of the group members is displayed on the display screen .","The group application manager  manages groups and group membership among other functions. Each group has a number of group members. The basis for forming such groups is known in the art and will not be described in detail herein. However, it will be noted that in at least some embodiments more than one group may be defined and a given mobile device  may be a group member in more than one group. For example, a predefined group may be a group of mobile devices  belonging to users in the same family. The present disclosure primarily describe group members in terms of mobile devices , however, groups could be defined in terms of device users. Thus, the term group member can be applied equally to mobile devices  and the respective device users associated with such mobile devices .","The method utilizes delivery acknowledgements (also known as delivery receipts) as a basis for presence status. Delivery acknowledgements are device level messages (rather than messages meant for display) sent by the wireless connector system  () of the wireless network  () for each mobile device recipient for which a data packet such as an electronic message (e.g., electronic mail (email) message or peer-to-peer message) was successfully delivered. The delivery acknowledgements are typically sent by the wireless connector system  in response to an acknowledgement from the receiving mobile device . For example, if an email message is sent to three recipients A, B, and C, a corresponding delivery acknowledgement is sent by the wireless connector system  to the sender of the email message when it has been delivered to each of A, B and C (i.e., 3 delivery acknowledgements are sent, one for each A, B and C). In other embodiments, the delivery acknowledgements could be sent by a component of the wireless network  different than the wireless connector system ","Delivery acknowledgements may also be sent to the sending mobile device  by receiving mobile devices  in response to receipt of a peer-to-peer data packets such as a peer-to-peer message (also referred to as a device-to-device message or PIN message) from the sending mobile device  rather than the wireless connector system . The delivery acknowledgements sent by receiving mobile devices  may differ in form and\/or content from those sent by the wireless connector system ; however, the differences do not affect the operations  and will not be described herein.","Delivery acknowledgements typically occur and are processed at the transport layer of the device communication protocol stack and are not displayed on the display screen . However, delivery acknowledgements could occur at a different layer in the device communication protocol stack in other embodiments. When a delivery acknowledgement is received for a recipient within a predetermined duration, this indicates that the mobile device  is in communication with the wireless network . The predetermined duration could be, for example 5 or 10 seconds, but may be any defined time period.","When data packets are not delivered because the mobile device  to which the data packets were to be delivered was out of communication with the wireless network  (e.g., out of a wireless coverage area, powered off, or otherwise unable to receive the data packets), the data packets are queued for delivery by the wireless connector system , typically but not necessarily in the order received, and as a result no delivery acknowledgements are sent to the senders of the queued data packets. When the mobile device  re-establishes communications with the wireless network  (e.g., returns to a wireless coverage area, is powered on, etc.), the queued data packets are then delivered to the mobile device  by the wireless connector system , and once the mobile device  has received them, the corresponding delivery acknowledgements are sent to the senders of the queued data packets.","In the first step , a data packet is sent from the mobile device  of one member of the group (the sending mobile device) to one or more group members of the group (the other group members). The sender could be any member of the group. In some embodiments, the data packet is sent from one of the group applications  managed by the group application manager  such as the location application, list application, conversation application, photo application, calendar application, or contact application shown in the application bar  of the example main user interface screen  of the group application manager  shown in .","In at least some embodiments, whenever a local change is made by a group application  that change is made to the group application database . The change could be any change in respect of a group application , such as a new message in a conversation, a new or changed calendar item, a new or changed list, a change in mobile device location, or the addition of a new photo. In response to a local change in the group application database , corresponding changes are required in the group application database  of the corresponding group member with which the information is shared.","Depending on the group application  and the particular change which occurred, the change may relate to information shared with all group members or only select group members. For example, some information may be \u201cprivate\u201d and shared between only selected members of the group (e.g., parents when the group defines a family) while other information may be \u201cpublic\u201d and shared with all members of the group (e.g., all members of the family). Shared content in the group application database  is synchronized between group members so that each group member has an up-to-date version of the shared content. This creates a mirrored copy of the shared content of the group application database  in the memory  of each group member with whom that data is shared. To implement private and public data (i.e., selectively shared content), multiple group application databases  may be used, for example one public database for public information and one private database for each group member for private information shared between the device user and that group member. The structure of the group application database  is not relevant to the present disclosure and so will not be described in detail herein.","In response to a change in the group application database , the group application manager  or the associated group application  causes a content update data packet be sent to the group members with whom the changed data is shared. The content update data packet comprises the content which requires updating. The content update data packet is recognized by receiving mobile devices  via the group application manager , the associated group application , or both, typically by header information and possibly the format or other aspects of the content update data packet. On receiving and processing the content update data packet, recipient mobile devices  update a respective local group application database  in accordance with the new or changed content of the content update data packet. Alternatively, the content update data packet could include explicit instructions to update the content of the local group application database  on recipient mobile devices  in addition to the content to be updated.","The content update data packet is typically sent at the transport layer. In response to receiving a content update data packet, the group application manager  or the associated group application  of the receiving mobile device  makes a corresponding change in its group application database . A corresponding notification or other user interface change may then be displayed on the receiving mobile device  in the main user interface screen  of the group application manager , the user interface screen of the associated group application , or possibly another user interface screens displayed on the mobile device .","In other embodiments, the data packet may be sent from an application  (e.g., email messaging application) on the sending mobile device  which is not a group application  managed by the group application manager . The data packet could be any electronic message sent from a corresponding messaging application on the sending mobile device to the one or more group members of the group via the wireless network  including, but not limited to, an email message, Short Messages Service (SMS) text message, Multimedia Message Service (MMS) message, chat message, IM message, or peer-to-peer message.","In yet other embodiments, the data packet may be a ping sent from the sending mobile device  to the other members in the group. The ping is sent from one mobile device  to the other members in the group at a predetermined time interval. In some embodiments, the predetermined time interval could be every 15 minutes. The responsibility for sending the ping is shared between group members using a predetermined scheduling algorithm. In some embodiments, responsibility for sending the ping is equally shared between group members using a round-robin scheduling algorithm. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, in round-robin scheduling each mobile device  in the group takes an equal turn in sending the ping to other members of the group. Other scheduling algorithms could be used in other embodiments. For example, the active group member may change at predetermined intervals (e.g., 15 minutes) in a predetermined order which could be based on the numerical order of the PIN of the group members.","For purposes of illustration, consider four mobile devices  in a group (e.g., mobile devices  belonging to four family members) using a round-robin scheduling algorithm. At a first 15 minute internal, the first mobile device  (the active group member) sends the ping. At the second 15 minute interval, the second mobile device  sends the ping. At the third 15 minute interval, the third mobile device  sends the ping. At the fourth 15 minute interval, the fourth third mobile device  sends the ping. In this example, compared to known solutions in which each mobile device  is responsible for polling other mobile devices  in a group and maintaining its own presence information, the number of data packets which are sent is reduced by \u00be. In some embodiments, the ping may be sent to all of the other group members regardless of the data packets which may have been received by the other group members. In other embodiments, the ping is only sent to group members for whom the active group member has not received a data packet within the predetermined time interval for sending pings. This allows the number of pings sent to be reduced, reducing the number of data packets even further. In some embodiments, the last time that a data packet was received may be maintained by each group member and used to determine whether to send a ping to the respective group member. The time may be stored by the presence module  in association with presence status in memory .","The predetermined scheduling algorithm is stored and used by each mobile device  in the group so that the \u201cactive\u201d group member responsible for sending the ping can be determined independently by each group member. The predetermined scheduling algorithm may select group members based on the PIN of the mobile devices  or other unique identifier.","The ping may be sent from one mobile device  to the other members in the group at the predetermined time interval in accordance with the predetermined scheduling algorithm regardless of the activity of group members, or the ping may only be sent when there is no other activity between the group members. To implement the later option, the ping may be sent by the active group member when it has not received any data packet or a predetermined type of data packet from all of the other group members within the predetermined time interval. In such embodiments, the predetermined time interval functions as a duration of a countdown timer for the sending of ping messages. In some embodiments, when the active group member receives a predetermined type of data packet from each of the group members, this could re-set the countdown timer for the sending of ping messages. The re-setting of the countdown timer could be independent of the selection of the active group member, or could trigger a change in the active group member. In other embodiments, no ping messages are sent and the operations rely executively on other activity between the group members. Thus, pings may be sent (i) irrespective of other activity between group members, (ii) only if there is no other activity between group members, or (iii) not at all, depending on the embodiment. Whether pings are used and the manner in which pings are used, if at all, could be configurable via a device setting in some embodiments.","The ping may include the PIN of the sending device and possibly location information describing the location of the mobile device , for example, based on one or both of triangulated location based on nearby base station location information determined by a wireless communication subsystem  of the mobile device  or provided by the wireless network , or GPS location information from a GPS subsystem of the mobile device , depending on the embodiment and the device components. The location in the ping could be provided instead of, or in addition to, the location provided by the location application as described above.","The active group member responsible for sending the ping can be determined independently by each group member using the predetermined scheduling algorithm and the identification of the last mobile device  (e.g., by PIN) in the group to send the ping. Each mobile device  in the group awaits the ping from the group member responsible for sending the next ping. If a ping is not received within a first predetermined duration of the scheduled time (e.g., based on the predetermined time interval and the time the last ping was sent or received), the next group member in accordance with the predetermined scheduling algorithm becomes the active group member and sends the ping. The first predetermined duration could be a fixed duration which may be few seconds up to a few minutes. In some embodiments, the predetermined duration could be 30 seconds. In other embodiments, the predetermined duration may be expressed as a percentage of the scheduled time. In some embodiments, the predetermined duration could be 10% of the scheduled time. For example, if the ping is \u201coverdue\u201d by a length of time equal to 10% of the scheduled time, then the next group member sends the ping.","If the next group member is out of communication with the wireless network , the ping will not be sent or received by the other group members. Accordingly, if the ping is not received within a second predetermined duration of the scheduled time, the next group member in accordance with the predetermined scheduling algorithm becomes the active group member and sends the ping. The second predetermined duration is longer than the first predetermined duration, and could be a few seconds up to a few minutes. The second predetermined duration could be twice the first predetermined duration, e.g. 60 seconds or 20% of the scheduled time. The selection process for the active group member can be repeated for each group member until a ping is received, i.e., when a group member in communication with the wireless network  becomes the active group member. Thus, the npredetermined duration for the ngroup member selected in accordance with the predetermined scheduling algorithm could be n times the first predetermined duration, e.g. n times the fixed duration or n times the percentage of the scheduled time. This implementation scales relatively well in that the group member at position n in the predetermined scheduling algorithm knows when to take over if the ping from the previous group member in the predetermined scheduling algorithm is overdue by n times the first predetermined duration. When all group members are out of communication with the wireless network  at the same time, the selection process may loop through the predetermined scheduling algorithm until one of the group members re-establishes communication with the wireless network , becomes the active group member and successfully sends the ping.","Next, in step  the sending device  determines whether a delivery acknowledgement has been received for each group member to which the data packet was sent. The delivery acknowledgement may vary in form, content, or both, depending on the type of data packet which was sent in step . The delivery acknowledgement may be received in respect of a data packet sent from a group application , an application , or a ping message. If a delivery acknowledgement is not received by the sending mobile device  for each group member to which the data packet was sent within a predetermined duration, the group members for whom a delivery acknowledgement was not received are determined to be unavailable (e.g., out of communication with the wireless network ). The predetermined duration could be a few seconds up to a few minutes. In some embodiments, the predetermined duration could be 30 seconds. Operations then proceed to step  in which the presence status stored in the memory (e.g., the flash memory , or possibly the RAM ) of the sending mobile device  is updated and set to unavailable for each group member to whom the data packet was sent and for whom a delivery acknowledgement was not received.","If a delivery acknowledgement is received by the sending mobile device  for each group member to which the data packet was sent within the predetermined duration (step ), the respective group members are determined to be available (e.g., in communication with the wireless network ). Operations then proceed to step  in which the presence status stored in the memory  of the sending mobile device  is updated and set to available for each group member to whom the data packet was sent and for whom a delivery acknowledgement was received. Depending on the embodiment, if the delivery acknowledgement of one or more group members includes location information, the location of the respective group members may be stored in memory , for example in association with the presence status maintained by the presence module .","Next, in step  in response to one or more of the group members being unavailable, and after updating the presence status, the sending mobile device  sends a presence update to all of the other members of the group. The presence update is typically a data packet which is recognized by receiving mobile devices  via the group application manager , the associated group application , or both, typically by header information and possibly the format or other aspects of the presence update data packet. On receiving and processing the presence update data packet, recipient mobile devices  update the presence status stored in respective local presence modules  in accordance with the presence status of the presence update data packet. Alternatively, the presence update data packet could include explicit instructions to update the presences status of the local presence module  on recipient mobile devices  in addition to the presence status to be updated.","In some embodiments, the presence update data packet indicates which group members are not available in accordance with the presence status stored in the presence module  of the sending mobile device . In these embodiments, the implicit understanding of the group members (i.e., recipient mobile devices ) is that other group members are available if a presence status was not specific in the presence update data packet. This reduces the amount of data which needs to be transmitted in order to maintain presence status. In other embodiments, the presence update data packet could include the presence status only group members who are currently available rather than unavailable.","In yet other embodiments, the presence update data packet could include the presence status for all group members stored in the presence module  on the sending mobile device  as indicated by the dashed line, rather than only including the presence status for those group members who are currently unavailable. This provides explicit presence status for all group members at the expense of an increase in the amount of data which needs to be transmitted in order to maintain presence status.","In yet other embodiments, regardless of whether presence status is explicitly provided in the presence update data packet as available, unavailable, or both available or unavailable, group members whose presence status is not known will not be included in the presence update data packet. In these embodiments, a receiving group member will not update the presence status for any group member unless it is explicitly provided in the presence update data packet.","The presence update data packet is typically a data packet sent at the transport layer of the device communication protocol stack. However, presence update data packet could occur at a different layer in the device communication protocol stack in other embodiments. The presence update data packet, when received by the other members of the group, causes the presence status to be updated in the local memory of recipient mobile devices  to match the updated presence status in presence update data packet.","In other embodiments, the presence update data packet is sent even when all group members are available rather than only when one or more of the group members are unavailable. This provides explicit presence status at regular intervals at the expense of an increase in the amount of data which needs to be transmitted in order to maintain presence status.","In yet another embodiment, the presence update packet is not sent when all group members are determined to be available, or their presence status is unchanged. This allows recipient mobile devices  to infer a presence status for each member of the group with reduced data transmission.","Next, in step  the indication of presence status displayed on the display screen  of the mobile devices  of the sender and other group members is updated to reflect the updated presence status. In some embodiments, step  comprises (re)displaying a user interface screen on the display screen  of the sending group member to provide an indication of the presence status of the group members within the respective group member status areas in accordance with the stored presence status. The (re)displaying could be in response to corresponding input on the sending group member. The presence status may be indicated by a background colour of the group member status area, a text colour of the group member status area, a presence status icon displayed in the group member status area, or any combination thereof.","Typically, step  involves (re)displaying\/updating the main user interface screen  of the group application manager . However, the presence status could also be updated in other user interface screens of the mobile devices  which provide an indication of presence status of the group members. If the main user interface screen  or other user interface screen providing an indication of presence status is not displayed on the display screen  when the presence update data packet is received, then the updated presence status will be displayed when the corresponding user interface screen is next displayed. The user interface could alternatively be updated after updating the presence status in step  and before step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"],"b":["600","400","410","412","201","602","404","201","604","244","201"]},"In most cases, delivery acknowledgements will not be received from group members whose updated presence status from steps  indicates they are not available when the data packet in step  was sent to all group members (whether a ping or other data packet). However, if the data packet in step  was not sent to all group members, then a delivery acknowledgement may not be received from other members in the group to which the initial data packet in step  was not sent. It is also possible that the presence status of one or more group members has changed since it was determined in step , but this is likely seldom to occur given the short time in which the operations  occur.","If a delivery acknowledgement is received by the sending mobile device  for all group members within the predetermined duration, the group members for whom a delivery acknowledgement was received are determined to be available. Operations then proceed to step  in which the presence status stored in the memory of the sending mobile device  is updated and set to available for each group member to whom the data packet was sent and for whom a delivery acknowledgement was received.","Next, in step  the sending mobile device  determines whether the presence status of one or more group members has changed since it was determined in step . Alternatively, this determination can be made before updating presence status in steps  and . A further presence update data packet is sent when the presence status of one or more group members has changed (step ). The further presence update data packet may have the same format and may be sent in the same manner as the presence update data packet in step  described above.","Next, in step  the indication of presence status displayed on the display screen  of the mobile devices  of the sender and other group members is updated to reflect the updated presence status. When the presence status of one or more group members has not changed since it was determined in step , no further presence update data packet is sent.","The operations  are optional and are not performed in all embodiments. In some embodiments, delivery acknowledgements for presence update data packet are not checked to reduce or eliminate looping operations when sharing and managing presence between group members in a peer-to-peer serverless presence system. This is sometimes referred to as a \u201cfire and forget it\u201d methodology.","Referring now to , one embodiment of a method of updating presence within a predefined group of mobile communication devices when a previously unavailable group member becomes available will now be described. The method is implemented by operations  which are performed by the processor  of the mobile device  under the instruction of the presence module  and\/or group application manager .","In the first step , a group member who was previously unavailable becomes available. This occurs when the group member re-establishes communications with the wireless network  in response to returning to a wireless coverage area, powering on of the respective mobile device , re-activating the wireless communication subsystem , etc.","Next, in step  the group member receives a previous presence update data packet from one of the other group members which indicates that that group member is unavailable. As noted above, data packets which are not delivered when the group member was out of communication with the wireless network  will have been queued for delivery from by the wireless connector system  and will be delivered to the group member by the wireless connector system  when the group member becomes available. The queued data packets include presence update data packets sent in the operations .","Next, in step  the presence status stored in the memory (e.g., the flash memory ) of the mobile device  is updated in accordance with the previous presence update data packet received in step . When \u201cavailable\u201d is used as default presence status, this comprises updating the presence status for each group members listed in the presence update data packet to unavailable. Updating using other configurations of presence status will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art upon review of the foregoing discussion.","Next, in step  the group member sends a presence update data packet to all of the other group members to update them that the group member is now available. It will be appreciated that, in at least this embodiment, it is the responsibility of previously unavailable group members to update the other group members as to their presence status when they become available. The presence update data packet sent in step , in some embodiments, includes the explicit presence status of \u201cavailable\u201d for the previously unavailable group member while not including the presence status of other group members because the presence status stored by the previously unavailable group member is out of date.","In other embodiments, the presence update data packet sent in step  includes the presence status of other group members. This is because, on returning to wireless coverage, the previously unavailable group member may receive presence updates from other group members. Thus, if the presence update data packet is sent after receiving and processing all queued data packets, then the presence status stored by the previously unavailable group member may be up to date.","In the above described embodiments, receiving group members will not update the presence status for any group member unless it is explicitly provided in the presence update data packet. The presence update data packet sent in step  typically only includes the explicit presence status of \u201cavailable\u201d for the previously unavailable group member, in which case, receiving group members will only update the presence status of the previously unavailable group member to available. This, presence status will not be update for other group members at this time. Delivery acknowledgements for presence update data packets sent in step  are typically not checked to reduce or eliminate looping operations (i.e., the data packets sent in step  are typically \u201cfire and forget it\u201d data packets).","The presence update data packet is recognized by receiving mobile devices  via the group application manager , the associated group application , or both, typically by header information and possibly the format or other aspects of the presence update data packet. On receiving and processing the presence update data packet, recipient mobile devices  updates the presence status stored in the local presence module  in accordance with the presence status of the presence update data packet. Alternatively, the presence update data packet could include explicit instructions to update the presences status of the local presence module  on recipient mobile devices  in addition to the presence status to be updated.","The presence update data packet is typically a data packet sent at the transport layer of the device communication protocol stack. However, presence update data packet could occur at a different layer in the device communication protocol stack in other embodiments. The presence update data packet, when received by the other members of the group, causes the presence status to be updated in the local memory of recipient mobile devices  to match the updated presence status in presence update data packet.","Next, in step  the indication of presence status displayed on the display screen  of the mobile devices  of the sender and other group members is updated to reflect the updated presence status. Typically this involves updating the main user interface screen , however, the presence status could also be updated in other user interface screens of the mobile devices  which provide an indication of presence status of the group members. If the main user interface screen  or other user interface screen providing an indication of presence status is not displayed on the display screen  when the presence update data packet is received, then the updated presence status will be displayed when the corresponding user interface screen is next displayed. The user interface could alternatively be updated after updating the presence status in step  and before step .","When a number of presence update data packets are queued by the wireless connector system , the operations  are typically repeated for each presence update data packet.","While the operations ,  and  have been described as occurring in a particular order, it will be appreciated to persons skilled in the art that some of the steps may be performed in a different order provided that the result of the changed order of any given step will not prevent or impair the occurrence of subsequent steps. Furthermore, some of the steps described above may be combined in other embodiments, and some of the steps described above may be separated into a number of sub-steps in other embodiments. It also should be noted that receiving the presence update data packets sent in any one or more of steps, , , , and possibly its contents of such data packets, may be used in evaluating whether to send a ping message in accordance with the operations . That is, receiving presence update data packets sent from other group members may be considered \u201cother activity\u201d which re-sets the countdown timer for the sending of ping messages.","Furthermore, while presence status has been described as being \u201cavailable\u201d or \u201cunavailable\u201d, other binary presence status indicators could be used. Other suitable presence status indicators include \u201conline\u201d or \u201coffline\u201d, \u201cpresent\u201d or \u201cnot present\u201d, \u201cable to communicate\u201d or \u201cunable to communicate\u201d, and \u201cin coverage\u201d or \u201cout of coverage\u201d. Presence status indicators need not be limited to text and may include a wide variety of data including creative statuses, such as a colour or an image, and user defined presence status which may be text-based or a visual representation. These presence status indicators are provided for purposes of illustration and are not intending to be limiting.","Compared to devices having wired or short-range wireless communication links (e.g., Wi-Fi\u2122), mobile communication devices having long-range wireless communication links may lose communication with the communications infrastructure more frequently, i.e. lose coverage of the wireless network . Accordingly, the loss of communication with the wireless network  can provide a useful basis for presence status. The present disclosure uses delivery acknowledgements, an existing feature of the communications infrastructure of at least some wireless networks, to provide a basis for presence status without requiring any additional hardware or software on the wireless connector system  or other component of the wireless network .","The present disclosure provides a solution to sharing presence among members of a predefined group using communications sent to group members in the ordinary course, pings sent to group members, or both as the basis for presence status. This can be contrasted to known solutions in which each mobile device in the group polls other group members periodically and receives acknowledgments concerning the presence status of other group members. In contrast to known solutions, the solution taught by the present disclosure shares the processing burden among group members. While this solution requires software on the mobile devices  of each group, it does not require any hardware or software changes to the wireless connector system  or other component of the wireless network . The solution of the present disclosure is peer-to-peer and attempts to balance privacy concerns, administration costs, and the number of packets which are sent (i.e., reducing bandwidth consumption). Presence status data and other data shared by group members is not stored on a server or other component of the wireless network , except temporally during transmission of the data. Instead, presence status data and other data shared by group members is stored by the group members in the presence modules  and\/or group application database . This solution may also improve the battery life of mobile devices  and decrease cost of sharing presence compared with known solutions by reducing the number of packets sent by each group member and any associated user data charges.","Moreover, the use of pings sent to all members of the group may obviate the need for pings to be sent from the wireless connector system  to mobile devices  in some embodiments. For example, GSM-based wireless networks  typically send pings to mobile devices  at predetermined time intervals in order to update the IP (internet protocol) address associated with the mobile devices  when there has been no communication with, or data exchanged with, the devices  during that interval. The predetermined time interval is typically measured from the last time a message was successfully sent and\/or received by a device .","As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, in GSM networks each mobile device  is assigned an IP address for use in addressing the respective mobile device  for wireless communications. The assigned IP address may change with the location of the device , for example, as the device  moves between cells of the wireless network . The pings sent by the active group member in some embodiments may be used to transmit IP address to the wireless connector system , thereby resetting the predetermined time interval for the sending the ping from the wireless connector system . To eliminate or reduce the need to send ping from the wireless connector system  in some embodiments, the predetermined duration used by the group members when deciding to send pings may be set to be less than or equal to the predetermined time interval used by the wireless connector system  when deciding to send pings.","While the operations  have been described as using delivery acknowledgements sent by the wireless connector system , the teachings of the present disclosure could be applied to any delivery acknowledgement architecture. For example, the teachings of the present disclosure could be applied to delivery acknowledgements used between a messaging server and its corresponding messaging clients, such as a Microsoft Exchange\u2122 server and Microsoft Outlook\u2122 clients. Additionally, the teachings of the present disclosure could be applied to read receipts for data packets between a messaging server and its corresponding messaging clients, such as email message read receipts. It will be appreciated that the messaging clients would need to be configured to provide an indication of presence status and that, depending on the embodiment, the messaging server, messaging clients, or both, would need to be configured to provide presence update data packets as described above.","While the present disclosure is primarily described in terms of methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the present disclosure is also directed to various apparatus such as a handheld electronic device including components for performing at least some of the aspects and features of the described methods, be it by way of hardware components, software or any combination of the two, or in any other manner. Moreover, an article of manufacture for use with the apparatus, such as a pre-recorded storage device or other similar computer readable medium including program instructions recorded thereon, or a computer data signal carrying computer readable program instructions may direct an apparatus to facilitate the practice of the described methods.
