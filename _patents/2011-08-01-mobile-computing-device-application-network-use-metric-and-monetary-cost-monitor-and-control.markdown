{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to operating mobile computing device applications. In particular, but not by way of limitation, the present invention relates to monitoring and controlling a network use metric usage and monetary cost of one or more mobile computing device applications.","The number of mobile computing device applications which require access to the internet is increasing. Internet access is typically provided through a cellular network such as, but not limited to, a 3G or a 4G network, or through a WiFi connection. However, not all network carriers providing cellular service to mobile computing devices include unlimited data access, and not all WiFi connections are free and such WiFi connections may be difficult to find. For example, some network carriers may place a monthly data use cap on a device, while some network plans may comprise a prepaid plan\u2014i.e., 200 MB for $35.","Many current mobile computing device applications are agnostic to which network the application may use, or which application features may be implemented across certain networks. Such applications simply choose whatever network interface is available and use the interface without concern for the amount of bandwidth or other network use metric the application is using on the network. Furthermore, users are not provided with easily-accessible mechanisms to determine the bandwidth used by each application and application features. Users may be unaware that an application may be using network resources without any instruction to do so from the user\u2014i.e., in the background of the mobile computing device.","It would often be advantageous for the mobile computing device applications to operate in one or more modes, depending on the type network available and the network carrier plan that is servicing the mobile computing device. For example, if the mobile computing device is connected to a free network providing the mobile computing device unlimited data access, each feature of the mobile computing device applications may operate to its full potential. However, when the mobile computing device is connected to a bandwidth limited network or a network that may charge for data use across the network, certain features of the mobile computing device may cease to operate, or may operate in a scaled-down mode. Disclosed herein are embodiments of an invention pertaining to monitoring and controlling the data used by a mobile computing device and mobile computing device applications. Such embodiments enable the user to control which applications and application features may access which data networks, depending on the network data plan, and the available data bytes in the data plan and the remaining time in the data plan billing cycle.","One embodiment of the invention comprises a mobile computing device having an application network use metric monitoring agent. This monitoring agent provides a network use metric used by one or more mobile computing device applications. The mobile computing device further comprises a network plan interface. This is a mechanism which allows a monetary cost to be associated to the network use metric used by the one or more mobile computing device applications. Such a cost is dependent upon what the mobile computing device is charged for the data used by the network carrier through the agreement, or network plan, servicing the mobile computing device.","Another embodiment of the invention comprises a mobile computing system comprising an agent, a user interface, a service, a first application programming interface, a second application programming interface, and one or more mobile computing device applications, wherein the one or more mobile computing device applications comprise a first application, a second application, and a third application. The agent is adapted to monitor network stack traffic associated with one or more mobile computing device applications. The user interface is adapted to display at least one of a monetary cost and a network use metric associated with one or more features of one or more mobile computing device applications and is further adapted to at least one of enable and disable the one or more features on the one or more mobile computing device applications. The service is adapted to run on the mobile computing device and implement the at least one of enabling and disabling one or more features on the one or more mobile computing device applications. The first application programming interface is adapted to at least one of enable and disable one or more features on the first application, wherein the first application being registered with the first application programming interface. The second application programming interface is adapted to provide at least one response to at least one query from the second application, with the second application adapted to at least one of enable and disable one or more features of the second application upon receiving the at least one response. The third application comprises one or more features that are adapted to be at least one of manually enabled and disabled according to at least one of a monetary cost and a network use metric associated with the one or more features.","And another embodiment of the invention may be characterized as a method of controlling one or more mobile computing device applications. One method comprises monitoring a bandwidth used by the one or more mobile computing device applications, calculating a monetary cost for the bandwidth used by the one or more mobile computing device applications, and adjusting the bandwidth used by the one or more mobile computing device applications.","Yet another embodiment of the invention may be characterized as a non-transitory, tangible computer readable storage medium on a mobile computing device, encoded with processor readable instructions to perform a method of adjusting a monetary cost of one or more features on one or more mobile computing device applications. The method of adjusting a monetary cost of one or more features on one or more mobile computing device applications comprises monitoring a network use metric used by the one or more mobile computing device applications, calculating a monetary cost for the network use metric used by the one or more mobile computing device applications, and using at least one of the network use metric and the monetary cost to adjust the network use metric used by the one or more features on the one or more mobile computing device applications.","Referring first to , seen is a mobile computing device . One mobile computing device  comprises an application network use metric monitoring agent  and a network plan interface, or NPI, . The application network use metric monitoring agent  may be referred to throughout the application as an agent , where appropriate. The agent  and NPI  may both comprise one or more of software and hardware. As seen in , the agent  and NPI may comprise a portion of a mobile computing device memory .","The agent  in one embodiment is adapted to monitor the amount of bandwidth (i.e., bytes over time) used by one or more applications . Alternatively, the agent  may monitor another network use metric such as, but not limited to, an aggregate amount of data used or packets sent\/received to\/from the network. Therefore, although the term \u201cbandwidth\u201d may be used throughout the application to describe the network use metric, it is contemplated that one or more alternative network use metrics may be substituted for the term \u201cbandwidth\u201d. In one example, the one or more applications  may communicate with a mobile computing device wireless transmitter\/receiver \u2014sending and receiving information through the wireless transmitter\/receiver  across a network. The agent  may monitor the network used by the one or more applications  and determine a bandwidth that each of the one or more applications  is using at any particular time. In one embodiment, the agent  may determine (i) the bandwidth used for a given time period, (ii) when the bandwidth changes, (iii) what value the bandwidth changes to, and (iv) when the bandwidth reaches zero for each application. Other options known in the art are also contemplated. The agent may also determine the bandwidth used by individual features of a single application. In one embodiment, the information may be saved to a log file.","The network plan interface  may be adapted to apply a monetary cost to the bandwidth used by the one or more mobile computing device applications . For example, the NPI  may comprise information detailing a network plan that a mobile computing device user has with a network carrier and is associated with the mobile computing device . It is also contemplated that the NPI  may communicate through the wireless transmitter\/receiver  across the network with a server such as, but not limited to, a network carrier server, to receive information regarding the cost of the bandwidth used.","One mobile computing device  may further comprise a user-interface . In one embodiment the user-interface  may display the bandwidth used and\/or monetary cost for the one or more mobile computing device applications  on an electronic display . As seen in , the user-interface  may provide a list of the one or more applications  and may also provide one or more bandwidth adjustment settings  for the one or more mobile computing device applications . The applications  displayed in the user-interfaces  may comprise applications  currently using bandwidth on the mobile computing device . However, applications  may also be listed which are not correctly using bandwidth. Also listed in the user interface  may be a network interface  for each of the one or more applications , as well as the total amount of bandwidth used  for each application on that network interface. The total bandwidth used  may be for a single session (i.e. a given time period). Other settings  and display categories are also contemplated besides the settings  and display categories (e.g., interface , bandwidth used ) seen in . In one embodiment, the one or more settings  may comprise one or more network settings. For example, a user may be able to adjust or \u201cthrottle\u201d the amount of bandwidth that is allocated to each application , as well as restrict the application from using any bandwidth\u2014i.e., cutting-off the application  from the network. In one embodiment, a user may set a \u201cthrottle\u201d value to zero if the user does not wish to limit the bandwidth used by the application . Values may range from zero to 100, with each higher value comprising less bandwidth in one embodiment. However, a higher number may comprise more bandwidth in an embodiment as well.","It is contemplated that one of the one or more applications  may comprise a first application. The functionality of the first application , with respect to the amount of bandwidth used by the first application, may be automatically adjusted by the first application, dependent upon an amount of bandwidth remaining in the data plan servicing the mobile computing device , as well as the network that the mobile computing device  is connected to. For example, if the mobile computing device  is connected to a 3G network, and the network data plan providing the mobile computing device  access to the 3G network has a data-cap, the user-interface  may be used so that the first application may be set so that certain functionality of features of the first application  may not operate or may operate at a decreased level when a percentage (such as, but not limited to, 50%) of the datacap is reached. In one embodiment, various features of the application may only be fully operational when the mobile computing device  is connected to a free network, such as, but not limited to, a WiFi network. Seen in  is a first application \u2032 comprising an email application. In one embodiment, the user interface  may be used to only allow the first application \u2032 to use 50% of a 3G network capacity. In other embodiments (not shown), features of a first application \u2032, such as, but not limited to, disabling a download of attachments, is also contemplated, where the features may be disabled\/enabled on a network-by-network basis. Such information, among others, may be supplied by the agent  and NPI . Furthermore, it is contemplated that such application settings  may be adjusted through the user interface . For example\u2014one embodiment comprises a second application whose functionality is adjusted through the user interface .","In one embodiment, the one or more mobile computing device applications  may comprise one of the first application \u2032 and a second application \u2033. In such an embodiment, and in other embodiments, the network plan interface , as seen, for example, in , may determine that the mobile computing device  is connected to a free network. For example, the free network may comprise a network that does not charge a network plan servicing the mobile computing device , and may comprise a home WiFi network. In such a free network embodiment, as well as in other embodiments where the user or the agent  has identified the application to receive data, the background agent  may enable data to be sent to the one of the application . One such application may comprise an email application that may only operate upon connection to the home WiFi network.","The mobile computing device  may further comprise a background agent adapted to enforce the settings  as established in the user interface  for each application  and application feature. For example, seen in  is one background agent . The background agent  seen in  may be adapted to run as a background process in a mobile computing device operating system  and may be initiated upon powering on of the mobile computing device . One background agent  may analyze all incoming and outgoing network traffic and enforce the policies as established by the settings  through the bandwidth monitoring agent  and the NPI  for the one or more mobile computing device applications .","Seen in  is one first application \u2032 and a network traffic  associated with the first application \u2032. Upon enforcing policies  associated with the first application \u2032 as established either by the settings  in the user interface  or through an automatic implementation of setting , the background agent  will either allow data to be sent to\/from the first application \u2032 through the network stack , or it will deny the transfer of data either to the first application \u2032 or from the first application \u2032. The bandwidth monitoring agent  and the NPI  may receive the necessary information to operate both processes from the network stack , as evidenced by the dashed arrows  from the network traffic  associated with each application . Therefore, as seen in , the background agent  operates to prevent data from being transferred to\/from the network stack , upon receiving the application settings from the agent  and the NPI . The background agent , bandwidth management agent , and NPI  may be in communication with each other in order for proper operation to occur.","Returning to , in one embodiment, the one or more network settings  comprise one or more first settings \u2032 and one or more second settings \u2033. The one or more first settings \u2032 may comprise the throttle setting. In one embodiment, the first setting \u2032 is provided for each application  on each interface . One interface  comprises the network type. For example, one interface may comprise a WiFi connection and another interface may comprise a 3G connection. The first setting \u2032 may adjusts the bandwidth used by the application  on that particular interface . In one embodiment, the first setting \u2032 may comprise a percentage of the available bandwidth. For example, seen in , a \u201c50\u201d is entered for one application  accessing a 3G interface . Therefore, this application  would only be able to access 50% of the available bandwidth at any given moment. The second setting \u2033 in one embodiment is a \u201ccutoff\u201d setting which may enable and disable the application  from accessing the interface .","One user interface  may comprise a bandwidth limit. A bandwidth limit of one mobile computing device  may comprise a percentage of the available bandwidth in a network plan. For example, if a network plan provides a user with 6 MB of data per month, one network setting  may establish that an application  is disable upon reaching a percentage of that available monthly bandwidth. For example, in  is a second application \u2033 comprising a YouTube\u00ae application. Such an application may be automatically set to \u201ccutoff\u201d in the second setting \u2033 upon reaching the bandwidth limit.","The one or more network settings  may be adapted to enable and disable one or more individual features of the one or more mobile computing device applications, the one or more features being enabled and disabled dependent upon an available bandwidth. For example, attachments may be disabled in the first application \u2032 upon reaching a 50% limit of the available bandwidth in a monthly network plan. The ability to enable and disable application features may be set through an application programming interface (API) . In one embodiment, the application programming interface  is adapted to at least one of register the enabling and disabling of the one or more features of the applications  with the bandwidth monitoring agent . In one embodiment, the API  may also be adapted provide a response to a query from the applications . For example, the application may query the NPI  or other feature of the mobile computing device  to determine the amount of bandwidth remaining in a network plan, and dependent upon the response from the NPI , the application  may enable or disable features of the application, or the entire application  itself.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["368","368","322","336","308","368","312","308","368","322"]},"One mobile computing system  may further comprise a first application programming interface \u2032 and a second application programming interface \u2033. The first application programming interface \u2032 may be adapted to at least one of enable and disable one or more features on a first application \u2032. For example, the first application \u2032 may be registered with the first application programming interface \u2032 in order for the features to be enabled\/disabled. The second application programming interface \u2033 may be adapted to provide responses to queries from a second application \u2033, with the second application \u2033 at least one of enabling and disabling one or more features of the second application upon receiving the at least one response. Each application programming interface  may be adapted to communicate with the background agent  and\/or the bandwidth monitoring agent  and\/or the NPI  in order for the operation of the applications  to be modified properly. One mobile computing system  may also include a third application \u2032\u2033. One third application \u2032\u2033 may comprise one or more features that may be manually enabled and disabled according to at least one of a monetary cost and a bandwidth usage of the one or more features. For example, as see in , the third application \u2032\u2033 does not interface with an API , but communicates directly with a background agent  and\/or a bandwidth monitoring agent  and\/or a NPI .","In one mobile computing system , the user interface  may comprise the first setting \u2032 and second setting \u2033. The first setting enables a percentage of available bandwidth to be used by the first application \u2032, second application \u2033, and third application \u2033. The second setting \u2033 may disables at least one of the first application \u2032, second application \u2033, and third application \u2033, for example, upon a bandwidth level reached, as determined by the NPI . It is contemplated that one application  may comprise an email application, and features on the email application may comprise a sync feature and an attachment download feature. An application programming interface  may limit the sync feature to a first bandwidth and the first application programming interface may limit the attachment download feature to a second bandwidth. For example, the sync feature (or any other feature or any other application) may only operate when the bandwidth servicing the mobile computing device  is greater than 100 kbps or when the total bandwidth limit remaining is greater than 50%, or when the mobile computing device is connected to a specific network type (i.e., interface).","The applications  may query or otherwise communicate with one or more APIs  for information such as, but not limited to, network data plan information, or the information may be provided directly to the application . In response to the network data plan information, a first application \u2032 may implement a first operation and a second application \u2033 may implement a second operation, where the first operation comprises a greater bandwidth usage than the second operation. The network data plan information may comprise an amount of data bytes remaining in a data plan associated with the mobile computing device , an end time of a current billing period associated with the data plan, and\/or how much time remains to a new billing cycle initiating, and therefore a resetting of the available bandwidth occurring.","Turning now to  seen is one method of controlling one or more mobile computing device applications . The method starts at  and at  the method of  comprises monitoring a bandwidth used by the one or more mobile computing device applications . At  the method comprises calculating a monetary cost for the bandwidth used by the one or more mobile computing device applications . At  the method comprises adjusting the bandwidth used by the one or more mobile computing device applications . The method ends at .","Adjusting the bandwidth used by the one or more mobile computing device applications  may comprise using a user interface  to display and adjust at least one of the bandwidth used by, and the monetary cost of, one or more features of the applications . It is also contemplated that individual application features may not be displayed and only an application  may be displayed in the user interface . Adjusting at least one of the bandwidth used and the monetary cost of at least one feature of the one or more mobile computing device applications  may comprise at least one of, (i) allowing the at least one application feature to access one of a free network and an unlimited bandwidth network, (ii) allowing the at least one feature to access one of a cost-incurring network and a limited bandwidth network until a data threshold is obtained, and (iii) providing a percentage of a total available bandwidth to the at least one feature in one or more types of networks. Adjusting the bandwidth used by the one or more mobile computing device applications  in one or more network types may comprise using at least one application programming interface  to adjust the bandwidth used by the one or more mobile computing device applications.","It is also contemplated that one embodiment of the invention comprises a non-transitory, tangible computer readable storage medium on a mobile computing device, encoded with processor readable instructions to perform a method of adjusting a monetary cost of one or more features on one or more mobile computing device applications. For example, the non-transitory, tangible computer readable storage medium may comprise at least a portion of the computer memory . Furthermore, as seen in , the method of adjusting a monetary cost of one or more features on one or more mobile computing device applications may comprise monitoring a bandwidth used  by the one or more mobile computing device applications . The user interface  may also display a real-time bandwidth or average bandwidth for each application  and\/or application feature over a given period of time as set by the user or the system . In one embodiment, the user interface  may also display the monetary cost for the bandwidth used  by the one or more mobile computing device applications . The monetary cost may also be shown for the real-time bandwidth or average bandwidth. The mobile computing device user may use at least one of the bandwidth used  and the monetary cost to adjust the percentage of available bandwidth used by the one or more features of the one or more mobile computing device applications .
