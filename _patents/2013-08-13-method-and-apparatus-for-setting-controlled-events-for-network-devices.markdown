title: Method and apparatus for setting controlled events for network devices
abstract: A method for controlling a device during content playback commences by receiving at the device at least one user-entered command to instruct the device to take at least one action upon the occurrence of an event during content playback. The device will execute the command to take the at least one action upon occurrence of the event during content playback. The action can include providing a notification to another device, such as in the form of a URL.

No. 61\/728,044, filed Nov. 19, 2012, the teachings of which are incorporated herein.","This invention relates to a method and apparatus for allowing a user to control a device during content playback.","Advances in technology have given rise to a variety of devices capable of displaying audio-visual content, such as television programs or movies. Traditionally, users watched such audio-visual video on television sets. Now with the advent of wireless communications devices such as smart cellular telephones, portable computers and tablets, users can watch audio-visual content on many different devices. In most instances, such wireless communications devices can interact with each other though one or more networks. The ability of such wireless devices to interact with each other can allow a user to watch content while switching between devices.","The current methodology for enabling a user to interact with remote device relies on trap messages using the Simple Network Messaging Protocol. This approach incurs drawbacks.","Thus, a need exists for an easier method for allowing a user to instruct a remote device to perform a given action.","Briefly, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present principles there is provided a method for controlling a device during content playback. The method commences by receiving at the device at least one user-entered command to instruct the device to take at least one action upon the occurrence of an event during content playback. The device will execute the command to take at least one action upon occurrence of the event during content playback.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","12","12","18"]},"In addition to the television platform , the device  of  includes elements  and  which serve as C3XML and C3 command processors, respectively, for handing C3XML and C3 commands, respectively, which as discussed hereinafter, enable control of the device  in accordance with the present principles. For example, the elements  and  could each take the form of memory elements for storing computer code (e.g., Java or Javascript) for execution by the microprocessor (not shown) comprising part of the TV platform  of the device . Alternatively, the elements  and  could each take the form of separate microprocessors or the like and associated hardware (including memories) to executing stored code for processing C3XML and C3 commands, respectively.","The device  also includes an element , typically a memory, for storing computer code (e.g., Javascript or HTML). (Such computer code, when executed by the microprocessor (not shown) in the television platform , enables content downloading to the second device  from the device  via the communications protocol . Rather than comprise a memory, the element  could take the form of a separate microprocessor or the like and associated hardware (including one or more memories) for executing computer code to enable content downloading from the device  to the device  via the communications protocol .","In practice, the communications protocol  takes the form of a wired or wireless network for interconnecting the devices  and . For example, the communications protocol  could comprise a wireless network that utilizes either the Bluetooth or the IEEE 802.11 protocols or any other well-known wireless communications protocol. The communications protocol  could utilize any one of a wide variety of network protocols without departing from the spirit of the device control technique of the present principles.","The device  can comprise any one of a variety of wireless communications devices, for example a smart cellular telephone, a lab-top computer, a tablet, etc. The particular structure of the device  remains unimportant, provided that the device has the capability of communicating with the smart television set  through the communications protocol  to download audio-visual content for subsequent playback. For that reason, most of the details of the device  have been omitted from .","To effectuate remote control of its operation in accordance with the present principles, the device  includes elements  and  which serve as C3XML and C3 command processors, respectively, for handing C3XML and C3 commands, respectively. For example, the elements  and  could each take the form of memory elements for storing computer code (e.g., Java or Javascript) for execution by a microprocessor (not shown) (within the device . Alternatively, the elements  and  could each take the form of separate microprocessors or the like and associated hardware (including memories) to executing stored code in connection with processing C3XML and C3 commands, respectively.","The device  also includes an element , typically a memory, for storing computer code (e.g., Javascript or HTML), which, when executed enables content downloading to the device  from the device  via the communications protocol . Rather than comprise a memory, the element  could take the form of a separate microprocessor or the like and associated hardware (including one or more memories) for executing computer code to enable content downloading from the device  to the device  via the communications protocol .","Control of a device, such either of the devices  and  occurs though user-entered commands, typically in the form of either one or more C3XML or C3 commands, to instruct the device to take at least one action upon the occurrence of a defined condition during content playback. Two examples of such commands include the \u201cSet Cue Point\u201d (referenced as \u201ccommand 46\u201d) and \u201cToggleEvents\u201d (referenced as \u201ccommand 36\u201d) described hereinafter. Each of these commands, when executed upon the occurrence of a defined condition during content playback, causes the device to perform a particular action.","The SetCuePoint command triggers a given action event upon the reaching a certain point in the content during playback by the device. For example, if content has had a certain time elapse, the device can take an action, including providing a notification to another device. An example of the SetCuePoint command for the smart television , expressed in XML, appears below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009<Command id=\u201d46\u201d serverDeviceId=\u201ddevice Id of Smart TV\u201d"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003clientDeviceId=\u201dclient device Id\u201d"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003xmlns=\u201dhttp:\/\/mgo.com\/c3xml\/1.0\/\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<CuePoints>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Cue>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Name><\/Name>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Position><\/Position>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<EventInformation><\/EventInformation>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Cue>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003..."},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/CuePoints>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/Command>"},{"entry":"<Response commandId=\u201d46\u201d serverDeviceId=\u201ddevice Id of Smart TV\u201d"},{"entry":"clientDeviceId=\u201dclient device Id\u201d errorId=\u201d\u201d errorMessage=\u201d\u201d"},{"entry":"xmlns=\u201dhttp:\/\/mgo.com\/c3xml\/1.0\/\u201d>true\/false<\/Response>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Property","Type","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["CuePoints","Collection","Collection of current CuePoints to"]},{"entry":[{},{},"apply to current content"]},{"entry":["Cue","Object","Container for Cue information"]},{"entry":[{},"String","Name of the current cue"]},{"entry":[{},"Integer","Position in miliseconds for the cue to"]},{"entry":[{},{},"fire an event"]},{"entry":["Cue.EventInformation","String","Data to be returned with Cue Event"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The ToggleEvent command turns on or off a particular notification when an event takes place during content playback by the device.
