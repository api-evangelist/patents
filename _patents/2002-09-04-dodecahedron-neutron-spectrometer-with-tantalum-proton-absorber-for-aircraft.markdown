title: Dodecahedron neutron spectrometer with tantalum proton absorber for aircraft
abstract: A neutron spectrometer for aircraft is provided by a series of substrates covered by a solid-state detector stacked on an absorbing layer. As many as 12 substrates that convert neutrons to protons are covered by a layer of absorbing material, acting as a proton absorber, with the detector placed within the layer to count protons passing through the absorbing layer. By using 12 detectors the range of neutron energies are covered. The preferred dodecahedron embodiment of the neutron spectrometer is a solid, polyethylene dodecahedron assembly with 12 surface facets covered by a solid-state detector stacked on an absorbing layer composed of tantalum. Each absorbing layer is constructed with a different thickness according to the minimum and maximum energies of neutrons in the spectrum. In this arrangement, each of the 12 surface pentagon-shaped facets provides a polyethylene substrate to convert neutrons to protons, covered by a layer of absorbing material, acting as a proton absorber, with the detector stacked on the absorbing layer to count protons passing through the absorbing layer. The dodecahedron assembly is housed concentrically within a titanium spherical shell that serves as an outer shield. The dodecahedron embodiment is sufficiently lightweight to be suitable for airborne and satellite applications.

No. 10\/006,735, entitled \u201cNeutron Spectrometer,\u201d was filed as a divisional application of the first application (09\/503,858) on Nov. 1, 2001 by the inventors herein, is currently pending before the U.S. Patent Office and, under 35 USC \u00a7 120, is \u201can application similarly entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the first application.\u201d This divisional application is being filed under 35 USC \u00a7 120, 35 USC \u00a7 121 and 37 CFR \u00a7 1.53 (b), and priority from the Feb. 14, 2000 effective date of the first application (09\/503,858) is hereby claimed.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, sold, imported, and\/or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment to us of any royalties thereon.","The invention relates to radiation sensors and, more particularly, to a spectrometer to measure an unknown neutron spectrum in outer space.","It is often necessary to quickly, accurately and inexpensively measure neutron spectra in low earth orbits covering several energy ranges. High-energy cosmic rays produce neutrons in the upper atmosphere are a particular concern because such neutrons pose a threat to airborne semiconductor equipment such as the memory devices in flight control equipment. Neutrons threaten these devices by causing bit-flips leading to failures in the flight control and navigational equipment, and thereby endangering the operation of both high-flying aircraft like the Concorde and lower altitude commercial aircraft.","There has been a long-standing need to characterize neutron spectra so that physicists and equipment designers can better predict aircraft upset rates and design systems to avoid catastrophic aircraft failures. The general operating principle for neutron spectrometers is that neutrons interact with certain atoms to produce recoil protons that travel in relatively straight lines, as described in Kronenberg, S. and H. Murphy, \u201cEnergy Spectrum of Protons Emitted From a Fast-Neutron-Irradiated Hydrogenous Material\u201d, Radiation Research 12, 728-735 1960.","Several types of detectors that have been used in prior art neutron spectrometers of this type to measure the recoil protons. One of the earliest applications described in Kronenberg, S., \u201cFast Neutron Spectroscope for Measurements in a High Intensity Time Dependent Neutron Environment\u201d, International Symposium on Nuclear Electronics\u201d, Paris France, Comptes Rendus, May 1964. That device utilized a scintillation counter, consisting of cesium iodide and a photomultiplier and solid state devices. A variation of that approach employing a PMOS transistor was described in Kronenberg, S. and G. J. Brucker, \u201cThe Use of Hydrogenous Material for Sensitizing PMOS Dosimeters to Neutrons\u201d, IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci. Vol. 42, No. 1, February 1995.","One significant limitation of these prior art devices is that they can only count protons and can neither characterize neutron spectra nor generate the original neutron spectra. These prior art neutron spectrometers suffered from a number of other disadvantages, limitations and shortcomings because of their size, weight cost and complex circuitry, making them unsuitable for use in spacecraft and other airborne applications. In fact, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center recently requested proposals for the measurement of high-energy spectra with a spectrometer on-board a satellite or the Shuttle spacecraft.","To overcome the prior art's inability to characterize neutron spectra, as well as disadvantages, limitations and shortcomings of size, weight, cost and complex circuitry, the present invention fulfills this long-standing need with a simplified, compact and inexpensive neutron spectrometer detector. The neutron spectrometer detector employs a thin depletion layer, silicon, solid state detector as a proton counter in an instrument that converts a distribution of neutrons to one of recoil protons. The present invention's neutron spectrometer uses computer technology to allow for greater and quicker data reduction and provides the added capability of characterizing neutron spectra by unfolding proton recoil spectra into the original neutron spectrum that produced the proton particles.","The preferred embodiment is a lightweight dodecahedron monitor for aircraft use with an arrangement of detectors, converters and absorbers housed within a sphere, further comprising a tantalum proton absorber, polyethylene hydrogenous substrate and titanium spherical chamber. The advantages of low weight, compact size, simplified operation and increased data reduction allow the present invention's neutron spectrometer to fulfill the long-standing need for measuring high-energy spectra onboard a satellite or Shuttle spacecraft, without suffering from the disadvantages, limitations and shortcomings of prior art devices. A flat dodecahedron embodiment of the neutron spectrometer with the detectors, converters and absorbers housed within a box is also described.","It is one object of the neutron spectrometer to measure neutron spectra on land or in the laboratory.","It is another object of the dodecahedron neutron spectrometer to measure neutron spectra in low earth orbits covering several energy ranges from 1 to 250 MeV.","It is an additional object of the dodecahedron neutron spectrometer to convert a distribution of neutrons to one of recoil protons sorted into numerous energy bins where they are counted and the original neutron spectrum is generated by software.","To attain these and other objects and advantages, the neutron spectrometer of the present invention provides a series of substrates covered by a solid-state detector stacked on an absorbing layer. In this arrangement, as many as 12 substrates that convert neutrons to protons, are covered by a layer of absorbing material, acting as a proton absorber, with the detector placed within the layer to count protons passing through the absorbing layer. By using 12 detectors the present invention covers the range of neutron energies. The present invention encompasses a preferred dodecahedron spectrometer, and other shapes are also possible.","The dodecahedron embodiment of the present invention's neutron spectrometer comprises a solid, polyethylene dodecahedron assembly with its 12 surface facets covered by a solid-state detector stacked on an absorbing layer. In this arrangement, each of 12 surface pentagon-shaped facets provides a polyethylene substrate to convert neutrons to protons, covered by a layer of absorbing material, acting as a proton absorber, with the detector stacked on the absorbing layer to count protons passing through the absorbing layer. The dodecahedron assembly is housed concentrically within a titanium spherical shell that serves as an outer shield. The dodecahedron embodiment is lightweight and therefore would be suitable for airborne and satellite applications.","Referring now to , the essential principle of operation for the devices of the present invention is illustrated.  is a conceptual cross section view of a single neutron detector comprising a means for detecting neutrons  stacked on an absorbing layer . The absorbing layer , being composed of a first material that absorbs protons, such as titanium, is stacked on a hydrogenous substrate . Hydrogenous substrate  is composed of a second material having hydrogen atoms interacting with an unknown source of neutrons, indicated by box .","When a single neutron detector is placed in a field of a neutron spectrum, the incident neutrons, indicated by arrow , from suspected neutron source  interact with hydrogen atoms within hydrogenous substrate . This interaction produces proton recoils that travel in fairly straight lines, one of which is indicated by arrow , through the absorber layer  and the detector means . Scattered neutrons, indicated by arrow , are deflected away from the hydrogenous substrate . Detector means  is connected to a data processing means, indicated by box , and a ground . The data processing means  includes a means for proton distribution. Using several detector means  with each absorbing layer  having a different thickness allows protons with energies and corresponding ranges greater than the thickness of a particular absorbing layer  to reach detector means  and produce proton counts. The amount of absorber layers  and their thickness can be selected to correspond to ranges of protons from a low value for 1 MeV and larger thicknesses of 250 MeV. Hydrogenous substrate  converts part of the kinetic neutron energy to energy of the recoil protons  and the detector means  detects protons passing through the absorbing layer .","This approach is demonstrated by considering the energy transfer behavior of neutrons and protons. The maximum energy a neutron of energy Ecan transfer to a proton E(max) equals E(1, 2). For this example, assume an absorbing layer  thickness of d. For monoenergetic neutrons (E), the number of recoil protons reaching detecting means  and producing proton counts decreases as energy Edecreases. The number of protons will eventually equal zero when the range of maximum energy recoil protons becomes smaller than d. Recoil particles due to elastic scattering do occur in the higher atomic number non-hydrogenous absorber but, except for very high E, they do not contribute to the counts due to their small range and the unfavorable quantum energy transfer in elastic scattering.","Having a system with K units, each with a different d and exposing them to a neutron spectrum, one obtains data which consist of K counts or count rate values C(d) i=1, 2, . . . K where for d<d<d, C(d>C>C. From these numbers one can unfold the incident spectrum of neutrons.","The detector means  can be of any shape or configuration and can be any type of solid state device. The inventors herein have employed a depleted n\/p diode used to measure alpha particles, which was relatively insensitive to beta particles because of their low LET (Linear Energy Transfer) values as a detector means . Spectroscopic grade detectors are not required for this device since only event counting is required and data describing the energy spectrum are not needed.","In considering the thicknesses of absorbing layers  and the ranges of protons to be measured, an energy range of 1 to 250 MeV was selected to match the expected neutron spectrum distribution. One solution to achieve this objective is to fabricate an instrument that converts a distribution of neutrons to one of recoil protons, which are charged particles that can be easily counted. By employing 12 detector means  within a given chamber, the recoil protons are essentially sorted into 12 bins where they can be readily counted. Said absorber layers  can be constructed of aluminum for detecting the lower energy levels or tantalum for the higher values. The hydrogenous substrate  for each detector means  could be constructed of polyethylene.","The data processing means  and its means for proton distribution provides a hitherto unavailable capability to determine a proton distribution pattern to construct a neutron spectrum indicating the spectrum of neutrons from an unknown source of neutrons . In operation, results of a spectral measurement are a set of pairs from the detector means  and the absorbing layer  that allows protons with energies and corresponding ranges greater than the absorbing layer 's thickness to reach the detector means  and produce proton recoil counts. One data processing means  successfully employed by the present inventors is a 3-dimensional Monte Carlo Adjoint Transport code, NOVICE, which is described in Jordan, T., \u201cNovice, A Radiation Transport and Shielding Code\u201d, Experimental and Mathematical Physics Consultant, Report EMP.
