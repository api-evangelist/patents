title: Open and covert detection mechanisms for materials at locations of interest
abstract: An optical receiving and data communications system for sensing materials of interest (e.g., drugs and/or explosives) in transportation systems such as buses, trucks, cars, trains, aircraft, and ships, and checkpoints such as building entrances, roadblocks, passenger boarding areas, and the like. The system can be included in the transportation system, and includes a fiber optic front end that focuses and/or concentrates light reflected from a target into the fiber filament for communication to an optical sensor. When the target is illuminated at a predetermined wavelength, a vapor plume and/or particulate matter associated therewith is energized such that change information is caused to occur and be received into the fiber system. The change information is communicated over a fiber communications network to a remote processing and analysis system for processing and analysis to determine its chemical components.

No. 11\/390,402 entitled \u201cOPEN AND COVERT DETECTION MECHANISMS FOR MATERIALS AT LOCATIONS OF INTEREST\u201d and filed Mar. 27, 2006, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent application Ser. No. 60\/666,127 entitled \u201cOPEN AND COVERT DETECTION MECHANISMS FOR A CHEMICAL COMPOSITION DETECTION SYSTEM\u201d and filed Mar. 29, 2005.","This application is related to copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/399,965 entitled \u201cOPEN AND COVERT DETECTION MECHANISMS FOR MATERIALS AT LOCATIONS OF INTEREST\u201d filed on Mar. 8, 2009, copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/399,967 entitled \u201cOPEN AND COVERT DETECTION MECHANISMS FOR MATERIALS AT LOCATIONS OF INTEREST\u201d filed on Mar. 8, 2009, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/352,800 entitled \u201cILLUMINATION AND DETECTION ARCHITECTURE\u201d filed Feb. 13, 2006, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/652,151 entitled \u201cTARGET COMPOSITION DETECTION ARCHITECTURE\u201d and filed Feb. 11, 2005. The entireties of the above-noted applications are incorporated by reference herein.","This invention is related to security systems at points of entry, chokepoints, or other desired locations for sensing\/detecting the presence or absence of at least drugs and\/or explosives, on persons, vehicles, ships, and aircraft, for example.","The security of any country is becoming threatened more and more by individuals who seek to impose their own beliefs on the society by destabilizing the current governments, taking retribution against others, and\/or to profit illegally from sales of drugs and guns, for example. Accordingly, governments are devoting more resources to deter such efforts. Such individuals and products can enter a country by many different means, ranging from walking in as human carriers to other transportation means (e.g., vehicles and other craft) that transport large containers thereby making it very difficult to adequately process such containers, craft and vehicles in large numbers without having an economic impact.","Some such materials do need not be supplied or conveyed in large quantities in order to do damage or cause harm to life and property. For example, small quantities of nuclear and biological material can pose great risk to human health. Moreover, given the destructive power in economic terms as well as human life associated with such small amounts it seems that individuals are more apt to take the risk of dealing with these materials for personal gain or other reasons. Accordingly, airports and borders are being more closely monitored for individuals and the transport of illegal materials trying to enter (or leave) a country. However, the numbers of vehicles and people moving across borders is enormous. Similarly, the number of shipping containers being transported in and out of ports, and the number of large trucks hauling such containers provides an even more difficult task of ensuring that no harmful or illegal products or materials enter the country. In other words, the capability to quickly monitor, scan and detect each human, container, truck and ship, for example, without having a negligible effect on commerce and travel is nearly an impossible task.","Current methods include x-ray detection and other nuclear techniques for non-human examination, such as at airports for luggage, none of which address the possibility that such materials can be carried by the person. Similarly, such applications are not conducive to scanning people or for adequately processing large numbers of vehicles, large vehicles and large transport vessels, for example. Accordingly, a need exists for improved techniques, systems, and methodologies for detecting materials of interest in such environments.","The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key\/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The subject invention is a system for sensing drug, explosives, and\/or other materials of interest at desired points or locations. For example, the invention can be employed in a wide variety of applications, including, but not limited to, checkpoints, embassy buildings, military entrances, government buildings, ports of entry, road checkpoints, chokepoints, public transportation, cargo transportation systems, or virtually any area that is desired to be scrutinized for the presence of certain chemical compositions and related components.","In another aspect thereof, the invention can be employed in a concealed or open implementation to facilitate the detection of desired chemical components (e.g., components related to explosives and\/or drugs). The system is simplistic, cost effective, and can be easily concealed in floors, ceilings, walls, portable containers, and handheld units, for example.","The system includes an optical receiving and data communications architecture for sensing at least drugs and explosives. The system includes a fiber optic front end having a lens attached thereto that focuses and\/or concentrates light reflected from a target into the fiber filament for communication to an optical sensor. When a target is illuminated at a predetermined wavelength, a vapor plume associated therewith is energized such that photoluminescent information is received into the fiber\/lens pair. The photoluminescent information is communicated over a fiber communications network to a remote processing and analysis system for processing and analysis to determine its chemical components.","In support thereof, the invention disclosed and claimed herein, in one aspect thereof, comprises an optical receiving component that receives photoluminescent information representative of a chemical component of an illuminated target, the chemical component associated with at least one of a drug and an explosive material. The system further includes a communications component that communicates the photoluminescent information to a remote location for processing and analysis to determine the chemical component. In one implementation, the communications component is a fiber optic communications system that facilitates communication of the photoluminescent information to an optical sensor that captures the photoluminescent information in the form of an image. In another implementation, the communications component includes the fiber optic communications system and radar (e.g., phased array) that facilitates communication of a photoluminescent image to the optical sensor.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects of the invention are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention can be employed and the subject invention is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The invention is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the subject invention. It may be evident, however, that the invention can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the invention.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent\u201d and \u201csystem\u201d are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component can be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, a hard disk drive, multiple storage drives (of optical and\/or magnetic storage medium), an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution, and a component can be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.","The disclosed architecture includes a system for sensing drug, explosives, and\/or other materials at desired points or locations. For example, the architecture can be employed in a wide variety of applications, including, but not limited to, checkpoints, embassy buildings, military entrances, government buildings, ports of entry, road checkpoints, chokepoints, public transportation, or virtually any area that is desired to be scrutinized for the presence of certain chemical compositions and related components. The architecture is suitable for a concealed (covert) and\/or open implementation to facilitate the detection of desired chemical components (e.g., components related to explosives and\/or drugs). The system is simplistic, cost effective, and can be easily concealed in floors, ceilings, walls, portable containers, and handheld units, for example.","It is to be understood that the term \u201cchange\u201d as used herein is intended to include any one or more of detectable events such as a chemical change, photoluminescent events such as fluorescence and phosphorescence, photofragmentation or photodisassociation, to name a few. The type of energy as well as characteristics and\/or parameters of the energy are controlled to facilitate detecting the presence or absence of the selected material at the target by the corresponding presence or absence of the change (or change signals), as exhibited by detected photon signals when the light impinges on the target and\/or particulate materials. For example, where the imposed energy is light, the frequency can be controlled to cause detectable changes in vapors at the target and\/or particulates on the surface or slightly beneath the surface of the object.","Referring initially to the drawings,  illustrates a sensing and detection system  for sensing and detecting materials of interest (e.g., drugs and\/or explosives) in an area of interest in accordance with the subject invention. An object of interest (or target)  is illuminated with a light source from an illumination component  such that vapors and\/or particulates associated therewith are energized generating detectable change data  (e.g., photoluminescence) that represents a chemical component of a drug and\/or explosive material. The object of interest  passes through an area of interest (or inspection area)  that is covertly and\/or openly configured with an optical receiving component . The optical receiving component  can include a single fiber filament that receives the change data  and facilitates communication of the photons associated therewith to a communications component . Alternatively, the optical receiving component  can be a plurality of optical fibers positioned separately and\/or in several bundles to receive the photon signals associated with the change data  and communicate the photon signals to the communications component .","The communications component  further conducts signals associated with the change data to a filters and sensing component  that filters the photons to allow only the desired wavelength(s), and an optical sensor that senses the received photons as, for example, an image. From there, the photon signals representative of the change data  are passed to a processing and analysis component  to detect the chemical(s) present in the vapors and\/or particles associated with the object of interest .","It is to be appreciated that the distance from the optical receiving component  to the filters and sensing component  can be a short distance (on the order of centimeters and meters) or a much greater distance (on the order of 100's to 1000's of meters). In support there of, if the distance is short, optical fiber can be run from the target inspection area directly to the filters and sensing component  without the need for the communications component  (e.g., the need for optical repeaters, focusers, etc.). Alternatively, if the distance from the optical receiving component  to the filters and sensing component  is a much greater distance (on the order of 100's to 1000's of meters), various other means can be employed to ensure that the optical signals received from the change data are communicated to the filters and sensing component . For example, the communications component  can include further lengths of optical fibers, multipliers, repeaters, etc., in addition to wireless systems that can communicate image data (e.g., phased array radar).","In another implementation, the optical receiving component  can include fiber filaments, some or all having a lens attached thereto that assists in coupling more photons thereinto than if the lens were not present. This is described infra.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"At , an area of interest (e.g., building ingress\/egress, shipping port, . . . ) is selected as well as the type of target (or object of interest) for inspection. At , an inspection area is configured with one or more photon receivers (e.g., optical fiber filaments). At , the target is illuminated, or selected areas thereof, with a predetermined wavelength of light to cause detectable change data (e.g., photoluminescence) on or near the target vapors and\/or particulates. At , the photon signals representative of the change data is coupled into the fiber filament(s). At , the photon change data is communicated through the fiber filaments. At , where greater distances are required, a wireless image communications systems can be employed with the fiber medium, if desired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","304","306","304","308","304","304","310","306","312","306","308","310","312","308"]},"In support thereof, the system  further includes an optical component  that interfaces to couple photon signals representative of the change information  to a detection component . In one implementation, the detection component  interfaces to an optical component  which includes a fiber filament (not shown) that conducts the change information  to the detection component . Either (or both) of the optical component  or (and) the detection component  can further include the hardware and\/or software desired to preprocess the change information , and provide further photon filtering, including one or more photon sensors, for example.","The detection component  outputs detection data to a processing and analysis component  that further can perform analysis thereof. For example, it is to be appreciated that many different types of analysis can be conducted such as image analysis, color analysis, timing analysis, signal conditioning from the detection component , etc. The processing and analysis component  can also function as a central monitor and control system for the system  that controls the illumination component  to tune the accompanying light source to the desired frequency, orientate the light source in a desired direction, conduct onboard tests, manages power subsystems on\/off or in reduced power modes, for example, and generally, manage subsystems of the illumination component  for all purposes.","The system  also includes a communications component  that facilitates wired and\/or wireless communications between the system  and a remote system (not shown), and between any of the system components (, , and ). Additionally, the communications component  can also be employed to communicate the detection data from the detection component  to suitable remote system for further processing. As indicated, the system  can be deployed covertly such that the target is not aware of the illumination component , detection component , optical component , processing and analysis component  and communications component .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","406","408"]},"For explosive residue, chemical compounds of interest can include trinitrotoluene (TNT), dinitrotoluene (DNT), octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), for example. The subject architecture can illuminate and detect \u201cnitrate explosive mixtures\u201d, which is intended to be an all-encompassing term, including all forms of sodium, potassium, barium, calcium, and strontium nitrate explosive mixtures.","It is to be appreciated that the subject invention is not limited to detecting explosives and\/or drugs on humans, vehicles, airplanes, ships, etc., but can also be employed to detect such chemical components in soil. Explosive molecules are semi-volatile organic compounds. Explosive compounds, or their degradation products, used in military and industrial applications, and therefore are present in soil where explosives, landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) are present or where explosion events have occurred to directly contaminate the soil with explosive compounds. These include, but are not limited to, CHNOor HMX, CHNOor RDX, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (CHNOor TNB), 1,3-dinitrobenzene (CHNOor DNB), methyl-2,4,6-trinitrophenylnitramine (CHNOor Tetryl), nitrobenzene (CHNOor NB), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (CHNOor TNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (CHNOor 24DNT), 2,6-dinitrotoluene (CHNOor 26DNT), o-nitrotoluene (CHNOor 2NT), m-nitrotoluene (CHNOor 3NT), p-nitrotoluene (CHNOor 4NT), nitroglycerin (CHNOor NG), 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (CHNOor 4-Am-DNT), 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (CHNOor 2-Am-DNT), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (CHNOor PETN).","Referring now to , there is illustrated a top-down view of an exemplary application of a detection system  in accordance with the invention. The system  can be employed in a wide variety of applications, including, but not limited to, checkpoints, embassy buildings, military entrances, government buildings, ports of entry, road checkpoints, chokepoints, or virtually any area that is desired to be scrutinized for the presence of certain chemical compositions and components (e.g., explosives and\/or drugs). In this exemplary implementation, the system  includes an inspection area  through which a target  is expected to pass. The inspection area  can be a canal (for ships or other water craft), an airport area where planes are expected to pass, a doorway of the plane, a doorway to or from a building, a drive entrance into a compound area through which vehicles must pass, and so on. The locations and configurations in which the subject invention can be employed are substantially unlimited.","The system  depicts essentially two identical detection systems; a first system  and a second system . However, it is to be appreciated that only a single system can be employed or more than two systems. This is based on the type of coverage desired for a given application. For example, it may not be desired or required in one application to inspect under the target , but only on the sides. In another scenario it may be required to inspect one or more of the top, bottom, front, back, and both sides of the target , or small openings thereof. For example, a small opening can be ported to the outside of the container such that gases can be sampled or scanned for presence of the desired chemical and\/or materials.","The first system  includes one or more light sources  that illuminate the target  or selected areas or portions thereof as the target passes by. Again, as described herein, it is also possible that the first system is mobile such that it moves along a stationary target. In one implementation, the first system  or portions thereof orbits above the target  to provide substantial scanning coverage of the target from above. One or more sensor banks  function to detect change information generated as a result of the light of the light source(s)  energizing chemicals in a vapor and\/or particulate materials associated with the target , as described supra.","The sensor banks  can be bundles of optical fiber filaments packaged to sense and conduct the phonon signals associated with the change information as one or more images to a control and analysis system . The control and analysis system  includes the necessary hardware and\/or software to process the received images or photon signals in order to determine if the images represent the chemicals desired to be detected (e.g., explosives and\/or drugs). The first system  also includes an HMI (human-machine interface) system  connected to the control and analysis system  that facilitates human interaction therewith (e.g., viewing data, initiating commands, receiving data, . . . ).","In this example, the second system  can be configured like the first system . However, it need not be. Moreover, there may not be a requirement for the second system  at all.","In that there are multiple light sources  such that different areas of the target  can be processed for the desired chemical component or material, the sensor banks  can obtain multiple change information images that are different. Thus, images from a single perspective (e.g., from only the top light source) can be processed on a \u201cper channel\u201d basis. This is because it is possible that more than one type of chemical component or material on a list of target chemicals can be detected and will be processed. In support thereof, the control and analysis system  can include multi-channel image processing capability that processes each channel of images over multiple \u201cframes\u201d and reacts accordingly to the detected results.","In this example, it is shown that when the light sources  of the first system  energize the target vapor and\/or particulates, such change information is detected by the second system . However, this is not required, in that the first system  (or the second system ) is capable of illuminating and detecting the change information without the second system  (or the first system ) being in place. It is also to be appreciated that the first and second systems ( and ) can be interconnected by a wired and\/or wireless technology.","In many cases, it will be advantageous in a particular application for the target  not to know that it is being inspected. In this scenario, the first and second systems ( and ) can be concealed in a structure proximate to the inspection area . In that the light sources  can be lasers and the sensor banks  the ends of optical fiber, concealment is made significantly easy. Moreover, utilization of such system components (lasers and fibers) further promotes the implementation of smaller more mobile detection systems (e.g., hand carry systems).","The control and analysis system (CAS)  can include an imaging component for image detection and processing of a detectable change at a target . The imaging component receives target information related to a detectable change at the target  as a result of being illuminated by the illumination source .","The CAS  can include subsystems that facilitate initialization (and\/or self calibration) and baseline processing for eliminating effects of ambient conditions, for example. In support thereof, the CAS  can include an imager subsystem for receiving the target information as photons that are filtered through a photon filter to remove unwanted signals. The CAS  can also include a baseline processing control component that facilitates initialization and\/or calibration of the imager subsystem prior to capturing a reading of the target information. For example, it is desired to eliminate the effects of the ambient lighting conditions by first capturing the ambient or background lighting data for eventual subtraction or elimination from the final image data. Next, capture of the working conditions can be recorded by briefly imposing illumination on the target  with the illumination source , and then capturing an image so as to process the illuminated target data against the ambient lighting conditions to obtain a delta value.","The imaging component of the CAS  can also include a shutter (or baffle) control component that closes off substantially all light to the imager elements to allow any residual readings (or photon activity) on the active elements of the imager to subside or bleed off. It is to be appreciated that such shutter can be opened and closed in short periods of time (e.g., milliseconds) in support of making the initialization process very short in terms of time. This will be controlled to reach the desired \u201cblack\u201d criteria or residual photon activity on the imager before initiating the next image capture.","Once the ambient lighting conditions, affects of illumination on the target, and residual imager conditions have been measured and accounted for, detection of the desired material of interest at the target can commence. Accordingly, when the illumination is imposed on the target , the imager subsystem receives back photon information from the target  via the sensor banks  related to the ambient lighting conditions and the light on target impact, which are then processed and subtracted out. What remains should be any change information recorded in the snapshot or image as captured by the imager. It is to be appreciated that this process can be performed many times in a very short period of time, thereby receiving large amounts of data which can be processed to confirm or deny or provide a likelihood of the presence or absence of the material of interest. Such processing can be provided by an imager software processing component. This processing component can include high speed processing hardware (e.g., digital signal processors) and\/or software for the rapid analysis, processing, and turnaround of imaging data in order to obtain results.","The illumination source  can also include a positioning control component (e.g., a servo control device) for controlling the direction of illumination to the target . Accordingly, the illumination (e.g., a beam from a laser) can be finely controlled to impact the target .","The CAS  can also, optionally, include a range finder component for determining an approximate distance-to-target value. This distance value can be used to control the illumination on the target . For example, if the distance value exceeds a predetermined minimum distance value, it will be understood that some adjustment to the illumination beam may be required, for example, related to focus or dispersion thereof. On the other hand, if the distance value is less than the minimum value, the beam may not require further adjustment prior to examining the target for the material of interest. Range determination can be accomplished by several different techniques, such as laser detection and\/or high frequency sonic means, for example.","The CAS  of the system  can also include a system software processing and control component for process and control of any of the aforementioned components. In particular, if the range finder component returns a value which indicates that the illumination source  requires adjustment, the process and control component can interface to the positioning control component to achieve the desired adjustment in the illumination beam, with respect to at least the amount of dispersion and placing the beam on the target .","In another implementation, multiple light beams of different wavelengths, one for each material of interest, are emitted onto the target . This allows multiple different materials of interest to be detected substantially simultaneously. Accordingly, in this particular application, both drugs and explosives could be scanned for. Similarly, the target  can be scanned for two different kinds of explosives.","The additional system  can also work as a backup system should the first system  need to be taken offline for repairs or troubleshooting, for example. Alternatively, the second system  can be a secondary system that simply provides corroborating data for the first (or primary) system . In yet another implementation, the first and second systems ( and ) can work in an interleaved fashion where the first system  takes a first scan of the target , and then the second system  scans the target  while the first system processes the first scan data, followed by now the first system , and so on. The interleaved implementation is more suitable for high speed sensing applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","600","602"]},"The system  employs optical fiber and\/or optical fiber with lens attached as sensing means, and which is described infra. For example, on either side of the passage area , lens\/optical fiber subsystems  can be deployed for receiving photon signals representative of change data caused to occur when light sources (represented by light bulbs, actually or symbolically) impose light on targets moved or passed therethrough. Where incandescent light sources are employed, a special coating on the bulb can facilitate emitting light at the desired wavelength to expose suitable change data (not shown).","The fiber\/lens systems  can be optionally filtered with photon filters  prior to optical transmission of the detected change information over fibers  to a sensor system  via a photon filter subsystem . Transmission can be directly via optical fiber cables , by wireless radar for image transmission, and other suitable means for the given application. The fiber\/lens and illumination systems can be embedded into structures for optimum concealment. Such structure can include, for example, walls, hulls, mobile barriers, doors, and so on. Moreover, multiple illumination sources can be employed. The illumination source can also be activated, modulated and\/or continuous, for example.","Additionally, other systems can be utilized in conjunction with the sensing\/detection systems, including a processing and analysis system represented by a software detect block , a notifications system  that interfaces automatically to the software detection system , user interface systems such as a display system  and human interaction block , and the like.","In one implementation, the system  can detect trace explosives and\/or drugs at a distance that ranges from about 15 feet to about 25 feet. In another implementation, the system  detects trace amounts at a distance that ranges from about 50 feet to about 500 feet. In yet another implementation, the system  can detect trace amounts of explosives and\/or drugs at a distance that ranges from about 500 feet to about 5000 feet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","702","700","700","700"]},"The inspection area can be designed to force the target through the area such that inspection is successful. For example, if the vehicle is an automobile, the vehicle can be routed through an area that forces the vehicle over and under the appropriate illumination and sensors. Similarly, if the vehicle is a midsize truck, the vehicle can be routed through tracks, for example, that force or guide the vehicle over\/under the appropriate inspection systems. It is also to be appreciated that the speed of the object of interest in inconsequential, since the change can be detected substantially instantaneously by the inspection system. This is particularly advantageous where vehicle traffic is not to be significantly impeded.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a system  that facilitates the illumination and detection of one or more materials of a target via an associated vapor plume (or material outgassing) in accordance with the subject invention. The system  includes an illumination component  that provides a source of electromagnetic radiation (or energy)  (herein, also referred to as \u201clight\u201d) that can be directed onto a target . The radiation  can be of a frequency that is visible or not visible to the human eye. For example, the illumination component  can be a LASER (Light Amplification of Stimulated Emission of Radiation\u2014hereinafter, \u201claser\u201d), which facilitates directing a visible coherent source of light onto the target . The illumination component  can also or alternatively be incandescent (with proper coatings to provide the suitable wavelength), for example, insofar as the light imposed causes a detectable change in the vapor  and\/or particulate material associated with the chemical desired to be detected at the target .","The chemical composition of many types of materials, whether natural or manmade, is such that the objects that include such materials, and continually or periodically emit (or outgas) one or more gasses or vapors associated with the materials. Thus, there is the invisible vapor cloud  that exists in some volume of space proximate the target  and that includes chemical vapors associated with one or more types of materials in, on, and\/or around the target .","In the example of , the vapor cloud  is shown to one side of the target , where the target  is a 3-D object, as opposed to the target  being an area or surface; however, in 3-D space, the vapor plume  can be on some or all sides of the target . It is to be appreciated that the target  to be illuminated and detected can be in the form of dust, a liquid or minute particles, again, which include and\/or emit vapors proximately. For example, where a surface has been exposed or contacted by an object, perhaps by the object being placed on the surface and then removed, residual dust and\/or smear of liquid, oil, etc., can exist on the surface that includes chemicals which when illuminated as the desired wavelength, can be detected. Alternatively, particulate matter can exist on and\/or in that surface cracks such that the imposed light causes the particulate matter to exhibit the detectable change. In one example, the surface can be the surface of the earth (also referred to herein as \u201cground\u201d) such that if the target dust particles, for example, drifted to the ground, again, such minute chemical vapors associated with the dust particles exist for illumination and detection in accordance with the detection system .","In operation, the illumination component  imposes the light  at a predetermined frequency f(or frequency range f-f) on the target , and when doing so, impacts the vapors  and\/or particulate matter (no shown). The energy of the light  interacts with a certain chemical or chemicals in the vapor plume causing a brief change  in the vapors  (or portions thereof) that is detectable as a different frequency f(or frequency range f-f) of detectable light  by a detector sensor system  that includes one or more sensors and associated processing capability suitable for detecting the desired chemical in a vapor or particulate material energized by the illumination component . The change  occurs and is detectable only as long as the light (or energy)  is imposed on the vapors  of the target  (or area) at the desired frequency (or wavelength). Thus, once the light  is removed from the target , the vapor change  reverts back to its original state, and hence, is no longer detectable by the detector sensor system .","Where the illumination component  includes a laser, the laser can be tunable, such that a predetermined frequency of light is output. Thus, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) can be employed to cause the atmospheric vapor and\/or target itself to exhibit certain properties that are detectable by the detector sensor system . As will be described infra, all that is required is that the target or gases\/particulates associated with the target be illuminated and the change detected.","The system  is particularly suited for detecting drugs and\/or explosives from near and\/or distant locations. For example, in one implementation, trace amounts of nitrocompounds in the atmosphere or on surfaces can be detected, for example, compounds related to DMNA (N,N-dimethylnitrosamine), nitromethane, nitrobenzene, TNT, and RDX (Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) or RDX compositions, to name just a few.","It is to be appreciated that the illumination component  and the detector sensor system  can be interconnected such that the components ( and ) are controlled by a central control system.

In a distributed computing environment, program modules can be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","A computer typically includes a variety of computer-readable media. Computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computer and includes both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media can comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.

The system bus  couples system components including, but not limited to, the system memory  to the processing unit . The processing unit  can be any of various commercially available processors.

For the computer , the drives and media accommodate the storage of any data in a suitable digital format. Although the description of computer-readable media above refers to a HDD, a removable magnetic diskette, and a removable optical media such as a CD or DVD, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of media which are readable by a computer, such as zip drives, magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, cartridges, and the like, may also be used in the exemplary operating environment, and further, that any such media may contain computer-executable instructions for performing the methods of the invention.","A number of program modules can be stored in the drives and RAM , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules  and program data .

Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, an IR remote control, a joystick, a game pad, a stylus pen, touch screen, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through an input device interface  that is coupled to the system bus , but can be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, an IEEE 1394 serial port, a game port, a USB port, an IR interface, etc.","A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor , a computer typically includes other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers, printers, etc.","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections via wired and\/or wireless communications to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer(s) . The remote computer(s)  can be a workstation, a server computer, a router, a personal computer, portable computer, microprocessor-based entertainment appliance, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described relative to the computer , although, for purposes of brevity, only a memory\/storage device  is illustrated.

This includes at least Wi-Fi and Bluetooth\u2122 wireless technologies. Thus, the communication can be a predefined structure as with a conventional network or simply an ad hoc communication between at least two devices.","Wi-Fi, or Wireless Fidelity, allows connection to the Internet from a couch at home, a bed in a hotel room, or a conference room at work, without wires. Wi-Fi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices, e.g., computers, to send and receive data indoors and out; anywhere within the range of a base station. Wi-Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11x (a, b, g, etc.) to provide secure, reliable, fast wireless connectivity. A Wi-Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other, to the Internet, and to wired networks (which use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet).","Wi-Fi networks can operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands. IEEE 802.11 applies to generally to wireless LANs and provides 1 or 2 Mbps transmission in the 2.4 GHz band using either frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) or direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). IEEE 802.11a is an extension to IEEE 802.11 that applies to wireless LANs and provides up to 54 Mbps in the 5 GHz band. IEEE 802.11a uses an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) encoding scheme rather than FHSS or DSSS. IEEE 802.11b (also referred to as 802.11 High Rate DSSS or Wi-Fi) is an extension to 802.11 that applies to wireless LANs and provides 11 Mbps transmission (with a fallback to 5.5, 2 and 1 Mbps) in the 2.4 GHz band. IEEE 802.11g applies to wireless LANs and provides 20+Mbps in the 2.4 GHz band. Products can contain more than one band (e.g., dual band), so the networks can provide real-world performance similar to the basic 10BaseT wired Ethernet networks used in many offices. Other systems such as Wi-Max and Bluetooth can be employed.","What has been described above includes examples of the invention. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the subject invention, but one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that many further combinations and permutations of the invention are possible.
