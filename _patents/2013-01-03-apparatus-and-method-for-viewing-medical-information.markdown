{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO A RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/583,630, filed Jan. 6, 2012, and titled \u201cApparatus And Method For Viewing Medical Information\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the present invention relate to information systems, and more particularly to medical information systems.","2. Description of the Related Art","Medical images are commonly stored, distributed, and viewed in digital form using computer technology. Often however, electronic medical records regarding a specific individual may exist in many locations. Picture Archival and Communication Systems (PACS) and other imaging archives have been used to store medical images. In a typical PACS or other digital imaging archive and workflow application, image data obtained by imaging equipment such as CT (Computed Tomography) scanners, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scanners, Whole Slide Imaging scanners, or other imaging sources are stored in the form of computer data files.","A large hospital system may be spread across a wide geographical area and may comprise numerous hospitals and imaging centers. These hospitals and imaging centers may have separate installations of PACS for Radiology and\/or Cardiology and other distinct imaging archives for Anatomic Pathology, Oncology and other imaging specialties referred as \u201c-ologies\u201d that constitute distinct silos of information. The siloed and distributed nature of such disparate imaging systems may impede the efficiency of information retrieval for radiologists, cardiologists, pathologists or other diagnostic imaging specialists and referring clinicians alike.","Patients often get referred from one hospital to another for various reasons, but their imaging studies and reports may not be easily available, which may result in unnecessary repeat imaging studies, inferior imaging reports, and tedious searching of possible prior test results across multiple different PACS.","It would be desirable to provide a standards-based platform that links the PACS enterprise and all the other diagnostic imaging archives, and provides a unified view of all of a patient's prior tests and reports from across all hospitals and specialties in the system.","In a first aspect, the invention provides an apparatus including a computer system programmed to retrieve information from a plurality of data sources; the computer system including a plurality of vault query services; an adapter for each of the data sources, each adapter translating an interface for one of the data sources to a vault query service interface; and a cross-vault query service providing an interface for data communication between an application program and the plurality of vault query services; and a user display for displaying the information retrieved from the data sources in response to a query from the application program.","In another aspect, the invention provides a method including: entering search criteria into a computer system programmed to retrieve information from a plurality of data sources; wherein the computer system includes a plurality of vault query services; an adapter for each of the data sources, each adapter translating an interface for one of the data sources to a vault query service interface; and a cross-vault query service providing an interface for data communication between an application program and the plurality of vault query services; and displaying the information retrieved from the data sources in response to the search criteria.","In many cases, it would be useful to provide access to a comprehensive set of electronic medical records related to a given individual, including records that may be widely distributed across multiple entities. In one aspect of the invention, this can be accomplished with a system that retrieves information from multiple sources and presents that information on a user display in a manner that facilitates the use of the information by the user. This is referred to as the SingleView system.","The SingleView system can be implemented as a \u201cfederated system\u201d with a \u201ctrue imaging interoperability platform.\u201d The SingleView system departs from the previous siloed workflow (which separated radiology information systems (RIS), PACS and 3D imaging), to provide an integrated system. The SingleView system can display information in a manner that is patient-centric and workflow-based.","The SingleView system allows patient exams and records to be visually presented across multiple PACS, multiple imaging archives or other Information Systems, thereby preventing the repetition of patient records. This reduces the probability of unnecessary patient tests and suboptimal readings of patient reports. SingleView can alleviate these problems and improve workflow since physicians are spending less time per case.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["18","20","22","24","26","28","30","32"]},"Adapter\/Provider blocks ,  and  provide a way to easily connect PACS to the Vault Query Service. The Vault Query service has a specific interface for communications with both the PACS and the Cross Vault Query Service. Each PACS or diagnostic imaging archive vendor may have a different query interface. The adapter translates the vendor specific interface into the Vault Query Service interface which allows the components to communicate. The provider aspect of the block adheres to a specific software engineering pattern that allows for the addition of new PACS or imaging archive Adapters to the system without modifying the Vault Query Service code.","The SingleView application program also interacts with a rules database  and an Enterprise Master Patient Index (EMPI) or similar database  through a cross-vault query rules engine . The EMPI service is an internal patient registry that links multiple patient instances together and identifies the instances though a single numeric identifier. An Adapter\/Provider block  decouples the EMPI specific interface from the cross-vault query rules engine  as well as provides a standard way to plug-in new patient registry sources that provide similar functionality as EMPI .","The SingleView application also interacts with a user workstation  that is used to enter information requests and to display the requested information for the user. In the embodiment of , workstation can also interact with a teleradiology system , a cached worklist  and a worklist configuration . The teleradiology system  utilizes the SingleView framework to query the PACS silo's as a single PACS instance. This allows patients and exams from both internal and external PACS to be displayed on a single radiologist work list regardless of source PACS. The cached worklist  component allows for the storage of multiple consolidated views of the PACS silos. The worklist configuration  is an application that allows the user to build specific patient and exam queries for the teleradiology system  and cached worklist . This application allows the user to build query rules using a standard language and syntax otherwise known as the SingleView query language. The SingleView framework converts the SingleView query language into the PACS or other imaging archive specific syntax.","As shown in , the SingleView application can also serve as a platform for development of other imaging informatics related applications. It can, for example, be utilized for other previously developed applications such as 24\/7 Teleradiology and an External Image Management System (EIMS).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["58","60","62","64","66"]},"The service tier  includes an application management service  and a SingleView service .","The business logic tier  includes an application manager  and a SingleView manager .","The data access tier  includes an application manager  and a SingleView manager .","The third party service\/third party wrapper service tier  includes Single Sign-On service , an iSite\u2122 wrapper service , and an Enterprise Master Patient Index (EMPI) service . The Single Sign-On service provides the ability for applications to synchronize patient and exam context. Once the user is logged on to a workstation, the Single Sign-On service captures the user name and tracks which patient and exam the user is viewing for all Single Sign-On enabled applications. When the user loads a patient in one application, all other Single Sign-On enabled applications synchronize based on their patient or exam level integration.","The data tier  includes an application management database , a patient index database , a Single Sign-On vault , an iSite\u2122 PACS , and an EMPI repository .","The SingleView framework is a unique approach to PACS and diagnostic imaging federation. Rather than attempting to create patient and exam registries, the SingleView framework relies on a business rule configuration to create Real-Time Virtual Patient Objects (RTVPO). Unlike patient and exam registries that require prepopulation of historical data and the registration of new data, the SingleView framework contains business rules. These rules are executed when the query is requested and direct the SingleView framework to query the appropriate data sources.","This rules-based framework provides a lightweight middleware layer that knows where to look for exams but is unaware of the existence of an exam. The rules-based approach of the SingleView framework allows for rapid integration or removal of data sources because historical data migration is not needed. The rules-based approach also allows for dynamic rules configuration to meet the organizational needs. Organizations can now agree to federate for a specific purpose or period of time without the need for a timely migration process. A research project that lasts only a few months or a Teleradiology agreement that operates only between the hours of 10 pm and 7 am are now candidates for federation.","The Real-Time Virtual Patient Object created by the SingleView framework can be used as a data source by other Information Systems. The SingleView Framework allows for the creation of endpoints such as IHE's XDS and XDS-I. The SingleView Framework contains service facades and adapters that simplify interfaces and adapt the interfaces in and out of the framework.","In operation, a user can submit a query from a workstation, and the system will retrieve relevant information based on the query and display the information on a display, that may be located at the workstation. The query may include patient information that will enable the system to find information relevant to a particular patient. Such patient information may include the patient name, patient ID number, social security number, birth date, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 4-7","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"For the medical facility, the integration of the application may provide time efficiency, increased accuracy, and a decrease in the unnecessary repetition of scans and claim denials leading to facility-wide cost savings.","Embodiments of the invention organize relevant clinical information. SingleView essentially creates a \u2018Federated\u2019 PACS and diagnostic imaging archive, intelligently matching a patient's Medical Record Number (MRN) and other demographics with his\/her other records across the enterprise and presents these in a single view. This imaging-centric platform can be integrated directly into a clinical workflow environment; providing a platform for imaging interoperability.","In various embodiments, a federation engine can be used to aggregate imaging data from across an organization's siloed imaging systems, including radiology PACS, Oncology PACS, Cardiology PACS, RIS, Cardio Vascular Information System (CVIS), Oncology Information Systems (OIS), Dermatology systems, Pathology systems, and others.","The described system can result in increased clinical efficiency; decreased time spent per case, and various facets of improved patient care. The system can also provide a robust functionality for identifying duplicate records within and across multiple systems and care venues, leveraging the Enterprise Master Patient Index (EMPI) web-services.","Conforming to the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) initiative. SingleView can be implemented using established standards-based architectures. SingleView leverages the PIX\/PDQ (Patient Identifier Cross-referencing\/Patient Demographic Query) components of the EMPI, and uniquely provides a workflow-centric imaging interoperability platform that is designed to be \u2018vendor-agnostic\u2019 and scalable.","SingleView has been designed to be standards based, and although it can leverage the API (Application Programming Interface) calls from various imaging vendors (for the visual controls), the application is not tied to one viewer and can be used even with open source viewing platforms.","Embodiments of the invention may be implemented, in part, using computer software applications executing on existing computer systems, e.g., desktop computers, server computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, and the like. The data communications techniques and distributed data nodes described herein, however, are not limited to any currently existing computing or data communications environment, and may be adapted to take advantage of new computing systems as they become available.","Further, embodiments of the invention (including the methods described herein) may be implemented as computer software applications and can be contained on a variety of computer-readable media. Illustrative non-transitory computer-readable media include, but are not limited to: (i) information permanently stored on non-writable storage media (e.g., read-only memory devices within a computer such as CD-ROM disks readable by a CD-ROM drive); and (ii) alterable information stored on writable storage media (e.g., floppy disks within a diskette drive or hard-disk drive). In other embodiments, the invention can utilize information conveyed to a computer by a communications medium, such as through a computer or telephone network, including wireless communications. The latter embodiment specifically includes information across the Internet and other data communications networks. Such computer-readable media and information conveyed on a communications medium, when carrying computer-readable instructions that direct the functions of the present invention, represent embodiments of the present invention.","In general, program routines created to implement an embodiment of the invention may be part of an operating system or a specific application, component, program, module, object, or sequence of executable instructions performed by a particular computing system. In addition, various computer software applications described hereinafter may be identified based upon the application for which they are implemented in a specific embodiment of the invention. However, it should be appreciated that any particular program nomenclature in the above description is used merely for convenience, and thus the invention is not limited to use solely in any specific application identified and\/or implied by such nomenclature.","In one embodiment, the SingleView application can be developed on top of the SingleView Framework. The SingleView Framework is comprised of reusable components. This means that both extending SingleView and creating applications from the components that make up SingleView are quicker and more robust.","Each component of SingleView can be designed separately and an extensible architecture facilitates the \u201cplug and play\u201d addition and modification of these pieces. The platform can be provided with \u201cout of the box\u201d solutions for administrative tasks such as logging, monitoring, and configuration for all applications that use it.","In one implementation, an application architecture can include a .NET Framework 3.5 server-side platform, an ASP.NET 3.5 web platform, a C# server-side language; and XHTML, JavaScript, CSS and AJAX client-side technologies.","Conforming to the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) initiative, SingleView uses established standards-based architectures. SingleView leverages the PIX\/PDQ (Patient Identifier Cross-referencing\/Patient Demographic Query) components of the EMPI, and uniquely provides a workflow-centric imaging interoperability platform that is designed to be \u2018vendor-agnostic\u2019 and scalable.","The SingleView system has been designed to be standards-based, although it leverages the API (Application Programming Interface) calls from various PACS vendors (for the visual controls). In addition, it is not tied to one viewer and can be used even with open source viewing platforms.","By better acquiring, managing, and disseminating patient data, health care providers are able to free themselves from mundane data entry and data acquisition tasks. These tasks can consume time that could be otherwise allocated to providing care. The system can accommodate a growing diversity of modalities; a large span of medical disciplines; increased utilization of imaging annotations and feature extractions to support care and research; inclusion of images in regional, state, and national clinical data exchanges; and increased utilization of order entry and electronic medical record decision support algorithms to guide provider ordering behavior.","The examples presented herein are intended to illustrate potential and specific implementations of the present invention.
