No. 08\/754,721, filed Nov. 21, 1996 which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,978,477;","(2) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/235,035 filed concurrently with this application;","(3) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/235,042 filed concurrently with this application;","(4) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/235,032 filed concurrently with this application;","(5) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/235,030 filed concurrently with this application; and","(6) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/234,414 filed concurrently with this application, which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,860,422.","The present invention relates generally to the field of document processing, and more particularly to techniques for performing actions based upon physical locations of one or more paper documents.","The number of paper documents used in commercial and non-commercial environments has increased substantially with the proliferation of copiers, printers, facsimile machines, and other paper document producing devices. As a result, the ability to track physical locations of paper documents is of great importance, especially in an office environment. In addition to tracking the locations of paper documents, users also frequently need to perform one or more actions based on the physical locations of the paper documents. Conventionally available systems do not provide the ability to perform actions based on physical locations of paper documents.","In light of the above, there is a need for techniques that facilitate actions to be performed based upon physical locations of one or more paper documents.","Embodiments of the present invention provide techniques for performing one or more actions based upon physical locations of one or more paper documents. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the paper documents have identification tags physically associated with them. The physical locations of the paper documents are determined based upon information read from the identification tags physically associated with the paper documents. One or more actions are performed based upon the physical locations of the paper documents.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, techniques are provided for performing an action based upon physical locations of paper documents. This embodiment of the present invention receives information identifying a first physical location and a first action to be performed. The embodiment also receives information read from identification tags physically associated with one or more paper documents located at the first physical location. For each paper document in the one or more paper documents, paper document-related information for the paper document is determined based upon information read from the identification tag physically associated with the paper document. The first action is then performed using the paper document-related information corresponding to at least one paper document in the one or more paper documents.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, techniques are provided for performing an action. In this embodiment, a data processing system receives information specifying a physical location, a condition associated with the physical location, and an action to be performed if the condition associated with the physical location is satisfied. The data processing system also receives information read from identification tags physically associated with one or more paper documents located at the physical location. The data processing system then determines if the condition associated with the physical location is satisfied based upon the information read from the identification tags physically associated with the one or more paper documents located at the physical location. The action is performed if the condition associated with the physical location is satisfied.","The foregoing, together with other features, embodiments, and advantages of the present invention, will become more apparent when referring to the following specification, claims, and accompanying drawings.","Embodiments of the present invention provide techniques for performing one or more actions based upon physical locations of one or more paper documents. For purposes of this invention, the term \u201cpaper document\u201d is intended to refer to a document comprising one or more pages of any tangible medium on which information can be printed, written, drawn, imprinted, embossed, etc. For example, a paper document may refer to a document printed by a printer, a document output by a copier or scanner, a document output by a facsimile machine, a photograph, a book, a single page of paper, a document comprising a plurality of papers, and the like. In alternative embodiments, the teachings of the present invention may also be applied to other types of objects.","For purposes of this invention, the term \u201celectronic document\u201d is intended to refer to information stored in an electronic or digital form. Examples of electronic documents include files, documents created using application programs such as word processors, email programs, image editors, etc., scanned images of paper documents, documents stored in various formats such as PDF, Postscript, etc., and other types of documents stored in electronic form.","According to the teachings of the present invention, actions are performed based upon physical locations of paper documents that have identification tags physically associated with them. Each identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document is configured to store information that facilitates identification of the physical location of the paper document. The information stored in the identification tag is also used to perform actions based upon the physical location of the paper document.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, each identification tag stores information that can be used to uniquely identify the paper document with which the identification tag is physically associated. For example, an identification tag may store an identification code that may be used to uniquely identify a paper document with which the identification tag is physically associated. It should be understood that other types of information that can be used to identify documents might also be stored in an identification tag in alternative embodiments of the present invention.","Depending upon the type of identification tag used, the identification code information may be stored in the memory of the identification tag when the tag is manufactured, when the tag is activated, or at some later time using software or hardware techniques. For example, a paper document output device may be configured to store a unique identification code in the memory of an identification tag that physically associated with a paper document or is selected to be physically associated with a paper document generated by the paper document processing device.","In addition to identification code information, other types of information related to a paper document may also be stored in an identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document. For example, the information stored in an identification tag may include an electronic representation of the contents of the paper document (e.g., a scanned image of the paper document, a Postscript format file or Portable Document Format (PDF) or image format or other file format, etc.), information identifying the author of the paper document, the date when the paper document was created, the number of pages in the paper document, and other like information. Other information that can be stored in an identification tag is described in U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/235,035, U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/235,042, U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/235,032, U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/235,030, and U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/234,414, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.","Various devices known to those skilled in the art may be used as identification tags. A device that can be used as an identification tag generally includes an on-device memory that is capable of storing information that can be read by a tag reader. As previously indicated, depending on the type of identification tag used, the information (e.g., identification code information) stored in the identification tag may be stored in the memory of the identification tag when the tag is manufactured, when the tag is activated, or at some later time using software or hardware programming applications.","Various different types of tag readers may be used to read information stored by identification tags. The type of tag reader used and the technique used by the tag reader for reading the information stored on an identification tag depends on the type of the identification tag. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a tag reader may read information from an identification tag by scanning the identification tag. In other embodiments, a tag reader may read the information by receiving the information from the identification tag. A tag reader may receive the information from an identification tag in response to an external stimulus (e.g., electromagnetic energy) or signal provided to the identification tag. The external stimulus or signal may be provided by the tag reader or by some other device or application. If the identification tag is self-powered, the identification tag may be configured to communicate the information stored by the identification tag to the tag reader. A tag reader may read the information stored by a tag reader in various forms including electromagnetic waves, electronic signals, acoustic signals, etc.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, radio frequency identification devices (RFIDs) may be used as identification tags. For example, the Mu-chip manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd. may be used as an identification tag. The Mu-chip is a radio recognition IC chip that measures 0.4-mm quare and is 60 microns thick in its present embodiment. Due to its reduced size, the Mu-chip can be embedded in paper. The Mu-chip comprises an on-chip memory (presently a 128-bit ROM) that can be programmed to store information such as the identification code for a paper document.","In its present embodiment, information stored by a Hitachi Mu-chip can be read by exposing the Mu-chip to 2.45 GHz band microwaves. The Mu-chip uses the microwave energy as a power source and communicates the information stored in the on-chip memory in the form of radio waves that can be detected and read by a tag reader. In alternative embodiments, the Mu-chip may also include an on-chip antenna to increase the communication distance range. In yet other embodiments, a power source may be provided on the Mu-chip and the Mu-chip may be programmed to communicate the information stored by the Mu-chip to a tag reader.","As indicated above, according to the teachings of the present invention, an identification tag is physically associated with a paper document. Various different techniques may be used to physically associate an identification tag with a paper document. The identification tag may be permanently or temporarily attached to a paper document or a page of the paper document. The tag may be attached to the paper document using clips, staples, adhesives, ties, strings, rubber bands, labels with identification tags, and the like. The identification tag may be embedded in a page of the paper document. An identification tag may also be incorporated into an object such as a label, a staple, etc. that is attached to the paper document.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, an identification tag may be physically associated with a paper document at the time the paper document is generated or produced. In this embodiment, the tag may be physically associated with the paper document by the device (referred to as a \u201cpaper document output device\u201d) that produces or generates the paper document. Examples of paper document output devices include printers, scanners, copiers, facsimile machines, and the like. For example, a copier may be configured to physically associate an identification tag to a photocopy generated by the copier. Likewise, a printer may physically associate an identification tag with a paper document printout generated by the printer. A facsimile machine may physically associate an identification tag with a paper document facsimile output. Likewise, other paper document output devices may be configured to physically associate identification tags with paper documents generated by the devices.","As described above, various different techniques may be used to physically associate an identification tag with a paper document. According to one technique, depending on the size of the identification tag, the identification tag is embedded in a page of the paper document. For example, the Mu-chip due to its reduced size can be embedded in a paper page. A paper page that has an identification tag embedded in it may be referred to as \u201ctagged paper\u201d. Accordingly, in an embodiment using Hitachi Mu-chips as identification tags, a paper document output device may physically associate an identification tag with a paper document by using at least one tagged paper to generate the paper document. Accordingly, if a paper document output device has access to tagged paper, the paper document output device may use one or more of the tagged papers to generate the paper document.","An identification tag may also be physically associated with a paper document by physically applying or attaching the identification tag to the paper document. An identification tag may also be physically associated with a paper document generated by a paper document output device using an adhesive, a clip, a staple, a rubber band, a tie, or other like mechanism. The identification tag may also be incorporated into an object (e.g., a staple, a clip, etc.) that is attached to the paper document.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, an identification tag may be physically associates with a paper document by mixing the identification tag in the ink that is printed on one or more pages of the paper document.","In alternative embodiments, a paper document output device may dispense a sticker or label comprising an identification tag. The identification tag may be physically associated with a paper document generated by a paper document output device by applying the sticker or label to the paper document. For example, a copier may dispense a label comprising an identification tag and a user may be requested to apply the dispensed label to a photocopy generated by the copier. Various other techniques may also be used to physically associate an identification tag with a paper document.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, if the size of the identification tag permits, the identification tag may be physically associated with a paper document such that it is not directly visible to the unaided observer or user of the paper document. For example, the identification tag may be embedded in a page of the paper document, the identification tag may be embedded or mounted on a staple that is attached to the paper document.","According to the teachings of the present invention, in addition to physically associating an identification tag with a paper document, a paper document output device is also configured to read information, including identification code information, from an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document generated by the paper document output device. For example, a copier is configured to read identification code information stored in the memory of an identification tag that is physically associated with a photocopy generated by the copier.","The information read from an identification tag may then be stored. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the identification code read from an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document is stored along with other information related to the paper document (referred to as \u201cpaper document-related information\u201d). The information for a paper document is stored such that the paper document-related information for the paper document is associated with the identification code read from an identification tag that is physically associated with paper document. The information is stored such that the paper document-related information can be retrieved given the identification code for the paper document.","The paper document-related information that is associated with a particular identification code identifying a particular paper document may include various types of information related to the particular paper document. The paper document-related information may include information read from identification tags and other information. For a particular identification code, paper document-related information associated with the identification code may include an electronic representation of the paper document (e.g., scanned images of the paper document, electronic document corresponding to the paper document, etc.) identified by the identification code, information identifying the paper document (e.g., title of the paper document, etc.), information identifying an electronic representation of the paper document (e.g., a filename, directory location, etc.), electronic document information (described in U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/235,042, information identifying the physical location of the paper document (described in U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/235,035, and other information. The paper document-related information may also include information identifying another document related to the paper document.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the identification code information and the paper document-related information is stored in a database (referred to as the \u201cpaper document tracking database\u201d). The information in the paper document tracking database may be indexed by the identification code information. In one embodiment, paper document tracking database may be implemented as a table wherein each row of the table stores information related to a particular identification code. Each row (or record) of paper document tracking database may store paper document-related information corresponding to the identification code. The paper document tracking database thus stores information identifying one or more identification codes and corresponding paper document-related information for each identification code. Information stored in the paper document tracking database is used to perform actions based upon physical locations of paper documents.","It should be understood that various other techniques may be used for storing identification code information and the corresponding paper document-related information. For example, the information may be stored in a file, in one or more data structures, and the like. The information may be stored in a memory location accessible to the paper document output device. The memory used for storing the information may be part of the paper document output device or may be part of another system or device coupled to the paper document output device.","As described above, a paper document output device such as a copier may be configured to physically associate an identification tag with a paper document and read and store information that is used to perform actions based upon physical locations of paper documents.  is a simplified block diagram of a network environment  comprising a copier  that is configured to physically associate identification tags with paper documents according to an embodiment of the present invention. As depicted in , copier  is coupled to network  via communication links . A data processing system  may be also be coupled to network  via communication links . Network environment  depicted in  is merely illustrative of an environment incorporating the present invention and does not limit the scope of the invention as recited in the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.","Communication network  depicted in  provides a mechanism for allowing communication and exchange of data and information between data processing system  and copier  and other data processing systems or devices. Communication network  may itself be comprised of many interconnected computer systems and communication links. Communication network  may be embodied as a direct connection, a LAN, a wide area network (WAN), a wireless network, an Intranet, the Internet, a private network, a public network, a switched network, or any other suitable communication network.","The communication links used to connect the various systems depicted in  may be of various types including hardwire links, optical links, satellite or other wireless communication links, wave propagation links, or any other mechanisms for communication of information. Various communication protocols may be used to facilitate communication of information via the communication links. These communication protocols may include TCP\/IP, HTTP protocols, extensible markup language (XML), wireless application protocol (WAP), protocols under development by industry standard organizations, vendor-specific protocols, customized protocols, and others.","As shown in , copier  includes a processor  that communicates with a number of peripheral subsystems via a bus subsystem . These peripheral subsystems may include a storage subsystem , a user interface subsystem , a network interface subsystem , a scanner subsystem , a print subsystem , and a tag subsystem .","Bus subsystem  provides a mechanism for letting the various components and subsystems of copier  communicate with each other as intended. Although bus subsystem  is shown schematically as a single bus, alternative embodiments of the bus subsystem may utilize multiple buses.","User interface subsystem  allows user interaction with copier . A user may be a human user, a device, a process, another computer, and the like. User interface subsystem  may be implemented using a touch pad, a touch screen, mechanical buttons, application programming interfaces (APIs), and the like. Interface  allows the user to select options for generating a photocopy  from an original document . For example, interface  may allow the user to select the paper size to be used for generating the photocopy, the copy darkness, the copy contrast, number of copies to be produced, magnification\/reduction ratio, and other like options known to those skilled in the art. A \u201cCopy\/Start\u201d key that allows the user to initiate the copying function may also be provided by interface . Copier  accepts a document  (also referred to as the \u201coriginal document\u201d) and prints a copy  (or photocopy) upon selection of the \u201cStart\/Copy\u201d key.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, interface  may also allow the user to select if an identification tag is to be physically associated with photocopy paper document . For example, before photocopying a original document , interface  may prompt the user to select whether an identification tag is to be physically associated with the photocopy. An identification tag is then physically associated with the photocopy paper document if selected by the user.","In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, an identification tag may be physically associated with the photocopy without prompting the user. In this embodiment of the present invention, activation of the \u201cCopy\/Start\u201d key by the user is sufficient to initiate the photocopying function, cause physical association of an identification tag with the photocopy paper document, and cause reading and archival of the identification code (and potentially other information stored by the identification tag) read from the identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document. Depressing the \u201cCopy\/Start\u201d key represents a single user command that is interpreted by copier  to request both copying, physically associating the identification tag, and reading and archival of information stored by the identification tag. In this embodiment, the user may not be aware that an identification tag has been physically associated with the photocopy produced by copier  and that the identification code read from the identification tag and information related to the photocopy has been automatically archived by copier .","User interface subsystem  also serves as an interface for outputting information to the user. For example, information related to the status of copier  or information related to the functions performed by copier  may be output to the user via interface .","Network interface subsystem  provides an interface to other computer systems (e.g., data processing system ), networks, and devices. Embodiments of network interface subsystem  include an Ethernet card, a modem (telephone, satellite, cable, ISDN, etc.), (asynchronous) digital subscriber line (DSL) units, and the like. Network interface system  facilitates transfer of information to and from copier  in an appropriate format.","Processor  performs or controls the functions performed by the various subsystems of copier . These functions include physically associating identification tags with photocopies, reading information from identification tags, and archiving the read information. According to an embodiment of the present invention, processor  executes a control program that controls operation of copier .","Storage subsystem  may be configured to store the basic programming and data constructs that provide the functionality of copier . For example, according to an embodiment of the present invention, software modules and control programs implementing the functionality of copier  may be stored in storage subsystem . Processor  may execute these software modules. Storage subsystem  may also provide a repository or database for storing information according to the teachings of the present invention. For example, the identification code information and corresponding paper document-related information may be stored in storage subsystem . It should be understood that the actual archival of identification codes information and photocopy documents-related information may occur either locally (i.e., in storage subsystem ) or remotely on some other system. For example, according to an embodiment of the present invention, copier  may communicate the information to data processing system  that may then store the information.","Scanner subsystem  includes a scanner  and an image-processing unit . Scanner  is configured to capture an image of original document  and transmit the image to image processing unit . Image processing unit  operates to remove distortion inherent in the scanning process. The output of the image-processing unit is a scanned image of original document  with the distortion removed. The scanned image is then forwarded to print subsystem  for further processing via video bus .","According to an embodiment of the present invention, an image data tap  provides processor  with access to scanned image data transferred over video bus . In alternative embodiments of the present invention, the image scanned by scanner  may be provided to processor  by scanner subsystem .","Print subsystem  operates in accordance with well-known laser xerography principles and is configured to receive scanned information from scanner subsystem  and produce a paper document photocopy  of original document . Print engine  operates in synchrony with tag subsystem  to ensure that an identification tag is appropriately physically associated with photocopy  and information from the identification tag is read and stored.","Tag subsystem  is configured to physically associate identification tags with photocopies generated by copier . As described above, various different techniques may be used to physically associate an identification tag with a photocopy paper document. For example, at least one tagged paper (e.g., paper with an identification tag, such as the Hitachi Mu-chip, embedded in it) may be used to generate photocopy . According to an embodiment of the present invention, tag subsystem  ensures that at least one tagged page is used to generate photocopy . If the photocopy consists of multiple pages, then normal paper pages (i.e., paper pages without the embedded identification tag) may be used for other pages of the photocopy paper document.","An identification tag may also be physically applied or attached to paper document . If the size of the identification tag permits, the identification tag may be attached to the paper document photocopy  such that it is not directly visible to the unaided observer or user of paper document . For example, tag subsystem  may attach a staple with an identification tag embedded in it (or mounted on it) to photocopy document . The identification tag may also be attached to the photocopy paper document by mixing it in the ink that is printed on the photocopy when the photocopy is generated by print subsystem . The identification tag may also be applied to the photocopy paper document using an adhesive (e.g., a sticker comprising the identification tag may be applied to a page of the photocopy). Various other techniques may also be used to physically associate an identification tag with the paper document.","As previously described, each identification tag may store a unique identification code that is used to identify the paper document with which the identification tag is physically associated. The identification code may be programmed into the identification tag when the identification tag is manufactured or activated. According to an embodiment of the present invention, tag subsystem  is configured to store a unique identification code in the memory of an identification tag that is selected to be physically associated with photocopy  or has already been physically associated with photocopy . Hardware or software modules configured to program the identification tag may be incorporated in tag subsystem .","If the identification code is already stored in identification tags used by copier , tag subsystem  is configured to read the identification code from an identification tag that has been physically associated with photocopy paper document  generated by copier  or that is selected to be physically associated with photocopy document . One or more tag readers  may be incorporated in tag subsystem  to facilitate reading of the identification code information and other information from identification tags.","The type of tag readers used and the techniques used for reading information from identification tags depends on the type of identification tags. For example, if a Hitachi Mu-chip is used as an identification tag, tag readers  included in tag subsystem  may be constructed to expose each identification tag to 2.45 GHz band of microwaves and to detect and read radio waves emanating from the identification tag. Various other types of tag readers that are capable of detecting electromagnetic, optical, acoustical, or other signals may be used in alternative embodiments of the present invention using other forms of identification tags.","It should be understood that in addition to identification code information other information stored in identification tags used by copier  may also be read by tag readers . The information read from the identification tags is then stored in a paper document tracking database. The information may be locally stored by copier  (e.g., in storage subsystem ). Alternatively, the information may be forwarded to data processing system  for storage, or may be stored on some other computer system or storage device accessible to copier .","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the scanned image output of scanner subsystem  is stored along with the identification code information. The scanned image of an original paper document is stored as part of the paper document-related information that is associated with an identification code read from an identification tag that is physically associated with a photocopy generated from the original paper document.","The various subsystems of copier  function in synchrony to ensure proper functioning of copier  according to the teachings of the present invention. Various synchronization signals known to those skilled in the art may be used to achieve this synchronization. Many other configurations of copier  are possible having more or fewer components than the system depicted in .","As indicated above, according to the teachings of the present invention, the information stored in the paper document tracking database is used to determine physical locations of paper documents that have an identification tag physically associated with them and to perform actions based upon the physical locations.  is a simplified block diagram of a distributed system  that may be used to perform actions based upon physical locations of paper documents according to an embodiment of the present invention. The configuration depicted in  is merely illustrative of an environment incorporating the present invention and does not limit the scope of the invention as recited in the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.","As depicted in , system  comprises a plurality of tag readers (TRs) , devices , and a user system  coupled to a data processing system  via communication links . Communication links  depicted in  may be of various types including hardwire links, optical links, satellite or other wireless communication links, wave propagation links, or any other mechanisms for communication of information. Various communication protocols may be used to facilitate communication of information via the communication links. These communication protocols may include TCP\/IP, HTTP protocols, extensible markup language (XML), wireless application protocol (WAP), protocols under development by industry standard organizations, vendor-specific protocols, customized protocols, and others.","Tag readers  are configured to read information, including identification code information, stored by identification tags that are physically associated with one or more paper documents and to facilitate determination of physical locations of the one or more paper documents. Whether or not a tag reader  can read identification code from an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document depends on the proximity of the paper document to the tag reader. If an identification tag has an on-board power supply (e.g., an on-board battery) and is capable of communicating information (including identification code information) stored in the memory of the identification tag, a tag reader  can detect and read the identification code from the identification tag if the reception range of the tag reader overlaps with the communication range of the identification tag.","If an identification tag does not have its own power supply and depends on power supplied by an external entity such as a tag reader, then a tag reader is able to read information, including identification code information, from the identification tag if the tag reader can expose the identification tag to the requisite energy and can read the information transmitted (or radiated) by the identification tag in response to the energy. For example, if a Hitachi Mu-chip is used as an identification tag, a tag reader can read information stored by the Mu-chip if the tag reader is able to expose the Mu-chip to 2.45 GHz band microwaves and is able to read the radio waves that emanate from the irradiated Mu-chip identification tag.","The manner in which a tag reader reads the identification code from an identification tag depends on the type of tag reader and the type of identification tag used. Likewise, a tag reader's ability to detect and read identification code from an identification tag depends on the type of tag reader and the type of identification tag and the proximity of the identification tag to the tag reader.","A tag reader is thus able to read information stored by an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document if the paper document is physically located proximal or near to the tag reader (i.e., the identification tag that is physically associated with the paper document is at a distance from the tag reader where the tag reader can read information stored by the identification tag). It should be understood that multiple tag readers may be able to read information stored by a particular identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document that is located proximal to the tag readers (i.e., at a distance from where the tag readers can read information from the identification tag physically associated with the paper document).","For example, in the embodiment depicted in , tag reader - is able to read the identification code from an identification tag physically associated with paper document (PD) . Tag readers - and - can read the identification code from the identification tag physically associated with paper document . Tag reader - is also able to read the identification code from an identification tag physically associated with paper document . Tag readers - and - can read the identification code from the identification tag physically associated with paper document .","Since a tag reader is thus able to read information stored by an identification tag that is physically associated with a paper document if the paper document is physically located proximal or near to the tag reader, the physical location of a particular paper document can be approximated to be the same as the physical location of a tag reader. Accordingly, the physical location of the paper document can be determined based on the physical location of the tag reader. If multiple tag readers are able to read information from an identification tag associated with a particular paper document, it indicates that the particular paper document is physically located in a location or zone proximal to the multiple tag readers. As described below, data processing system  is configured to receive information read by the individual tag readers from the identification tags and to determine the physical locations of the paper documents corresponding to the identification tags.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, tag readers  may be configured to send out signals at periodic time intervals to interrogate and read information including identification code information from identification tags that the tag readers can detect and read. In alternative embodiments, a tag reader  may be configured to interrogate identification tags that are proximal to the tag reader in response to a signal received from an external system, device, or application, or in response to external stimuli. For example, a tag reader may be configured to interrogate identification tags that are proximal to the tag reader upon receiving a signal from data processing system .","In addition to the identification code information, a tag reader may also be configured to read other information stored in an identification tag interrogated by the tag reader. According to an embodiment of the present invention, tag reader  may timestamp the read information to indicate when (e.g., date and time) the information was read. The read information may then be stored.
