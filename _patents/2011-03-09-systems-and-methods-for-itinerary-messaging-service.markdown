title: Systems and methods for itinerary messaging service
abstract: Messages are targeted to travelers based on travel itineraries. Targeting may also be based on real-time travel status information. The targeted messages communicate their purpose and priority to respective travelers within the context of the travel itineraries. A disclosed method includes accessing a travel itinerary database including a plurality of travel itineraries. Each travel itinerary is associated with a traveler and defines itinerary segments of a corresponding travel schedule. A message is associated with a set of targeting rules used to identify a subset of itineraries in the travel itinerary database. The targeting rules may be used with real-time travel status information to identify the subset of itineraries.

Overview","II. Example Itinerary Messaging System","III. Example Scenarios","IV. Example Message Sources and Message Types","V. Example Method for Targeting Messages to Travelers","VI. Example Itinerary Displays"],"p":["This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/313,016, filed Mar. 11, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","This disclosure relates to computerized messaging systems. In particular, this disclosure is directed to systems and methods for targeting messages to travelers based on travel itineraries, and communicating the purpose and priority of the targeted messages within the context of the travel itineraries.","The dramatic growth in smart phones and internet-enabled mobile devices, combined with the increasingly broad availability of travel itineraries, is re-shaping the travel experience. A variety of companies, including airlines, travel agencies, and mobile application developers, have begun to recognize opportunities that exist for enabling travelers to carry and interact with their travel itinerary on a mobile device. There is a need, however, to do more than simply provide users with travel itineraries on their mobile devices.","Providers of travel-related services often desire to communicate with travelers. For example, a travel agency may want to notify its customers that a portion of a tour package is temporarily unavailable and offer alternatives, or an airline may want to notify passengers scheduled for a particular flight that the there is a mechanical problem with the aircraft, and the flight will be delayed and moved to another gate. However, it may be difficult or impossible for providers of travel-related services to match relevant messages with respective travelers in a timely fashion. In many instances, certain providers may not have any access to traveler contact information or even a way to identify travelers. For example, an airport may want to notify travelers that a certain airport parking garage is unavailable for a specific period of time, but the airport does not know the identities or contact information for travelers catching a flight at the particular airport during the specific period. Further, users of personal communication devices are often inundated with a large number of messages (e.g., emails and\/or SMS text messages), which may result in travel-related messages being missed or ignored by users until the message is no longer relevant.","The present disclosure provides systems and methods for targeting messages to travelers based on travel itineraries. Targeting may also be based on real-time travel status information. In addition, or in other embodiments, the targeted messages communicate their purpose and priority to respective travelers within the context of the travel itineraries.","In one embodiment, a method is provided for causing a computer system to target messages to travelers based on travel itineraries. The method includes accessing a travel itinerary database that includes a plurality of travel itineraries. Each travel itinerary is associated with one or more travelers and defines itinerary segments of a corresponding travel schedule. The method further includes receiving a request to provide a message, through an itinerary messaging system, based on an associated set of targeting rules. The received request includes the message, the associated targeting rules, and a message category. The method further includes identifying a subset of itineraries based on a comparison of the set of targeting rules with the plurality of itineraries in the travel itinerary database, associating the message with a priority level based on the message category, and communicating an indication of an availability of the message to the one or more travelers associated with each itinerary in the subset of itineraries. The indication of availability is based on at least one of the message category and the priority level. In some embodiments, identifying the subset of itineraries is further based on a comparison of the targeting rules with real-time travel status information associated with one or more of the itinerary segments.","Additional aspects and advantages will be apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.","An itinerary messaging system, according to certain embodiments disclosed herein, is configured to target messages based on both scheduled itinerary segments and real-time travel status information. This capability allows users of the system to specify targeting rules for identifying travelers who receive messages, which dramatically improves the messages' relevance and value when compared to more general \u201cbroadcast\u201d messaging solutions or even newer \u201clocation-based\u201d services that do not have specific information about each respective traveler's current situation and needs.","The itinerary messaging system may classify the messages according to a priority level and a message category. The itinerary messaging system may further select which travelers receive the messages based on the classification so as to provide specific travelers with relevant and timely information. In certain embodiments, the itinerary messaging system controls the types of messages (e.g., the priority level and message category) that can be received from a particular message source or publisher. For example, an airport food vendor may be allowed to send low priority promotional messages to travelers stranded in an airport, while an airport authority may be allowed to send high priority airport closure or security alerts to targeted travelers.","In one embodiment, the itinerary messaging system further targets messages based on user generated events that provide information associated with a traveler's current situation. For example, the traveler may indicate that he or she has cleared customs at an airport, checked into a hotel, or arrived at a particular venue or geographic location. Such user generated events, when combined with travel itinerary information, provide message targeting beyond that which is possible through either location-based or itinerary-based messaging systems. Highly targeted marketing is possible from knowing a traveler's itinerary, and even their precise current location, as is readily possible with modern GPS (global positioning system) enabled mobile phones. Message targeting becomes even more compelling when the traveler's itinerary is combined with accurate, timely real-time flight status information that informs the current situation of their itinerary.","With real-time flight status, the system knows, for example, when a traveler is stuck in a hub airport for several hours because his or her outbound connecting flight is delayed. The system knows when a traveler is likely to miss a connecting flight because the first segment of his or her connecting flight is delayed. This is very powerful information both for providing useful assistance to the traveler as well as for delivering a variety of valuable, timely, and highly targeted messages to the travelers.","In one embodiment, the itinerary messaging system also provides icon alert messaging, which includes messages displayed in the context of an itinerary display that allows travelers to receive message alerts without obtrusive email or SMS (short message service) text messaging. The icons quickly identify the nature and priority of the message that is waiting for the traveler. The icons may represent message categories to communicate, in a passive way, the existence of a message in the category (e.g., using active vs. inactive icon states), the number of messages that exist in each category, and\/or the priority of messages (e.g., the icons may indicate the existence of at least one message of a high priority for the corresponding category).","In one embodiment, the itinerary messaging system allows a traveler to control which messages he or she receives and how the messages should be delivered. For example, travelers can choose to receive email or SMS text messages for certain types of messages, priorities of messages, and\/or sources of messages. Travelers can also choose to show icons on an itinerary display for certain priorities and message sources, and suppress icons for lower priorities or from specific sources. In such embodiments, the system allows travelers to see all applicable messages if they so choose, but they will not have to sort through a plethora of messages in an email or text message inbox to locate the relevant messages.","In one embodiment, the itinerary messaging system provides a two-way structured conversation, which includes both a defined structure and a work flow, between a traveler and a provider of travel-related services. For example, the itinerary messaging system may provide a two-way structured conversation between a travel agent and a traveler that allows the traveler to request a change to an itinerary by selecting a travel segment and answering a few questions about the nature of the change (e.g., one hour earlier, three hours later, etc.). The message structure in such embodiments ensures that all of the relevant details required to process the change request are provided by the traveler. When the travel agent responds to the change request, the message includes a structured set of choices from which the traveler can choose. The message structure includes the list of choices. The message work flow encapsulates a process (e.g., the traveler requests a change, the agent responds with change options and corresponding prices, the traveler chooses a change option, the agent makes the change, and the traveler receives a confirmation message and an updated itinerary).","The embodiments of the disclosure will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like elements are designated by like numerals throughout. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided for a thorough understanding of the embodiments described herein. However, those of skill in the art will recognize that one or more of the specific details may be omitted, or other methods, components, or materials may be used. In some cases, operations are not shown or described in detail. For illustrative purposes, some drawings include text that is small, including some text that may not be legible due to the height of the text. The small text is provided as graphical elements of the drawing for illustrative purposes only, and not for the content of the text.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","112","116","118","120","110","112","116","118","120","110"]},"The itinerary messaging system  is configured to access a travel itinerary database  that includes a plurality of travel itineraries. The travel itineraries within the travel itinerary database  define itinerary segments (see ) of a corresponding travel schedule. The travel itinerary database  may receive new itineraries  from, for example, travelers, travel agencies, travel suppliers, and other providers of travel-related services. The travel suppliers providing itineraries  to the travel itinerary database  may include, for example, airlines, cruise lines, ground transportation companies, or hotels. Such travel suppliers may provide direct bookings for travelers.  shows an arrow directly from the new itineraries  to the travel itinerary database  to indicate that travelers, travel agencies, travel suppliers, and other providers of travel-related services may directly add the itineraries  to the travel itinerary database . In other embodiments, the itinerary messaging system  directly receives one or more of the new itineraries  and adds them to the travel itinerary database .","The travelers, travel suppliers, and other providers of travel-related services may update one or more of the travel itineraries in the travel itinerary database  with real-time travel status information . The real-time travel status information  may include, for example, flight status information (e.g., flight delays or cancellations), airport status information, traffic or ground transportation status information, updated weather information, updated security information, and\/or user-generated event information (e.g., GPS location, hotel check-in, clear customs, etc.).  shows an arrow directly from the real-time status information  to the travel itinerary database  to indicate that the travelers, travel agencies, travel suppliers, and other providers of travel-related services may directly update the itineraries in the travel itinerary database  (or replace existing itineraries with updated or new itineraries ). In other embodiments, the itinerary messaging system  directly receives at least some of the real-time status information  and updates the corresponding itineraries in the travel itinerary database . In one embodiment, the itinerary messaging system  receives a stream of real-time status information from, e.g., airlines and\/or the federal aviation administration, which the itinerary messaging system  associates with specific itineraries in the travel itinerary database .","As shown in , the itinerary messaging system  receives messages and associated targeting rules  from sources or publishers such as travel agencies, airlines, cruise lines, ground transportation companies, hotels, airport authorities (e.g., a government or commercial entity charged with the management and operation of an airport), airport concession operators, government agencies (e.g., travel security administration), private security companies, corporate travel managers, business associations, chambers of commerce, travelers, and\/or designated friends or family members of the corresponding travelers.","In one embodiment, the itinerary messaging system  receives traveler profiles from a traveler profile database . The traveler profiles may include, for example, traveler identification information, traveler contact information, and message delivery preferences. The message delivery preferences indicate which types of messages the particular travelers want to receive and how different types of messages should be delivered. As mentioned above, travelers can choose to receive email or SMS text messages for certain types of messages, priorities of messages, and\/or sources of messages based on the message delivery preferences in the corresponding traveler profiles. Travelers can also choose to show icons on an itinerary display for certain priorities and message sources, and suppress icons for lower priorities or from specific sources based on the message delivery preferences in the corresponding traveler profiles.","For a particular message and associated set of targeting rules  received by the itinerary messaging system , the message targeting engine  identifies a subset of itineraries by comparing the set of targeting rules with the plurality of itineraries in the travel itinerary database . In other words, the message targeting engine  searches for and identifies itineraries that satisfy the set of targeting rules. The message delivery engine  selects an icon associated with a message category indicated by the message. In certain embodiments, the message delivery engine  also performs filtering of the messages based, for example, on the message delivery preferences discussed above. The one or more communication interfaces  communicates the message (shown as targeted messages ) to the selected one or more travelers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","122","200","210","212","210","200","122","210","200"]},"In other embodiments, the identity of the associated traveler and\/or travel contact information is not provided by the travel itinerary  or made known to the itinerary messaging system . For example, the itinerary  may have been added to the travel itinerary database  by a travel agent (or other provider of travel-related services) that does not desire to disclose the associated traveler's identity to the itinerary messaging system . In some embodiments, the itinerary ID  includes only a record locator (e.g., a confirmation number) and possibly a last name of the traveler. Because the itinerary messaging system  cannot be sure that the person viewing the itinerary is the actual traveler, the itinerary messaging system  does not allow display of some classes of messages in this context.","As shown in , the travel itinerary  in certain embodiments may include an optional agent ID  that uniquely identifies the travel agent (or agency) that provided the travel itinerary  to the travel itinerary database . The communication interface  in such an embodiment provides any targeted messages  for the particular travel itinerary  to the travel agent associated with the agent ID . The travel agent associated with the agent ID  may then, at his or her discretion, provide the targeted messages  to the traveler. For example, some travel agencies provide \u201cempty\u201d itineraries  (i.e., itineraries with no passengers) to the travel itinerary database for the itinerary messaging system  to monitor based on selected monitoring rules. When a monitoring rule is triggered, the itinerary messaging system  sends an XML message back to the agency, who handles all message delivery to the traveler.","For illustrative purposes,  shows only three of the N number of itinerary segments as 1st itinerary segment (), 2nd itinerary segment (), . . . , Nth itinerary segment (N). Persons having skill in the art will recognize, however, that the travel itinerary  may have any number of itinerary segments , including less than three segments (or even a single segment). Each itinerary segment  corresponds to a different part of a travel schedule such as a particular flight in a series of connecting flights, a layover at an airport between flights, a rental car reservation or other ground transportation arrangement, a hotel reservation, and\/or a scheduled meeting. Each itinerary segment  includes segment parameters that define the respective part of the travel schedule.","For example,  is a block diagram of a data structure for segment parameters  of an itinerary segment  shown in  according to one embodiment. In the illustrated example embodiment, the segment parameters  include a segment type  (e.g., air, automobile, rail), start location  for the segment, start date and\/or time  for the segment, end location  for the segment, end date and\/or time  for the segment, travel supplier ID  for the segment (e.g., a particular airline carrier ID and\/or flight number), status  of the segment (e.g., delayed, canceled, in progress, complete), and\/or segment details . The segment details  may include, for example, in-flight meal information, assigned seat information, driving directions information, business meeting information, expense reporting information, billing information, or other information useful to the traveler to complete the corresponding itinerary segment . Skilled persons will recognize from the disclosure herein that not every segment parameter shown in  is used in every embodiment, and that different types of itinerary segments  may include additional or different segment parameters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["400","400","100","400","410","122","412","414","416","418","420","422"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 1","FIG. 4A"],"b":["423","423","132","100","423","412","414","416","418","420","422","400","423","410","100","423","424"]},"With reference to , , , A, and B, the itinerary messaging system  according to certain embodiments provides a \u201chub\u201d through which many of the world's air-travel and other travel itineraries  may flow. As discussed above, there is a need to do more than simply collect and distribute itineraries. While there is substantial value in simply collecting itineraries from a broad variety of sources and making them available to mobile applications, web sites, and other customers, the embodiments disclosed herein add value by providing ways to leverage the intelligence gained from knowing a traveler's itinerary.","By accessing a traveler's itinerary , combined with real-time travel status information  (e.g., flight status information) and (in some embodiments) GPS location information, the itinerary messaging system  is able to target messages  to the traveler at a high level of specificity and relevance. Regardless of the message delivery mechanism (e.g., email, SMS text, or other communication channels), the ability to target messaging based on knowledge of the traveler's itinerary and status dramatically increases the value of the messages delivered.","Further, the itinerary messaging system  according to certain embodiments includes a message delivery mechanism that provides message \u201calert\u201d icons that are combined with an itinerary display on a web site or mobile device. The message alert icons are displayed in the context of the user's itinerary and alert the user to available messages that are highly relevant to their specific itinerary and situation. Users can view the messages by clicking on or touching the icon in their itinerary display.","The itinerary messaging system  is a highly targeted communication channel that connects travel suppliers and other stake-holders in the travel experience (e.g., airports, security companies, ground transportation companies, etc.) with travelers based on knowledge of the traveler's itinerary  and the traveler's real-time travel status .","The itinerary messaging system's targeted messages  may be delivered by various methods. For example, the targeted messages  may be indicated on an itinerary display on a mobile device or web site by one or more icons displayed in the context of the itinerary. In certain embodiments, the messages  may be transmitted (e.g., from a wireless access point) to a remote location, such as a hotel lobby or an airport, for display on a kiosk or other display device. Various icons may be used to show the source of the message and the type of message. In certain embodiments, each icon indicates a source and\/or message type and the severity or priority of its corresponding message. The user may be able to view the messages by clicking on or touching the icons. As another example of a message delivery method, messages may also be delivered via email. Certain high priority messages from travel suppliers may be delivered without a user's explicit choice to opt-in. Other lower priority types of messages may require a user's choice to receive low priority messages via email. In certain embodiments, messages may also be delivered as data via XML over HTTP or SOAP. In addition, or in other embodiments, messages may be delivered via SMS text messaging (though in some embodiments, this may be limited to messages delivered via email-to-SMS gateways).","In some embodiments, travel suppliers and other stake-holders are offered access to the itinerary messaging system  via a subscription. The subscription model may be based, for example, on a per-message delivered fee or simply a flat access fee. Subscribers may specify the targets of the messages based on a robust set of itinerary and status rules. Access to the itinerary messaging system  may be offered to a variety of industry players on a subscription basis with pricing based on message volumes. Messaging subscribers (i.e., message sources) may include travel agencies, travel suppliers, security companies, airports, airport concessions and businesses, and corporate travel arrangers or travel managers.","The following are but a few examples of the types of targeting rules that a message subscriber may specify for a particular message. An airline may target a message to all travelers departing on a particular flight explaining the cause of a flight delay and suggesting that travelers not come to the gate area until a later time. As another example, a car rental company may target a promotional message to any traveler who is arriving at a particular airport that is not his or her home or origin airport. Such targeted travelers may be more likely to be renting a car than other travelers because they are not arriving at their home airport and they are not simply making a connection on another flight. As another example, a travel agency or security company may target a message to all travelers whose itineraries include a stay or connection within a certain date range in a particular city where a security threat exists. As another example, an airport concession company may target a message to all travelers who are connecting through a specific airport with a connection time (either scheduled or caused by flight delays) of, e.g., 90 minutes or more. Such travelers often have \u201ctime to kill\u201d (e.g., idle time or time without any scheduled activities) and represent a substantial marketing opportunity for airport restaurants or other concessions. As yet another example, an airport authority may target all passengers departing a specific airport during a certain day or over a date range informing them about a parking lot change or a parking lot being full and recommending alternatives.","Generally, travelers book their reservations through a variety of channels including, for example, traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d travel agencies, on-line travel agencies (OTAs), and supplier direct bookings. Traditional travel agencies are most often used for corporate travel because many larger corporations use the services of an agent to negotiate better fares with the travel suppliers (e.g., airlines, hotels, car rental companies) and to enforce corporate travel policy. OTAs are companies that often have no traditional retail offices, but do all of their selling on-line. Most of an OTA's business is with \u201cun-managed\u201d travelers (e.g., leisure travel or small companies that do not have corporate travel departments). Typically, airlines, hotels, and car rental companies do a substantial part of their business through direct bookings on their web sites or through their call centers.","Each of these booking channels generally has its own database of booked itineraries. Larger agencies or suppliers may book millions of itineraries every month and their customers are increasingly demanding access to these itineraries through the internet and\/or through mobile devices. However, travel agencies and travel suppliers are often somewhat reluctant to share the itineraries broadly because they are aware of the value of the market intelligence they represent, even though most of them have few, if any effective ways to monetize that intelligence.","The itinerary messaging system  creates a way for agencies and airlines to distribute their itineraries so as to meet traveler demand to display their itineraries on mobile devices. In certain embodiments, the itinerary messaging system  allows agencies and travel suppliers to attach their brand to their corresponding itineraries wherever they are displayed. In addition, or in other embodiments, the itinerary messaging system  combines the itineraries with real-time flight status information that allows the agencies and travel suppliers proactively serve their customers when travel interruptions occur due to delays or cancellations. Generally, the agencies and suppliers recognize that their itineraries have value, for example, in targeted marketing. The itinerary messaging system  provides a way to effectively monetize that value and share the revenue with the agencies and suppliers, who are generally hungry for additional revenue sources.","The itinerary messaging system  meets the goals of the travel suppliers and agencies by substantially expanding the collection of the itineraries  in the travel itinerary database  and providing mobile-optimized web viewers for the companies that provide itineraries  as well as an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows mobile application developers and other companies to retrieve and display the itineraries from the travel itinerary database  with appropriate permission from the agencies and travel suppliers that provide them.","By collecting and distributing a substantial volume of itineraries, the itinerary messaging system  monetizes the value of the itineraries  in ways that create revenue streams that may be shared with the agencies and travel suppliers that provide their itineraries  to the travel itinerary database . Travel suppliers and agencies may have strong motivation to offer their itineraries  to the travel itinerary database  because their itineraries  can become a new revenue stream (instead of a cost) and the itinerary messaging system  may distribute those itineraries to many other companies, including mobile application developers and security companies, among others. In addition, the real-time travel status information  allows the itinerary messaging system  to combine the itineraries with timely actionable information that further enhances the value of the itineraries.","The itinerary messaging system  allows a variety of travel stake-holders to send highly targeted, relevant messages  to customers based on very specific targeting criteria specified by the sender. The message delivery engine  and the one or more communication interfaces  allow the itinerary messaging system  to deliver the targeted messages  to travelers in a variety of contexts and environments. In one embodiment, the message delivery engine  selects an icon that the one or more communication interfaces  displays along with an itinerary that the itinerary messaging system  retrieves from the travel itinerary database . The itineraries may be displayed on a mobile device or web site. For example,  graphically illustrates a user interface  for a mobile device including an itinerary display  according to one embodiment. The itinerary display  in the illustrated example includes a variety of icons  shown across the top of the itinerary display  in an itinerary messages window . The icons  may be displayed along the top, as illustrated, or next to specific itinerary segments (e.g., the displayed flights segment ), depending on the itinerary display format and message type. While the itinerary display  shows nine icons , this disclosure is not so limited and fewer or more icons may be displayed. For example, certain embodiments only show one or two icons at a time, since in many cases, there may be a limited number of messages for a specific traveler. The user can display the content of a message by clicking or touching one of the displayed icons . The precise format of the itinerary display may be up to an application developer. Various other example displays are described below.","Returning to , the one or more communication interfaces  may also deliver the targeted messages  via email to users whose itineraries in the travel itinerary database  match the message targeting rules , and where the particular message is either of a high priority or the user has specifically chosen to accept messages of the specific type and\/or priority level being delivered. In addition, or in other embodiments, the one or more communication interfaces  may deliver the targeted messages  via SMS text messaging. Some embodiments use an infrastructure that only supports SMS delivery via email-to-SMS gateways. However, other embodiments may either use direct SMS delivery mechanisms or partner with SMS delivery providers to deliver messages via this format. In certain embodiments, even where the traveler (or travel agency) has setup a profile option to have messages of certain classes and\/or priority levels forwarded through email and\/or SMS text messaging, those messages still appear as highlighted icons in an itinerary display (in addition to being delivered via email and\/or SMS text messaging).","In addition, or in other embodiments, the one or more communication interfaces  deliver the targeted messages  and\/or icons to mobile devices using push technologies (e.g., Apple\u00ae Push Notification Service). The one or more communication interfaces  may use other message delivery platforms including, but not limited to, interactive TV, hotel kiosks, and automotive GPS systems. In each of these cases, the messages may be displayed in a format similar to the mobile or web-based itinerary displays, using the icons to notify the user of applicable messages. The one or more communication interfaces  may also use RSS (really simple syndication) to deliver the targeted messages  in certain embodiments. The one or more communication interfaces  may also deliver the targeted messages  to a user's social network (e.g., Facebook\u00ae, MySpace\u00ae, etc.) according to certain embodiments.","Some targeted messages  may apply to a particular flight segment or airport regardless of other itinerary elements and may be published even with simple segment-based flight status queries or queries for airport information. For example, the itinerary messaging system  may include a notification icon with flight status results indicating that additional details or messages are available. Airlines may send explanatory messages along with an updated estimated departure time for a flight, for example. Airports may also send messages that apply to all passengers as well as non-travelers (e.g., friends, family, drivers, etc.) who will be visiting the airport during a specified time interval.","As discussed above, the itinerary messaging system  may allow travelers to create \u201cuser-generated\u201d events that can provide additional detail on the status of their trip that is not available through publicly available flight status information. For example, users may be able to easily click a button or icon on their itinerary display to indicate that they have checked into their hotel, that they have cleared customs, or even just to report their current position (e.g., as a Latitude and Longitude). Some mobile client applications may even be configured to automatically generate position report updates on a regular basis. The user generated events may also provide additional criteria for message targeting. As travelers get used to initiating user-generated events, the itinerary messaging system  may use those user-generated events in the message targeting rules. For example, a security company may want to provide customs instructions to any traveler who is arriving at a certain airport or country but has not yet cleared customs.","A few simple example scenarios illustrate how the itinerary messaging system  may be used.","A. Scenario #1: Airport Advisories","In this example scenario, DFW airport (Dallas\/Fort Worth International Airport) has construction going on at one of its terminals that is causing major traffic backups at the departures and curb-side check-in area. Using the itinerary messaging system , the DFW airport authority can send a message to every traveler whose itinerary indicates that they are departing from DFW within a certain range of dates and times, and advising them to use a special shuttle service available from the short-term parking lot. All travelers whose itineraries indicate that they are departing from DFW during the affected period see an alert icon displayed next to their itinerary. A traveler may also elect to receive email notification if he or she chooses to receive the messages that way, but the itinerary messaging system  notification may simply appear as an icon next to their itinerary (or next to a DFW departure segment) indicating that a message that is significant to this itinerary is available for viewing. Travelers who are connecting through DFW do not receive the message because they are not affected by the traffic delays.","Notice that DFW does not need to know the email addresses or any contact information for any of these travelers. They simply submit the message via a secure itinerary messaging system web site, along with a priority and message type, and specify the conditions for delivery (e.g., they may specify targeting rules that the message be delivered to all travelers departing from DFW between specified dates and times). Also, travelers or other interested parties (such as a spouse or driver) will see this same message if they query for flights that arrive or depart through DFW during the specified time interval, or if they view airport information pages for DFW during the specified time interval.","B. Scenario #2: Traveler Security Alerts","In another example scenario, if a corporate travel manager or a company's security company becomes aware of a potential security threat, such as criminal activity, terrorist threat, health advisory or natural disaster in a particular city or area, the travel manager or security company can use the itinerary messaging system  to send an advisory to all their travelers who currently are, or will be arriving in that city within the next 24 hours. The security company or travel manager simply sends the message to all travelers within their \u201caccount\u201d (i.e., the travelers they manage) whose itineraries indicate that they either are in, or will be in the affected area within the next 24 hours. Because this is a high priority message, the icon displayed next to the itinerary may be flashing to indicate a high-priority message is available. The security company or travel manager may also have the option of sending an email in addition to the targeted message displayed in the itinerary context. Both are handled by the itinerary messaging system , based on the knowledge of the traveler's itineraries and having their contact information within the itinerary database.","C. Scenario #3: Special Offers within a Connecting Airport","In another example scenario, an airport restaurant at ORD airport (Chicago O'Hare International Airport) may wish to attract customers by offering a special discount to travelers who are connecting through ORD with connection times longer than 90 minutes. These travelers will often be looking for a way to \u201ckill time\u201d in the airport and are very likely to respond to such targeted specials. Some travelers have itineraries with long connect times planned into their original itineraries. Other travelers may have extended connect times due to delays in outbound flights or due to missed connections. Because the itinerary messaging system  has both the traveler's itinerary plan and real-time flight status information, the itinerary messaging system  is able to identify travelers who will be at ORD waiting more than 90 minutes for a connection, even if their original itinerary did not include a long connection time. These travelers may see a special offer icon next to their displayed itinerary.

Scenario #4: Airline Alert Message","As another example scenario, airlines often do not have the contact information for all the passengers on their flights. When passengers book through a travel agency, the agency may choose not to share the full contact information with the airline, in order to protect their relationship with the customer. When a problem develops on a flight, the airline's only option is usually to publish the new estimated departure time through normal flight status channels. That information may eventually be relayed to the customers who have access to flight status information, but the airline cannot include any comments or suggestions to the passengers. Travelers report the frustration experienced with incrementally increasing delays where little information is shared beyond people standing directly around the boarding gate area.","The itinerary messaging system  provides a new communication channel the airlines can use to better serve their customers when unusual situations develop, even the passengers for which the airline does not have any contact information. Using the itinerary messaging system , the airline can send a message to passengers that are departing on a particular flight segment on a specified date. While the airline does not have the contact information for some passengers booked through agencies, the itinerary messaging system  is more likely to have that contact information because agencies can share it without compromising their proprietary customer data. Everyone wins in this scenario. The travel agency's customer is better served, the airline is better able to communicate with passengers, and the passengers have more useful information to help them make decisions about their travel experience.","The examples herein illustrate that the itinerary messaging system  offers unique value in messaging delivery that is not available through other channels. For example, the targeted messages  can be extremely specifically targeted where only travelers who fit the criteria specified receive the message. Further, the targeted messages  are displayed directly in the context of the itinerary where they make the most sense. Thus, high priority travel messages do not get lost in a high volume of other email. Also, the itinerary messaging system  may be a complement to email and SMS text messaging. The itinerary messaging system  may have email addresses or mobile phone numbers for most travelers or for their travel arrangers, so messages can be delivered in any combination as icons on the itinerary, via SMS text messaging, and\/or via email, depending on traveler preference and message priority. Travelers can also be assured that the targeted messages  are of high value because messages can be very specifically targeted and subscribers may pay for message delivery based on volume, so there may be an incentive to use the channel appropriately. Travelers may also have the option to hide message icons of specific types or importance levels, increasing the value of the messages.","The itinerary messaging system  may receive the messages and associated targeting rules  from many different types of message sources. Such message sources include, for example, travel agencies, travel suppliers (e.g., airline, hotel, car rental companies, cruise lines, etc.), security companies, airports, government security agencies such as the Transportation Security Agency (TSA), travel managers and\/or travel arrangers, advertisers (e.g., airport concession businesses, other businesses associated with the travel industry, and\/or other business not associated with the travel industry), local chambers of commerce or business associations, FlightStats.com (a website providing real-time and historical flight status information), and\/or friends and family of travelers.","The itinerary messaging system  may deliver many different types of messages, which may be classified into different categories. Each of the message categories may be represented by a unique icon on the itinerary display.  is a table illustrating example message types and associated categories according to one embodiment. A travel warning or advisory category  may be associated with information about a security threat in a particular hotel or region of a city. An airline or flight status category  may be associated with delayed, canceled, or missed flights. An airport category  may be associated with delays at an airport where the traveler is departing, arriving or connecting. A traffic and\/or parking category  may be associated with traffic and parking advisories. A promotional offer category  may be associated with, for example, an electronic discount coupon for all travelers connecting through a particular airport with a minimum amount of time available before their departure. A ground transportation category  may be associated with ground transportation advisories. A user messages category  may be associated with, for example, traveler messages regarding particular itinerary segments or personal greetings or informational messages to an individual traveler or small group of travelers from a travel agent, or friends and family. A weather category  may be associated with, for example, a warning about an expected ice storm that may affect travelers in a particular city or area. Although not illustrated, persons having skill in the art will recognize other categories such as a travel information or suggestions category associated with, for example, a message from a cruise line giving arriving passengers information about where to meet their ground transportation to the ship. As yet another example, an emergency messages category may be associated with, for example, a message informing a traveler of an immediate need to return to the office as the result of an emergency situation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","810","800","812","800","814","800","816","818"]},"In some embodiments, as mentioned above, identifying the subset of itineraries is further based on a comparison of the subset of targeting rules with real-time travel status information associated with one or more of the itinerary segments. A targeting rule might require, for example, matching all itineraries with a connection time longer than 90 minutes. In such an example, itineraries with scheduled connections of longer than 90 minutes may or may not match depending on the status of the incoming and outbound flights. Itineraries with connections that were scheduled to only be 60 minutes, but experience a delay in the outbound flight that makes the connection longer than 90 minutes would then match the targeting rule based on the real-time travel status information.","Each of a plurality of predetermined message categories may be associated with a different icon. In such embodiments, communicating the indication of the availability of the message includes displaying, in the context of the respective itinerary, an icon associated with the message category of the received request.","In one embodiment, communicating the indication of the availability of the message further includes transmitting a command for displaying the icon associated with the message category of the received request to a mobile user device. The transmitted command may instruct the mobile user device to display the icon along with the associated itinerary. In another embodiment, communicating the indication of the availability of the message includes displaying the along with the associated itinerary on a web page accessible by the corresponding traveler. In another embodiment, communicating the indication of the availability of the message includes transmitting data for displaying the icon to a remote kiosk.","In certain embodiments, the icon may be modified to indicate a number of messages within the category available to the corresponding traveler. In addition, or in other embodiments, the icon may be modified to indicate the priority level of the message.","In one embodiment, communicating the message includes transmitting the message and an itinerary identification number to a travel agency associated with the corresponding traveler.","In one embodiment, communicating the indication of the availability of the message to the one or more travelers includes transmitting the message and an itinerary identification number to a travel agency associated with the corresponding traveler.","One embodiment further includes communicating the message in response to a request for flight status information.","In one embodiment, classifying the message includes defining a plurality of message types, and assigning each of the plurality of message types to a respective category. Each category includes at least one message type, and at least one category includes a plurality of message types. Classifying the message further includes assigning a priority to each message type, and determining the message type of the requested message.","In addition, or in another embodiment, classifying the message may further include identifying a message source corresponding to the requested message, wherein the message source is associated with a predetermined subset of the plurality of message types. The identified message source may be selected from the group comprising a travel agency, an airline, a cruise line, a ground transportation company, a hotel, an airport authority, an airport concession operator, a government agency, a private security company, a travel manager, a business association, a chamber of commerce, a traveler, and a designated friend or family member of the corresponding traveler.","In one embodiment, the method further includes receiving message delivery preferences from travelers. The message delivery preferences define rules for blocking display of an icon associated with the message category in the context of the associated itinerary. The message delivery preferences may further define rules for directly delivering notifications to the respective travelers of the message, the notifications being pushed from the itinerary messaging system to user devices associated with the respective travelers. Pushing the notifications may include communicating the notifications using at least one of email, text messaging, and a push notification service. Further, the notifications may be communicated from the itinerary messaging system to a third-party device for display outside the context of the associated itineraries. The third-party display device may be located, for example, in at least one of a hotel lobby and an airport.","In one embodiment, identifying the subset of itineraries further includes identifying, through the comparison, segment parameters within the subset of itineraries specified by the targeting rules, the segment parameters including one or more parameters selected from the group comprising arrival airport, departing airport, operating airline, airport terminal, flight connection information, flight status information, and geographic region of travel.","In one embodiment, the method further includes providing two-way structured communication between a travel agent and a traveler through the itinerary messaging system, the two-way structured communication allowing the traveler to request a change to an itinerary.","As discussed above, the itinerary display  shown in  includes a plurality of icons  associated with respective message categories. The icons  provide for \u201ccompressing\u201d information regarding a potentially large number of messages into a small screen area.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","900"]},"A. Context View","In one embodiment, itinerary messages are displayed in a \u201ccontextual view\u201d such that users interact with the messages in the context of a flight, itinerary, flight listing, or airport information screen. The context determines which messages are displayed based on the specific targeting rules associated with individual messages. An itinerary display having a contextual view may allow multiple messages to span multiple categories by compressing information into limited space while providing visual cues to the user as to message content.","In one embodiment, a fixed or static icon bar displays an entire set of icons. Icons for categories with no available messages are displayed in a dimmed or disabled state. The itinerary messages window , according to certain embodiments, is a fixed icon bar. When a user touches one of the icons  or the entire itinerary messages window , the itinerary display  either expands to display all messages or switches to a new screen that displays messages in a list view pattern.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 10A","FIG. 9","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10A"],"b":["1000","1010","1010","900","900","900","562","1000","1012","900","1010","900"]},"In another embodiment, a dynamic icon list displays only icons for which there are active messages. In certain such embodiments, this results in fewer icons. For mobile applications, the number of icons displayed may be limited to a small number to thereby reduce screen space requirements and\/or icon clutter. When there are messages spanning a number of categories that exceeds the maximum number allowed by the design, a \u201cmore messages\u201d button or link may be used. In this case, display preference may be given to those categories that include high priority messages over categories that do not have any high-priority messages. By way of example,  graphically illustrates a user interface  for an itinerary display including a dynamic icon bar  in the context of a flight status website according to one embodiment.","In another embodiment, a badge or button is displayed to signal to a user that messages are waiting. When the user selects the button, either a popup or navigation to another screen reveals a static icon bar or dynamic icon list as described above. Adding the number of messages and highest level of importance alongside the button enhances the user experience.
