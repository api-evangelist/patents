title: Activation systems for inflatable personal restraint systems
abstract: Systems for indicating the status of a seatbelt buckle prior to a protective response are disclosed herein. An airbag activation system configured in accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure includes a normally closed magnetically operated reed switch. The reed switch is attached to a connector carried on one portion of a seatbelt, and a magnet is attached to a buckle carried on another portion of the seatbelt. Coupling the connector to the buckle causes the magnetic field of the magnet to move the reed switch from the normally closed position to an open position, thereby enabling the activation system to inflate the airbag in the event of an accident.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/174,659, filed Jun. 30, 2011, and entitled \u201cINFLATABLE PERSONAL RESTRAINT SYSTEMS,\u201d which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/516,681, filed Apr. 5, 2011, and entitled \u201cAIRBAG SYSTEM WITH WIRELESS DIAGNOSTICS\u201d which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. The subject matter of the following U.S. patent applications and U.S. patents are incorporated into the present application in their entireties by reference: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/227\/392, filed concurrently herewith, and entitled \u201cBUCKLE CONNECTORS FOR INFLATABLE PERSONAL RESTRAINTS AND ASSOCIATED METHODS OF USE AND MANUFACTURE,\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/170,079, filed Jun. 27, 2011, and entitled \u201cSENSORS FOR DETECTING RAPID DECELERATION\/ACCELERATION EVENTS;\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/086,134, filed Apr. 13, 2011, and entitled \u201cSTITCH PATTERNS FOR RESTRAINT-MOUNTED AIRBAGS AND ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS AND METHODS;\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 5,984,350; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,442,807.","The following disclosure relates generally to inflatable personal restraint systems, and more specifically to systems for determining the status of an inflatable personal restraint system.","Various types of seat belt and airbag systems have been used to protect passengers in automobiles, aircraft and other vehicles. In automobiles, airbags typically deploy from the steering column, dashboard, side panel, and\/or other fixed location. During a rapid deceleration event (e.g., a collision), a sensor detects the event and transmits a corresponding signal to an initiation device (e.g., a pyrotechnic device) on an airbag inflator. Initiation causes the inflator to release compressed gas into the airbag via a hose, thereby rapidly inflating the airbag. There are a number of different types of inflators known in the art. Some inflators contain compressed gas (e.g., air, nitrogen, helium, argon, etc.). Other inflators (e.g., gas generating devices) provide high pressure gas via chemical reaction of an energetic propellant.","Airbags can be deployed in a number of positions around the vehicle passenger or driver. Airbags positioned in the steering column, for example, can inflate in front of the driver to cushion his head and torso from forward impact. Airbags can also reduce the likelihood of whiplash.","Although airbags that deploy from stationary locations (e.g., a steering column) may be effective in automobiles, they may not be as effective in other types of vehicles having other seating arrangements. Seats in commercial passenger aircraft, for example, can be configured in a variety of layouts that provide different spacing between succeeding rows and adjacent seats. Moreover, such layouts may lack the availability of stationary structures upon which to mount airbags. Additionally, seatbacks in aircraft may rotate forward and downward during a crash or similar event, and thus may be unsuitable for airbag storage. As a result, airbags have been developed that deploy from seatbelts to accommodate occupants in aircraft and other vehicles. Such airbags can deploy from, for example, a lap belt and\/or a shoulder belt to provide additional protection during a crash or other rapid deceleration event. Such airbag systems are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,984,350, which is owned by the assignee of the present application and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.","Seatbelt airbag systems generally utilize electronic activation systems and circuitry to facilitate or enhance their protective features. It is generally desirable in such systems to ensure that the airbag does not inadvertently inflate when it is not needed, such as when a person is not present in the associated seat. At the same time, of course, systems designed to prevent inadvertent inflation should not prevent inflation when the seat is occupied and inflation is desired. For these reasons, various types of airbag activation systems have been developed that include means for determining whether a seatbelt connector and corresponding buckle have been engaged (i.e., to determine the \u201cbuckle status\u201d), and thereby determine whether or not the seat is occupied. One such system utilizes a \u201cnormally open\u201d reed switch in cooperation with a magnet. In general, the reed switch is mounted to the connector on one portion of the seatbelt, and the magnet is mounted to the buckle on the other portion of the seat belt. When the connector and the buckle are joined together to buckle the seatbelt, the magnet closes the reed switch. Closing the reed switch closes a corresponding electrical circuit that enables power to be provided for airbag initiation in the event of a crash.","The following disclosure describes various embodiments of activation systems for use with airbags and other restraint systems, and associated methods of manufacture and use. Certain details are set forth in the following description and  to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the disclosure. Other details describing well-known structures and systems often associated with activation systems, reed switches, and airbag systems, however, are not set forth below to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the various embodiments of the disclosure.","Many of the details and features shown in the Figures are merely illustrative of particular embodiments of the disclosure. Accordingly, other embodiments can have other details and features without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that further embodiments can be practiced without several of the details described below. Furthermore, various embodiments of the disclosure can include structures other than those illustrated in the Figures and are expressly not limited to the structures shown in the Figures. Moreover, the various elements and features illustrated in the Figures may not be drawn to scale.","In the Figures, identical reference numbers identify identical, or at least generally similar, elements. To facilitate the discussion of any particular element, the most significant digit or digits of any reference number refer to the Figure in which that element is first introduced. Element , for example, is first introduced and discussed with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["112","100","100","112","112","116","114","112","118"]},"In another aspect of the illustrated embodiment, the restraint system  includes an airbag assembly  carried on a seatbelt . More specifically, in the illustrated embodiment the seatbelt  includes a first web portion and a corresponding second web portion . A proximal end portion of the first web portion can be fixably attached to the seat mounting structure  by means of a hook  or other suitable device known in the art. A proximal end portion of the second web portion can be similarly attached to the mounting structure  on the opposite side of the seat . A distal end portion of the first web portion can carry a first coupler, such as a connector assembly or connector  having a tongue portion. Similarly, a distal end portion of the second web portion can carry a corresponding second coupler, such as a buckle assembly or buckle  configured to receive and releasably engage the tongue portion of the connector  to couple the two web portions , , together around a seat occupant (not shown) in a conventional manner. In certain embodiments, the connector  and the buckle  can be configured to operate in a manner that is at least generally similar to conventional connector\/buckle assemblies found on conventional seatbelts. As described in greater detail below, in other embodiments the connector  and the buckle  can include features that preclude the connector  or the buckle  from being inadvertently joined to a different buckle or connector, respectively.","In a further aspect of the illustrated embodiment, the airbag assembly  includes an airbag  that is attached to the first web portion generally proximate the connector . In one embodiment, for example, the airbag  can be fastened to the first web portion using the methods and systems disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/086,134, which was filed Apr. 13, 2011 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In , the airbag  is illustrated in the nondeployed configuration in which it is folded and neatly stowed beneath a flexible and durable cover . The cover  encloses the airbag  and the first web portion and extends from a back shell  on the connector  to proximate the hook . The cover  includes one or more tear seams (not shown) which are designed to rupture upon airbag inflation enabling the airbag  to fully inflate.","In another aspect of the illustrated embodiment, the airbag assembly  further includes an inflator hose  having a first end portion in fluid communication with the interior of the airbag , and a second end portion that carries a coupling . The coupling  is configured to be operably (e.g., threadably) engaged with an outlet of an airbag inflator . Various types of inflators can be used with the airbag systems described herein. In certain embodiments, the inflator  can include a stored gas canister that contains compressed gas (e.g., compressed air, nitrogen, argon, helium, etc.) that can be released upon electrical initiation of a corresponding pyrotechnic device (e.g., a squib). Suitable inflators can be provided by, for example, Autoliv Inc. of Ogden Technical Center 3350 Airport Road Ogden, Utah, USA 84405. In other embodiments, other suitable inflator devices can be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Such inflator devices can include, for example, gas generator devices that generate high pressure gas through a rapid chemical reaction of an energetic propellant. Accordingly, the present disclosure is not limited to a particular type of inflator device.","In yet another aspect of the illustrated embodiment, the airbag assembly  includes a seatbelt switch  carried on the web connector . As described in greater detail below, in one embodiment of the present disclosure the seatbelt switch  is a \u201cnormally closed\u201d switch (e.g., a normally closed reed switch) that \u201copens\u201d when the connector  is engaged with the buckle . The opening of the reed switch  can be effectuated by a magnet (not shown) carried on the buckle . When the connector  is properly engaged with the buckle , the reed switch  is moved into the field of the magnet, thereby causing the switch to open. When the reed switch  is closed (i.e., when the connector  is not engaged with the buckle ), the reed switch  completes a circuit comprised of a first pair of wires including a first wire or lead and a second wire or lead . The first and second wires , terminate in an electrical connector . A second pair of wires and also terminates in the electrical connector . A distal end portion of the second pair of wires  carries an electrical connector  operably coupled to an initiation device (e.g., a squib or other ignitor; not shown) on the inflator .","In a further aspect of the illustrated embodiment, the airbag system  includes an electronic module assembly (EMA)  for controlling initiation and deployment of the airbag  during a rapid deceleration event (e.g., a crash) of sufficient magnitude. The EMA  is operably coupled to the airbag assembly  via a cable assembly . The cable assembly  includes a first connector  that is plugged in to the EMA  and a second connector  that provides a receptacle for the airbag electrical connector . In the illustrated embodiment, the EMA  includes a microprocessor  that receives electrical power from a power source  (e.g., one or more lithium batteries). Though shown schematically, the EMA  can include a protective housing that contains the various electronics, circuitry, and associated devices contained within. When employed in, for example, a commercial aircraft, the EMA  can be mounted to a rigid structure beneath the seat .","In another aspect of the illustrated embodiment, the EMA  includes a sensor  that detects rapid deceleration along a particular axis (e.g., an axis of forward motion of the vehicle). Moreover, in this embodiment the sensor  can include two individual sensor switches aligned with a common axis for additional safety as will be explained below. The sensor switches can be virtually any type of suitable switch known in the art for responding to a rapid deceleration (or acceleration) event, including magnetically activated reed switches and\/or hall effect switches. In one embodiment, for example, the sensor switches can be at least generally similar in structure and function to the sensor switches in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/170,079, filed Jun. 27, 2011, and entitled, \u201cSENSORS FOR DETECTING RAPID DECELERATION\/ACCELERATION EVENTS,\u201d which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.","In operation, if the vehicle experiences a crash or other rapid deceleration event above a preset magnitude, the sensor switches in the sensor  close and complete their corresponding circuits. One of the sensor switches causes the microprocessor  to detect the occurrence of a crash event. Upon confirming that the connector  is operably engaged with the buckle  (e.g., by confirming that the seatbelt switch  is in the open position, as described further below), the microprocessor  sends a corresponding signal to a deployment circuit . Upon receiving a signal from the microprocessor , the deployment circuit  completes a circuit to the ignitor that causes the inflator to discharge its compressed gas into the airbag  via the hose  and inflate the airbag  to provide the seat occupant (not shown) with additional protection during the crash event.","The foregoing discussion provides a high level overview of some of the structures and functions of the airbag restraint system  in accordance with one embodiment of the present technology. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that various aspects and features of the various subsystems of the airbag system  described above can be utilized in combination with other systems without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. For example, in certain embodiments the airbag assembly  described above can be used with an EMA that, rather than including a microprocessor, can simply include a power source and a crash sensor that completes a circuit to activate an inflator during a crash event. Moreover, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the EMA  of the illustrated embodiment includes a number of other components and features for, e.g., diagnostics, redundancy, etc., which have not been described herein to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the general description of various embodiments of the present technology.","Moreover, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that additional airbag assemblies  (e.g., a second and third airbag assembly) can be operably coupled to the EMA  for use with the other seats in the row adjacent to the seat . Accordingly, in one embodiment, if a row of seats in an aircraft includes three seats, each seat could be outfitted with a seatbelt airbag assembly as described above, with each of the airbag assemblies coupled to an individual inflator as illustrated in . All three of the airbag assemblies, however, can be initiated by the single EMA .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["120","132","127","130","122","126","122","124","122","202","126","124"],"i":["a","a","b"]},"As previously mentioned, multiple airbag assemblies  can be installed in a row of seats in an aircraft. In other embodiments, however, an airbag assembly  may be installed in a seat adjacent to another seat having a conventional seat belt without an airbag. In such an embodiment, it is desirable to ensure that the connector  and the buckle  can only be engaged with each other, and not with a buckle or a connector of another seatbelt. In the illustrated embodiment, the connector  and the buckle  are \u201ckeyed\u201d to prevent either the connector  or the buckle  from being engaged with an unintended connector or buckle that is not keyed. For example, the connector backshell  includes a first back sloped or angled edge and a second back sloped edge . The buckle  includes a complimentary first forward sloped edge and a complimentary second forward sloped edge . The back sloped edges  and the forward sloped edges  are shaped to allow the tongue portion  to be fully inserted into the buckle . A seatbelt connector having vertical edges, or edges with other shapes, in place of the forward sloped edges  would prevent the full insertion of the corresponding tongue portion into the buckle . Similarly, a seatbelt buckle having vertical edges in place of the back sloped edges  would prevent the full insertion of the tongue portion  into the buckle. Accordingly, the keyed connector  and the keyed buckle  prevent inadvertent engagement of either the buckle  or the connector  with a non-keyed buckle or connectors.","Although the illustrated embodiment is keyed with the forward sloped edges  and the back sloped edges , other embodiments may include other features for preventing inadvertent engagement with foreign buckles or connectors. Raised portions on the tongue portion , for example, may engage a groove on the buckle . In another embodiment, an offset edge on the connector  can be engaged with a corresponding slot on the buckle . The offset edge and the corresponding slot can be configured in accordance with the systems and methods of U.S. Pat. No. 6,442,807, filed Mar. 13, 2000, and entitled, \u201cAIRBAG BUCKLE ASSEMBLY,\u201d which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Accordingly, other embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure may include keyed features that have differing shapes and\/or sizes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["124","310","312","302","304","310","306","308","124","126","124","202","124","126","124","304","310","202","124","205","126","124"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["120","202","408","410","412","122","412","122","408","404","404","408","406","402","134","402","406","136","402","406","132","127","406"],"i":["a ","a ","a ","b "]},"In one embodiment, the components and features of the connector  can be at least generally similar in structure and function to the corresponding components and features disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.

When the seatbelt  is buckled, the seatbelt switch  is positioned sufficiently close to the magnet  to expose the seatbelt switch  to the magnetic field of the magnet . The magnetic field urges the metal reed  away from the contact and into contact with the contact , as shown in , thereby moving the seatbelt switch  from the normally closed position to an open position. As described above, in the event of a crash, the microprocessor  determines whether the seatbelt  is buckled by determining that there is an open circuit with the seatbelt switch . Accordingly, in the event of a crash, the seatbelt switch  provides an indication that the seatbelt  is buckled (i.e., the switch is open), and the microprocessor  sends a corresponding signal to the deployment circuit  to cause inflation of the airbag .","A failure of the wiring or the connections between the seatbelt switch  and the EMA  would likely result in an open circuit. One advantage of some embodiments of the present disclosure is that in the event of a detected crash during such a failure, the EMA  would determine that the circuit was open and would still initiate deployment of the airbag . Hence, the present design allows for deployment of the airbag , even with a wiring or connector failure in the seatbelt switch circuit.","Another advantage of some embodiments of the present disclosure is the ability to test the electrical circuitry of the personal restraint system  without having to first buckle the seatbelt . This is possible because the normally closed switch  enables the processor  to check the circuit through the seatbelt switch  while the seatbelt  is unbuckled. If the circuit is open, it is likely an indication of a fault in the seatbelt switch  or the wires . If the circuit is closed, it is indicative of the functionality of the seatbelt switch  and the wires . Decreasing the time required for testing decreases maintenance costs for the system. In contrast, the seatbelt must first be buckled to check the seatbelt switch and associated wiring in other airbag systems having normally open switches. This requires a technician to buckle the seatbelts prior to the testing procedure, which can be very time consuming on an aircraft with a large number of seats.","From the foregoing it will be appreciated that specific embodiments have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the various embodiments of the disclosure. Hence, although the illustrated embodiment includes a magnetically operated reed switch , it is within the scope of the present disclosure to include other types of switches, including other types of magnetically operated switches, such as a Hall effect sensor. As is known in the art, a Hall effect sensor varies its output voltage in response to a change in the magnetic field, and can therefore operate as a switch. In such an embodiment, the operation would be substantially similar to the above described embodiments. However, rather than checking for an open circuit, the processor  would verify that the output voltage of the Hall effect switch was not equal to a value that occurs when the magnet  is proximate the Hall effect switch.","Additionally, a non-magnetically activated switch, such as a spring loaded toggle switch or a button switch, may be used. In one such embodiment, the toggle switch can be moved from a normally closed position to an open position by a mechanical interface with the buckle . For example, the toggle switch could be mounted at a position on the connector  such that when the tongue portion  of the connector  is inserted into the buckle , a portion of the buckle  moves the toggle switch from a closed position to an open position. Further, while various advantages and features associated with certain embodiments of the disclosure have been described above in the context of those embodiments, other embodiments may also exhibit such advantages and\/or features, and not all embodiments need necessarily exhibit such advantages and\/or features to fall within the scope of the disclosure. Accordingly, the disclosure is not limited, except as by the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
