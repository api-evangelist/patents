title: Sonoelastographic shear velocity imaging using crawling wave excitation
abstract: Vibration sources are applied to a body or other object to image a region of interest. The mechanical vibrations introduced by the sources interfere in the region of interest to produce a crawling wave, which is detected by an ultrasound probe A relationship between crawling wave phase derivatives and local shear wave velocity is derived with phase derivatives estimated using either one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) autocorrelation-based techniques to image the region of interest.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/901,643, filed Feb. 16, 2007, whose disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure.","The work leading to the present invention was supported by NIH Grant No. 5 R01 AG16317-05. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention is directed to sonoelastography and more particularly to sonoelastography using interfering shear waves to produce crawling waves.","Vibrational sonoelastography is a tissue elasticity imaging technique, developed at the University of Rochester, which estimates the amplitude response of tissues under harmonic mechanical excitation using ultrasonic Doppler techniques. Due to a mathematical relationship between particle vibrational response and received Doppler spectral variance, low frequency (50 to 500 Hz) and low amplitude (1 to 100 \u03bcm) shear waves propagating in tissue can be visualized using sonoelastography to detect regions of abnormal stiffness. Low frequency shear waves are used because they are much less attenuated (due to damping mechanisms) than at higher frequencies. Furthermore, given the shear moduli distribution typically encountered in soft tissue (more than four orders of magnitude), corresponding wavelengths reside in the useful range of millimeters.","Recently, it was shown that interfering shear waves produce slowly propagating interference patterns with an apparent velocity much less than (but proportional to) the underlying true shear velocity. Termed crawling waves, they are generated using a pair of mechanical sources vibrating at slightly offset frequencies or by continuously phase shifting one of the source excitation signals.","Sonoelastographic imaging of interference patterns has been used for estimation of the shear velocity of homogeneous biomaterials. However, before the present invention, it had not been used for imaging of heterogeneous biomaterials.","It is therefore an object of the invention to achieve such imaging.","To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention is directed to a novel real-time sonoelastographic technique for estimating local shear velocities from crawling wave images. Specifically, a relationship between crawling wave phase derivatives and local shear wave velocity is derived with phase derivatives estimated using either one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) autocorrelation-based techniques. In comparison, the 1D sonoelastographic shear velocity estimator has the advantage of being computationally simple, whereas the 2D estimation technique provides enhanced performance in terms of minimizing noise artifacts. Thus, a fundamental tradeoff between computational time and estimator performance distinguishes these two dedicated shear velocity estimation and imaging algorithms.","The shear wave interference patterns can be visualized in real-time using sonoelastographic imaging techniques. In general, crawling wave images describe shear wave propagation patterns and allow local estimation of shear velocity distributions. Assuming that the local shear velocity values are proportional to the square root of the shear modulus, spatial mapping of either parameter allows production of quantitative tissue elasticity images.","The experimental setup is centered on an ultrasound scanner modified for sonoelastographic imaging that allows real-time visualization of crawling wave sonoelastograms. Furthermore, sonoelastographic data, either image or demodulated data sets (i.e. in-phase and quadrature signals), are utilized for processing shear velocity sonoelastograms.","Two or more (preferably two) vibration sources are utilized to excite shear wave propagation and to generate shear wave interference patterns (i.e., crawling waves). These sources (or active vibration regions) are placed in appropriate locations, such as in direct contact with opposing lateral boundaries of the biomaterial with the long axis (and induced shear vibration) parallel to, and in line with, the desired image plane (governed by transducer positioning). Vibration can be achieved in a variety of ways, e.g., using external vibration sources in contact with the tissue, or using an acoustic radiation force on each side of the region of interest to generate the interference patterns. A two-channel signal generator produces two monochrome low frequency signals that are typically amplified before being input to the vibration sources. Introducing a frequency offset or phase shifting one of the vibration excitation signals allows spatial translation of shear wave interference patterns (i.e., crawling waves) across the image plane. If the delta frequency of the vibration sources becomes zero or very small, then the crawling wave becomes a fixed interference pattern. Such a fixed interference pattern can also be used with the 1D and 2D estimators of the present invention.","Additional disclosure is found in the following publications, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties into the present disclosure:\n\n","Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be set forth in detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like elements or steps throughout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B","b":["100","102","104","106","108","106","110","110","112","114","108","100","106","112","104","110","102"]},"Shear wave interference displacement fields u(m, n) excited using a pair of monochromatic mechanical sources can be expressed as standing wave patterns:\n\n()=2exp(\u2212\u03b1)[cos (2)+cos(2)]\u2003\u2003(1)\n","where m and n are integer values denoting row and column matrix indices (i.e., spatial coordinates), respectively, A is the excitation source amplitude, \u03b1 is the shear wave attenuation coefficient, D is the excitation source separation distance, Tdenotes the spatial sampling interval along the n-axis (i.e., shear wave propagation axis or lateral direction), and kand \u0394kdenote the shear wave number and difference, respectively.
