In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.","Advances in computing technologies and related technologies (e.g., visual display technology, battery technology, etc.) in recent years have greatly facilitated in the development of computing devices having increasingly smaller form factors while still maintaining exceptional processing capabilities. Examples of such computing devices include, for example, laptops, Netbooks, tablet computers (i.e., \u201cslate\u201d computers), e-readers, Smartphones, and so forth. Because of their compactness, such devices are becoming much easier to share among a plurality of users. That is, due to their small form factors, such devices allow users of such devices to physically share such devices with friends, family, co-workers, clients, and so forth, in order to share the content and\/or applications being presented through such devices For example, suppose a user of a tablet computer is reading an electronic book (e.g., an eBook, a digital book, etc.) through the tablet computer. While reading the electronic book, the user comes across an interesting passage that is located on a particular page (e.g., a particular portion) of the electronic book that the user wants to share with a friend sitting across a table from the user. Typically, in order to show the friend the portion (e.g., a page) of the electronic book that was being viewed by the user, the user will simply pass or handover the tablet computer to the friend thereby allowing the friend to view the portion of the electronic book that was being viewed by the user.","Unfortunately by doing so, the user is allowing the friend to obtain control over the tablet computer as well as any electronic items (e.g., the electronic book or any other content\/applications) that may be accessible through the tablet computer. As a result, the user's friend, upon receiving the tablet computer, may scroll through the electronic book to another portion of electronic book or may even close the electronic book. In doing so, the user upon handed back the tablet computer from the friend may not be able to easily find the page (e.g., the portion) of the electronic book that the user was viewing before handing over the tablet computer to the friend.","In accordance with various embodiments, computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture are provided that can determine whether a computing device that was presenting one or more portions of one or more electronic items (herein simply \u201citems\u201d) and that was in possession of a first user has been transferred from the first user to a second user; and to mark (e.g., tag, memorialize, identify, etc.), in response to determining that the computing device has been transferred from the first user to the second user, the one or more portions of the one or more items (e.g., electronic documents, software applications such as gaming and\/or productivity applications, application files, audio files, image files such as digital image folder or album, video files including movies, and so forth) to facilitate the computing device in returning to the one or more portions upon the computing device being at least transferred back to the first user. Note that the marking of the one or more portions of the one or more items does not necessarily require that the one or more items be actually marked as will be described herein. For example, in some cases, the use of pointers that point to the one or more portions may be employed in order to mark the one or more portions of the one or more items. Other ways of indirectly marking the one or more portions of the one or more items will also be described herein.","In some embodiments, the computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture may be further designed to recall the one or more portions of the one or more items based, at least in part, on the marking of the one or more portions of the one or more items, the recalling being in response, at least in part, to determining that the computing device has been transferred back to the first user. In various embodiments, such computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture may be implemented at the computing device.","Referring now to  illustrating a computing device * in the form of a tablet computer in accordance with various embodiments. For the embodiments, the computing device * may have at least a front-side that includes a display device  (e.g., a display monitor such as a touch screen), and a back-side (not visible in ) that is opposite of the front-side . As further illustrated in , the front-side of the computing device * may include a center  (note that in  a center axis has been drawn-in that represents an axis originating from the center  of the front-side of the computing device * and perpendicular to the surface of the front-side of the computing device *). In various embodiments, the front-side of the computing device * may include one or more camera lens or viewing ports  (e.g., one or more viewing ports  for one or more cameras including one or more digital cameras, webcams, infrared cameras, and\/or other types of image capturing devices) and\/or one or more audio ports  (e.g., one or more audio ports for one or more microphones).","Note that although the front-side of the computing device * of  is illustrated as having three viewing ports  for three image capturing devices  (see  and three audio ports  for three audio capturing devices  (see , in alternative embodiments, the front-side may include alternative number of viewing ports  and\/or audio ports  than what is depicted in . Further, and although not shown in , in various embodiments, the backside of the computing device * may also include one or more viewing ports  and\/or audio ports . Note that and illustrate two different implementations of the computing device * of  illustrated in as computing device \u2032 and in as computing device \u2033. Note further that for purposes of the following, \u201c*\u201d represents a wildcard. Thus, references in the following to the \u201ccomputing device *\u201d may be in reference to the computing device * of  as well as to the computing device \u2032 of or the computing device \u2033 of . Although the computing device * illustrated in  is depicted as being a tablet computer, in alternative embodiments, the computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture in accordance with various embodiments may be embodied in other types of computer systems having other form factors including form factors of other types of portable computer devices such as, for example, laptops, Netbooks, Smartphones, e-readers, and so forth.","Referring now to illustrating the computing device * in an exemplary environment  being transferred between two users. As will be further described herein the illustrated computing device * may employ the computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture in accordance with various embodiments. The computing device *, in various embodiments, may be endowed with logic that is designed to determine that the computing device * has been transferred from a first user  to a second user ; and in response to such a determination, automatically marking (e.g., tagging, memorializing, and so forth) one or more portions of one or more items that were being presented by the computing device * when the computing device * was being transferred from the first user  to the second user , the marking of the one or more portions of the one or more items to facilitate the computing device * in returning to the one or more portions upon the computing device * being at least transferred back to the first user . The computing device * or its endowed logic may further be designed to determine that the computing device * has been transferred back to the first user  and based, at least in part, on such a determination as well as based on the marking of the one or more portions of the one or more items, recall (e.g., retrieving, re-presenting, and so forth) the one or more portions of the one or more items. The computing device *, as illustrated again in , includes a display device , such as a touchscreen, on the front side of the computing device *. As further depicted in , the display device  displaying a portion of an exemplary item in the form of an electronic textual document.","There are a number of ways to determine whether a computing device * is or has been transferred from one user to another user. In some cases, for instance, various sensor-provided data may be collected in order to make such a determination. Such data may indicate various environmental aspects surrounding the computing device * and\/or aspects of the computing device * itself (e.g., movements displayed or exhibited by the computing device * as a result of being in contact with one or more users). For example, when the computing device * of  is passed from, for example, the first user  to another user such as the second user , the first user  may make certain recognizable as well as detectable gestures. Such gestures may include, for example, the first user  extending his\/her arms out with the computing device * in one or both hands (e.g., as if to offer the computing device * to the second user ); the first user  passing the computing device * from one hand to another hand, and extending the second hand with the computing device * out and away from the first user ; the first user  rotating the computing device * around using his\/her hands so that the front side of the computing device * faces away from the first user  and faces the second user , who is standing or sitting across from the first user , and so forth. These movements or gestures made by the first user , when detected, may at least infer that the transfer (e.g., change in possession) of the computing device * from a first user  to a second user  has occurred.","One way to track the movements or gestures of the first user  is to track the movements of the computing device * itself (note that another way to detect the gestures of the first user  is to observe visually the gestures made by the first user  via one or more image capturing devices , which will be described in greater detail below). That is, these gestures that may be exhibited by the first user  during the transfer of a computing device * from the first user  to the second user  may cause the computing device * to be spatially moved in particular ways. Thus, in order to detect whether a computing device * is being transferred from a first user  to a second user , one may observe the spatial movements of the computing device * in order to detect signature movements that when detected at least infer the transfer of the computing device * between the first user  and the second user . For example, the computing device * may maintain in its memory  (see and ) a movement library  (see and ), which is a catalog or library that identifies those signature spatial movements that when detected as occurring at least infers (e.g., implies) that a transfer of the computing device * has occurred between two users (e.g., first user  and second user ).","One way to monitor for such movements of the computing device * is to directly detect such movements using one or more \u201cmovement\u201d sensors that are designed to directly detect\/measure spatial movements. Examples of such movement sensors include, for example, inertia sensors, accelerometers (e.g. three-axis or 3D accelerometers), gyroscopes, and so forth. These sensors (herein \u201cmovement\u201d sensors \u2014see which illustrates the one or more types of sensors  that may be included in the computing device * of ) when integrated with a computing device * may be used to directly detect the actual spatial movements\/motions of the computing device * as the computing device * is being transferred from, for example, a first user  to a second user  (or from the second user  back to the first user ).","Since not all movements of the computing device * that may be detected will be as a result of the computing device * being transferred between two users, in various embodiments and as will be further described herein, the computing device * may be endowed with particular logic for determining (e.g., identifying) which movements associated with the computing device * that have been detected indicates or at least suggests that the computing device * is or has been transferred from, for example, a first user  to a second user  and which detected movements may merely be \u201cnoise movements.\u201d","Various types of movements of the computing device * may be tracked in order to determine or at least infer that the computing device * is being transferred between, for example, a first user  and a second user . Examples of the types of movements that may be tracked include, for example, the overall three-dimensional movements of the computing device *, or specific types of movements including tilt type movements, spin-rotation type movements, spatial relocation type movements, vibration movements, and so forth of the computing device *. In order to determine or at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred from a first user  to a second user , these movements of the computing device * may be, individually or in combination, tracked using one or more sensors  that may be included with the computing device * as illustrated in . For example, in various embodiments, one or more movement sensors  (e.g., inertia devices, accelerometers, etc.) that can directly detect movements, and\/or other types of sensors (e.g., image capturing devices , audio capturing devices , etc.) that may be able to indirectly detect movements may be employed in order to track the movements of the computing device * as will be further described herein.","Referring now to illustrating various types of tilts and tilt movements of the computing device * that may be detected and monitored using one or more sensors  (e.g., one or more movement sensors ) in order to, for example, determine or infer that the computing device * has been transferred between two users (e.g., from the first user  to the second user  or from the second user  to the first user ) in accordance with various embodiments. That is, shows the backside of the computing device * and some of the tilt-type movements that may be monitored by the computing device * in order to determine whether the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, a first user  to a second user  (or vice versa). Note that for ease of illustration and understanding the computing device * in (as well as in , , and ) is not drawn to scale at least with respect to the first user  and the second user .","One type of tilt that may be detected\/monitored is tilt of the computing device * that may occur when the computing device * is at least partially rotated around a central horizontal axis . A second type of tilt that may be detected is tilt , which may occur when the computing device * is at least partially rotated around a bottom horizontal axis . Although not depicted, another type of tilt that may occur and that may be monitored is when the computing device * is at least partially rotated around an angular axis that is angular with respect to a horizontal axis (e.g., axis or ) and is parallel to the plane of the backside similar to axis and axis . Yet another type of tilt that may occur and that may also be monitored is when the computing device * is at least partially rotated around a vertical axis . Note that although the vertical axis is depicted as being centered along the backside of the computing device *, just like the horizontal axis , the vertical axis does not have to be centered on the backside and instead, may be offset from the center of the backside of the computing device *(e.g., may be closer to one end of the device rather than an opposite end of the device. Although only a few types of tilts were illustrated in , those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other types of tilts or tilt movements of the computing device * may alternatively or additionally be monitored in various alternative implementations in order to determine whether the computing device * has been transferred between two users.","By detecting that the computing device * has been tilted in a particular manner from a first tilt orientation to a second tilt orientation, a determination or an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user . In particular, when the first user , for example, is handing off or transferring the computing device * to the second user , the first user  may tilt the computing device * in a particular way that may be identifiable. Thus, when the computing device * is being transferred from a first user  to a second user  (or vice versa), the computing device *(or rather the logic endowed with the computing device *) may track the movements of the computing device * as it moves from a first tilt orientation (e.g., the tilt of the computing device * at the beginning of the transfer or when the first user  was using or had possession of the computing device *) to a second tilt orientation (e.g., the tilt of the computing device * at the end of the transfer or when the second user , for example, has obtained possession of the computing device *).","In order to make a determination or inference that a transfer was made between two users such as from the first user  to the second user  (or vice versa), the computing device * or at least the logic endowed in the computing device * may examine the particular movements of the computing device *(e.g., how the computing device * was reoriented from a first tilt orientation to a second tilt orientation including speed and cadence of the reorientation) as the computing device * moves from the first tilt orientation to a second tilt orientation. The computing device * may additionally or alternatively analyze the second tilt orientation (e.g., the tilt of the computing device * after it has finished being reoriented) at least with respect to the first tilt orientation in order to determine or infer that the computing device * has been transferred. To further determine or at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user , for example, the examination\/analysis of the detected tilt movements of the computing device * may involve comparing the detected tilt movements of the computing device * with catalogued or library tilt movements (which may be stored in the memory  of the computing device *) that are identified as being movements associated with transfer of the computing device * between two users.","That is, the computing device * may maintain in its memory  (see and ) a movement library  that may include a catalogue or library of movements including signature tilt movements that have been previously identified as tilt movements that may occur when, for example, a computing device * is transferred between two users (e.g., first user  and second user ). Thus, when tilt movements that match with catalogued or library tilt movements (e.g., signature tilt movements) have been detected, then a determination or at least an inference may be made that a transfer of the computing device * between two users has occurred. Note that the above discussed tilt movements relates to the movement of the computing device * as it moves from a first tilt orientation to a second tilt orientation.","Thus, another aspect of tilt orientation changes that may be considered in order to determine or infer that a transfer has taken place is to simply look at the end points of the tilt reorientation and their differences. In other words, to analyze the first tilt orientation (e.g., the tilt orientation of the computing device * before the computing device * being reoriented) and the second tilt orientation (e.g., the end tilt orientation of the computing device * after it has been reoriented) with respect to each other, and the differences between the first tilt orientation and the second tilt orientation. Thus, in some embodiments, the computing device * may also or additionally maintain a catalogue or library of changes of tilt orientation (e.g., tilt orientation changes) that have been previously identified as tilt changes that occur when, for example, a computing device * is transferred between two users. Such catalogue or library of tilt orientation changes may be stored as part of a movement library  stored in memory  (see and ) of the computing device * of  (e.g., the computing device \u2032 of or the computing device \u2033 of ). Therefore, when tilt orientation changes that match with catalogued or library tilt orientation changes (e.g., as stored in the movement library  of the memory ) have been detected, then at least an inference may be made that a transfer of the computing device * between two users has occurred.","Referring now to illustrating another type of movement of the computing device * that may be detected\/monitored in order to determine or at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred between two users. In particular, shows a couple types of spin rotation and spin rotation movements of the computing device * that may be detected\/monitored using one or more sensors  (e.g., one or more movement sensors ) in order to determine or infer that a transfer of the computing device * has occurred between at least two users. Note that this type of rotation (e.g., spin rotation) is different from the type of rotation associated with the previously described tilt movement where the \u201ctilt\u201d rotation involves the entire backside of the computing device * rotating around some axis in a sweeping motion. In a spin rotation, the backside (or the front side ) of the computing device * substantially spins around an axis without the sweeping motion. Referring back to , which shows some of the various types of spin rotations that may be detected\/monitored by the computing device * in order to, for example, determine whether the computing device * has been transferred between two users such as, for example from a first user  to a second user  (or vice versa). Examples of the type of spin rotations that may be monitored include a spin rotation of the computing device * that occurs when the computing device * is rotated around a center axis that is centered and vertical to the backside of the computing device *. Another type of rotation that may be monitored is a spin rotation of the computing device * that occurs when the computing device * is rotated around a center axis that may be centered but not vertical to the backside of the computing device *. Instead, the center axis is angular to the backside of the computing device * such that when the computing device * is rotating around the center axis , the computing device * will have a constant tilt with respect to the center axis . Another type of rotation that may be monitored is spin rotation of the computing device * that may occur when the computing device * is rotated around an axis that may not be centered on the backside of the computing device and that may not be vertical to the backside of the computing device *.","By detecting that the computing device * has been spin rotated in a particular manner, a determination or an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user . In particular, when the first user  is, for example, handing off or transferring the computing device * to the second user , the first user  may spin rotate the computing device * in a particular way. Thus, when the computing device * is being transferred from, for example, the first user  to the second user , the computing device *(or rather the logic endowed with the computing device *) may track the movements of the computing device * as it moves from a first spin orientation (e.g., the orientation of the computing device * at the beginning of the transfer or when the first user  was using the computing device *) to a second spin orientation (e.g., the orientation of the computing device * at the end of the transfer or when the second user  has obtained possession of the computing device *).","Similar to the tilt or tilt movement detection\/analysis described earlier, in order to make a determination or inference that a transfer was made from, for example, the first user  to the second user  (or vice versa), the computing device * or at least the logic endowed in the computing device * may scrutinize the particular movements of the computing device * as the computing device * spin rotates from a first orientation to a second orientation. The computing device * may additionally or alternatively analyze the second orientation (e.g., the orientation of the computing device * after it has finished being spin rotated) at least with respect to the first orientation (e.g., the orientation of the computing device * before it was spin rotated) in order to determine or at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred.","To further determine or at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user , the examination\/analysis of the detected spin rotation of the computing device * from the first orientation to the second orientation may involve comparing the detected spin rotation movement of the computing device * with catalogued or library spin rotation movements that are identified as being associated with transfer of the computing device *. That is, the computing device * may maintain in its memory  (see and ) a movement library  that may include a catalogue or library of movements including signature spin rotation movements that when detected as occurring may infer that a transfer of the computing device * between two users has occurred.","Turning now to illustrating yet another type of movement of the computing device * that may be detected\/monitored in order to determine or infer that the computing device * has been transferred between two users. In particular, shows the computing device * being relocated by moving from a first spatial location  to a second spatial location  when the computing device * is transferred between two users such as from a first user  to a second user  (or vice versa). In various embodiments, such movements from the first spatial location  to the second spatial location , which will be referred to herein as \u201cspatial relocation movements,\u201d may be detected using one or more sensors  (e.g., one or more movement sensors ). In order to make a determination or inference that a transfer was made from the first user  to the second user , the computing device * or at least the logic endowed in the computing device * may examine\/analyze the particular spatial relocation movements of the computing device * as it moves from the first spatial location  to the second spatial location , and to compare the pattern of spatial relocation movements (e.g., path, speed, acceleration, and so forth) with those catalogued or library signature spatial movements stored in a movement library  that when detected as occurring at least infers that the computing device * has been transferred between at least two users (e.g., between a first user  and a second user ).","In some cases, the computing device *(or rather the logic endowed with the computing device *) may additionally or alternatively analyze the second spatial location  with respect to the first spatial location  in order to determine or at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user . To further determine or at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, the first user  to the second user , the examination\/analysis of the detected spatial relocation movements of the computing device * may be compared with catalogued or library signature spatial relocation movements that have been identified as being associated with the transfer of the computing device  between two users. That is, the computing device * may maintain in its memory  (see and ) a movement library  that may include a catalogue or library of movements including signature spatial movements that when detected as occurring may at least infer that a transfer of the computing device * between two users has occurred.","In some embodiments, in order to determine or at least infer that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user  (or vice versa), the computing device * may be endowed with logic that detects\/monitors vibrations. That is, each user who may come in contact with the computing device * may pass on to the computing device * unique vibration pattern or signature (e.g., as a result of the heartbeat of the \u201ctouching\u201d user). Thus, when the first user  is holding the computing device *, the computing device * may vibrate in a particular vibration pattern that is associated with the first user . In contrast, when the computing device * has been transferred to the second user  and the second user  is holding the computing device *, the computing device * may vibrate in a manner that is associated with the second user . Thus, one way to determine whether the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user  (or vice versa) is to detect\/monitor at least changes in vibrations of the computing device *. In some cases, this may involve the computing device *(or at least the logic endowed with the computing device *) initially detecting the particular vibration pattern of the computing device * when the computing device * is being used by, for example, the first user , and to detect when the computing device * no longer vibrates in such a particular vibration pattern. In order to determine whether the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user , the computing device * in some cases may be further designed to determine that the computing device * is vibrating in a way that matches with a vibration pattern of the second user . By making such a determination, an inference may be made that the computing device * is being held or is in contact with the second user .","In some embodiments, the computing device * may include logic that is designed to determine whether the computing device * has moved away from the first user  in order to determine whether, for example, the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user . That is, by making such a determination, an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user . In some embodiments, in order to make such a determination, data from a combination of sensors  may be processed and analyzed. That is, in order to determine whether the computing device  has moved away from, for example, the first user , a combination of one or more movement sensors  (see  for directly detecting movements of the computing device *, one or more image capturing devices  (e.g., webcam or digital camera), and\/or one or more audio capturing devices  (e.g., microphones) may be employed in order to determine whether the computing device * is moving away from the first user  (and thus, an inference that the computing device * has been transferred to the second user ). For example, the computing device * in some cases may employ one or more movement sensors  to detect the actual movements of the computing device * and one or more image capturing devices  (along with facial recognition system\/application) to determine that a face associated with the first user  is moving away from the computing device *. Based on the data provided by both the movement sensors  and the image capturing devices , at least an inference may be made that the computing device * has moved away from the first user *.","In some embodiments, and as illustrated in , rather than only detecting\/monitoring for a particular type of movement (e.g., tilt-type movements, spin rotation movements, spatial relocation movements, vibration movements, and so forth) the computing device * may be endowed with logic that is designed to detect\/monitor the overall three-dimensional movements of the computing device * and to determine whether the computing device * has moved in a particular three-dimensional way that infers that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user . In order to accomplish this, the computing device * may maintain in its memory  (see and ) a movement library  that may include a catalogue or library of movements including signature three-dimensional movements that when detected as occurring may infer at least that a transfer of the computing device * between two users has occurred.","As described briefly above, in addition to directly detecting the movements of the computing device * using movement sensors  (e.g., inertia sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and so forth), other types of environmental aspects may be detected\/monitored in order to determine whether the computing device * has been transferred from a first user  to a second user . For instance, in some embodiments, the computing device * or the logic endowed with the computing device * may be designed to detect, using one or more image capturing devices , certain visual cues that when detected at least infers the transfer of the computing device * from a first user  to a second user . For example, in some embodiments, the computing device * may be endowed with certain logic that is able to detect certain visual cues, such as gestures made by a first user  that when visually detected as occurring at least infers that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to another user. In the same or alternative embodiments, the computing device * may additionally or alternatively be endowed with logic that at least detects, via one or more image capturing devices , changes in lighting in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *. That is, generally when an object is moved from one spatial location to another spatial location, as in the case of a computing device * being transferred between two users, the object will be exposed to changes in lighting conditions. Thus, by merely detecting changes in lighting conditions of the computing device *, at least an inference may be made that the computing device * is being transferred between users.","Alternatively or additionally, in some embodiments, the computing device * may be endowed with a facial recognition system (e.g., facial recognition software or application) that when employed with one or more image capturing devices  may be used in order to determine the presence or absence of a face associated with the first user  or the second user  within the proximate vicinity of the computing device *. If the face associated with the first user  is not detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * and\/or if a face not associated with the first user  is detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *, such as the face of the second user , then a determination or at least an inference may be made by the computing device * or by the endowed logic of the computing device * that a transfer of the computing device * from the first user  to the second user  may have occurred. The phrase \u201cproximate vicinity\u201d as used here is in reference to the immediate area surrounding the computing device * such as within a distance from the computing device * from which an object or a person is visually (or audibly) discernible or identifiable by the computing device * using, for example, a facial recognition system (or a voice verification\/recognition system). Depending on sensitivity of the various systems, this may mean within three feet, within five feet, within six feet, and so forth, of the computing device *.","In some cases, an inference that the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, the first user  to the second user  will not be made until the computing device *(or at least the logic endowed with the computing device *) determines that the face of a person other than the first user  is detected as being in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * and is detected as being located at one or more specified locations relative to the specific orientation of the computing device *. For example, in some cases, the inference that the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, the first user  to the second user  will not be made at least until it is determined that the face of the second user  is determined to be in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * and is detected as being at or on the display side (e.g., front side ) of the computing device *. Note that since the computing device * may be endowed with multiple sensors  (e.g., image capturing devices  and\/or audio capturing devices ) located on both the front side as well as the backside of the computing device *, it may be possible to detect the presence of a person or a face of the person on either side of the computing device *.","Another type of visual cues that the computing device * or at least the logic endowed with the computing device * may look for in order to determine whether the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, a first user  to a second user  is the presence or absence of one or more eyes (e.g., irises or retinas) in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * that are determined to be associated with the first user  or the second user . In particular, if the eyes of the first user  is determined not to be at least in the field of view of an image capturing device  (e.g., an image capturing device  that employs the viewing port  disposed on the front side ) of the computing device * and\/or if one or more eyes of another person (e.g., second user ) other than the first user  is determined to be in the field of view of the image capturing device , then at least an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user .","In some cases, an inference that the computing device * has been transferred from for example, the first user  to the second user  (or vice versa) will not be made until the computing device  (or at least the logic endowed with the computing device *) determines that the eye of a person other than the first user  is detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * and is detected as being located at one or more specified locations (e.g., nearby the front side ) relative to the specific orientation of the computing device *. In other words, the inference or determination that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user , for example, will not be made at least until it is determined that the eye or eyes of the second user  is determined to be in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * and is detected as being at or on the display side (e.g., the front side ) of the computing device *.","In various embodiments, the computing device * or at least the logic that may be endowed with the computing device * may be designed to detect for the absence or presence of audio cues in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * in order to determine or at least infer as to whether the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, a first user  to a second user  (or vice versa). For example, in some embodiments, the computing device * may be endowed with voice verification system or application that may be designed to detect, via one or more audio capturing devices  (e.g., one or more microphones), a voice in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * having a voice pattern that may be different from the signature voice pattern of the first user . By making such a determination and\/or by detecting absence for at least a predefined period of time of a voice pattern associated with the first user  in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *, an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, the first user . In some embodiments, an inference may be made that the computing device * has been transferred from, for example, the first user  to the second user  when a voice pattern belonging to person other than the first user  is detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * and is detected being originating from a point on the display side (e.g., the front side ) of the computing device *","In some embodiments, the computing device * or at least the logic endowed with the computing device * may be designed to determine the transfer of the computing device * from the first user  to the second user  based on one or more detected movements of the computing device *, one or more detected visual cues, and\/or one or more detected audio cues. That is, since in many situations, a particular type of data or measurement (e.g., detected movements of the computing device * or detected visual cues in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *) may not reliably or conclusively indicate that the transfer of the computing device * from the first user  to the second user  has occurred, in various embodiments, the computing device * may make the determination as to whether the computing device * has been transferred based on different types of measurements (e.g., movements of the computing device *, visual cues, and\/or audio cues).","As described earlier, in response to determining that the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user , the computing device * or at least the logic that may be endowed with the computing device * may be designed to, mark one or more portions of one or more items that were being presented to the first user  via the computing device * when the first user  had possession of the computing device * and just prior to being transferred to the second user . By marking the one or more portions of the one or more items, the one or more portions of the one or more items may be easily recalled (e.g., retrieved and\/or re-presented) when the computing device * is transferred back to the first user . There are a number of ways to mark the one or more portions of the one or more items depending on a number of factors including depending on the types of items that are being marked. In some cases, the marking of the one or more portions of the one or more items may be by inserting tags to the one or more portions, by memorializing the one or more portions, by generating pointers (which may be included with the one or more items or stored in memory) that point to the one or more portions of the one or more items, or by other alternative means. In still other cases, in which the one or more items are software applications the marking of the one or more portions of the one or more items may involve memorizing the state of the one or more items when the items were being presented immediately prior to the transfer of the computing device *. These concepts will be described in greater detail herein.","In various embodiments, the one or more items that may be marked through the computing device * may include a wide variety of electronic items that may be accessible through the computing device * in various alternative implementations. For example, in various embodiments, the one or more items that may be marked (or at least one or more portions thereof that may be marked) may include one or more alphanumeric documents (e.g., textual documents such as a word processing document or electronic messages such as email messages), audio messages, productivity documents (e.g., word processing documents, spreadsheet documents, presentation documents, etc.), image files (e.g., digital photos, video files, etc.) such as digital photo album or folders, audio files (e.g., voice messages), video files, electronic folders, software applications (e.g., productivity applications, messaging applications, or gaming applications), application interfaces, Internet websites and so forth.","In various embodiments, the computing device * or at least the endowed logic of the computing device * may be designed to recall (e.g., locating or finding, retrieving, re-presenting, and so forth) the one or more portions of the one or more items for presentation through the computing device * based, at least in part, on the marking of the one or more portions of the one or more items, the recalling further being in response, at least in part, to determining that the computing device * has been transferred back to the first user . The determination as to whether the computing device * has been transferred back to the first user  may be based on the same or similar factors (e.g., detected movements of the computing device *, visual cues, and\/or audio cues) used to determine whether the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user  as described herein. A more detailed discussion related to the above described transfer determining operation (e.g., determining whether the computing device * has been transferred from the first user  to the second user ), the marking operation (e.g., marking the one or more portions of the one or more items that were being presented through the computing device  when the computing device * was being transferred) and the recalling operation (e.g., recalling the one or more portions of the one or more items upon determining that the computing device * has been transferred back to the first user ) will be described in greater detail below.","Referring now to and , and are two block diagrams representing two different implementations of the computing device * of  illustrated in as computing device \u2032 and in as computing device \u2033.

However, those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein, in whole or in part, can be equivalently implemented in integrated circuitry, as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems), as one or more programs running on one or more processors (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors), as firmware, or as virtually any combination thereof, and that designing the circuitry and\/or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. In addition, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing medium include, but are not limited to, the following: a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk, a hard disk drive, a Compact Disc (CD), a Digital Video Disk (DVD), a digital tape, a computer memory, etc.; and a transmission type medium such as a digital and\/or an analog communication medium (e.g., a fiber optic cable, a waveguide, a wired communications link, a wireless communication link, etc.).","In a general sense, those skilled in the art will recognize that the various aspects described herein which can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof can be viewed as being composed of various types of \u201celectrical circuitry.\u201d Consequently, as used herein \u201celectrical circuitry\u201d includes, but is not limited to, electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit, electrical circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein), electrical circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of random access memory), and\/or electrical circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, or optical-electrical equipment). Those having skill in the art will recognize that the subject matter described herein may be implemented in an analog or digital fashion or some combination thereof.","Those having skill in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to describe devices and\/or processes in the fashion set forth herein, and thereafter use engineering practices to integrate such described devices and\/or processes into data processing systems. That is, at least a portion of the devices and\/or processes described herein can be integrated into a data processing system via a reasonable amount of experimentation. Those having skill in the art will recognize that a typical data processing system generally includes one or more of a system unit housing, a video display device, a memory such as volatile and non-volatile memory, processors such as microprocessors and digital signal processors, computational entities such as operating systems, drivers, graphical user interfaces, and applications programs, one or more interaction devices, such as a touch pad or screen, and\/or control systems including feedback loops and control motors (e.g., feedback for sensing position and\/or velocity; control motors for moving and\/or adjusting components and\/or quantities). A typical data processing system may be implemented utilizing any suitable commercially available components, such as those typically found in data computing\/communication and\/or network computing\/communication systems.","The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected\u201d, or \u201coperably coupled\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and\/or physically interacting components and\/or wirelessly interactable and\/or wirelessly interacting components and\/or logically interacting and\/or logically interactable components.","While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the appended claims.","It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.","In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.).","In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"a ","b":["10","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":"b ","b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":"c ","b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":"d ","b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":"e ","b":["10","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"i":"a ","b":["10","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"i":"b ","b":["10","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 3"],"i":["c ","a ","b.
