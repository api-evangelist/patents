More particularly, it pertains to improved green light emitting pyrotechnic compositions employing boron.","Light emitting pyrotechnics are an invaluable asset in a battlefield environment. In particular, light emitting pyrotechnics are advantageously used to signal battlefield status to troops. As a specific example, green light emitting pyrotechnics may signal to troops that it is safe to advance to another position.","Accordingly\u2014given their military and\/or industrial importance\u2014new green light emitting pyrotechnic compositions would represent a significant advance in the art.","An advance in the art is made according to an aspect of the present disclosure directed to new green light emitting pyrotechnic compositions and methods for their preparation. Advantageously, compositions according to the present disclosure do not include barium, perchlorate or chlorinated organic compounds.","More particularly\u2014and in sharp contrast to prior art compositions that contain barium and generate green light with the formation of metastable barium (I) chloride (BaCl)\u2014compositions according to the present disclosure emit green light with the controlled formation of metastable boron dioxide (BO).","Viewed from a first aspect, the present disclosure is directed to green light emitting compositions containing boron carbide, an oxidizer, and a suitable binder. Variations to this basic formulation include the addition of amorphous boron.","Viewed from another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to green light emitting compositions containing amorphous boron, crystalline boron, an oxidizer and a suitable binder.","Viewed from yet another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to green light emitting compositions containing amorphous boron, an oxidizer and a suitable binder.","Advantageously, compositions prepared according to the present disclosure do not contain barium or perchlorates and exhibit tunable burn characteristics.","The following merely illustrates the principles of the disclosure. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements, which, although not explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles of the disclosure, and are included within its spirit and scope.","Furthermore, all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the disclosure and the concepts contributed by the inventor(s) to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.","Moreover, all statements herein reciting principles, aspects, and embodiments of the disclosure, as well as specific examples thereof, are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally, it is intended that such equivalents include both currently-known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future, i.e., any elements developed that perform the same function, regardless of structure.","Thus, for example, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the diagrams herein represent conceptual views of illustrative structures embodying the principles of the disclosure.","With these principles in place, we may now describe the application of the present disclosure to the preparation of green light emitting pyrotechnic compositions and methods of preparation. However, it is useful to first review some additional background.","Contemporary green light emitting pyrotechnic compositions employ barium nitrate along with a chlorine donor to generate green light. Operationally, when barium and chlorine atoms combine at high temperatures the metastable BaCl ion molecular emitter is generated. Common, known formulations employing this mechanism include mixtures of 1) barium nitrate, magnesium, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and suitable binder(s) (e.g., Laminac\/Lupersol or any of a number of known polyester binder systems) and 2) barium nitrate, dechlorane plus, potassium perchlorate, magnesium and binder(s).","As noted previously, contemporary green light emitting pyrotechnic compositions produce the green light as a result of the formation of BaCl. Alternative green light emitting pyrotechnic formulations employing metastable boron dioxide anion (BO)\u2014while known\u2014introduce significant difficulties as the bum-time of boron-based pyrotechnics is difficult to control. According to the present disclosure however, a boron-based pyrotechnic with a tunable burn-time and sufficient green light output is prepared and described.","In a first composition, a mixture of substantially 10% amorphous boron, 85% potassium nitrate and 5% binder burned quickly and completely and generated a green light. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, amorphous boron exhibiting a non-crystalline atomic structure has been employed in the commercial pyrotechnics and propellant industries. One problem immediately encountered when using amorphous boron is its extremely fine particle size (generally <1 micron) and high material cost. Consequently, pyrotechnics employing such materials generally burn too quickly and are somewhat too sensitive to ignition. Despite these drawbacks, variations to the burn time and light output may be achieved by varying the ratio of the amorphous boron\/oxidizer.","A second composition according to the present disclosure comprises a mixture of substantially 10% boron, 83% potassium nitrate and 7% binder. The boron component is a mixture of both amorphous boron and crystalline boron. The binder system comprised Epon 828 and Epikure 3140 curing agent in an 80\/20 proportion. The general compositional outline for this second composition is shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Amorphous\/Crystalline Boron General Pyrotechnic Formulations"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["COMPONENT","FUNCTION","WEIGHT PERCENT"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Potassium Nitrate","Oxidizer","83"]},{"entry":["Amorphous Boron","Fuel","2-9"]},{"entry":["Crystalline Boron","Burn Time Moderator","1-8"]},{"entry":["Epon 828\/Epikure 3140","Binder","\u20027"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Combustion properties of this amorphous\/crystalline boron pyrotechnic composition is shown in Table 2.

During combustion, the fuel and the oxidizer exothermically react to form metastable boron oxide\u2014a green light emitter. With increased quantities of crystalline boron, burn time is increased and energy output from the formulation is decreased.","To evaluate these compositions\u2014and by way of example only\u2014each was pressed into pellets substantially 1.27 cm (0.5 in.) diameter by 2.54 cm (1 in) such as that shown in . The pellets were pressed with an 891 kg dead load (1963 lbs dead load at 10,000 psi) and weighed approximately 4 grams. To ensure consistent burn, the pellets were coated with an energetic slurry (A1A), which generates sufficient heat to initiate the chemical reaction. Electric matches were used to ignite the A1A slurry\u2014which in turn\u2014ignited the pellets.","As already noted, boron serves as a fuel while the potassium nitrate serves as an oxidizer. When the mixture of these materials is exposed to a thermal stimulus, the resulting exothermic reaction produces BO, which produces green light in its metastable excited state, BO.  shows two spectra for both boron-based (()) and barium-based formulations (()). As may be observed from this , the barium-based composition exhibits a narrower green emission and a higher spectral purity and the boron-based compositions according to the present disclosure. More particularly, the barium-based compositions exhibit a dominant wavelength at approximately 558 nm while the boron-based compositions exhibit a dominant wavelength at approximately 562 nm. Notwithstanding these differences, there is minimal perceptible difference to the human eye in the green light output by the two compositions.","Another additional composition according to the present disclosure comprises a mixture of substantially 10% boron, 83% potassium nitrate and 7% binder.
