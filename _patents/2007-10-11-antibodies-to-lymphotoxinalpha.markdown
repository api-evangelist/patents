No. 60\/829,257 filed on 12 Oct. 2006, and of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/938,999 filed on 18 May 2007, which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The present invention concerns antibodies and their uses to treat autoimmune disorders. More particularly, the present invention concerns antibodies that bind to lymphotoxin-\u03b1 and may also block binding of the lymphotoxin-\u03b1 ligand to one or more receptors.","Autoimmune diseases remain clinically important diseases in humans. As the name implies, autoimmune diseases wreak their havoc through the body's own immune system. While the pathological mechanisms differ among individual types of autoimmune diseases, one general mechanism involves the binding of certain antibodies (referred to herein as self-reactive antibodies or autoantibodies) present. Physicians and scientists have identified more than 70 clinically distinct autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), vasculitis, immune-mediated diabetes, and lupus such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While many autoimmune diseases are rare\u2014affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals\u2014collectively, these diseases afflict millions of Americans, an estimated five percent of the population, with women disproportionately affected by most diseases. The chronic nature of these diseases leads to an immense social and financial burden.","Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-related proteins are recognized in the art as a large family of proteins having a variety of activities ranging from host defense to immune regulation to apoptosis. TNF was first identified as a serum-derived factor that was cytotoxic for several transformed cell lines in vitro and caused necrosis of certain tumors in vivo. A similar factor in the superfamily was identified and referred to as lymphotoxin (\u201cLT\u201d). Due to observed similarities between TNF and LT in the early 1980's, it was proposed that TNF and LT be referred to as TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2, respectively. Scientific literature thus makes reference to both nomenclatures. As used in the present application, the term \u201cTNF\u201d refers to TNF-\u03b1. Later research revealed two forms of lymphotoxin, referred to as LT\u03b1 and LT\u03b2. US 2005-0129614 describes another polypeptide member of the TNF ligand super-family based on structural and biological similarities, designated TL-5.","Members of the TNF family of proteins exist in membrane-bound forms that act locally through cell-cell contact, or as secreted proteins. A family of TNF-related receptors react with these proteins and trigger a variety of signalling pathways including cell death or apoptosis, cell proliferation, tissue differentiation, and proinflammatory responses. TNF-\u03b1 by itself has been implicated in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, malignancies, and\/or neurodegenerative diseases and is a useful target for specific biological therapy in diseases such as RA and Crohn's disease.","Cloning of the TNF and LT\u03b1 proteins and further characterization of their respective biological activities reveal that the proteins differ in many aspects. Aggarwal et al., , Wiley-Liss, Inc. 1990, pp. 375-384. For instance, LT\u03b1 is a secreted, soluble protein of approximately 20 kDa (25 kDa if N- and O-glycosylated). TNF, in contrast, has no site for glycosylation and is synthesized with an apparent transmembrane domain that results in the original protein transcript being cell associated. Proteolysis of the cell-associated TNF protein results in the release of the soluble form of the protein having a molecular weight of approximately 19 kDa. TNF is produced primarily by activated macrophages, whereas LT is produced by activated lymphocytes. Wong et al., , Beutler, B., ed., Raven Press (1991), pp. 473-484. The sequences encoding TNF and LT\u03b1 also differ. TNF and LT\u03b1 share only approximately 32% amino acid sequence identity. Regarding the different biological activities of TNF and LT\u03b1, TNF increases production of endothelial-cell interleukin-1 (\u201cIL-1\u201d), whereas LT\u03b1 has little effect thereon. Further, TNF induces production of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor from macrophages, whereas LT\u03b1 has no effect thereon. These and other biological activities are discussed in Aggarwal, , Aggarwal and Vicek, eds. (1992), pp. 61-78.","TNF and LT\u03b1 are described further in the review articles by Spriggs, \u201cTumor Necrosis Factor Basic Principles and Preclinical Studies,\u201d , DeVita et al., eds., J.B. Lippincott Company (1991) Ch. 16, pp. 354-377; Ruddle, 4:327-332 (1992); Wong et al., \u201cTumor Necrosis Factor,\u201d , Academic Press (1989), pp. 195-215; and Paul et al., 6:407-438 (1988).","In non-tumor cells, TNF and TNF-related cytokines are active in a variety of immune responses. Both TNF and LT\u03b1 ligands bind to and activate TNF receptors (p55 or p60 and p75 or p80; herein called \u201cTNF-R\u201d).","Cell-surface LT complexes have been characterized in CD4+ T cell hybridoma cells (II-23.D7), which express high levels of LT (Browning et al., 147: 1230-1237 (1991); Androlewicz et al., 267: 2542-2547 (1992)). The expression and biological roles of LT\u03b2-R, LT subunits, and surface LT complexes are reviewed in Ware et al., \u201cThe ligands and receptors of the lymphotoxin system\u201d, in ., Springer-Verlag, pp. 175-218 (1995).","LT\u03b1 expression is induced and LT\u03b1 secreted primarily by activated T and B lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. Among the T helper cell subclasses, LT\u03b1 appears to be produced by Th1 but not Th2 cells. LT\u03b1 has also been detected in melanocytes. LT\u03b2 (also called p33) has been identified on the surface of T lymphocytes, T cell lines, B cell lines and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Studies have shown that LTD is not functional in the absence of LT\u03b1.","LT\u03b1 exists either as a homotrimer (LT\u03b13) or a heterotrimer with LT\u03b2. These heterotrimers contain either two subunits of LT\u03b1 and one subunit of LT\u03b2 (LT\u03b12\u03b21), or one subunit of LT\u03b1 and two of LT\u03b2 (LT\u03b11\u03b22).","The only known cell-surface receptors for the LT\u03b1 homotrimer are the two TNF receptors, p55 and p75. However, the LT\u03b1\u03b2 heterotrimer, LT\u03b11\u03b22, does not bind to the TNF receptors and instead binds to a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, lymphotoxin \u03b2 receptor (referred to herein as LT\u03b2-R). The heterotrimeric form LT\u03b12\u03b21 likely binds TNF receptors.","LT\u03b2-R has a well-described role both in the development of the immune system and in the functional maintenance of a number of cells in the immune system, including follicular dendritic cells and a number of stromal cell types (Matsumoto et al., 156:137 (1997)). Known ligands to the LT\u03b2-R include not only LT\u03b11\u03b22, but also a second ligand called LIGHT (Mauri et al., 8:21 (1998)). Activation of LT\u03b2-R has been shown to induce the apoptotic death of certain cancer cell lines in vivo (U.S. Pat. No. 6,312,691). Humanized antibodies to LT\u03b2-R and methods of use thereof are provided in US 2004-0058394 and stated as being useful for treating or reducing the advancement, severity, or effects of neoplasia in humans. Further, EP 1585547 (WO 2004\/058183) (LePage and Gill) discloses combination therapies that include a composition that activates LT\u03b2-R signaling in combination with one or more other chemotherapeutic agents, as well as therapeutic methods and screening methods for identifying agents that in combination with a LT\u03b2-R agonist agent have an additive effect on tumor inhibition.","LT is important for lymphoneogenesis, as evident from knockout mice. See Futterer et al. 9 (1): 59-70 (1998), showing that mice deficient in LT\u03b2-R lacked lymph nodes and Peyer's patches and also showing impaired antibody affinity maturation. Rennert et al., 9 (1): 71-9 (1998) reported that an agonist monoclonal antibody against LT\u03b2-R restored the ability to make lymph nodes in LT\u03b1 knockout mice. See also Wu et al., 166 (3): 1684-9 (2001) and Endres et al., 189 (1): 159-68 (1999); Dohi et al., 167 (5): 2781-90 (2001); and Matsumoto et al., 163 (3): 1584-91 (1999). Korner et al. 27 (10): 2600-9 (1997) reported that mice lacking both TNF and LT showed retarded B-cell maturation and serum immunoglobulin deficiencies, whereas mice lacking only TNF showed no such deficiencies.","In addition, LT is important for inflammation. LT\u03b1 is overexpressed in the pancreas of RIP.LT\u03b1 transgenic mice, which have shown inflammation, increased chemokine expression, and a lymphoid-like structure, and in which overexpression of LT\u03b2 alone has demonstrated no additional inflammation. Further, LT\u03b1-deficient mice exhibit impaired TNF-\u03b1 production, and defective splenic architecture and function are restored when such mice are crossed to TNF-transgene (Kollias, 188:745 (1998); Chaplin, 17:399 (1999)), and decreased TNF levels are restored after pathogenic challenge (Eugster, 31:1935 (2001)).","When TNF-\u03b1 or LT\u03b1interacts with the TNF receptors TNFRI and\/or TNFRII, the result is proinflammatory responses and\/or apoptosis. When LT\u03b11\u03b22 interacts with the receptor LT\u03b2-R, the result is lymphoneogenesis and induction of chemokines and adhesion molecules. Autoimmune diseases are associated with lymphoneogenesis and inflammatory responses, and there is increased LT expression in patients with autoimmune disease, including MS, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and RA (Weyand et al., 15: 259-266 (2003); Selmaj et al., 87: 949-954 (1991); Matusevicius et al., 66: 115-123 (1996); Powell et al., 2 (6): 539-44 (1990); Zipp et al., Annals of Neurology, 38\/5: 723-730 (1995); Voskuhl et al., 15 (2): 137-43 (1993); Selmaj et al., 147: 1522-29 (1991); Agyekum et al., 199 (1): 115-21 (2003); and Takemura et al., 167: 1072 (2001)).","As to MS specifically, serum LT\u03b1 correlates with lesions\/disease burden in MS (Kraus et al., Scandinavica, 105 (4): 300-8 (2002)). LT\u03b1 is involved in demyelination but not remyelination in an in vivo cuprizone model, whereas TNF-\u03b1 is required for both (Plant et al., 49:1-14 (2005)).","As to RA specifically, levels of human LT\u03b13 and TNF-\u03b1 in RA patients are elevated over those of normal donors (Stepien, 9: 145 (1998)). The roles of LT\u03b1 in RA include: serum LT\u03b1 is present in some RA patients, increased LT\u03b1 protein is present in synovium, the LT pathway is associated with ectopic lymphoneogenesis in synovium, and there is increased LT\u03b2-R expression on fibroblast-like synoviocytes in RA patients. In addition, a case report discloses that neutralizing LT\u03b13 is beneficial for an infliximab-resistant RA patient (Buch et al., 63: 1344-46 (2004)). Also, Han et al., 52: 3202-3209 (2005) describes that blockading the LT pathway exacerbates autoimmune arthritis by enhancing the Th1 response.","Preclinical efficacy for prevention and treatment with LT\u03b2R-Ig in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is shown in Fava et al., 171 (1): 115-26 (2003). Further, LT\u03b1-deficient mice are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Suen et al., 186: 1233-40 (1997); Sean Riminton et al., 187 (9): 1517-28 (1998)). There is also published efficacy of LT\u03b2R-Ig in EAE (Gommerman et al., 112 (5): 755-67 (2003)). Also, LT\u03b2R-Ig disrupts lymphogenesis in mice. Mackay et al., 27 (8): 2033-42 (1997)). Further, administration of LT\u03b2R-Ig decreases insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in non-obese diabetic mice (Wu et al., 193 (11): 1327-32 (2001)). The role of LT in lymphogenesis in non-human primates was investigated by Gommerman et al., 110 (9): 1359-69 (2002) using LT\u03b2R-Ig. Further, LT\u03b1-deficient mice are less susceptible to BCG than TNF-\u03b1-deficient mice. Eugster et al., 31: 1935 (2001).","LT has also been used to treat cancer. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,023.","Antibodies are proteins that exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen. Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (V) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light-chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light- and heavy-chain variable domains.","The term \u201cvariable\u201d refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are responsible for the binding specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions (CDRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework regions (FRs). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs, largely adopting a \u03b2-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the \u03b2-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)).","The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant region of their heavy chains, antibodies or immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4; IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant regions that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3, and \u03bc, respectively. Of the human immunoglobulin classes, only human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgM are known to activate complement, and human IgG1 and IgG3 mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) more effectively than IgG2 and IgG4.","Two main approaches have been used to develop therapeutic compounds that inhibit TNF-\u03b1. The first, exemplified by infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF-\u03b1 also known as REMICADE\u00ae (infliximab), is to neutralize TNF-\u03b1 action by using a specific monoclonal antibody of high affinity and potency to prevent binding of TNF-\u03b1 to its receptors. The second, exemplified by etanercept, also known as ENBREL\u00ae (etanercept), is to inhibit TNF-\u03b1 by using a TNF receptor-based molecule that functions as a \u201cdecoy\u201d to reduce the binding of TNF-\u03b1 to its natural receptors. Although both types of molecules can prevent the binding of TNF\u03b1 to its receptors, receptor-based inhibitors such as etanercept will also prevent receptor binding of LT\u03b1.","In the patent literature, antibodies to cachectin (TNF), disclosed by EP 212489, are reported as useful in diagnostic immunoassays and in therapy of shock in bacterial infections. EP 218868 discloses monoclonal antibodies to human TNF and their uses. EP 288,088 discloses anti-TNF antibodies, and their utility in immunoassay diagnosis of pathologies, in particular Kawasaki's pathology and bacterial infection. Anti-TNF antibodies are also described, for example, in EP 1585477 (Giles-Komar et al.); US 2006-0147452; US 2006-0222646; and US 2006-0121037. A method of treating RA by using a single-domain antibody polypeptide construct that antagonizes human TNF\u03b1's binding to a receptor is described in US 2005-0271663. Methods of treating RA using anti-TNF receptor fusion proteins are described in US 2005-0260201. Methods for treating a TNF-mediated disease using a composition comprising methotrexate and an anti-TNF antibody, including RA, Crohn's disease, and acute and chronic immune diseases associated with transplantation, are described in EP 1593393. Antibodies that bind to TNF-R include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,057,022. Novel proteins with TNF-alpha antagonist activity are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,056,695. US 2006-0147448 discloses treatment of immunological renal disorders by LT pathway inhibitors.","LT\u03b2 and LT\u03b2\/LT\u03b1 complexes and LT\u03b2-R and antibodies thereto as well as LT\u03b2 blocking agents are described, for example, in WO 1992\/00329; WO 1994\/13808; U.S. Pat.

Multivalent antibodies (that bind the TNF receptor superfamily) are described, for example, in US 2002-0004587 and US 2006-0025576.","There is a continuing need in the art to produce antibodies, in particular, therapeutic antibodies having improved function, such as anti-LT\u03b1 antibodies or fragments thereof that block LT\u03b2, since LT\u03b1 has more interactions with the various receptors than TNF-\u03b1 or LT\u03b2 alone.","The invention is in part based on the identification of a variety of antagonists of the LT biological pathway, which is a biological\/cellular process presenting as an important therapeutic target.

No. 5,824,509. LT\u03b1 is defined to specifically exclude human TNF\u03b1 or its natural animal analogues (Pennica et al., 312:20\/27: 724-729 (1984) and Aggarwal et al., 260: 2345-2354 (1985)). LT\u03b1 is defined to specifically exclude human LT\u03b2 as defined, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,004.","\u201cLymphotoxin-\u03b13 trimer\u201d or \u201cLT\u03b13\u201d refers to a homotrimer of LT\u03b1 monomers.

These heterotrimers contain either two subunits of LT\u03b1 and one subunit of LT\u03b2 (LT\u03b12\u03b21), or one subunit of LT\u03b1 and two of LT\u03b2 (LT\u03b11\u03b22).","\u201cTumor necrosis factor receptor-I\u201d or \u201cTNFRI\u201d and \u201ctumor necrosis factor receptor-II\u201d or \u201cTNFRII\u201d refer to cell-surface TNF receptors for the LT\u03b1\u03b2 homotrimer, also known as p55 and p75, respectively.","\u201cLymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor\u201d or \u201cLT\u03b2-R\u201d refers to the receptor to which the LT\u03b1\u03b2 heterotrimers bind.","\u201cRegulatory cytokines\u201d are cytokines the abnormal levels of which indicate the presence of an autoimmune disorder in a patient. Such cytokines include, for example, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-69 IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-14, IL-15, IL-18, IL-23, IL-24, IL-25, IL-26, BLyS\/April, TGF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, MIP-1, MIF, MCP-1, M-CSF or G-CSF, a lymphotoxin, LIGHT, 4-1BB ligand, CD27 ligand, CD30 ligand, CD40 ligand, Fas ligand, GITR ligand, OX40 ligand, RNAK ligand, THANK, TRAIL, TWEAK and VEG1. This group includes TNF family members, which include but are not limited to, TNF-\u03b1, LTs such as LT\u03b1, LT\u03b2, and LIGHT. For a review of the TNF superfamily, see MacEwan, 135: 855-875 (2002). Preferably, the regulatory cytokine is an IL such as IL-1b or IL-6 and\/or a TNF family member.","\u201cInflammatory cytokines associated with rheumatoid arthritis\u201d refer to IL-6, IL-1b, and TNF\u03b1, associated with RA pathology, which can be inhibited systemically and or in the joints in an in vitro collagen-induced arthritis assay.","\u201cLT\u03b1\u03b2-expressing cells\u201d are cells that express or secrete the LT\u03b1\u03b2 heterotrimers.","The expression \u201cmodulates LT\u03b1\u03b2-expressing cells\u201d refers to depleting or altering proteins made by the cells such as cytokines, chemokines, or growth factors, with the cells including, for example, monocytes, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells.","The terms \u201cantibody\u201d and \u201cimmunoglobulin\u201d are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies (e.g., full-length or intact monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multivalent antibodies, and multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity), and may also include certain antibody fragments (as described in greater detail herein). An antibody can be chimeric, human, humanized, and\/or affinity matured.","\u201cAntibody fragments\u201d comprise only a portion of an intact antibody, wherein the portion preferably retains at least one, more preferably most or all, of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment comprises an antigen-binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment, an antibody fragment, for example one that comprises the Fc region, retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody, such as FcRn binding, antibody half-life modulation, ADCC function, and complement binding. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For example, such an antibody fragment may comprise an antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment. In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention is a one-armed antibody as described in WO 2005\/063816, for example, an antibody comprising Fc mutations constituting \u201cknobs\u201d and \u201choles\u201d. For example, a hole mutation can be one or more of T366A, L368A and\/or Y407V in an Fc polypeptide, and a cavity mutation can be T366W. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","For the purposes herein, an \u201cintact antibody\u201d is one comprising heavy and light variable domains as well as an Fc region.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies useful in the present invention may be prepared by the hybridoma methodology first described by Kohler et al., 256:495 (1975), or may be made using recombinant DNA methods in, e.g., bacterial, non-animal eukaryotic, animal, or plant cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The \u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in, e.g., Clackson et al., 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., 222:581-597 (1991).","The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., 81:6851-6855 (1984)). Methods of making chimeric antibodies are known in the art.","\u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a CDR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and maximize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence, although the FR regions may include one or more amino acid substitutions that improve binding affinity. The number of these amino acid substitutions in the FR is typically no more than six in the H chain, and no more than three in the L chain. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., 321:522-525 (1986); Reichmann et al., 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, 2:593-596 (1992).

The humanized antibody includes a PRIMATIZED\u00ae antibody wherein the antigen-binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by, e.g., immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest. Methods of making humanized antibodies are known in the art.","A \u201chuman antibody\u201d is one that possesses an amino acid sequence that corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and\/or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues. Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage-display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter, 227:381 (1991); Marks et al., 222:581 (1991). Also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al., , Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); Boerner et al., 147(1):86-95 (1991).","An \u201caffinity-matured\u201d antibody is an antibody with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof that result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody that does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity-matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and\/or framework residues is described by: Barbas et al., 91:3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al., 169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al., 155:1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al., 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al., 226:889-896 (1992).","An \u201cantigen\u201d is a predetermined antigen to which an antibody can selectively bind. The target antigen may be polypeptide, carbohydrate, nucleic acid, lipid, hapten, or another naturally occurring or synthetic compound. Preferably, the target antigen is \u03b1 polypeptide. An \u201cacceptor human framework\u201d for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework, or from a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework \u201cderived from\u201d a human immunoglobulin framework or human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes.

The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra, for each of these definitions. Throughout the present specification and claims, the numbering of the residues in an immunoglobulin heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al., supra. The \u201cEU index as in Kabat\u201d refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.","An \u201cunmodified human framework\u201d is a human framework that has the same amino acid sequence as the acceptor human framework, e.g. lacking human to non-human amino acid substitution(s) in the acceptor human framework.","An \u201caltered CDR\u201d for the purposes herein is a CDR comprising one or more (e.g. one to about 16) amino acid substitution(s) therein.","An \u201cun-modified CDR\u201d for the purposes herein is a CDR having the same amino acid sequence as a non-human antibody from which it was derived, i.e. one lacking one or more amino acid substitutions.","\u201cFramework\u201d or \u201cFR\u201d residues are those variable domain residues other than the CDR residues as herein defined.","A \u201cblocking\u201d antibody or an \u201cantagonist\u201d antibody is one that inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Preferred blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.","An \u201cagonist antibody\u201d, as used herein, is an antibody that mimics at least one of the functional activities of a polypeptide of interest.","An \u201cisolated\u201d antibody is one that has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably to more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.","The term \u201cvariable-domain residue numbering as in Kabat\u201d or \u201camino acid position numbering as in Kabat\u201d, and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy-chain variable domains or light-chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al., supra. Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy-chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc according to Kabat) after heavy-chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a \u201cstandard\u201d Kabat-numbered sequence.","A \u201cparent polypeptide\u201d is a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that lacks one or more of the Fc-region modifications disclosed herein and that differs in effector function compared to a polypeptide variant as herein disclosed. The parent polypeptide may comprise a native-sequence Fc region or an Fc region with pre-existing amino acid sequence modifications (such as additions, deletions, and\/or substitutions).","The term \u201cFc region\u201d is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. The \u201cFc region\u201d may be a native-sequence Fc region or a variant Fc region. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy-chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The Fc region of an immunoglobulin generally comprises two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. The last residue, lysine, in the heavy chain of IgG1 can, but does not have to, be present as the terminal residue in the Fc in the mature protein.","The \u201cCH2 domain\u201d of a human IgG Fc region (also referred to as \u201cC\u03b32\u201d domain) usually extends from about amino acid 231 to about amino acid 340. The CH2 domain is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather, two N-linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG molecule. It has been speculated that the carbohydrate may provide a substitute for the domain-domain pairing and help stabilize the CH2 domain. Burton, 22: 161-206 (1985).","The \u201cCH3 domain\u201d comprises the stretch of residues C-terminal to a CH2 domain in an Fc region (i.e. from about amino acid residue 341 to about amino acid residue 447 of an IgG)","A \u201cfunctional Fc region\u201d possesses an \u201ceffector function\u201d of a native-sequence Fc region. Exemplary \u201ceffector functions\u201d include C1q binding; CDC; Fc receptor binding; ADCC; phagocytosis; down regulation of cell-surface receptors (e.g. LT receptor), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g. an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays as herein disclosed, for example.","A \u201cnative-sequence Fc region\u201d or \u201cwild-type Fc region\u201d comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Native-sequence human Fc regions are known in the art and include a native-sequence human IgG1 Fc region (non-A and A allotypes); native-sequence human IgG2 Fc region; native-sequence human IgG3 Fc region; and native-sequence human IgG4 Fc region, as well as naturally occurring allelic variants thereof.","A \u201cvariant Fc region\u201d comprises an amino acid sequence that differs from that of a native-sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one \u201camino acid modification\u201d as herein defined. Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native-sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native-sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% homology with a native-sequence Fc region and\/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, more preferably at least about 90% homology therewith, and most preferably at least about 95% homology therewith.","The term \u201cFc region-containing polypeptide\u201d refers to a polypeptide, such as an antibody or immunoadhesin (see definitions herein), which comprises an Fc region.","The terms \u201cFc receptor\u201d and \u201cFcR\u201d are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an IgG antibody. The preferred FcR is a native-sequence human FcR. In one embodiment, the FcR is a Fc\u03b3R that includes receptors of the Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, and Fc\u03b3RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc\u03b3RII receptors include Fc\u03b3RIIA (an \u201cactivating receptor\u201d) and Fc\u03b3RIIB (an \u201cinhibiting receptor\u201d), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc\u03b3RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc\u03b3RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain (see review in Da\u00ebron, 15:203-234 (1997)). The term includes allotypes, such as Fc\u03b3RIIIA allotypes: Fc\u03b3RIIIA-Phe158, Fc\u03b3RIIIA-Val158, Fc\u03b3RIIA-R131, and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA-H131. FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 9:457-492 (1991); Capel et al., 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., 126:330-341 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term \u201cFcR\u201d herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., 24:2429-2434 (1994)).","\u201cAntibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\u201d or \u201cADCC\u201d refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (e.g. Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies \u201carm\u201d the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc\u03b3RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, and Fc\u03b3RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, 9:457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and NK cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al., PNAS (USA) 95:652-656 (1998).","\u201cHuman effector cells\u201d are leukocytes that express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably, the cells express at least Fc\u03b3RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes that mediate ADCC include PBMCs, NK cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells, and neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source thereof, e.g. from blood or PBMCs as described herein.","\u201cComplement-dependent cytotoxicity\u201d or \u201cCDC\u201d refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to antibodies (of the appropriate subclass) that are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., 202:163 (1996), may be performed.","A polypeptide with a variant IgG Fc having \u201caltered\u201d FcR binding affinity or ADCC activity is one that has either enhanced or diminished FcR binding activity (Fc\u03b3R or FcRn) and\/or ADCC activity compared to a parent polypeptide or to a polypeptide comprising a native-sequence Fc region. The variant Fc that \u201cexhibits increased binding\u201d to an FcR binds at least one FcR with better affinity than the parent polypeptide. The improvement in binding compared to a parent polypeptide may be about three-fold, preferably about 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, 60-, 100-, 150-, 200-, and up to 500-fold, or about 25% to 1000% improvement in binding. The polypeptide variant that \u201cexhibits decreased binding\u201d to an FcR binds at least one FcR with less affinity than a parent polypeptide. The decrease in binding compared to a parent polypeptide may be about 40% or more decrease in binding. Such Fc variants that display decreased binding to an FcR may possess little or no appreciable binding to an FcR, e.g., about 0-20% binding to the FcR compared to a native-sequence IgG Fc region.","The polypeptide having a variant Fc that binds an FcR with \u201cbetter affinity\u201d or \u201chigher affinity\u201d than a polypeptide or parent polypeptide having wild-type or native-sequence IgG Fc is one that binds any one or more of the above identified FcRs with substantially better binding affinity than the parent polypeptide with native-sequence Fc, when the amounts of polypeptide with variant Fc and parent polypeptide in the binding assay are essentially the same. For example, the variant Fc polypeptide with improved FcR binding affinity may display from about two-fold to about 300-fold, preferably, from about three-fold to about 170-fold, improvement in FcR binding affinity compared to the parent polypeptide, where FcR binding affinity is determined as known in the art.","The polypeptide comprising a variant Fc region that \u201cexhibits increased ADCC\u201d or mediates ADCC in the presence of human effector cells more effectively than a polypeptide having wild-type IgG Fc is one that in vitro or in vivo is substantially more effective at mediating ADCC, when the amounts of polypeptide with variant Fc region and the polypeptide with wild-type Fc region used in the assay are essentially the same. Generally, such variants will be identified using the in vitro ADCC assay as herein disclosed, but other assays or methods for determining ADCC activity, e.g. in an animal model, etc, are contemplated. The preferred variant is from about five-fold to about 100-fold, more preferably from about 25- to about 50-fold, more effective at mediating ADCC than the wild-type Fc.","An \u201camino acid modification\u201d refers to a change in the amino acid sequence of a predetermined amino acid sequence. Exemplary modifications include an amino acid substitution, insertion, and\/or deletion. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution.","An \u201camino acid modification at\u201d a specified position, e.g. of the Fc region, refers to the substitution or deletion of the specified residue, or the insertion of at least one amino acid residue adjacent to the specified residue. By insertion \u201cadjacent to\u201d a specified residue is meant insertion within one to two residues thereof. The insertion may be N-terminal or C-terminal to the specified residue.","An \u201camino acid substitution\u201d refers to the replacement of at least one existing amino acid residue in a predetermined amino acid sequence with another different \u201creplacement\u201d amino acid residue. The replacement residue or residues may be \u201cnaturally occurring amino acid residues\u201d (i.e., encoded by the genetic code) and selected from the group consisting of: alanine (Ala); arginine (Arg); asparagine (Asn); aspartic acid (Asp); cysteine (Cys); glutamine (Gln); glutamic acid (Glu); glycine (Gly); histidine (His); isoleucine (Ile): leucine (Leu); lysine (Lys); methionine (Met); phenylalanine (Phe); proline (Pro); serine (Ser); threonine (Thr); tryptophan (Trp); tyrosine (Tyr); and valine (Val). Preferably, the replacement residue is not cysteine. Substitution with one or more non-naturally occurring amino acid residues is also encompassed by the definition of an amino acid substitution herein. A \u201cnon-naturally occurring amino acid residue\u201d refers to a residue, other than those naturally occurring amino acid residues listed above, which is able to covalently bind adjacent amino acid residues(s) in a polypeptide chain. Examples of non-naturally occurring amino acid residues include norleucine, ornithine, norvaline, homoserine, and other amino acid residue analogues such as those described in Eliman et al., 202:301-336 (1991). For generation of such non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, the procedures of Noren et al., 244:182 (1989) and Eliman et al., supra, can be used. Briefly, these procedures involve chemically activating a suppressor tRNA with a non-naturally occurring amino acid residue followed by in vitro transcription and translation of the RNA.","The term \u201cconservative\u201d amino acid substitution as used within this invention is meant to refer to amino acid substitutions that substitute functionally equivalent amino acids. Conservative amino acid changes result in silent changes in the amino acid sequence of the resulting polypeptide. For example, one or more amino acids of a similar polarity act as functional equivalents and result in a silent alteration within the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide. In general, substitutions within a group may be considered conservative with respect to structure and function. However, the skilled artisan will recognize that the role of a particular residue is determined by its context within the three-dimensional structure of the molecule in which it occurs. For example, Cys residues may occur in the oxidized (disulfide) form, which is less polar than the reduced (thiol) form. The long aliphatic portion of the Arg side chain may constitute a critical feature of its structural or functional role, and this may be best conserved by substitution of a nonpolar, rather than another basic, residue. Also, it will be recognized that side chains containing aromatic groups (Trp, Tyr, and Phe) can participate in ionic-aromatic or \u201ccation-pi\u201d interactions. In these cases, substitution of one of these side chains with a member of the acidic or uncharged polar group may be conservative with respect to structure and function. Residues such as Pro, Gly, and Cys (disulfide form) can have direct effects on the main-chain conformation, and often may not be substituted without structural distortions.","An \u201camino acid insertion\u201d refers to the incorporation of at least one amino acid into a predetermined amino acid sequence. While the insertion will usually consist of the insertion of one or two amino acid residues, the present application contemplates larger \u201cpeptide insertions\u201d, e.g., insertion of about three to about five or even up to about ten amino acid residues. The inserted residue(s) may be naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring as disclosed above.","An \u201camino acid deletion\u201d refers to the removal of at least one amino acid residue from a predetermined amino acid sequence.","Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains (in A. L. Lehninger, in , second ed., pp. 73-75, Worth Publishers, New York (1975)):\n\n","Alternatively, naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n","The \u201chinge region\u201d is generally defined as stretching from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1 (Burton, 22: 161-206 (1985)). Hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by placing the first and last cysteine residues forming inter-heavy chain S\u2014S bonds in the same positions.","The \u201clower hinge region\u201d of an Fc region is normally defined as the stretch of residues immediately C-terminal to the hinge region, i.e., residues 233 to 239 of the Fc region.","\u201cC1q\u201d is a polypeptide that includes a binding site for the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. C1q together with two serine proteases, C1r and C1s, forms the complex C1, the first component of the CDC pathway. Human C1q can be purchased commercially from, e.g. Quidel, San Diego, Calif.","The term \u201cbinding domain\u201d refers to the region of a polypeptide that binds to another molecule. In the case of an FcR, the binding domain can comprise a portion of a polypeptide chain thereof (e.g., the \u03b1 chain thereof) that is responsible for binding an Fc region. One useful binding domain is the extracellular domain of an FcR \u03b1 chain.","\u201cFunctional fragments\u201d of the antibodies of the invention comprise a portion of an intact antibody, generally including the antigen-binding or variable region of the intact antibody or the Fc region of an antibody that retains FcR binding capability. Examples of antibody fragments include linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","As used herein, the term \u201cimmunoadhesin\u201d designates antibody-like molecules that combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein (an \u201cadhesin\u201d) with the effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains. Structurally, the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity that is other than the antigen-recognition and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is \u201cheterologous\u201d), and an immunoglobulin constant-domain sequence. The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant-domain sequence in the immunoadhesin can be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such as IgG-1, IgG-2, IgG-3, or IgG-4 subtypes, IgA (including IgA-1 and IgA-2), IgE, IgD, or IgM. For example, useful immunoadhesins as second medicaments herein include polypeptides that comprise the B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) binding portions of a BLyS receptor without the transmembrane or cytoplasmic sequences of the BLyS receptor. In one embodiment, the extracellular domain of BR3 (BLyS receptor 3), TACI (transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor), or BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) is fused to a constant domain of an immunoglobulin sequence.","A \u201cfusion protein\u201d and a \u201cfusion polypeptide\u201d refer to a polypeptide having two portions covalently linked together, where each of the portions is a polypeptide having a different property. The property may be a biological property, such as activity in vitro or in vivo. The property may also be a simple chemical or physical property, such as binding to a target molecule, catalysis of a reaction, etc. The two portions may be linked directly by a single peptide bond or through a peptide linker containing one or more amino acid residues. Generally, the two portions and the linker will be in reading frame with each other.","\u201cBinding affinity\u201d generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to intrinsic binding affinity that reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.","An \u201con-rate\u201d or \u201crate of association\u201d or \u201cassociation rate\u201d or \u201ck\u201d according to this invention can be determined with the surface plasmon resonance technique using a BIACORE\u00ae-2000 or a BIACORE\u00ae-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) optical biosensor at 25\u00b0 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at \u02dc10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 ug\/ml (\u02dc0.2 \u03bcM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcl\/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of 1M ethanolamine to block unreacted groups, for kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% TWEEN\u2122 20 (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bcl\/min. Association rates (k) and dissociation rates (k) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE\u00ae Evaluation Software version 3.2\u2122) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\/k. See, e.g., Chen et al., 293:865-881 (1999). However, if the on-rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate is preferably determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0 C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophotometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO\u2122 spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.","The \u201cKd\u201d or \u201cKd value\u201d according to this invention is, in one embodiment, measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of the antibody and antigen molecule as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (Chen et al., 293:865-881 (1999)). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 \u03bcg\/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w\/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23\u00b0 C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (consistent with assessment of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., 57:4593-4599 (1997)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature for one hour. The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% TWEEN\u2033-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 \u03bcl\/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT\u2122 gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.","The phrase \u201csubstantially similar\u201d or \u201csubstantially the same,\u201d as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (generally one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference\/comparator antibody) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and\/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is preferably less than about 50%, more preferably less than about 40%, still more preferably less than about 30%, even more preferably less than about 20%, and most preferably less than about 10% as a function of the value for the reference\/comparator antibody.","The phrase \u201csubstantially reduced,\u201d or \u201csubstantially different,\u201d as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference\/comparator antibody) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values, HAMA response). The difference between said two values is preferably greater than about 10%, more preferably greater than about 20%, still more preferably greater than about 30%, even more preferably greater than about 40%, and most preferably greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference\/comparator antibody.","\u201cPercent (%) amino acid sequence identity\u201d and \u201chomology\u201d with respect to a peptide or polypeptide sequence are defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide or polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, or MEGALIGN\u2122 (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2, authored by Genentech, Inc. The source code of ALIGN-2 has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.","In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows:\n\n100 times the fraction X\/Y\n\nwhere X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described herein using the ALIGN-2 computer program.\n","A \u201cdisorder\u201d is any condition that would benefit from treatment with an antibody or method of the invention, regardless of mechanism, but including inhibiting or blocking the action of LT\u03b13 or LT\u03b1\u03b2 and\/or by depleting LT\u03b1-positive cells. This condition includes, but is not limited to, a medical condition or illness mediated by or related to elevated expression or activity, or abnormal activation, of LT\u03b13 and\/or LT\u03b1\u03b2 by any cell. This includes chronic and acute disorders such as those pathological conditions that predispose the mammal to the disorder in question.","An \u201cautoimmune disorder\u201d herein is a disease or disorder arising from and directed against an individual's own tissues or organs or a co-segregate or manifestation thereof or resulting condition therefrom. In many of these autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, a number of clinical and laboratory markers may exist, including, but not limited to, hypergammaglobulinemia, high levels of autoantibodies, antigen-antibody complex deposits in tissues, benefit from corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatments, and lymphoid cell aggregates in affected tissues. Without being limited to any one theory regarding B-cell mediated autoimmune disorder, it is believed that B cells demonstrate a pathogenic effect in human autoimmune diseases through a multitude of mechanistic pathways, including autoantibody production, immune complex formation, dendritic and T-cell activation, cytokine synthesis, direct chemokine release, and providing a nidus for ectopic neo-lymphogenesis. Each of these pathways may participate to different degrees in the pathology of autoimmune diseases.","As used herein, an \u201cautoimmune disorder\u201d can be an organ-specific disease (i.e., the immune response is specifically directed against an organ system such as the endocrine system, the hematopoietic system, the skin, the cardiopulmonary system, the gastrointestinal and liver systems, the renal system, the thyroid, the ears, the neuromuscular system, the central nervous system, etc.) or a systemic disease that can affect multiple organ systems (for example, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, etc.).

the 2000 revised American Rheumatoid Association criteria for the classification of RA, or any similar criteria, and includes active, early, and incipient RA, as defined below. Physiological indicators of RA include symmetric joint swelling, which is characteristic though not invariable in rheumatoid arthritis. Fusiform swelling of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the hands as well as metacarpophalangeal (MCP), wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints are commonly affected and swelling is easily detected. Pain on passive motion is the most sensitive test for joint inflammation, and inflammation and structural deformity often limit the range of motion for the affected joint. Typical visible changes include ulnar deviation of the fingers at the MCP joints, hyperextension, or hyperflexion of the MCP and PIP joints, flexion contractures of the elbows, and subluxation of the carpal bones and toes. The subject with RA may be resistant to DMARDs, in that the DMARDs are not effective or fully effective in treating symptoms. Further candidates for therapy according to this invention include those who have experienced an inadequate response to previous or current treatment with TNF inhibitors such as etanercept, infliximab, and\/or adalimumab because of toxicity or inadequate efficacy (for example, etanercept for 3 months at 25 mg twice a week or at least 4 infusions of infliximab at 3 mg\/kg).","A patient with \u201cactive rheumatoid arthritis\u201d means a patient with active and not latent symptoms of RA. Subjects with \u201cearly active rheumatoid arthritis\u201d are those subjects with active RA diagnosed for at least eight weeks but no longer than four years, according to the revised 1987 ACR criteria for the classification of RA. Subjects with \u201cearly rheumatoid arthritis\u201d are those subjects with RA diagnosed for at least eight weeks but no longer than four years, according to the revised 1987 ACR criteria for classification of RA. Early RA includes, for example, juvenile-onset RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), or juvenile RA (JRA).","Patients with \u201cincipient RA\u201d have early polyarthritis that does not fully meet ACR criteria for a diagnosis of RA, but is associated with the presence of RA-specific prognostic biomarkers such as anti-CCP and shared epitope. They include patients with positive anti-CCP antibodies who present with polyarthritis, but do not yet have a diagnosis of RA, and are at high risk for going on to develop bona fide ACR criteria RA (95% probability).","\u201cJoint damage\u201d is used in the broadest sense and refers to damage or partial or complete destruction to any part of one or more joints, including the connective tissue and cartilage, where damage includes structural and\/or functional damage of any cause, and may or may not cause joint pain\/arthalgia. It includes, without limitation, joint damage associated with or resulting from inflammatory joint disease as well as non-inflammatory joint disease. This damage may be caused by any condition, such as an autoimmune disease, especially arthritis, and most especially RA. Exemplary such conditions include acute and chronic arthritis, RA including juvenile-onset RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), or juvenile RA (JRA), and stages such as rheumatoid synovitis, gout or gouty arthritis, acute immunological arthritis, chronic inflammatory arthritis, degenerative arthritis, type II collagen-induced arthritis, infectious arthritis, septic arthritis, Lyme arthritis, proliferative arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Still's disease, vertebral arthritis, osteoarthritis, arthritis chronica progrediente, arthritis deformans, polyarthritis chronica primaria, reactive arthritis, menopausal arthritis, estrogen-depletion arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis\/rheumatoid spondylitis), rheumatic autoimmune disease other than RA, and significant systemic involvement secondary to RA (including but not limited to vasculitis, pulmonary fibrosis or Felty's syndrome). For purposes herein, joints are points of contact between elements of a skeleton (of a vertebrate such as an animal) with the parts that surround and support it and include, but are not limited to, for example, hips, joints between the vertebrae of the spine, joints between the spine and pelvis (sacroiliac joints), joints where the tendons and ligaments attach to bones, joints between the ribs and spine, shoulders, knees, feet, elbows, hands, fingers, ankles, and toes, but especially joints in the hands and feet.","As used herein, \u201ctreatment\u201d refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishing of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, prevention of metastasis, decreasing of the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder. A subject is successfully \u201ctreated\u201d for example, for an autoimmune disorder if, after receiving a therapeutic amount of an antibody of the invention according to the methods of the present invention, the subject shows observable and\/or measurable reduction in or absence of one or more signs and symptoms of the particular disease.","In one preferred embodiment of successful treatment, the antibody induces a major clinical response in a subject with RA. For purposes herein, a \u201cmajor clinical response\u201d is defined as achieving an American College of Rheumatology 70 response (ACR 70) for six consecutive months. ACR response scores are categorized as ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70, with ACR 70 being the highest level of sign and symptom control in this evaluation system. ACR response scores measure improvement in RA disease activity, including joint swelling and tenderness, pain, level of disability, and overall patient and physician assessment. An example of a different type of antibody that induces a major clinical response as recognized by the FDA and as defined herein is etanercept (ENBREL\u00ae).","An \u201ceffective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.","A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of a medicament herein may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the medicament, e.g., antibody, to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the drug in question, e.g., antibody, are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily, since a prophylactic Dose is Used in Subjects Prior to or at an Earlier Stage of Disease, the Prophylactically Effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.","The term \u201ccytotoxic agent\u201d as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and\/or causes destruction of cells.

Fold difference in binding affinity can be quantified in terms of the ratio of the monovalent binding affinity value of a humanized antibody (e.g., in Fab form) and the monovalent binding affinity value of a reference\/comparator antibody (e.g., in Fab form) (e.g., a murine antibody having donor CDR sequences), wherein the binding affinity values are determined under similar assay conditions.","Thus, in one embodiment, the fold difference in binding affinity is determined as the ratio of the Kd values of the humanized antibody in Fab form and said reference\/comparator Fab antibody. For example, in one embodiment, if an antibody of the invention (A) has an affinity that is \u201cthree-fold lower\u201d than the affinity of a reference antibody (M), then if the Kd value for A is 3\u00d7, the Kd value of M would be 1\u00d7, and the ratio of Kd of A to Kd of M would be 3:1. Conversely, in one embodiment, if an antibody of the invention (C) has an affinity that is \u201cthree-fold greater\u201d than the affinity of a reference antibody (R), then if the Kd value for C is 1\u00d7, the Kd value of R would be 3\u00d7, and the ratio of Kd of C to Kd of R would be 1:3. Any assays known in the art, including those described herein, can be used to obtain binding affinity measurements, including, for example, an optical biosensor that uses SPR (BIACORE\u00ae technology), RIA, and ELISA. Preferably, the measurement is by optical biosensor or radioimmunoassay.","The antibodies herein are preferably chimeric or humanized, more preferably humanized, and still more preferably antibodies wherein at least a portion of their framework sequence is a human consensus framework sequence.","Another embodiment herein is an anti-idiotype antibody that specifically binds the antibody herein.","Monoclonal Antibodies","Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567).","In the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized as described above to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. After immunization, lymphocytes are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, , pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)).","The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium which medium preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells (also referred to as fusion partner). For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.","Preferred fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 and derivatives, e.g., X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, 133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et al., , pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).","Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as RIA or ELISA.","The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al., 107:220 (1980).","Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and\/or activity are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal , pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal, e.g, by i.p. injection of the cells into mice.","The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, affinity chromatography (e.g., using protein A or protein G-SEPHAROSE\u2122 medium) or ion-exchange chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, etc.","DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as cells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al., 5:256-262 (1993) and Pl\u00fcckthun, 130:151-188 (1992).","In a further embodiment, monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., 348:552-554 (1990). Clackson et al., 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., 222:581-597 (1991) describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high-affinity (nM range) human antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al., 10:779-783 (1992)), as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et al., 21:2265-2266 (1993)). Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.","The DNA that encodes the antibody may be modified to produce chimeric or fusion antibody polypeptides, for example, by substituting human heavy-chain and light-chain constant-domain (Cand C) sequences for the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 and Morrison, et al., 81:6851 (1984)), or by fusing the immunoglobulin coding sequence with all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide (heterologous polypeptide). The non-immunoglobulin polypeptide sequences can substitute for the constant domains of an antibody, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.","Humanized Antibodies","The present invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are known in the art. For example, a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source that is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as \u201cimport\u201d residues, which are typically taken from an \u201cimport\u201d variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al. 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al. 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al. 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such \u201chumanized\u201d antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.","The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called \u201cbest-fit\u201d method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence that is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., 151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al., 196:901 (1987). Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al. 151:2623 (1993).","It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to one method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available that illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.","The humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment, such as a Fab, which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent(s) in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively, the humanized antibody may be a full-length antibody, such as a full-length IgG1 antibody.","Human Antibodies and Phage Display Methodology","As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated. For example, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (J) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array into such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., 362:255-258 (1993); Bruggemann et al., 7:33 (1993); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,806, 5,569,825, 5,591,669 (all of GenPharm); and 5,545,807; and WO 1997\/17852.","Alternatively, phage-display technology (McCafferty et al., 348:552-553 (1990)) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the LT\u03b1 cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats, reviewed in, e.g, Johnson and Chiswell, 3:564-571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al., 352:624-628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al., 222:581-597 (1991) or Griffith et al., 12:725-734 (1993). See, also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332 and 5,573,905.","As discussed above, human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,567,610 and 5,229,275).","Antibody Fragments","In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments, rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance, and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.","Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al, 24:107-117 (1992) and Brennan et al., 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from , thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab\u2032-SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F(ab\u2032)fragments (Carter et al., 10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab\u2032)fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(ab\u2032)fragment with increased in vivo half-life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See, e.g., WO 1993\/16185; U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,894; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,458. Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. The antibody fragment may also be a \u201clinear antibody\u201d, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.","Bispecific Antibodies","Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the LT\u03b1 protein. Other such antibodies may combine a LT\u03b1 binding site with a binding site for another protein. Alternatively, an anti-LT\u03b1 arm may be combined with an arm that binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g. CD3), or Fc receptors for IgG (Fc\u03b3R), such as Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) and Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16), or NKG2D or other NK-cell-activating ligand, so as to focus and localize cellular defense mechanisms to the LT\u03b2-expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells that express LT\u03b1. These antibodies possess a LT\u03b1-binding arm and an arm that binds the cytotoxic agent (e.g., saporin, anti-interferon-\u03b1, vinca alkaloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten). Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full-length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., F(ab\u2032)bispecific antibodies).","WO 1996\/16673 describes a bispecific anti-ErbB2\/anti-Fc\u03b3RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,234 discloses a bispecific anti-ErbB2\/anti-Fc\u03b3RI antibody. A bispecific anti-ErbB2\/Fc\u03b1 antibody is shown in WO 1998\/02463. U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337 teaches a bispecific anti-ErbB2\/anti-CD3 antibody.","Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full-length bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain\/light-chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Millstein et al., 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of ten different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 1993\/08829, and in Traunecker et al., 10:3655-3659 (1991).","According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant-domain sequences. Preferably, the fusion is with an Ig heavy-chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, C2, and C3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (C1) containing the site necessary for light-chain bonding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy-chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains into a single expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios have no significant effect on the yield of the desired chain combination.","In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy-chain\/light-chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 1994\/04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., 121:210 (1986).","In another approach (U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168), the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers that are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g., tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory \u201ccavities\u201d of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g., alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.","Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or \u201cheteroconjugate\u201d antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 1991\/00360, WO 1992\/20373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.","Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., 229: 81 (1985) describes a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab\u2032)fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent, sodium arsenite, to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab\u2032 fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab\u2032-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab\u2032-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab\u2032-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.","Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab\u2032-SH fragments from , which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., 175: 217-225 (1992) describes the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab\u2032)molecule. Each Fab\u2032 fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.","Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., 148(5): 1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab\u2032 portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The \u201cdiabody\u201d technology described by Holliger et al., 90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a Vconnected to a Vby a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the Vand Vdomains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary Vand Vdomains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al., 152:5368 (1994).","Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al., 147: 60 (1991).","Multivalent Antibodies","A multivalent antibody may be internalized (and\/or catabolized) faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies (which are other than of the IgM class) with three or more antigen-binding sites (e.g., tetravalent antibodies), which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen-binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises (or consists of) an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario, the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino-terminal to the Fc region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises (or consists of) three to about eight, but preferably four, antigen-binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain (and preferably two polypeptide chains), wherein the polypeptide chain(s) comprise two or more variable domains. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise VD1-(X1)-VD2-(X2)-Fc, wherein VD1 is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region, X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide, and n is 0 or 1. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise: VH-CH1-flexible linker-VH-CH1-Fc region chain; or VH-CH1-VH-CH1-Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two (and preferably four) light chain variable-domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may, for instance, comprise from about two to about eight light-chain variable-domain polypeptides. The light-chain variable-domain polypeptides contemplated herein comprise a light-chain variable-domain and, optionally, further comprise a CL domain.","Vectors, Host Cells, and Recombinant Methods","Selection and Transformation of Host Cells","Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the recombinant monoclonal antibodies, immunoadhesins, and other polypeptide antagonists described herein are prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryotic cells. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as , e.g., , e.g., , e.g., , and , as well as Bacilli such as and (e.g., 41P disclosed in DD 266,710 published 12 Apr. 1989), such as , and . One preferred cloning host is 294 (ATCC 31,446), although other strains such as B, X1776 (ATCC 31,537), and W3110 (ATCC 27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.","Full-length antibody, antibody fragments, and antibody fusion proteins can be produced in bacteria, in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector functions are not needed, such as when the therapeutic antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a toxin) and the immunoconjugate by itself shows effectiveness in tumor cell destruction. Full-length antibodies have greater half life in circulation. Production in is faster and more cost efficient. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,648,237; 5,789,199; and 5,840,523, which describe translation-initiation region (TIR) and signal sequences for optimizing expression and secretion. After expression, the antibody is isolated from the cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be purified through, e.g., a protein A or G column depending on the isotype. Final purification can be carried out similar to the process for purifying antibody expressed e.g, in CHO cells. For general monoclonal antibody production, see also U.S. Pat. No. 7,011,974.","In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody-encoding, such as LT\u03b1-antibody-encoding, vectors. , or common baker's yeast, is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms.

A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available, e.g., the L-1 variant of NPV and the Bm-5 strain of NPV, and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention, particularly for transfection of cells.","Plant cell cultures of cotton, corn, potato, soybean, petunia, tomato, and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts.","However, interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure.

In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al., 58:44 (1979), Barnes et al., 102:255 (1980), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 1990\/03430; WO 1987\/00195; or US Re. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and\/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN\u2122 drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.","In one particular aspect, a suitable medium contains a basal medium component such as a DMEM\/HAM F-12 based formulation (for composition of DMEM and HAM F12 media and especially serum-free media, see culture media formulations in the , Sixth Edition, 1988, pages 346-349) (the formulations of medium as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,469 may be appropriate) with suitably modified, if necessary, concentrations of some components such as amino acids, salts, sugar, and vitamins, and optionally containing glycine, hypoxanthine, and thymidine; recombinant human insulin, hydrolyzed peptone, such as PROTEASE PEPTONE 2 and 3\u2122, PRIMATONE HS\u2122 or PRIMATONE RL\u2122 (Difco, USA; Sheffield, England), or the equivalent; a cell-protective agent, such as PLURONIC F68\u2122 or the equivalent PLURONIC\u2122 polyol; GENTAMYCIN\u2122 antibiotic; and trace elements. Preferably the cell culture media is serum free.","In one aspect of the invention, antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large-scale fed-batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large-scale fermentations have at least about 1000 liters of capacity, preferably about 1,000 to 100,000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients, especially glucose (the preferred carbon\/energy source). Small-scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity, and can range from about one liter to about 100 liters.","In a fermentation process, induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density, e.g., an ODof about 180-220, at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12-50 hours, although longer or shorter induction time may be used.","To improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention, various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example, to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides, additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins, such as Dsb proteins (DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD and or DsbG) or FkpA (a peptidylprolyl cis,trans-isomerase with chaperone activity) can be used to co-transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al., 274:19601-19605 (1999); U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,083,715 and 6,027,888; Bothmann and Pluckthun, 275:17100-17105 (2000); Ramm and Pluckthun, 275:17106-17113 (2000); and Arie et al., 39:199-210 (2001).","To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins (especially those that are proteolytically sensitive), certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example, host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation(s) in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III, OmpT, DegP, Tsp, Protease I, Protease Mi, Protease V, Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some protease-deficient strains are available and described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,264,365; 5,508,192; and Hara et al., 2:63-72 (1996).","In one embodiment, strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system herein.","Purification of Antibody","When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, are removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an AMICON\u2122 or MILLIPORE PELLICON\u2122 ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride (PMSF) may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis, and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.","In one embodiment, the antibody protein produced herein is further purified to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous for further assays and uses. Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures: hydroxylapatite chromatography, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE\u2122, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, fractionation on immunoaffinity columns, ethanol precipitation, reverse-phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on an anion- or cation-exchange resin (such as DEAE or a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration using, for example, SEPHADEX\u2122 G-75 resin. Affinity chromatography is a preferred purification technique. For analytical-scale purification, smaller volumes are passed through columns and used; for preparative- or commercial-scale purification to produce quantities of antibody useful in therapeutic applications, larger volumes are employed. The skilled artisan will understand which scale should be used for which application. Preferably, preparative scale is employed for this invention.","The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human \u03b31, \u03b32, or \u03b34 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., 62:1-13 (1983)). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human \u03b33 (Guss et al., 5:15671575 (1986)). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled-pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C3 domain, the BAKERBOND ABX\u2122 resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification.","For Protein A chromatography, the solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized is preferably a column comprising a glass or silica surface, more preferably a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications, the column has been coated with a reagent, such as glycerol, to prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants. The solid phase is then washed to remove contaminants non-specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally, the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.","Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic-interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0 to 0.25M salt).","Generating Variant Antibodies Exhibiting Reduced or Absence of HAMA Response","Reduction or elimination of a HAMA response is a significant aspect of clinical development of suitable therapeutic agents. See, e.g., Khaxzaeli et al., 80:937 (1988); Jaffers et al., 41:572 (1986); Shawler et al., 135:1530 (1985); Sears et al., 3:138 (1984); Miller et al., 62:988 (1983); Hakimi et al., 147:1352 (1991); Reichmann et al., 332:323 (1988); and Junghans et al., 50:1495 (1990). In some embodiments herein, the invention provides antibodies that are humanized such that HAMA response is reduced or eliminated. Variants of these antibodies can further be obtained using routine methods known in the art, some of which are further described below.","For example, an amino acid sequence from an antibody as described herein can serve as a starting (parent) sequence for diversification of the framework and\/or CDR sequence(s). A selected framework sequence to which a starting CDR sequence is linked is referred to herein as an acceptor human framework. While the acceptor human frameworks may be from, or derived from, a human immunoglobulin (the VL and\/or VH regions thereof), preferably the acceptor human frameworks are from, or derived from, a human consensus framework sequence, as such frameworks have been demonstrated to have minimal, or no, immunogenicity in human patients.","Where the acceptor is derived from a human immunoglobulin, one may optionally select a human framework sequence based on its homology to the donor framework sequence by aligning the donor framework sequence with various human framework sequences in a collection of human framework sequences and selecting the most homologous framework sequence as the acceptor.","In one embodiment, human consensus frameworks herein are from, or derived from, VH subgroup III and\/or VL kappa subgroup I consensus framework sequences.","Thus, the VH acceptor human framework may comprise one, two, three, or all of the following framework sequences:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0346","num":"0355"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"FR1

the acceptor may be identical in sequence to the human framework sequence selected, whether that be from a human immunoglobulin or a human consensus framework, the present invention contemplates that the acceptor sequence may comprise pre-existing amino acid substitutions relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or human consensus framework sequence. These pre-existing substitutions are preferably minimal, usually only four, three, two, or one amino acid difference relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or consensus framework sequence.","CDR residues of the non-human antibody are incorporated into the VL and\/or VH acceptor human frameworks. For example, one may incorporate residues corresponding to the Kabat CDR residues, the Chothia hypervariable loop residues, the AbM residues, and\/or the contact residues. Optionally, the extended CDR residues as follows are incorporated: 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3), 26-35 (H1), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and 93-102, 94-102, or 95-102 (H3).","\u201cIncorporation\u201d of CDR residues can be achieved in various ways, e.g., nucleic acid encoding the desired amino acid sequence can be generated by mutating nucleic acid encoding the mouse variable domain sequence so that the framework residues thereof are changed to acceptor human framework residues, or by mutating nucleic acid encoding the human variable domain sequence so that the CDR residues are changed to non-human residues, or by synthesizing nucleic acid encoding the desired sequence, etc.","CDR-grafted variants may be generated by Kunkel mutagenesis of nucleic acid encoding the human acceptor sequences, using a separate oligonucleotide for each CDR. Kunkel et al., 154:367-382 (1987). Appropriate changes can be introduced within the framework and\/or CDR, using routine techniques, to correct and re-establish proper CDR-antigen interactions.","Phage(mid) display (also referred to herein as phage display in some contexts) can be used as a convenient and fast method for generating and screening many different potential variant antibodies in a library generated by sequence randomization. However, other methods for making and screening altered antibodies are available to the skilled person.","Phage(mid) display technology has provided a powerful tool for generating and selecting novel proteins that bind to a ligand, such as an antigen. Using the techniques of phage(mid) display allows the generation of large libraries of protein variants that can be rapidly sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Nucleic acids encoding variant polypeptides are generally fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a viral coat protein, such as the gene III protein or the gene VIII protein. Monovalent phagemid display systems where the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein or polypeptide is fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of the gene III protein have been developed. (Bass, 8:309 (1990); Lowman and Wells, 3:205 (1991)). In a monovalent phagemid display system, the gene fusion is expressed at low levels and wild-type gene III proteins are also expressed so that infectivity of the particles is retained. Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening those libraries have been disclosed in many patents (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,723,286; 5,432,018; 5,580,717; 5,427,908; and 5,498,530).","Libraries of antibodies have been prepared in a number of ways including by altering a single gene by inserting random DNA sequences or cloning a family of related genes. Methods for displaying antibodies or antigen-binding fragments using phage(mid) display are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,750,373; 5,733,743; 5,837,242; 5,969,108; 6,172,197; 5,580,717; and 5,658,727. The library is then screened for expression of antibodies or antigen-binding proteins with the desired characteristics.","The sequence of oligonucleotides includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the CDR residues to be altered. A codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. Codon sets can be represented using symbols to designate particular nucleotides or equimolar mixtures of nucleotides as shown below according to the IUB code.","IUB Codes","G Guanine","A Adenine","T Thymine","C Cytosine","R (A or G)","Y (C or T)","M (A or C)","K (G or T)","S(C or G)","W (A or T)","H (A or C or T)","B (C or G or T)","V (A or C or G)","D (A or G or T) H","N (A or C or G or T)","For example, in the codon set DVK, D can be nucleotides A or G or T; V can be A or G or C; and K can be G or T. This codon set can present 18 different codons and can encode amino acids Ala, Trp, Tyr, Lys, Thr, Asn, Lys, Ser, Arg, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Cys.","Oligonucleotide or primer sets can be synthesized using standard methods. A set of oligonucleotides can be synthesized, for example, by solid-phase synthesis, containing sequences that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will encode the desired group of amino acids. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide \u201cdegeneracy\u201d at certain positions is well known in that art. Such sets of nucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers (available from, for example, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), or can be obtained commercially (for example, from Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.). Therefore, a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences, the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides, as used herein, have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable-domain nucleic acid template and also can include restriction enzyme sites for cloning purposes.","In one method, nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids can be created by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis. This technique is well known in the art as described by Zoller et al. 10:6487-6504 (1987). Briefly, nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids are created by hybridizing an oligonucleotide set encoding the desired codon sets to a DNA template, where the template is the single-stranded form of the plasmid containing a variable-region nucleic acid template sequence. After hybridization, DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that will thus incorporate the oligonucleotide primer, and will contain the codon sets as provided by the oligonucleotide set.","Generally, oligonucleotides of at least 25 nucleotides in length are used. An optimal oligonucleotide will have 12 to 15 nucleotides that are completely complementary to the template on either side of the nucleotide(s) coding for the mutation(s). This ensures that the oligonucleotide will hybridize properly to the single-stranded DNA template molecule. The oligonucleotides are readily synthesized using techniques known in the art such as that in Crea et al., 75:5765 (1978).","The DNA template is generated by those vectors that are derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors (the commercially available M13mp18 and M13mp19 vectors are suitable), or that contain a single-stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al., 153:3 (1987). Thus, the DNA to be mutated can be inserted into one of these vectors to generate single-stranded template. Production of the single-stranded template is described in sections 4.21-4.41 of Sambrook et al., supra.","To alter the native DNA sequence, the oligonucleotide is hybridized to the single stranded template under suitable hybridization conditions. A DNA-polymerizing enzyme, for example, T7 DNA polymerase or the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, is then added to synthesize the complementary strand of the template using the oligonucleotide as a primer for synthesis. A heteroduplex molecule is thus formed such that one strand of DNA encodes the mutated form of gene 1, and the other strand (the original template) encodes the native, unaltered sequence of gene 1. This heteroduplex molecule is then transformed into a suitable host cell, usually a prokaryote such as JM101. After growing the cells, they are plated onto agarose plates and screened using the oligonucleotide primer radiolabeled with a P phosphate to identify the bacterial colonies that contain the mutated DNA.","The method described immediately above may be modified such that a homoduplex molecule is created wherein both strands of the plasmid contain the mutation(s). The modifications are as follows: The single-stranded oligonucleotide is annealed to the single-stranded template as described above. A mixture of three deoxyribonucleotides, deoxyriboadenosine (dATP), deoxyriboguanosine (dGTP), and deoxyribothymidine (dTT), is combined with a modified thiodeoxyribocytosine called dCTP-(aS) (which can be obtained from Amersham). This mixture is added to the template-oligonucleotide complex. Upon addition of DNA polymerase to this mixture, a strand of DNA identical to the template except for the mutated bases is generated. In addition, this new strand of DNA will contain dCTP-(aS) instead of dCTP, which serves to protect it from restriction endonuclease digestion. After the template strand of the double-stranded heteroduplex is nicked with an appropriate restriction enzyme, the template strand can be digested with ExoIII nuclease or another appropriate nuclease past the region that contains the site(s) to be mutagenized. The reaction is then stopped to leave a molecule that is only partially single-stranded. A complete double-stranded DNA homoduplex is then formed using DNA polymerase in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, ATP, and DNA ligase. This homoduplex molecule can then be transformed into a suitable host cell.","As indicated previously, the sequence of the oligonucleotide set is of sufficient length to hybridize to the template nucleic acid and may also, but does not necessarily, contain restriction sites. The DNA template can be generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors or vectors that contain a single-stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. 153:3 (1987). Thus, the DNA that is to be mutated must be inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single-stranded template. Production of the single-stranded template is described in sections 4.21-4.41 of Sambrook et al., supra.","In another method, a library can be generated by providing upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets, each set having a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences. These sequences are established by the codon sets provided within the sequence of the oligonucleotides. The upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets, along with a variable-domain template nucleic acid sequence, can be used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate a \u201clibrary\u201d of PCR products. The PCR products can be referred to as \u201cnucleic acid cassettes\u201d, as they can be fused with other related or unrelated nucleic acid sequences, for example, viral coat proteins and dimerization domains, using established molecular biology techniques.","The sequence of the PCR primers includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the solvent-accessible and highly diverse positions in a CDR. As described above, a codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids.","Antibody selectants that meet the desired criteria, as selected through appropriate screening\/selection steps, can be isolated and cloned using standard recombinant techniques.","Activity Assays","The antibodies of the present invention can be characterized for their physical\/chemical properties and biological functions by various assays known in the art.","The purified immunoglobulins can be further characterized by a series of assays including, but not limited to, N-terminal sequencing, amino-acid analysis, non-denaturing size-exclusion high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry, ion-exchange chromatography, and papain digestion.","In certain embodiments of the invention, the antibodies produced herein are analyzed for their biological activity. In some embodiments, the antibodies herein are tested for their antigen-binding activity. The antigen-binding assays known in the art and useful herein include, without limitation, any direct or competitive-binding assays using techniques such as Western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, fluorescent immunoassays, and protein A immunoassays.","In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates an altered antibody that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desired candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important, yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments, the Fc activities of the produced immunoglobulin are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and\/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction\/depletion of CDC and\/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc\u03b3R binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc\u03b3RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, 9:457-92 (1991). An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337. Useful effector cells for such assays include PBMCs and NK cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. () 95:652-656 (1998). C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g., as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., 202:163 (1996), may be performed. FcRn binding and in vivo clearance\/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art.","Antibody Variants","In some embodiments, amino-acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and\/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and\/or insertions into and\/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced into the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that the sequence is made.","A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called \u201calanine-scanning mutagenesis\u201d as described by Cunningham and Wells, 244:1081-1085 (1989). Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.","Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and\/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g., for ADEPT) or a polypeptide that increases the serum half-life of the antibody.","Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the CDRs, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table A under the heading of \u201cpreferred substitutions.\u201d If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated \u201cexemplary substitutions\u201d in Table A, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0392","num":"0401"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE A"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Original","Exemplary","Preferred"]},{"entry":["Residue","Substitutions","Substitutions"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Ala (A)","Val; Leu; Ile","Val"]},{"entry":["Arg (R)","Lys; Gln; Asn","Lys"]},{"entry":["Asn (N)","Gln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg","Gln"]},{"entry":["Asp (D)","Glu; Asn","Glu"]},{"entry":["Cys (C)","Ser; Ala","Ser"]},{"entry":["Gln (Q)","Asn; Glu","Asn"]},{"entry":["Glu (E)","Asp; Gln","Asp"]},{"entry":["Gly (G)","Ala","Ala"]},{"entry":["His (H)","Asn; Gln; Lys; Arg","Arg"]},{"entry":["Ile (I)","Leu; Val; Met; Ala; Phe; Norleucine","Leu"]},{"entry":["Leu (L)","Norleucine; Ile; Val; Met; Ala; Phe","Ile"]},{"entry":["Lys (K)","Arg; Gln; Asn","Arg"]},{"entry":["Met (M)","Leu; Phe; Ile","Leu"]},{"entry":["Phe (F)","Trp; Leu; Val; Ile; Ala; Tyr","Tyr"]},{"entry":["Pro (P)","Ala","Ala"]},{"entry":["Ser (S)","Thr","Thr"]},{"entry":["Thr (T)","Val; Ser","Ser"]},{"entry":["Trp (W)","Tyr; Phe","Tyr"]},{"entry":["Tyr (Y)","Trp; Phe; Thr; Ser","Phe"]},{"entry":["Val (V)","Ile; Leu; Met; Phe; Ala; Norleucine","Leu"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains (as described, for example, in A. L. Lehninger, 73-75, Worth Publishers, New York (1975)):\n\n","Alternatively, naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n","Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or, more preferably, into the remaining (non-conserved) sites.","One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more CDR residues of a parent antibody (e.g., a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several CDR sites (e.g., 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g., binding affinity) as herein disclosed. For location of candidate CDR sites for modification, alanine-scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify CDR residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.","Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.","The antibodies of the present invention preferably have the native-sequence Fc region. However, it may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications into an Fc region thereof, generating a Fc-region variant. The Fc-region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g., a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild-type counterpart. Such amino acid substitutions may, e.g., improve or reduce other Fc function or further improve the same Fc function, increase antigen-binding affinity, increase stability, alter glycosylation, or include allotypic variants. The antibodies may further comprise one or more amino acid substitutions in the Fc region that result in the antibody exhibiting one or more of the properties selected from increased Fc\u03b3R binding, increased ADCC, increased CDC, decreased CDC, increased ADCC and CDC function, increased ADCC but decreased CDC function (e.g., to minimize infusion reaction), increased FcRn binding, and increased serum half life, as compared to the same antibodies that have the wild-type Fc region. These activities can be measured by the methods described herein. For example, see WO 1999\/51642. See also Duncan and Winter, 322:738-40 (1988); U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,260; U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; and WO 1994\/29351 concerning other examples of Fcregion variants.","For additional amino acid alterations that improve Fc function, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,056. Any of the antibodies of the present invention may further comprise at least one amino acid substitution in the Fc region that decreases CDC activity, for example, comprising at least the substitution K322A. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,624 (Idusogie et al.).","In another preferred embodiment, the antibody has amino acid substitutions at any one or any combination of positions that are 268D, or 298A, or 326D, or 333A, or 334A, or 298A together with 333A, or 298A together with 334A, or 239D together with 332E, or 239D together with 298A and 332E, or 239D together with 268D and 298A and 332E, or 239D together with 268D and 298A and 326A and 332A, or 239D together with 268D and 298A and 326A and 332E, or 239D together with 268D and 283L and 298A and 332E, or 239D together with 268D and 283L and 298A and 326A and 332E, or 239D together with 330L and 332E and 272Y and 254T and 256E, or 250Q together with 428L, or 265A, or 297A, wherein the 265A substitution is in the absence of 297A and the 297A substitution is in the absence of 265A. The letter after the number in each of these designations represents the changed amino acid at that position.","Mutations that improve ADCC and CDC include substitutions at one to three positions of the Fc region, including positions 298, 333, and\/or 334 of the Fc region (Eu numbering of residues), especially S298A together with E333A and K334A (S298A\/E333A\/K334A, or synonymously a combination of 298A, 333A, and 334A), also referred to herein as the triple Ala mutant. K334L increases binding to CD16. K322A results in reduced CDC activity; K326A or K326W enhances CDC activity. D265A results in reduced ADCC activity.","Stability variants are variants that show improved stability with respect to, e.g., oxidation and deamidation.","A further type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody. Such altering includes deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, and\/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody. Glycosylation variants that increase ADCC function are described, e.g., in WO 2003\/035835. See also US 2006\/0067930.","Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.","Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).","Where the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example, antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US 2003\/0157108 (Presta). See also US 2004\/0093621 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd). Antibodies with a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in, e.g., WO 2003\/011878, Jean-Mairet et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684 (Umana et al.). Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported, for example, in WO 1997\/30087 (Patel et al.).

Specifically, antibodies are contemplated herein that have reduced fusose relative to the amount of fucose on the same antibody produced in a wild-type CHO cell. That is, they are characterized by having a lower amount of fucose than they would otherwise have if produced by native CHO cells. Preferably the antibody is one wherein less than about 10% of the N-linked glycans thereon comprise fucose, more preferably wherein less than about 5% of the N-linked glycans thereon comprise fucose, and most preferably, wherein none of the N-linked glycans thereon comprise fucose, i.e., wherein the antibody is completely without fucose, or has no fucose.","Such \u201cdefucosylated\u201d or \u201cfucose-deficient\u201d antibodies may be produced, for example, by culturing the antibodies in a cell line such as that disclosed in, for example, US 2003\/0157108; WO 2000\/61739; WO 2001\/29246; US 2003\/0115614; US 2002\/0164328; US 2004\/0093621; US 2004\/0132140; US 2004\/0110704; US 2004\/0110282; US 2004\/0109865; WO 2003\/085119; WO 2003\/084570; WO 2005\/035586; WO 2005\/035778; WO2005\/053742; US 2006\/0063254; US 2006\/0064781; US 2006\/0078990; US 2006\/0078991; Okazaki et al. 336:1239-1249 (2004); and Yamane-Ohnuki et al., 87: 614 (2004).

In addition, the composition is preferably one wherein the antibody has been produced by a CHO cell, preferably a Lec13 cell. The composition is also preferably one wherein the antibody has been produced by a mammalian cell lacking a fucosyltransferase gene, more preferably the FUT8 gene.","In one aspect, the composition is one wherein the antibody is free of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) attached to the mature core carbohydrate structure. Alternatively, the composition is such that the antibody has bisecting GlcNAc attached to the mature core carbohydrate structure.","In another aspect, the composition is one wherein the antibody has one or more galactose residues attached to the mature core carbohydrate structure.

The composition even more preferably comprises at least about 19% afucosylated antibodies. The composition most preferably comprises about 100% afucosylated antibodies.","Immunoconjugates","The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates, or antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a drug, a growth-inhibitory agent, a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).","The use of antibody-drug conjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, e.g., drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer (Syrigos and Epenetos, 19:605-614 (1999); Niculescu-Duvaz and Springer, 26:151-172 (1997); and U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278) allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, and intracellular accumulation therein, where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (Baldwin et al., 603-05 (1986); Thorpe, \u201cAntibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,\u201d in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, A. Pinchera et al. (eds), pp. 475-506 (1985)). Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies (Rowland et al., 21:183-87 (1986)). Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vindesine. Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant toxins such as ricin, small-molecule toxins such as geldanamycin (Mandler et al., 92(19):1573-1581 (2000); Mandler et al., & 10:1025-1028 (2000); and Mandler et al., 13: 786-791 (2002)), maytansinoids (EP 1391213 and Liu et al., 93: 8618-8623 (1996)), and calicheamicin (Lode et al., 58:2928 (1998); and Hinman et al., Cancer Res., 53:3336-3342 (1993)). Without being limited to any one theory, the toxins may exert their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.","Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from ), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, proteins, dianthin proteins, proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi, I, In, Y, and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., 238: 1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See, for example, WO 1994\/11026.","Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small-molecule toxins, such as a calicheamicin, maytansinoid, trichothecene, and CC1065, and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity, are also contemplated herein.","In the ADCs of the invention, an antibody (Ab) is conjugated to one or more drug moieties (D), e.g., about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody, through a linker (L). The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent, to form Ab-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with a drug moiety D; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent, to form D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody.\n\nAb-(L-D)\u2003\u2003Formula I\n","Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side-chain amine groups, e.g., lysine, (iii) side-chain thiol groups, e.g., cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; and (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e., cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.","Antibody-drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g., with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups that may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g., by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Domen et al., 510: 293-302 (1990)). In another embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan and Stroh, 3:138-146 (1992) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,852). Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.","Likewise, nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; and (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.","Alternatively, a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g., by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide that does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.","In yet another embodiment, the antibody may be conjugated to a \u201creceptor\u201d (such as streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pre-targeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a \u201cligand\u201d (e.g., avidin) that is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide).","The ADCs herein are optionally prepared with cross-linker reagents, such as, for example, BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH, SBAP, SIA, SIAB, SMCC, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SIAB, sulfo-SMCC, sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyl-(4-vinylsulfone)benzoate), which are commercially available (e.g., from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, Ill., U.S.A). See pages 467-498, 2003-2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.","Antibody Derivatives","The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably, the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water-soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of water-soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol\/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene\/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene oxide\/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer is attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and\/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc.","Pharmaceutical Formulations","Therapeutic formulations of the antibodies used in accordance with the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing an antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers (16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low-molecular-weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose, or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and\/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122, or polyethylene glycol (PEG).","A further formulation and delivery method herein involves that described, for example, in WO 2004\/078140, including the ENHANZE\u2122 drug delivery technology (Halozyme Inc.). This technology is based on a recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20). rHuPH20 is a recombinant form of the naturally occurring human enzyme approved by the FDA that temporarily clears space in the matrix of tissues such as skin. That is, the enzyme has the ability to break down hyaluronic acid (HA), the space-filling \u201cgel\u201d-like substance that is a major component of tissues throughout the body. This clearing activity is expected to allow rHuPH20 to improve drug delivery by enhancing the entry of therapeutic molecules through the subcutaneous space. Hence, when combined or co-formulated with certain injectable drugs, this technology can act as a \u201cmolecular machete\u201d to facilitate the penetration and dispersion of these drugs by temporarily opening flow channels under the skin. Molecules as large as 200 nanometers may pass freely through the perforated extracellular matrix, which recovers its normal density within approximately 24 hours, leading to a drug delivery platform that does not permanently alter the architecture of the skin.","Hence, the present invention includes a method of delivering an antibody herein to a tissue containing excess amounts of glycosaminoglycan, comprising administering a hyaluronidase glycoprotein (sHASEGP) (this protein comprising a neutral active soluble hyaluronidase polypeptide and at least one N-linked sugar moiety, wherein the N-linked sugar moiety is covalently attached to an asparagine residue of the polypeptide) to the tissue in an amount sufficient to degrade glycosaminoglycans sufficiently to open channels less than about 500 nanometers in diameter; and administering the antibody to the tissue comprising the degraded glycosaminoglycans.","In another embodiment, the invention includes a method for increasing the diffusion of an antibody herein that is administered to a subject comprising administering to the subject a sHASEGP polypeptide in an amount sufficient to open or to form channels smaller than the diameter of the antibody and administering the antibody, whereby the diffusion of the therapeutic substance is increased. The sHASEGP and antibody may be administered separately or simultaneously in one formulation, and consecutively in either order or at the same time.","Exemplary anti-LT\u03b1 antibody formulations are described in WO 1998\/56418, which include a liquid multidose formulation comprising the anti-LT\u03b1 antibody at 40 mg\/mL, 25 mM acetate, 150 mM trehalose, 0.9% benzyl alcohol, 0.02% polysorbate 20 at pH 5.0 that has a minimum shelf life of two years storage at 2-8\u00b0 C. Another anti-LT\u03b1 formulation of interest comprises 10 mg\/mL antibody in 9.0 mg\/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg\/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.7 mg\/mL POLYSORBATE 80\u2122 surfactant, and Sterile Water for Injection, pH 6.5. Yet another aqueous pharmaceutical formulation comprises 10-30 mM sodium acetate from about pH 4.8 to about pH 5.5, preferably at pH 5.5, POLYSORBATE as a surfactant in an amount of about 0.01-0.1% v\/v, trehalose at an amount of about 2-10% w\/v, and benzyl alcohol as a preservative (U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,586). Lyophilized formulations adapted for subcutaneous administration are described, for example, in WO 1997\/04801 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,267,958 (Andya et al.). Such lyophilized formulations may be reconstituted with a suitable diluent to a high protein concentration and the reconstituted formulation may be administered subcutaneously to the mammal to be treated herein.","Crystallized forms of the antibody are also contemplated. See, for example, US 2002\/0136719 (Shenoy et al.).","The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound (a second medicament as noted above) as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, it may be desirable to further provide a cytotoxic agent, chemotherapeutic agent, cytokine antagonist, integrin antagonist, or immunosuppressive agent (e.g., one that acts on T cells, such as cyclosporin or an antibody that binds T cells, e.g., one that binds LFA-1). The type and effective amounts of such second medicaments depend, for example, on the amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disease or disorder or treatment, the clinical parameters of the subjects, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein or from about 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages. The preferred such medicaments are noted above.","The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug-delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles, and nanocapsules), or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed, for example, in 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).","Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and \u03b3 ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","The formulations to be used for in-vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.","Uses","An antibody of the present invention may be used in, for example, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo therapeutic methods. Antibodies of the invention can be used as an antagonist to partially or fully block the specific LT\u03b1 activity in vitro, ex vivo, and\/or in vivo. Moreover, at least some of the antibodies of the invention can neutralize antigen activity from other species. Accordingly, the antibodies of the invention can be used to inhibit a specific antigen activity, e.g., in a cell culture containing the antigen, in human subjects, or in other mammalian subjects having the antigen with which an antibody of the invention cross-reacts (e.g., chimpanzee, baboon, marmoset, cynomolgus, rhesus, pig, or mouse). In one embodiment, the antibody of the invention can be used for inhibiting antigen activities by contacting the antibody with the antigen such that antigen activity is inhibited. Preferably, the antigen is a human protein molecule.","In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention can be used in a method for inhibiting an antigen in a subject suffering from a disorder in which the antigen activity is detrimental, comprising administering to the subject an antibody of the invention such that the antigen activity in the subject is inhibited. Preferably, the antigen is a human protein molecule and the subject is a human subject. Alternatively, the subject can be a mammal expressing the antigen to which an antibody of the invention binds. Still further, the subject can be a mammal into which the antigen has been introduced (e.g., by administration of the antigen or by expression of an antigen transgene). An antibody of the invention can be administered to a human subject for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, an antibody of the invention can be administered to a non-human mammal expressing an antigen with which the immunoglobulin cross-reacts (e.g., a primate, pig, or mouse) for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter, such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of the invention (e.g., testing of dosages and time courses of administration). The antibodies of the invention can be used to treat, inhibit, delay progression of, prevent\/delay recurrence of, ameliorate, or prevent autoimmune diseases, disorders, or conditions as defined herein.","In one aspect, a blocking antibody of the invention is specific to a ligand antigen, and inhibits the antigen activity by blocking or interfering with the ligand-receptor interaction involving the ligand antigen, thereby inhibiting the corresponding signal pathway and other molecular or cellular events. The invention also features receptor-specific antibodies that do not necessarily prevent ligand binding but interfere with receptor activation, thereby inhibiting any responses that would normally be initiated by the ligand binding. The invention also encompasses antibodies that either preferably or exclusively bind to ligand-receptor complexes. An antibody of the invention can also act as an agonist of a particular antigen receptor, thereby potentiating, enhancing, or activating either all or partial activities of the ligand-mediated receptor activation.","The antibody may be a naked antibody or alternatively is conjugated with another molecule, such as a cytotoxic agent. The antibody is preferably administered intravenously or subcutaneously, most preferably subcutaneously.","In one embodiment, the subject has never been previously treated with drug(s), such as immunosuppressive agent(s), to treat the disorder, and in a particular embodiment has never been previously treated with a TNF antagonist. In an alternative embodiment, the subject has been previously treated with drug(s) to treat the disorder, including with a TNF antagonist.","In a still further aspect, the patient has relapsed with the disorder. In an alternative embodiment, the patient has not relapsed with the disorder.","In another aspect, the antibody herein is the only medicament administered to the subject to treat the disorder. In an alternative aspect, the antibody herein is one of the medicaments used to treat the disorder.","In a further aspect, the subject only has RA as an autoimmune disorder. Alternatively, the subject only has MS as an autoimmune disorder. Still alternatively, the subject only has lupus, or ANCA-associated vasculitis, or Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome as an autoimmune disorder. In all cases autoimmune disorder is defined above.","In a still further embodiment, the subject has an abnormal level of one or more regulatory cytokines, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-rheumatoid factor (RF) antibodies, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, anti-endothelial antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), infiltrating CD20 cells, anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, anti-Sm antibodies, anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, anti-ribosomal P antibodies, anti-Ro\/SS-A antibodies, anti-Ro antibodies, anti-La antibodies, antibodies directed against Sj\u00f6gren's-associated antigen A or B (SS-A or SS-B), antibodies directed against centromere protein B (CENP B) or centromere protein C (CENP C), autoantibodies to ICA69, anti-Smith antigen (Sm) antibodies, anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibodies, anti-ribosomal P antibodies, autoantibodies staining the nuclear or perinuclear zone of neutrophils (pANCA), anti-antibodies, cross-reactive antibodies to GM1 ganglioside or GQ1b ganglioside, anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR), anti-AchR subtype, or anti-muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies, serum anti-endothelial cell antibodies, IgG or anti-desmoglein (Dsg) antibodies, anti-centromere, anti-topoisomerase-1 (Scl-70), anti-RNA polymerase or anti-U3-ribonucleoprotein (U3-RNP) antibodies, anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies, anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies, anti-mitochondrial (AMA) or anti-mitochondrial M2 antibodies, anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO), anti-thyroglobin (TG) or anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antibodies, anti-nucleic (AN), anti-actin (AA) or anti-smooth muscle antigen (ASM) antibodies, IgA anti-endomysial, IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase, IgA anti-gliadin or IgG anti-gliadin antibodies, anti-CYP21A2, anti-CYP11A1 or anti-CYP17 antibodies, anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP), or myosytis-specific antibodies, anti-myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies, anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, anti-GM1 ganglioside, anti-sulfate-3-glycuronyl paragloboside (SGPG), or IgM anti-glycoconjugate antibodies, IgM anti-ganglioside antibody, anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO), anti-thyroglobin (TG) or anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antibodies, anti-myelin basic protein or anti-myelin oligodendrocytic glycoprotein antibodies, IgM rheumatoid factor antibodies directed against the Fc portion of IgG, anti-Factor VIII antibodies, or a combination thereof.","The parameters for assessing efficacy or success of treatment of an autoimmune disorder (which includes an autoimmune-related disease) will be known to the physician of skill in the appropriate disease. Generally, the physician of skill will look for reduction in the signs and symptoms of the specific disease. The following are by way of examples.","In one embodiment, the methods and compositions of the invention are useful to treat RA. RA is characterized by inflammation of multiple joints, cartilage loss, and bone erosion that leads to joint destruction and ultimately reduced joint function. Additionally, since RA is a systemic disease, it can have effects in other tissues such as the lungs, eyes, and bone marrow.","If the subject has RA, which is a preferred indication herein, preferably the antibodies herein induce a major clinical response in the subject.","The antibodies herein can be used as first-line therapy in patients with early RA (i.e., methotrexate (MTX) naive), or in combination with, e.g., MTX or cyclophosphamide. Alternatively, the antibodies can be used in treatment as second-line therapy for patients who were, for example, refractory to DMARD and\/or TNF inhibitor, and\/or MTX, in combination with, e.g., MTX. The LT\u03b1-binding antibodies can also be administered in combination with B-cell mobilizing agents such as integrin antibodies that mobilize B cells into the bloodstream for more effective killing. The LT\u03b2-binding antibodies are useful to prevent and control joint damage, delay structural damage, decrease pain associated with inflammation in RA, and generally reduce the signs and symptoms in moderate-to-severe RA. The RA patient can be treated with the LT\u03b1 antibody prior to, after, or together with treatment with other drugs used in treating RA (see combination therapy described herein). Patients who had previously failed DMARDs and\/or had an inadequate response to MTX alone are, in one embodiment, treated with a LT\u03b1-binding antibody. In another embodiment, such patients are administered humanized LT\u03b1-binding antibody plus cyclophosphamide or LT\u03b1-binding antibody plus MTX. Most preferably, the antibodies herein are administered with MTX for treatment of RA, and not with high-dose steroids.","One method of evaluating treatment efficacy in RA is based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, which are used to measure the percentage of improvement in tender and swollen joints, among other things. The RA patient can be scored at, for example, ACR 20 (20 percent improvement) compared with no antibody treatment (e.g, baseline before treatment) or treatment with placebo. Other ways of evaluating the efficacy of antibody treatment include X-ray scoring such as the Sharp X-ray score used to score structural damage such as bone erosion and joint space narrowing. Patients can also be evaluated for the prevention of or improvement in disability based on Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, AIMS score, or SF-36 at time periods during or after treatment. The ACR 20 criteria may include 20% improvement in both tender (painful) joint count and swollen joint count plus a 20% improvement in at least three of five additional measures:\n\n","The ACR 50 and 70 are defined analogously. Preferably, the patient is administered an amount of an LT\u03b1-binding antibody of the invention effective to achieve at least a score of ACR 20, preferably at least ACR 30, more preferably at least ACR 50, even more preferably at least ACR 70, and most preferably at least ACR 75.","Psoriatic arthritis has unique and distinct radiographic features. For psoriatic arthritis, joint erosion and joint space narrowing can be evaluated by the Sharp score as well. The antibodies disclosed herein can be used to prevent the joint damage as well as reduce disease signs and symptoms of the disorder.","Yet another aspect of the invention is a method of treating lupus, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis, by administering to the subject having such disease an effective amount of an antibody of the invention. For example, SLEDAI scores provide a numerical quantitation of disease activity. The SLEDAI is a weighted index of 24 clinical and laboratory parameters known to correlate with disease activity, with a numerical range of 0-103. See Gescuk and Davis, 14: 515-521 (2002). Antibodies to double-stranded DNA are believed to cause renal flares and other manifestations of lupus. Patients undergoing antibody treatment can be monitored for time to renal flare, which is defined as a significant, reproducible increase in serum creatinine, urine protein, or blood in the urine. Alternatively or in addition, patients can be monitored for levels of antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA. Treatments for SLE include high-dose corticosteroids and\/or cyclophosphamide (HDCC).","Spondyloarthropathies are a group of disorders of the joints, including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn's disease. Treatment success can be determined by validated patient and physician global assessment measuring tools.","Various medications are used to treat psoriasis; treatment differs directly in relation to disease severity. Patients with a more mild form of psoriasis typically utilize topical treatments, such as topical steroids, anthralin, calcipotriene, clobetasol, and tazarotene, to manage the disease, while patients with moderate and severe psoriasis are more likely to employ systemic (methotrexate, retinoids, cyclosporine, PUVA, and UVB) therapies. Tars are also used. These therapies are disadvantageous due to safety concerns, time-consuming regimens, and\/or inconvenient processes of treatment. Furthermore, some require expensive equipment and dedicated space in the office setting. Such systemic medications can produce serious side effects, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bone-marrow suppression, liver disease, kidney disease, and gastrointestinal upset. Also, the use of phototherapy can increase the incidence of skin cancers. In addition to the inconvenience and discomfort associated with the use of topical therapies, phototherapy and such systemic treatments also require cycling patients on and off therapy and monitoring lifetime exposure due to their side effects.","Treatment efficacy for psoriasis is assessed by monitoring changes in clinical signs and symptoms of the disease, including Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) changes, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores, and Psoriasis Symptom Assessment (PSA), compared with the baseline condition. The patient can be measured periodically throughout treatment on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) used to indicate the degree of itching experienced at specific time points.","Assays","Ligand\/receptor binding studies may be carried out in any known assay method, such as competitive-binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays. Cell-based assays and animal models can be used to understand the interaction between the ligands and receptors identified herein and the development and pathogenesis of the conditions and diseases referred to herein.","In one approach, mammalian cells may be transfected with the ligands or receptors described herein, and the ability of the antibody herein to inhibit binding or activity is analyzed. Suitable cells can be transfected with the desired gene, and monitored for activity. Such transfected cell lines can then be used to test the ability of antibody, for example, to modulate LT\u03b1\u03b2 complex expression of the cells.","In addition, primary cultures derived from transgenic animals can be used in the cell-based assays. Techniques to derive continuous cell lines from transgenic animals are well known in the art. See, e.g., Small et al., 5:642-648 (1985).","One suitable cell-based assay is the addition of epitope-tagged ligand (e.g., LT\u03b1) to cells that have or express the respective receptor, and the analysis of binding (in the presence or absence of prospective antibodies) by FACS staining with anti-tag antibody. In another assay, the ability of the antibody herein to inhibit the expression of LT\u03b1\u03b2 complex on cells expressing such complex is assayed. For example, suitable expressing cell lines are cultured in the presence or absence of prospective antibodies and the modulation of LT\u03b1\u03b2 complex expression can be measured by H-thymidine incorporation or cell number.","The results of the cell-based in vitro assays can be further verified using in vivo animal models. Many animal models can be used to test the efficacy of the antibodies identified herein in relation to, for instance, immune-related disease. The in vivo nature of such models makes them particularly predictive of responses in human patients. Animal models of immune-related diseases include both non-recombinant and recombinant (transgenic) animals. Non-recombinant animal models include, for example, rodent, e.g., murine models. Such models can be generated by introducing cells into syngeneic mice using standard techniques, e.g. subcutaneous injection, tail-vein injection, spleen implantation, intraperitoneal implantation, and implantation under the renal capsule.","Graft-versus-host disease is an example of a disease for which an animal model has been designed. Graft-versus-host disease occurs when immunocompetent cells are transplanted into immunosuppressed or tolerant patients. The donor cells recognize and respond to host antigens. The response can vary from life-threatening severe inflammation to mild cases of diarrhea and weight loss. Graft-versus-host disease models provide a means of assessing T-cell reactivity against MHC antigens and minor transplant antigens. A suitable procedure is described in detail in , Eds. Cologan et al., (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994), unit 4.3.","An animal model for skin allograft rejection tests the ability of T cells to mediate in vivo tissue destruction to measure their role in anti-viral immunity, and is described, for example, in , supra, unit 4.4. Other transplant rejection models useful to test the antibodies herein include the allogeneic heart-transplant models described by Tanabe et al., 58:23 (1994) and Tinubu et al., 4330-4338 (1994).","Animal models for delayed-type hypersensitivity provide an assay of cell-mediated immune function. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions are a T-cell-mediated in vivo immune response characterized by inflammation that does not reach a peak until after a period of time has elapsed after challenge with an antigen. These reactions also occur in tissue-specific autoimmune diseases such as MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, a model for MS). A suitable, exemplary model is described in detail in , supra, unit 4.5.","The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model is considered a suitable model for studying potential drugs or biologics active in human arthritis because of the many immunological and pathological similarities to human RA, the involvement of localized major histocompatibility, complete class-II-restricted T-helper lymphocyte activation, and the similarity of histological lesions. Features of this CIA model that are similar to that found in RA patients include: erosion of cartilage and bone at joint margins (as can be seen in radiographs), proliferative synovitis, and symmetrical involvement of small and medium-sized peripheral joints in the appendicular, but not the axial, skeleton. Jamieson et al., 20: 324-9 (1985). Furthermore, IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 appear to be involved in CIA as well as in RA. Joosten et al., 163: 5049-5055 (1999). TNF-neutralizing antibodies, and separately, TNFR.Fc, reduced the symptoms of RA in this model (Williams et al., 89:9784-9788 (1992); Wooley et al., 151: 6602-6607 (1993)).","In this model for RA, type II collagen is purified from bovine articular cartilage (Miller, 11:4903 (1972)) and used to immunized mice (Williams et al, 91:2762 (1994)). Symptoms of arthritis include erythema and\/or swelling of the limbs as well as erosions or defects in cartilage and bone as determined by histology. This widely used model is also described, for example, by Holmdahl et al., 97:575 (1989), in , supra, units 15.5, and in Issekutz et al., 88:569 (1996).","A model of asthma has been described in which antigen-induced airway hyper-reactivity, pulmonary eosinophilia, and inflammation are induced by sensitizing an animal with ovalbumin and challenging the animal with the same protein delivered by aerosol. Animal models such as rodent and non-human primate models exhibit symptoms similar to atopic asthma in humans upon challenge with aerosol antigens. Suitable procedures to test the antibodies herein for suitability in treating asthma include those described by Wolyniec et al., 18:777 (1998).","Additionally, the antibodies herein can be tested in the SCID\/SCID mouse model for immune disorders. For example, as described by Schon et al., 3:183 (1997), the mice demonstrate histopathologic skin lesions resembling psoriasis. Another suitable model is the human skin\/SCID mouse chimera prepared as described by Nickoloff et al., 146:580 (1995).","Dosage","For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention (when used alone or in combination with a second medicament as noted below) will depend, for example, on the type of disease to be treated, the type of antibody, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The dosage is preferably efficacious for the treatment of that indication while minimizing toxicity and side effects.","The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 500 mg\/kg (preferably about 0.1 mg\/kg to 400 mg\/kg) of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 500 mg\/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg\/kg to about 400 mg\/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5 mg\/kg, 2.0 mg\/kg, 4.0 mg\/kg or 10 mg\/kg or 50 mg\/kg or 100 mg\/kg or 300 mg\/kg or 400 mg\/kg (or any combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, e.g., every week or every three weeks (e.g., such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, e.g., about six doses of the antibody). An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses, may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 to 500 mg\/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 to 400 mg\/kg of the antibody. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.","For the treatment of an autoimmune disorder, the therapeutically effective dosage will typically be in the range of about 50 mg\/mto about 3000 mg\/m, preferably about 50 to 1500 mg\/m, more preferably about 50-1000 mg\/m. In one embodiment, the dosage range is about 125-700 mg\/m. For treating RA, in one embodiment, the dosage range for the humanized antibody is about 50 mg\/mor 125 mg\/m(equivalent to about 200 mg\/dose) to about 1000 mg\/m, given in two doses, e.g., the first dose of about 200 mg is administered on day one followed by a second dose of about 200 mg on day 15. In different embodiments, the dosage is about any one of 50 mg\/dose, 80 mg\/dose, 100 mg\/dose, 125 mg\/dose, 150 mg\/dose, 200 mg\/dose, 250 mg\/dose, 275 mg\/dose, 300 mg\/dose, 325 mg\/dose, 350 mg\/dose, 375 mg\/dose, 400 mg\/dose, 425 mg\/dose, 450 mg\/dose, 475 mg\/dose, 500 mg\/dose, 525 mg\/dose, 550 mg\/dose, 575 mg\/dose, or 600 mg\/dose, or 700 mg\/dose, or 800 mg\/dose, or 900 mg\/dose, or 1000 mg\/dose, or 1500 mg\/dose.","In treating disease, the LT\u03b1-binding antibodies of the invention can be administered to the patient chronically or intermittently, as determined by the physician of skill in the disease.","A patient administered a drug by intravenous infusion or subcutaneously may experience adverse events such as fever, chills, burning sensation, asthenia, and headache. To alleviate or minimize such adverse events, the patient may receive an initial conditioning dose(s) of the antibody followed by a therapeutic dose. The conditioning dose(s) will be lower than the therapeutic dose to condition the patient to tolerate higher dosages.","The antibodies herein may be administered at a frequency that is within the skill and judgment of the practicing physician, depending on various factors noted above, for example, the dosing amount. This frequency includes twice a week, three times a week, once a week, bi-weekly, or once a month, In a preferred aspect of this method, the antibody is administered no more than about once every other week, more preferably about once a month.","Route of Administration","The antibodies used in the methods of the invention (as well as any second medicaments) are administered to a subject or patient, including a human patient, in accord with suitable methods, such as those known to medical practitioners, depending on many factors, including whether the dosing is acute or chronic. These routes include, for example, parenteral, intravenous administration, e.g., as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intra-arterial, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, intracerebrospinal, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, intralesional, or inhalation routes (e.g., intranasal). Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In addition, the antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Preferred routes herein are intravenous or subcutaneous administration, most preferably subcutaneous.","In one embodiment, the antibody herein is administered by intravenous infusion, and more preferably with about 0.9 to 20% sodium chloride solution as an infusion vehicle.","Combination Therapy","In any of the methods herein, one may administer to the subject or patient along with the antibody herein an effective amount of a second medicament (where the antibody herein is a first medicament), which is another active agent that can treat the condition in the subject that requires treatment; for example, if the condition is an autoimmune disorder, the second medicament is a drug that can treat the autoimmune disorder, alone or with another active agent. For treatment of autoimmune disorders, the second medicament includes, for example, a chemotherapeutic agent, an immunosuppressive agent, an antagonist (such as an antibody) that binds a B-cell surface marker such as rituximab or humanized 2H7, a BAFF antagonist, a DMARD, a cytotoxic agent, an integrin antagonist such as a CD11 or CD18 antagonist including CD11a or CD18 antibodies, e.g., efalizumab (RAPTIVA\u00ae), a NSAID, a cytokine antagonist, such as a TNF antagonist, an anti-rheumatic agent, a muscle relaxant, a narcotic, an analgesic, an anesthetic, a sedative, a local anesthetic, a neuromuscular blocker, an antimicrobial, an antipsoriatic, a corticosteriod, an anabolic steroid, an erythropoietin, an immunizing agent, an immunoglobulin, a radiopharmaceutical, an antidepressant, an antipsychotic, a stimulant, an asthma medication, a beta agonist, an inhaled steroid, an epinephrine, a cytokine, cells for repressing B-cell autoantibody secretion as set forth in WO 2005\/027841, a hyaluronidase glycoprotein as an active delivery vehicle as set forth in, for example, WO 2004\/078140, or a combination thereof.","For treatment of proliferative diseases such as cancer, the second medicament would include, for example, chemotherapeutic agents, hormones, cytotoxic agents, and other biologics such as antibodies to HER-2, to VEGF, to B-cell surface antigens such as TAHO antigen (e.g., US 2006\/0251662), CD20, and CD22, and to EGF\/EGF-R.","Preferably, such second medicament for autoimmune diseases is an immunosuppressive agent, an antagonist that binds a B-cell surface marker (such as an antibody, e.g., CD20 antibody or CD22 antibody), a BAFF antagonist, a DMARD, an integrin antagonist, a hyaluronidase glycoprotein (as an active delivery vehicle), a NSAID, a cytokine antagonist, more preferably a TNF (e.g., TNF-alpha), CD11, or CD18 antagonist, or a combination thereof. More preferably, it is methotrexate, a TNF antagonist, an antagonist to a B-cell surface marker, or a DMARD.","The type of such second medicament depends on various factors, including the type of autoimmune disorder, the severity of the disease, the condition and age of the patient, the type and dose of first medicament employed, etc.","The antibodies herein can be administered concurrently, sequentially, or alternating with the second medicament or upon non-responsiveness with other therapy. Thus, the combined administration of a second medicament includes co-administration (concurrent administration), using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) medicaments simultaneously exert their biological activities. All these second medicaments may be used in combination with each other or by themselves with the first medicament, so that the expression \u201csecond medicament\u201d as used herein does not mean it is the only medicament besides the first medicament, respectively. Thus, the second medicament need not be one medicament, but may constitute or comprise more than one such drug.","These second medicaments as set forth herein are generally used in the same dosages and with the same administration routes as the first medicaments, or from about 1 to 99% of the dosages of the first medicaments. If such second medicaments are used at all, preferably, they are used in lower amounts than if the first medicament were not present, especially in subsequent dosings beyond the initial dosing with the first medicament, so as to eliminate or reduce side effects caused thereby.","For the treatment of RA, for example, the patient can be treated with an antibody of the invention in conjunction with any one or more of the following drugs: integrin antagonists, DMARDs (e.g., MTX), NSAIDs, cytokine inhibitors such as HUMIRA\u2122 (adalimumab; Abbott Laboratories), ARAVA\u00ae (leflunomide), REMICADE\u00ae (infliximab; Centocor Inc., of Malvern, Pa.), ENBREL\u00ae (etanercept; Immunex, WA), corticosteroids, or COX-2 inhibitors. DMARDs commonly used in RA include hydroxycloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, etanercept, infliximab, azathioprine, D-penicillamine, Gold (oral), Gold (intramuscular), minocycline, cyclosporine, or Staphylococcal protein A immunoadsorption. Adalimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to TNF\u03b1. Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to TNF\u03b1. Etanercept is an \u201cimmunoadhesin\u201d fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand binding portion of the human 75 kD (p75) tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) linked to the Fc portion of a human IgG1. For conventional treatment of RA, see, e.g., American College of Rheumatology Subcommittee on Rheumatoid Arthritis Guidelines, & 46(2): 328-346 (2002). In a specific embodiment, the RA patient is treated with an LT\u03b1 antibody of the invention in conjunction with MTX. An exemplary dosage of MTX is about 7.5-25 mg\/kg\/wk. MTX can be administered orally and subcutaneously.","For the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn's disease, the patient can be treated with an antibody of the invention in conjunction with, for example, REMICADE\u00ae (infliximab; from Centocor Inc., Malvern, Pa.) or ENBREL\u00ae (etanercept; Amgen, Calif.).","Treatments for SLE include high-dose corticosteroids and\/or cyclophosphamide (HDCC) in conjunction with the antibodies herein.","For the treatment of psoriasis, patients can be administered a LT\u03b2-binding antibody in conjunction with topical treatments, such as topical steroids, anthralin, calcipotriene, clobetasol, and tazarotene, or with MTX, retinoids, cyclosporine, PUVA and UVB therapies, and integrin antagonists such as anti-CD11a or anti-CD 18 antibodies, including, e.g., efalizumab (RAPTIVA\u00ae). In one embodiment, the psoriasis patient is treated with the LT\u03b1-binding antibody sequentially or concurrently with cyclosporine or with efalizumab.","In certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprising the antibody herein conjugated with a cytotoxic agent is administered to the patient. In some embodiments, the immunoconjugate and\/or antigen to which it is bound is\/are internalized by the cell, resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the target cell to which it binds. In one embodiment, the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with nucleic acid in the target cell. Examples of such cytotoxic agents include any of the chemotherapeutic agents noted herein (such as a maytansinoid or a calicheamicin), a radioactive isotope, a ribonuclease, or a DNA endonuclease.","Articles of Manufacture","In another embodiment of the invention, articles of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above are provided. In one aspect, the article of manufacture comprises (a) a container comprising the antibodies herein (preferably the container comprises the antibody and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent within the container); and (b) a package insert with instructions for treating the disorder in a patient.","In a preferred embodiment, the article of manufacture herein further comprises a container comprising a second medicament, wherein the antibody is a first medicament.

It is understood that various other embodiments may be practiced, given the general description provided above. The disclosures of all citations in the specification are expressly incorporated herein by reference.","Anti-human LT\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies 2C8 and 3F12 were generated as follows: BALB\/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Del.) were hyperimmunized by injection with 5 \u03bcg\/dose of purified recombinant human LT\u03b1 expressed in (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif.; Genentech Lot #8360-2B; see also Spriggs, \u201cTumor Necrosis Factor: Basic Principles and Preclinical Studies,\u201d , DeVita et al., eds., J.B. Lippincott Company (1991) Ch. 16, pp. 354-377; Ruddle, 4:327-332 (1992); Wong et al., \u201cTumor Necrosis Factor,\u201d , Academic Press (1989), pp. 195-215; Aggarwal et al., , Wiley-Liss, Inc. 1990, pp. 375-384; and Paul et al., 6:407-438 (1988)) in DETOX\u2122 adjuvant (RIBI ImmunoChem Research, Inc., Hamilton, Mo.). Specifically, 10 \u03bcg LT\u03b13 was mixed with 50 \u03bcL of the adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into the rear footpads of mice (strain BALB\/c) on days 1, 4, 15, 29, 41, 56, and 71. Serum was collected on Days 15 and 56 for detection of anti-LT\u03b13-specific antibodies by binding ELISA.","On day 75, the animals were sacrificed, spleens were harvested, and 3\u00d710E7 cells were fused with 5\u00d710E7 cells of the mouse myeloma line X63-Ag8.653 using 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 by an established procedure (Oi and Herzenberg, in , B. Mishel and S. Schiigi, eds., (W.J.Freeman Co., San Francisco, Calif., 1980)). The fused cells were plated into 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 2\u00d710E5 cells\/well containing HAT medium for selection (Littlefield, 145:709 (1964)). After 12 days, the supernatants were harvested and screened for antibody production by direct ELISA. The supernatants harvested from each hybridoma lineage were purified by affinity chromatography (Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC); Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The purified antibody preparations were then sterile filtered (0.2-\u03bcm pore size; Nalgene, Rochester N.Y.) and stored at 4\u00b0 C. in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).","Anti-murine LT\u03b1 monoclonal antibody S5H3 was generated as follows: Armenian hamsters were immunized with recombinant mouse LT\u03b12\u03b21 (R&D Systems Inc. (1008-LY)). The hamsters were immunized with 2 \u03bcg of antigen by footpad for 12 injections, with an IP boost of 2 \u03bcg of antigen once. The lymph nodes and spleen were fused by PEG treatment. Primary screening was done by ELISA on Immunogen-vs. Genentech-manufactured murine LT\u03b1-6His (murine LT\u03b1 with six histidines attached at the C-terminal end). Detection was done with peroxidase-conjugated AFFINIPURE\u2122 goat anti-Armenian hamster IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch 127-035-160). Secondary screening was performed by FACS on irrelevant transfected HEK 293 cells vs. HEK 293 cells stably transfected with murine LT\u03b1\u03b2 (under G418 selection). Detection was performed using R-phycoerythrin-conjugated AFFINIPURE\u2122 F(ab\u2032)2 goat anti-Armenian hamster IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch 127-116-160). The hybridoma from which this antibody was derived was deposited with ATCC as Deposit No. PTA-7538 (hybridoma murine Lymphotoxin alpha2 beta1 s5H3.2.2).","All anti-murine and anti-human LT\u03b1 antibodies generated in these experiments were selected for recognition of LT\u03b13. These were then screened for (a) blocking of binding of LT\u03b13 to TNFR1 and TNFR11 by ELISA, (b) binding of LT\u03b1\u03b2 by ELISA and FACS of cells stably transfected with LT\u03b1 and LT\u03b2, and (c) blocking of LT\u03b1\u03b2 interaction with the LT\u03b2 receptor by ELISA. Antibodies 3F12, 2C8, and S5H3 were selected because they all bound and neutralized LT\u03b13 and LT\u03b1\u03b2.","For use in the murine in vivo studies described below, the hamster anti-murine LT\u03b1 hybridoma was cloned as a hamster\/mouse chimera. Total RNA was extracted from S5H3 hybridoma cells using a RNEASY MINI\u2122 kit (Qiagen) and the manufacturer's suggested protocol. RT-PCR was accomplished using a Qiagen ONE-STEP\u2122 kit, and primers were designed to amplify the light- and heavy-chain variable domains and add restriction enzyme sites for cloning.","For construction of the light chain of this chimeric antibody S5H3, two sequential cloning steps were used. In the first step, RT-PCR, ClaI and AscI sites were added, using primer set one, allowing cloning into a pRK-based vector simply to amplify DNA for sequencing. After the DNA sequence of the light-chain variable domain was obtained, a round of PCR was performed, using this plasmid as template, in order to add EcoRV and KpnI sites that are compatible with the expression vector.","For construction of the heavy chain of S5H3, likewise two cloning steps were used. Specifically, RT-PCR was used to amplify cDNA and add ClaI and AscI sites for cloning into a vector for sequencing. Subsequently, this plasmid was used as template for PCR to add BsiWI and ApaI sites that are compatible with the expression vector.","For RT-PCR, the primers used were as

The unadsorbed solution was aspirated from the wells. Wells were blocked with 200 \u03bcL PBS containing 5 mg\/ml bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA) for 2 hours. 50 \u03bcL of test sample appropriately diluted in PBS-BSA was added to each well, incubated for one hour, and washed with PBS containing 0.05% TWEEN-20\u2122 surfactant. 100 \u03bcL of horse radish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG in PBS-BSA buffer was added to each well and incubated for one hour. Each well was washed with PBS\/0.05% TWEEN-20\u2122 surfactant and then citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5, containing 0.1 mg o-phenylenediamine\/ml (substrate solution), and aqueous 30% HOwas added to each well. The wells were incubated for 30 minutes; then the reaction was stopped with 50 \u03bcL 2.5M sulfuric acid HSO, and absorbance was read at 490 nm.","The LT\u03b13-blocking ELISA, the LT\u03b1\u03b2-binding ELISA and FACS assays, and the LT\u03b1\u03b2-blocking ELISA were carried out by procedures described further below.","1. De Novo Sequencing of Anti-LT\u03b1 3F12 Using LTQ-FTMS-MS\/MS Analysis and Edman Degradation","Because the hybridoma cell line 3F12.2D3 was lost from the frozen cell line bank, anti-LT\u03b1 monoclonal antibody protein, purified from ascites 3F12.2D3, was submitted for sequencing at a concentration of about 3.0 mg\/mL in PBS. The antibody (Ab) was separated on 4-20% TRIS\u2122 HCl SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and each resolved heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) was subjected to N-terminal sequencing (25-30 residues were sequenced) to establish monoclonality. The HC was found to be blocked with a pyroglutamyl group that made the N-terminal amino acid inaccessible to Edman sequencing. The blocking group was subsequently removed using the pyroglutamate aminopeptidase enzyme (PGAP) and the HC chain subjected to sequencing again. Both the HC and LC were confirmed to be monoclonal. The Ab was then treated with various enzymatic and chemical cleavages according to a strategy described in 35:77-86 (2006). In brief, these consisted of the enzymes trypsin, endo Lys-C, Asp-N, and chemical treatments with CNBr and dilute acid (Asp\/Pro cleavage).","Chemical cleavages generated a mixture of peptides that were sequenced on model 494 PROCISE\u2122 sequencers and identified using Genentech's SEQSORT program (SEQSORT is a utility program designed to make the output produced by the programs in Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center's sequence analysis suite more manageable and readable). These chemical cleavages allowed identification of the constant region of the HC and LC by identity with antibodies in protein sequence databases. Peptides generated from the enzymatic digestions were collected from capillary RP-HPLC separations and the peptide masses measured using MALDI-TOF analysis. Peptides with masses that did not match the constant regions were subjected to further analysis using Edman degradation or liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) on an LTQ-FT mass spectrometer. Sequences of the variable regions of the HC and LC were derived from peptides with overlapping sequences obtained by the various proteolytic cleavages.","For analysis of the peptides by LC-MS\/MS a micro-capillary C18 reverse-phase chromatography column (0.15\u00d7150 mm i.d., 5 \u03bcm, 300 \u212b) was employed using a flow rate of 1 mL\/minute on an AGILENT\u2122 1100 series capillary LC system. Solvent A was applied, and a gradient from 2 to 80% solvent B was applied, solvent A consisting of 0.1% v\/v formic acid in water and solvent B consisting of 0.1% v\/v formic acid in acetonitrile. The LC was coupled in-line with the LTQ-FT mass spectrometer, and peptides with m\/z between 350 and 1800 were analyzed in data-dependent mode with the five most abundant species in each full mass range survey scan being selected for collision-induced dissociation (CID). The resulting CID spectra were screened with the search program MASCOT to find exact matches to database sequences, and potentially novel sequences were determined by manual de novo interpretation. Peptides that could not be completely sequenced or that contained the isobaric amino acid pairs of leucine\/isoleucine and glutamine\/lysine were analyzed further using Edman degradation.","A Fab portion of anti-LT\u03b1 was obtained from papain digestion of the intact antibody followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Masses of both heavy-chain and light-chain components of the Fab were obtained by quadruple-TOF mass spectrometry after inter-chain disulfides were reduced. The experimental masses corresponded to those calculated based on the obtained sequences of the heavy chain and light chain to within 0.5 Da each.","Sequence of anti-LT\u03b1 light chain for chimera 3F12.2D3:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0522","num":"0546"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"right"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200364)"},{"entry":"DIVMSQSPSSLAVSVGEKVTMSCKSSQSLLYSTXQKXFLAWYQQKPGQSP"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"KLLIYWASTRDSGVPDRFTGSGSGTDFTLTISSVKAEDLAVYYCQQYYSY"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"PRTFGGGTKLEIKRADAAPTVSIFPPSSEQLTSGGASVVCFLXXFYPKDI"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"XVKWKIDGSERQXGVLXSWTDQDSKDSTYSMSSTLTLTKDEYERHXSYTC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"EATHKTSTSPIVKSFXRXEC"}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0523","num":"0547"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00012","num":"00012"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"right"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200365)"},{"entry":"QGQLQQSGAELMKPGASVKISCKATGYTFSSYWIEWVKQRPGHGLEWIGE"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"ISPGSGSTXYXEEFKGKATFTADKSSXTAYIQLSSLSTSEDSAVYYCADG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"YHGYWGQGTTLTVSSAKTTPPSVYPLAPGCGDTTGSSVTLGCLVKGYFPE"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"SVTVTWXSGSLSSSVHTFPALLQSGLYTMSSSVTVPSSTWPSQTVTCSVA"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"HPASSTTVDKKLEPSGPIST"}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0524","num":"0548"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1D"]},"2.

Chronically inflamed synovium is usually accompanied by a massive CD4 T-cell infiltration (Pitzalis et al., 18:1397 (1988) and Morimoto et al., 84:817 (1988)).","Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is an animal model for human RA, which resembles human disease, and can be induced in susceptible strains of mice by immunization with heterologous type-II collagen (CII) (Courtenay et al., 283:665 (1980) and Cathcart et al., 54:26 (1986)). Both CD4 T cells and antibodies to CII are required to develop CIA. Transfer of anti-CII to na\u00efve animals only leads to partial histo-pathology that is quite different from CIA, and complete symptoms of CIA do not develop (Holmdahl et al., 19:295 (1986)). In contrast, adoptive transfer of both CD4 T cells and anti-CII antibodies from CII-immunized mice to na\u00efve recipients completely reconstitutes the symptoms of classical CIA (Seki et al., 148:3093 (1992)). Involvement of both T cells and antibodies in CIA is also consistent with histo-pathological findings of inflamed joints in CIA. Thus, agents that block B-cell or T-cell functions, or inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by T cells, may be efficacious to prevent or treat arthritis. Indeed, depletion of CD4 T cells, blockade of CD40-CD40L interactions, neutralization of TNF-\u03b1, or blocking of IL-1 receptors can lead to prevention of CIA in mice (Maini et al., 144:195 (1995); Joosten et al., 39:797 (1996); and Durie et al., 261:1328 (1993)).","In the CIA model used herein, DBA-1J mice were immunized with 100 \u03bcg bovine collagen type II in 100 \u03bcl of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) on Day 0 and Day 21 intradermally.

Depending on the environment and cytokine stimulation, CD4+ T cells differentiate into a Th1 or Th2 phenotype and become effector or memory cells (Sprent et al., supra and Murphy et al., 2(12):933-44 (2000)). This process is known as primary activation. Having undergone primary activation, CD4+ T cells become effector or memory cells, they maintain their phenotype as Th1 or Th2. Once these cells encounter antigen again, they undergo secondary activation, but this time the response to antigen will be quicker than the primary activation and results in the production of effector cytokines as determined by the primary activation (Sprent et al., supra, and Murphy et al., supra).","For primary activation conditions, na\u00efve T cells were activated by anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and specific cytokines depending on whether Th1 or Th2 was being examined.

Examples of cell lines producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation (Ripka et al., 249:533-545 (1986); US 2003\/0157108 A1 (Presta) and WO 2004\/056312 A1 (Adams et al., especially at Example 11), and knockout cell lines, such as alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase gene, FUT8, knock-out CHO cells (Yamane-Ohnuki et al. supra).","In fact, the antibody 2C8.vX was afucosylated to produce an antibody called anti-LTa 2C8.vX AF. This molecule was generated using a stable CHO cell line having a FUT8 knock-out gene as described by the method in Yamane-Ohnuki et al., supra It is 100% afucosylated.","The biophysical properties of 2C8.vX (including blocking and binding data) were not substantially changed upon afucosylation thereof, except for the ADCC. The ADCC properties of the wild-type and afucosylated molecules were determined by carrying out the experiments using the protocol set forth in Example 16 involving 293-LT\u03b11\u03b22 cells. The results are shown in . The figure shows that the afucosylated antibody anti-LT\u03b1 2C8.vX AF has about a ten-fold increase over the wild-type (WT) antibody (produced in a normal CHO cell line as described above).","As an alternative way to achieve high yields of non-fucosylated antibodies in mammalian cells, an RNAi approach may be employed to knock down the expression of the FUT8 gene. A plasmid may be used to produce short hairpin siRNA consisting of 19 nt (nucleotide) sense siRNA sequence specific to the gene of FUT8, linked to its reverse complementary antisense siRNA sequence by a short spacer (9nt hairpin loop), followed by 5-6 U's at the 3\u2032 end.","Four different RNAi probes are designed to target the different regions based on the available CHO FUT8 DNA sequence.","For testing the efficacy of these RNAi probes, a FLAG-tagged FUT8 fusion protein is constructed using the available CHO FUT8 DNA sequence (Genbank accession no. P_AAC63891). RT-PCR is performed with FUT8 primers and the resulting PCR fragment fused with 5\u2032 FLAG tag sequence. The tagged FUT8 fragment is cloned into an expression vector. The RNAi probe plasmid and flag-tagged FUT8 plasmid are cotransfected into CHO cells. Cell lysate is extracted 24 hours after transfection and the FUT8 fusion protein level analyzed using anti-flag M2 antibody by immuno-blotting. In the presence of RNAi probes, the fusion protein expression is expected to be significantly inhibited in most of the cases.","The two probes showing the best inhibitory effect are transfected into a CHO cell line expressing an antibody as described herein, such as 2C8.vX. The expressed anti-LT-alpha antibody is purified by a protein A column and submitted for Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption\/Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectral analysis of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides (including fucose content) and Fc\u03b3R binding assay as described below.","Methods for analyzing the oligosaccharides by MALDI-TOF are conducted generally as follows: N-linked oligosaccharides are released from recombinant glycoproteins using the peptide-N-glycosidase-F (PNGase F) procedure of Papac et al., 8, 445-454 (1998). Briefly, the wells of a 96-well polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)-lined microtitre plate (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) are conditioned with 100 \u03bcl methanol that is drawn through the PVDF membranes by applying vacuum to the MILLIPORE\u2122 multiscreen vacuum manifold. The conditioned PVDF membranes are washed with 3\u00d7250 \u03bcl water. Between all wash steps the wells are drained completely by applying gentle vacuum to the manifold. The membranes are washed with reduction and carboxymethylation buffer (RCM) consisting of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 360 mM TRIS buffer, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.6. Glycoprotein samples (50 \u03bcg) are applied to individual wells, again drawn through the PVDF membranes by gentle vacuum and the wells washed with 2\u00d750 \u03bcl of RCM buffer. The immobilized samples are reduced by adding 50 \u03bcl of a 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT) solution to each well and incubating the microtitre plate at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hr. DTT is removed by vacuum and the wells are washed 4\u00d7250 \u03bcl water. Cysteine residues are carboxylmethylated by the addition of 50 \u03bcl of a 0.1 M iodoacetic acid (IAA) solution that is freshly prepared in 1 M NaOH and diluted to 0.1 M with RCM buffer.","Carboxymethylation is accomplished by incubation for 30 min in the dark at ambient temperature. Vacuum is applied to the plate to remove the IAA solution and the wells are washed with 4\u00d7250 \u03bcl purified water. The PVDF membranes are blocked by the addition of 100 \u03bcl of 1% PVP360\u2122 (polyvinylpyrrolidine 360,000 MW) (Sigma) solution and incubation for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. The PVP-360\u2122 solution is removed by gentle vacuum and the wells are washed 4\u00d7250 \u03bcl water. Peptide: N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F\u2122) amidase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.), at 25 \u03bcl of a 25 Unit\/ml solution in 10 mM TRIS acetate, pH 8.3, is added to each well and the digest proceeds for 3 hr at 37\u00b0 C. After digestion, the samples are transferred to 500 \u03bcl EPPENDORF\u2122 tubes and 2.5 \u03bcl of a 1.5 M acetic acid solution is added to each sample. The acidified samples are incubated for two hrs at ambient temperature to convert the oligosaccharides from the glycosylamine to the hydroxyl form. Prior to MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis, the released oligosaccharides are desalted using a 0.7-ml bed of cation-exchange resin (AG50W-X8 resin in the hydrogen form) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) slurry packed into compact reaction tubes (US Biochemical, Cleveland, Ohio).","For MALDI-TOF mass-spectral analysis of the samples in the positive mode, the desalted oligosaccharides (0.5 \u03bcl aliquots) are applied to the stainless target with 0.5 \u03bcl of the 2,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix (sDHB) that is prepared by dissolving 2 mg 2,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid with 0.1 mg of 5-methoxyslicylic acid in 1 ml of 1 mM NaCl in 25% aqueous ethanol. The sample\/matrix mixture is vacuum dried and then allowed to absorb atmospheric moisture prior to analysis. Released oligosaccharides are analyzed by MALDI-TOF on a PERSEPTIVE BIOSYSTEMS VOYAGER-ELITE\u2122 mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer is operated in the positive mode at 20 kV with the linear configuration and utilizing delayed extraction. Data are acquired using a laser power of approximately 1100 and in the data summation mode (240 scans) to improve the signal to noise ratio. The instrument is calibrated with a mixture of standard oligosaccharides and the data are smoothed using a 19-point Savitsky-Golay algorithm before the masses are assigned. Integration of the mass-spectral data is achieved using the CAESAR 7.2\u2122 data analysis software package (SciBridge Software).","Binding of control and test materials to the human Fc\u03b3 receptors can be assessed using modified versions of procedures originally described by Shields et al., 276:6591-604 (2001).","For confirmation that the RNAi-transfected cells do have less FUT8 RNA expression, a Northern blot can be performed using RNA samples extracted from the transfected cells 24 hours after transfection. Total RNA from cells containing a control plasmid (random mouse DNA sequence, no homology to any known mouse proteins) and two RNAi plasmids can be purified and hybridized with a 300-bp probe. The knock down of endogenous \u03b1 1,6-fucosyltransferase RNA can be further confirmed by quantitative PCR.","The following materials have been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, USA (ATCC):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0668","num":"0696"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00028","num":"00028"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Material","ATCC Dep.
