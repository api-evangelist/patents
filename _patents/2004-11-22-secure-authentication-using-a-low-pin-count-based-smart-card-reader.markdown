{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to computer authentication systems and methods. More specifically, the invention relates to a user using an integrated circuit device to provide various user credentials, among other information, to one or more computer systems.","2. Description of the Related Art","Typically, individuals are required to provide one or more credentials such as identification and authentication information (e.g., a username and password) to access various computer systems, networks, and\/or information. Various methods and systems can be used for identification and authentication that can be more robust than a username and password combination. One such system is a smart card system. A smart card is, typically, a card about the size of a credit card or a business card which comprises an embedded integrated circuit (IC) device. Other form factors of smart cards can be used, as well. The IC device generally comprises a microprocessor or microcontroller, a memory, and an input\/output (I\/O) interface, among other elements. The IC device is programmed with various information and\/or one or more software programs.","In general, smart cards can provide one or more credentials such as identification and authentication information along with other information such as bank account information, medical information, personal identification numbers (PINs), a digital certificate, a digital signature, social security information, etc. Smart cards can even verify information of a human being before disseminating or transmitting stored information. For example, a smart card can verify fingerprint information before disseminating and\/or transmitting a password.","Smart cards can be coupled to a computer system in a variety of ways. In various examples, a smart card may be coupled to a computer system by a universal serial bus (USB), serial (e.g., RS-232), PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association), a keyboard (e.g., with a PS\/2 cable and\/or connector), or FireWire (IEEE 1394), among other typical couplings for peripheral devices.","In addition to identifying and\/or authenticating a user of a computer system by using a smart card to provide one or more user credentials, other authentication systems and\/or methods may also be utilized. For example, various credentials of the computer system used by the user may also be used in determining whether or not access may be granted to the user and\/or the computer system used by the user. In one instance, software executing on the computer system can require credentials of the computer system before executing further functionality of the software and\/or before executing other software. In a second instance, a server computer system may have a list of computer system credentials indicating certain computer systems with which it may communicate, and each computer system may provide credentials to the server computer system in order to communicate with the server computer system over a network. In other words, the server computer system may not communicate with a \u201crogue\u201d computer system introduced to the network. Credentials that may be provided to the server computer system may include endorsement credentials, platform credentials, and\/or conformance credentials, among other credentials. Each computer system may include an integrated circuit (IC) device which may be or may include a trusted platform module (TPM) which can manage the credentials and\/or provide various credentials to the server computer system. In general, TPMs are not meant to be used on more than one computer system; thus, a TPM of a computer system is often soldered to the computer system.","Typically, if a computer system includes a TPM, the computer system uses a low pin count (LPC) bus to communicate with the TPM. The LPC bus was designed by Intel to implement an ISA (Industry Standard Interface) bus in a computer system. In general, the LPC bus may include a range of six to thirteen interface pins while the ISA bus may include a range of thirty-six to ninety-eight interface pins. The LPC bus has certain characteristics or operations which require executing specific software to communicate with devices (e.g., the TPM) coupled to the LPC bus. For example, the LPC bus has read and write cycles which are used for retrieving and storing data of devices coupled to the LPC bus, and software executing on the computer system would need to be executable to use these read and write cycles to communicate with devices coupled to the LPC bus.","In general, an operating system executing on a computer system may comprise the software executable to use these read and write cycles to communicate with devices coupled to the LPC bus, and, thus, the operating system can communicate with a TPM of the computer system. An operating system communicating with the TPM is considered a \u201ctrusted\u201d operating system. Applications executing on the computer system can rely on credentials and\/or other identification and authentication information from the TPM. Since these applications rely on credentials from the TPM, they are considered \u201ctrusted\u201d applications. In general, the trusted operating system executes the trusted applications and providers one or more software interfaces that allow the trusted applications to communicate with the TPM.","Even with the one or more software interfaces that allow the trusted applications to interface with a device coupled to the LPC bus, currently, there exists no method and\/or no system to access an IC device carried by a user (e.g., an IC device comprised in a smart card) through a LPC bus of a computer system. Therefore, there exists a need for a system and method for a trusted operating system and\/or trusted application to interface with IC devices which are removable (i.e. carried by users) and provide user credentials and which are coupled to the LPC bus of a computer system.","In various embodiments, an integrated circuit (IC) device (e.g., included in a removable smart card carried by a user) may store user credential information. The user credential information may comprise identification information (e.g., a username) and\/or authentication information (e.g., a password), among other information, associated with a user. In some embodiments, a second IC device may be substantially permanently coupled to the computer system and may provide credential information of a computer system to the computer system.","The computer system may include an IC device interface to receive the user credential information from the IC device, and the IC device interface may be coupled to a CPU of the computer system through a low pin count (LPC) bus. In other words, the user credential information associated with the user may be provided by the IC device through a LPC bus of the computer system. In some embodiments, software (e.g., an operating system and\/or other application) executing on the computer system may operate the LPC bus and\/or may receive information provided by the IC device through the LPC bus.","The user credential information provided by the IC device through the LPC bus may be used to determine whether to grant access to program instructions and\/or to information (e.g., private and\/or sensitive information). A memory may be coupled to the computer system, and the memory may comprise a data structure which comprises a list of user credential information, a corresponding list of program instruction identifications (e.g., software application names) or information identifications, and\/or access level and\/or privilege level information.","In one example, the user may attempt to execute an application such as a word processor, a spreadsheet, accounting software, etc. on the computer system. Software (e.g., an operating system or the application) executing on the computer system may use the user credential information provided by the IC device and the identification of the application (e.g., an application identification or application name) to determine whether or not access to the application may be granted. In some embodiments, determining whether or not access to the application may be granted may include indexing into a data structure which comprises a list of credentials and a corresponding list of application identifications (IDs). If the user credential information and\/or the identification of the application are not found in the data structure, access may not be granted. If the user credential information and the identification of the program instructions are found in the data structure, access may be granted. The data structure may further comprise various access and\/or privilege levels associated with each credential information and application identification pair. In some embodiments, access may be granted based on an access level and\/or privilege level corresponding to the user credential information and the identification of the program instructions.","In a second example, the user may attempt to access information (e.g., private and\/or sensitive information) on the computer system. Software (e.g., an operating system or other application) executing on the computer system may use the user credential information provided by the IC device and an identification of the information to determine whether or not access may be granted to the information. In some embodiments, determining whether or not access to the information may be granted may include indexing into a data structure which comprises a list of credentials and a corresponding list of information IDs. If the user credential information and the identification of the information are not found in the data structure, access may not be granted. If the user credential information and the identification of the information are found in the data structure, access may be granted. The data structure may further comprise various access and\/or privilege levels associated with each credential information and information identification pair. In some embodiments, access may be granted based on an access level and\/or privilege level corresponding to the user credential information and the identification of the information.","In some embodiments, the computer system may be coupled to a network. A request for access of information and credentials (e.g., user credentials, computer system credentials, etc.) may be transmitted by the computer system to a service provider coupled to the network. The service provider may use the credential information provided by the computer system and the request for access of information to determine whether to grant access to the information. In some embodiments, a second IC device may be coupled to the LPC bus, and the second IC device may store computer system credential information which is associated with the computer system.","In various embodiments, a memory (e.g., a database coupled to the network) may be coupled to the service provider, and the memory may comprise a data structure which comprises a list of user credential information, a corresponding list of information types or identifications, and a corresponding list of access level and\/or privilege level information. Software executed by the service provider may use the user credential information and an identification of the information (e.g., private and\/or sensitive information identification) to index into the data structure to determine whether or not access may be granted to the information. If the user credential information and the identification of the information are not found in the data structure, access may not be granted. If the user credential information and the identification of the information are found in the data structure, access to the requested information may be granted. In some embodiments, access may be granted based on the access level and\/or privilege level information corresponding to the user credential information and the identification of the information.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.","Incorporation by Reference","The following references are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety as though fully and completely set forth herein:","\u201cIntel Low Pin Count (LPC) Interface Specification\u201d August 2002 Revision 1.1;","\u201cTCG Software Stack (TSS) Specification\u201d Version 1.10 Golden Aug. 20, 2003;","\u201cTPM Main Part 1 Design Principles Specification\u201d Version 1.2 Revision 62 Oct. 2, 2003; and","\u201cTPM Main Part 2 Design Principles Specification\u201d Version 1.2 Revision 62 Oct. 2, 2003.","FIG. \u2014Components Included in a Computer System","In various embodiments, a computer system  may include various components illustrated in . Elements of computer system  not necessary to understand the present description have been omitted for simplicity. It is noted that computer system  may include various forms, including a personal computer system, mainframe computer system, workstation, network appliance, Internet appliance, personal digital assistant (PDA), cellular telephone, satellite telephone, communication device, embedded computer system, television system, or other device. In general, the term \u201ccomputer system\u201d can be broadly defined to encompass any device having a processor which executes instructions from a memory medium.","Computer system  may include at least one central processing unit or CPU  which may be coupled to a north bridge (e.g., memory controller hub) . A memory medium, typically including RAM (random access memory), such as memory , may be coupled to north bridge .

As used herein, the terms \u201clow pin count bus\u201d and \u201cLPC bus\u201d refer to a bus that implements an ISA (Industry Standard Interface) bus in a computer system while comprising a lower number of interface pins than a standard ISA bus interface. For example, in some embodiments, a LPC bus may include six (6) to thirteen (13) interface pins while an ISA bus may include thirty-six (36) to ninety-eight (98) interface pins. It may be advantageous to use a bus with a \u201clow pin count\u201d, such as LPC bus , since using a reduced or lower pin count may be easier to implement and\/or may consume less \u201creal estate\u201d (e.g., space) on a computer system board which may result in one or more lower costs (e.g., production costs, power costs, etc.).

For example, IC device interface  may include an ISO- interface. In some embodiments, the ISO-7816 interface of IC device interface  may be incompatible with LPC bus , and bus interface  may allow the ISO- interface of IC device interface  to couple to LPC bus . In other words, bus interface  may allow IC device interface  to couple to and\/or interact with LPC bus . IC device interface  may couple to an IC device A by physical contact (see ), and\/or IC device interface  may couple to an IC device B in a wireless fashion (see ).","A user of computer system  may carry IC device A and\/or B.

Information (i.e. user credential information) provided by IC device A and\/or B may indicate ID information and\/or authentication information (e.g., a username and\/or password, etc.) of the user of computer system .","In some embodiments, program instructions (e.g., OS ), included in memory , may be executable by CPU  to initiate read and\/or write cycles of LPC bus , and bus interface  may be operable to allow IC interface  and IC devices A and\/or B to interact with the read and\/or write cycles of LPC bus . For example, information may be received from IC device A and\/or B during a read cycle of LPC bus , and information may be transmitted to IC device A and\/or B during a write cycle of LPC bus . In some embodiments, the read and\/or write cycles of LPC bus  may include \u201cspecial\u201d read and\/or write cycles of LPC bus .
