title: Assessment of communication strengths of individuals from electronic messages
abstract: An apparatus, program product, and method analyze electronic messages directed between individuals to quantitatively assess the relative communication capabilities of such individuals. A quantitative value referred to as “communication strength” is determined for one or more individuals from a plurality of individuals based upon analysis of the electronic messaging activities of such individual(s), and is subsequently used to select an individual from among the plurality of individuals, e.g., for the purpose of selecting a target for a viral marketing encounter, a market research project, etc. The communication strength of an individual is determined by modeling a plurality of conversations identified through analysis of a plurality of electronic messages generated by the plurality of individuals, where each conversation is associated with a talker and a listener from the plurality of individuals, and is useful in determining a level of messaging activity between the talker and listener associated with such conversation.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention is generally related to marketing and computer analysis of electronic media in connection with the same. More particularly, the invention is related to the quantitative analysis of electronic messages for the purpose of improving marketing efficacy.","Marketing techniques have substantially improved in terms of sophistication and efficacy since the days of undirected mass-market advertisements and the like. Marketing campaigns, in particular, desirably balance the number of \u201cimpressions\u201d or contacts with consumers with the quality of those impressions and the overall cost of the campaign. The efficacy of a marketing campaign is largely premised on getting the most \u201cbang for the buck\u201d, i.e., the greatest impact for the marketing dollar.","Marketing efforts often vary in the degree in which they \u201ctarget\u201d specific consumers. Whereas mass marketing efforts generally target a large audience with little or no focus towards particular types of consumers, many direct marketing campaigns are generally targeted toward those consumers who are most likely to respond favorably to a marketing impression.","One specific type of marketing technique is known as viral, or diffusion, marketing. With viral marketing, the recipient of an encounter or impression is desirably used to relay a marketing message to other consumers. Viral marketing thus exemplifies a somewhat more sophisticated form of \u201cword of mouth\u201d advertising. To maximize the efficacy of a viral marketing campaign, therefore, it is desirable to direct encounters toward only those recipients who are most likely to relay marketing messages to others, and thus who are most capable of maximizing the viral relay effect.","In terms of viral marketing, research has found that certain types of individuals, typically referred to as \u201cmavens\u201d, \u201cconnectors\u201d and \u201csalespersons\u201d, are critical to applying the viral social phenomenon to effective marketing campaigns. Mavens are typically collectors of information who are motivated to distribute information to other individuals, predominantly due to a social motivation. Connectors are individuals who communicate information of interest to themselves to an unusually large number of other people. Some connectors may merely be \u201centhusiasts\u201d who effectively relay information to others only pertaining to a narrow area of interest. Other connectors, however, may be likely to convey information to others on a wide number of topics outside of their particular areas of interest. For example, a connector who has a particular area of expertise in musical instruments might still be inclined to relate to others about a wonderful dining experience that he or she recently had at a particular restaurant.","Initiation of viral marketing events through the use of mavens and connectors also requires the addition of \u201cpersuasion\u201d into a social interaction. Thus, an individual functioning as a salesperson is often required to initiate a desirable viral marketing encounter.","Traditionally, the identification of suitable targets for viral marketing efforts has been through surveys and other manual, and often haphazard, processes. However, with the advent of electronic communications, and in particular the growth of the Internet, the opportunity exists to utilize computers and data processing techniques to assist in better targeting marketing efforts. In particular, with respect to viral marketing, it has been found that individuals who are influential in the physical or real world (i.e., the \u201cphysical environment\u201d) are often influential within the electronic, or \u201ccyber\u201d world (i.e., the \u201celectronic environment\u201d), as well. Thus, it is believed that the identification of individuals who are influential within electronic environments may assist in identifying desirable targets for marketing efforts in both physical and electronic environments.","The Internet, in particular, is interesting from a sociological standpoint for the manner in which \u201conline communities\u201d are formed by different individuals based upon particular areas of interest to those individuals. Moreover, the very nature of the Internet, and in particular the subset of the Internet known as the \u201cWorld Wide Web\u201d (or simply \u201cthe Web\u201d), presents social and marketing researchers with a vast repository of data from which useful trends and relationships may be obtained. For example, research has been devoted to identifying the kinds and qualities of the groups and institutions that people create and use on the Internet, as well as to spot online trends and\/or detect customer likes and dislikes from forums and other enthusiast communities, etc.","Also, the interactions of individuals and other entities have been researched to assist in other useful endeavors. For example, research has been devoted to improving searching technologies, and in particular, the results returned in response to search queries, based upon the links between different information repositories accessible via the Internet. For example, one avenue of research has been directed to analyzing the hypertext links between various Internet content items to determine the relative quality or \u201cauthority\u201d of a particular content item accessible via the Internet.","One particular avenue of research, for example, is based on the premise that the authority of a particular content item can be assessed based upon the number of links to that item by other content items. Furthermore, to make such an assessment, content items are segregated into \u201chubs\u201d and \u201cauthorities\u201d. Hubs are typically directory-type content items that provide relatively large numbers of links to other content items, much like a telephone directory. Authorities are typically the end use content items that are desirably returned as search results. Assessment of authority is premised further on the dual propositions that (1) a good hub links to many good authorities, and (2) a good authority is linked to by many good hubs. Such dual propositions are then modeled for a particular search space, and quantitative analysis is performed to attempt to simultaneously resolve these dual propositions, typically using an analysis technique such as the eigenvalue technique. Using this type of quantitative analysis, search results may be arranged so as to favor content items that are assessed to have greater authority by virtue of their links to greater numbers and qualities of other content items.","While the aforementioned quantitative analysis techniques have been used in connection with deriving certain types of information from the Internet and other electronic environments, quantitative analysis techniques have not been effectively utilized in connection with the identification of individuals having particular communication capabilities. In particular, quantitative analysis techniques have not been used to analyze individuals' electronic messaging activities to attempt to identify particular individuals who might be useful in connection with marketing activities such as viral marketing campaigns and market research.","The Internet, in particular, presents an ever-growing repository of information regarding individuals and the manners in which they communicate, in particular with respect to the electronic messages that individuals author and convey to others. The electronic messages created and maintained within electronic environments and media such as news archives and forums, list servers, chat rooms, etc. often present a wealth of information regarding the individuals that participate in such environments. Moreover, in many instances, the messages are relatively well categorized and capable of being searched to harvest relevant information about a particular topic. As an example, Internet forums are typically devoted to a particular area or field of interest. With those forums, members often post messages about particular topics or questions that interest them, and other members reply to those messages with answers or further discussions. The original messages and the replies thereto are often grouped into \u201cthreads\u201d that present entire discussions in a cohesive manner.","A significant need therefore exists in the art for a manner of quantitatively assessing the communication capabilities of various individuals participating in electronic environments. In particular, a significant need exists in the art for a manner of quantitatively assessing the communication capabilities of individuals to assist in improving the efficacy of marketing activities, such as viral marketing and market research.","The invention addresses these and other problems associated with the prior art by providing an apparatus, program product, and method that analyze the various electronic messages directed between multiple individuals to quantitatively assess the relative communication capabilities of such individuals. Given the wide availability of electronic messaging archives of various types, and in particular the wide availability of public messaging archives, the identification of individuals having particular communication capabilities in either or both of the electronic and physical worlds can be substantially facilitated through the analysis of such archives, and thus used to improve the efficacy of marketing activities.","In particular, consistent with the invention a quantitative value referred to as \u201ccommunication strength\u201d is determined for one or more individuals from a plurality of individuals based upon analysis of the electronic messaging activities of such individual(s), and is subsequently used to select an individual from among the plurality of individuals, e.g., for the purpose of selecting a target for a viral marketing encounter, a market research project, etc. The communication strength of an individual is determined by modeling a plurality of conversations identified through analysis of a plurality of electronic messages generated by the plurality of individuals. Each conversation is associated with a talker and a listener from the plurality of individuals, and is useful in determining a level of messaging activity between the talker and listener associated with such conversation.","These and other advantages and features, which characterize the invention, are set forth in the claims annexed hereto and forming a further part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the invention, and of the advantages and objectives attained through its use, reference should be made to the Drawings, and to the accompanying descriptive matter, in which there is described exemplary embodiments of the invention.","The embodiments described herein assess the communication strengths of individuals participating in an electronic environment based upon analysis of electronic messages with which those individuals are associated. In general, communication assessment consistent with the invention may be utilized in connection with electronic messages of differing types, as well as electronic messages found in various electronic environments. For example, communication assessment may be performed on various types of electronic messages such as emails, message posts, telephone records, \u201cinstant messages\u201d, chat sessions, and combinations thereof, whether incorporating text, image data, animation, video, audio, and\/or other electronic information. Moreover, such messages may be retrieved from electronic environments such as news archives, forum archives, mailing (listserv) list archives, chat archives, instant messaging archives, telephone record archives, email archives, etc.","In general, electronic messages are analyzed to identify \u201cconversations,\u201d where each conversation is associated with both a \u201ctalker\u201d and a \u201clistener\u201d, where the conversation is considered to be directed \u201cfrom\u201d a talker and directed \u201cto\u201d a listener. In the context of individual conversations, a talker may be, for example, an author, sender and\/or other originator of a message, while a listener is typically someone who is a recipient of a message. As will become more apparent below, however, when a set of conversations is analyzed during a communication assessment study, individuals that meet predetermined talker and listener criteria are designated either as talkers or listeners for the entire set of conversations being analyzed, thus representing the predominant role of a particular individual in the context of the study domain. As a result, it is entirely likely that a study domain will include conversations where the \u201ctalker\u201d for a particular conversation is an individual designated to be a \u201clistener\u201d for the study domain and\/or where the \u201clistener\u201d for a particular conversation is an individual designated to be a \u201ctalker\u201d for the study domain.","Consequently, conversations within a study domain may include talker-listener conversations, where the roles for the individuals within such conversations are consistent with those defined for the overall domain, as well as talker-talker, listener-talker, and listener-listener conversations, where one or both of the participants in such conversations have roles within such conversations that are inconsistent with their designated roles in the study domain. As will become more apparent below, it may be desirable to exclude certain conversations, particularly those originated by listeners, from analysis in certain circumstances.","Precisely how an individual is designated as a talker or a listener can vary in different applications, and is discussed in greater detail below. It should also be appreciated that some electronic messages may be addressed to multiple recipients, whereby a particular message may be considered to represent multiple conversations between the same talker and different listeners. In the alternative, multiple listeners may be considered to be participating in the same conversation.","Conversations are typically harvested and derived from selected messages that pertain to a particular selection criterion, e.g., to analyze only messages dealing with a particular area or domain of interest. Thus, in many instances the conversations identified during communication assessment may represent only a subset of the messages capable of being accessed by a communication assessment system consistent with the invention.","From the conversations identified for a particular area of interest, communication \u201cstrengths\u201d for various participants of those conversations may be derived, either in the form of relative or absolute strength values. Communication strength consistent with the invention may represent either or both of \u201ctalker\u201d strength and \u201clistener\u201d strength, and may be dependent upon calculations made under differing conditions (e.g., using different wearout factors, as discussed in greater detail below). Talker strength generally represents an individual's propensity to communicate to others, while listener strength generally represents an individual's propensity to listen or otherwise be willing to receive information communicated by others. When used in connection with selecting connectors for use in viral marketing or other marketing endeavors, communication strength may also be representative of \u201cconnector\u201d strength as well.","To determine communication strengths, identified conversations are used to determine the general levels of messaging activity between various talkers and listeners, typically in the form of activity indicators such as conversation counts. These activity indicators are then typically used to populate a matrix from which modeling may be performed to facilitate the quantitative assessment of communication strength.","A quantitative assessment of communication strength as used herein is based upon the fundamental underlying propositions that: (1) strong talkers are those who frequently talk to strong listeners; and (2) strong listeners are those who frequently listen to strong talkers. As will become more apparent below, these two propositions may be resolved through solution of an eigenvalue problem using quantitative modeling techniques. From such modeling techniques, one or both of talker and listener strength may be derived for selected individuals, and under varying input conditions.","As will become more apparent below, the end uses of calculated communication strengths may include, for example, the selection of \u201cconnectors\u201d, e.g., strong talkers (who are also possibly strong listeners), who are more likely to be able to effectively convey viral marketing messages, as well as have those messages listened to and given weight by other individuals, or who may be appropriate for use in market research projects. In other instances, listener strength may also be utilized separate from talker strength to identify individuals that are particularly receptive to particular messages or encounters.","The quantitative analysis techniques utilized to perform communication assessment consistent with the invention are presented in greater detail hereinafter. However, prior to such presentation, a brief discussion of an exemplary hardware and software environment suitable for implementing communication assessment consistent with the invention is provided.","Hardware and Software Environment","Turning now to the Drawings, wherein like numbers denote like parts throughout the several views,  illustrates an exemplary application of communication assessment, in particular within a viral marketing architecture or environment , in which is illustrated an exemplary set of individuals . Individuals  may be considered to exist within either or both of a \u201ccyber\u201d world  (i.e., as those individuals interact with other individuals over the Internet or another electronic medium) or physical world .","To implement a viral marketing architecture, an enterprise , e.g., a business, educational institution, non-profit organization, etc., that wishes to conduct viral marketing may utilize a communication assessment system  to harvest information about electronic communications between individuals , and from such information, to assess connection strengths of various individuals in connection with particular study parameters. In the illustrated embodiment, the harvested information takes the form of electronic messages .","As will become more apparent below, the harvested electronic messages are processed by communication assessment system  to generate communication strengths for various individuals so that one or more of such individuals may be selected from a pool of individuals based upon their respective communication strengths. For a viral marketing application, for example, it may be desirable to select individuals having relatively communication strengths (e.g., having relatively high talker strengths, and optionally, relatively high listener strengths as well) so that such individuals may be designated as \u201cconnectors\u201d and targeted in a viral marketing campaign. In , for example, individuals  that meet a connector criterion are illustrated using cross-hatched representations.","For the purposes of viral marketing, it is anticipated that an individual  within enterprise , e.g., a maven and\/or salesperson, will attempt to initiate a viral marketing encounter with one or more connectors, e.g., as represented by encounter  directed to a connector individual designated at A. Then, as shown in , it is anticipated that the designated connector A will relay the viral marketing message to other individuals  within either or both of the \u201ccyber\u201d and physical worlds , .","Any number of known viral marketing encounters may be utilized to initiate a viral marketing campaign. For example, electronic messages, printed letters, product samples, coupons, product and other \u201cuseful\u201d information may be conveyed to an individual, and other contacts, such as telephone calls, may be initiated. An individual may be provided with an \u201copt-in\u201d invitation, or the individual may be solicited for input, advice or interviews. A contact may acknowledge and\/or celebrate an individual's expertise, knowledge and\/or celebrity, and may invite an individual to participate in an event such as a focus group. Other contacts that create a favorable impression to the individual may also be initiated.","As another component of a viral marketing architecture, it may be desirable to utilize an additional measurement\/feedback system  that receives feedback (designated at ) from either or both of worlds ,  for use in determining marketing efficacy. Various known forms of collecting and processing feedback, whether electronic, automated, or manual in nature, may be used to gauge the effectiveness of a particular marketing encounter and\/or campaign. For example, emails capable of triggering a report back to a monitor may be used to detect viewings by connectors, as well as forwarding of the emails to additional recipients. Questionnaires and surveys may also be directed to connectors to gauge effectiveness.","Additional operations may be desirable in a viral marketing architecture. For example, it may be desirable to convert electronic identities into real identities. In many forums, for example, individuals are identified by email address or pseudonym, and it is often only these identifiers that will be available during data mining and analysis. Translation, e.g., via directory lookup, examination of message content, examination of user profiles, or working with a third-party host of a message archive may be used to derive a real identity to which encounters may be directed. In the alternative, an encounter may be directed to the electronic identity, e.g., by posting or sending a reply directed to a specific individual.","It also may be desirable to \u201cscreen\u201d connectors to attempt to determine suitability of a connector for a particular marketing activity. For example, connectors may be offered surveys, or their messages may be analyzed manually or automatically to determine their usefulness.","It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the instant disclosure that communication assessment consistent with the invention has applicability in a wide variety of other applications. For example, communication assessment may be used to identify individuals for market research projects, e.g., to select individuals for placement in a focus group, to select individuals from which to solicit input on product\/service improvements, etc. Communication assessment may also be used to select individuals having high listener strengths, e.g., to identify individuals that might be more receptive to listening to a particular proposal, message or encounter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["30","30","30"]},"Computer  typically includes at least one processor  coupled to a memory . Processor  may represent one or more processors (e.g., microprocessors), and memory  may represent the random access memory (RAM) devices comprising the main storage of computer , as well as any supplemental levels of memory, e.g., cache memories, non-volatile or backup memories (e.g., programmable or flash memories), read-only memories, etc. In addition, memory  may be considered to include memory storage physically located elsewhere in computer , e.g., any cache memory in a processor , as well as any storage capacity used as a virtual memory, e.g., as stored on a mass storage device  or on another computer coupled to computer  via a network.","Computer  also typically receives a number of inputs and outputs for communicating information externally. For interface with a user or operator, computer  typically includes one or more user input devices  (e.g., a keyboard, a mouse, a trackball, a joystick, a touchpad, and\/or a microphone, among others) and a display  (e.g., a CRT monitor, an LCD display panel, and\/or a speaker, among others). Otherwise, user input may be received via another computer interfaced with computer , e.g., a workstation.","For additional storage, computer  may also include one or more mass storage devices , e.g., a floppy or other removable disk drive, a hard disk drive, a direct access storage device (DASD), an optical drive (e.g., a CD drive, a DVD drive, etc.), and\/or a tape drive, among others. Furthermore, computer  may include an interface with one or more networks (e.g., a LAN, a WAN, a wireless network, and\/or the Internet, among others) via one or more network adaptors  to permit the communication of information with other computers coupled to the network. It should be appreciated that computer  typically includes suitable analog and\/or digital interfaces between processor  and each of components , , ,  and  as is well known in the art.","Computer  operates under the control of an operating system , and executes or otherwise relies upon various computer software applications, components, programs, objects, modules, data structures, etc. (e.g., database management system (DBMS) , local message archive , study , data mining engine , and quantitative analysis engine , among others). Moreover, various applications, components, programs, objects, modules, etc. may also execute on one or more processors in another computer coupled to computer  via a network , e.g., in a distributed or client-server computing environment, whereby the processing required to implement the functions of a computer program may be allocated to multiple computers over a network. In particular, it is envisioned that the functions of harvesting messages, managing message archives and study data, and performing quantitative analysis, may be performed by different computers interfaced together over a network.","In general, the routines executed to implement the embodiments of the invention, whether implemented as part of an operating system or a specific application, component, program, object, module or sequence of instructions will be referred to herein as \u201ccomputer programs\u201d, or simply \u201cprograms\u201d. The computer programs typically comprise one or more instructions that are resident at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer, and that, when read and executed by one or more processors in a computer, cause that computer to perform the steps necessary to execute steps or elements embodying the various aspects of the invention. Moreover, while the invention has and hereinafter will be described in the context of fully functioning computers and computer systems, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the various embodiments of the invention are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that the invention applies equally regardless of the particular type of signal bearing media used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of signal bearing media include but are not limited to recordable type media such as volatile and non-volatile memory devices, floppy and other removable disks, hard disk drives, magnetic tape, optical disks (e.g., CD-ROM's, DVD's, etc.), among others, and transmission type media such as digital and analog communication links.","In addition, various programs described hereinafter may be identified based upon the application for which they are implemented in a specific embodiment of the invention. However, it should be appreciated that any particular program nomenclature that follows is used merely for convenience, and thus the invention should not be limited to use solely in any specific application identified and\/or implied by such nomenclature. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that a \u201cprogram\u201d may actually incorporate program code executing on multiple computers, as well as program code that may be considered to be executing as multiple computer applications. Therefore, as an example, program code performing certain aspects of the illustrated embodiment within a quantitative analysis engine, as well as program code performing other aspects in a database management system and\/or a data mining engine, may nonetheless still be considered to be one program within the context of the invention, irrespective of the fact that such program code may be executing in different applications and on different computers.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that the exemplary environments illustrated in  are not intended to limit the present invention. Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize that other alternative hardware and\/or software environments may be used without departing from the scope of the invention.","Communication Assessment Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["50","46","30","52","42","40"]},"Harvesting is generally used to pare down the available search space to focus on messages directed to a particular domain of interest, e.g., \u201cwater purification\u201d, or \u201cteens' interest in electronic games.\u201d Harvesting typically incorporates identifying electronic message repositories that potentially contain messages relevant to the domain of interest. In the illustrated implementation, for example, specific news archives or forums that potentially pertain to a particular domain of interest are utilized as the principal search space from which harvesting occurs.","Harvesting may be performed in an automated fashion using any of a number of known harvesting techniques, e.g., using various commercially-available data mining engines such as Content Exchange available from Liason Technology. Typically, data records are harvested (retrieved and saved) from the search space and organized in the local message archive, optionally with the assistance of automated agents. The data harvested may contain as many of the fields describing a forum posting as are desired or available, e.g., date posted, time posted, author ID, message forum where posted, message text, thread ID, response message ID, etc. In addition or in lieu of any or all of these items, web links (URL's) to the forum posts may also be harvested.","A local archive may be maintained in any of a number of database architectures. For example, a local archive may be maintained in any of a number of commercially available database management systems, e.g., Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL server, Oracle, etc.","Harvesting to a local archive is often desirable for performance reasons, given that harvesting can be substantially automated, and that access from a local archive during selection and model building is often more reliable and faster than accessing directly from public archives. Moreover, segregating harvesting and study selection permits study variations to be reframed relatively easily to reformulate results to account for different input parameters. In the alternative, however, a local message archive may not be used and\/or harvesting may not performed in some instances.","Next, a select step  is typically performed to further reduce the search space from which relevant electronic messages are obtained, and to create therefrom the framework for a study . Within this selection process, keywords may be selected to narrow the topic of interest further, as well as to limit messages to certain date ranges, forums, etc., and to select out certain exceptional data if necessary. Moreover, it is also during selection that various study parameters are selected, including parameters for use in quantitative analysis, as well as definitional parameters such as what is a conversation, who is a talker and who is a listener. Furthermore, individual individuals, forums, threads, etc., may also be excluded from a study (e.g., if a certain individual or forum is known to have little relevance to a particular study).","The definitional parameters such as what is a conversation (a conversation criterion), who is a talker (a talker criterion) and who is a listener (a listener criterion) will typically vary in different applications, and may be selectable and controllable to vary study results within a particular application.","A conversation, in terms of written communications, may be defined even in the case of one-way messages such as e-mails. In the illustrated implementation, a conversation includes a message, an author who created the message, and a recipient (who is believed to have read the message). Typically, a conversation is considered to be between two individuals, so that a message sent to multiple individuals will constitute multiple conversations between the same author and each of the recipients.","Conversations need not require proof that an intended recipient actually read a message. Depending upon the \u201ctightness\u201d of the definition, a conversation may require that a recipient reply to or forward a message to confirm receipt of a message, or have posted a message in the same thread. Otherwise, simple membership on a distribution list, or membership in a forum, may be sufficient to identify a recipient of a message posted to the list or forum.","With other types of messages, e.g., real-time messages such as chats or instant messages, conversations may be defined by looking at archives of transcripts, and may require additional analysis to detect who was listening whenever a particular individual sent a message, e.g., based upon who replied directly to a statement, or even who was logged on at the time.","As with conversations, typically some form of restricted definition of a \u201ctalker\u201d and a \u201clistener\u201d is desired, so that only a desirable subset of individuals represented in a message archive may be used. Typically, with written communications, a \u201ctalker\u201d can be defined as the author of a message, or only the author of a particular type of message (e.g., the poster of the first message in a thread). Moreover, a talker may be required to have some posting activity above a certain threshold (e.g., more than two posts).","Listeners may simply be selected from the remaining individuals represented in an archive, or may be further restricted, e.g., to those that participated in one or more forums with a certain degree of activity beyond simple membership. Listeners, for example, may be required to have responded to a message or participated in a thread.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIGS. 4 and 5","b":["80","82","82","84"]},"Individuals that author posts within the various forums  may be classified as talkers and\/or listeners using various criteria. For example,  illustrates a relatively restrictive definition, where a talker is an author of a first, or initial, post in a thread. A listener in a restrictive definition, however, might only be those individuals who can be confirmed to have read an author's post. In , for example, listeners may be restricted to those who post replies to a particular post, or participate in a particular thread. Thus, in this example, an individual  who initiates thread  may be designated a talker, while the individuals who reply to the initial post (designated at  and ) may be designated listeners. In this example, therefore, two conversations are defined: one between individuals  and , and one between individuals  and .","A comparatively looser set of criteria would be to distinguish talkers and listeners by virtue of the number of posts made by individuals to the search space. Thus, for example, as shown in , if individuals  and  only posted once each to a particular set of forums, and individual  posted above a certain threshold (e.g., 3 posts or more), individuals  and  could be designated as listeners, and individual  designated as a talker.","Other manners of designating talkers and\/or listeners may be used consistent with the invention. For example, listeners could be designated by virtue of merely participating in a thread, specifically replying to a particular post, or just via membership in a forum. Moreover, in some instances it may be desirable to incorporate multiple factors, as well as scale such factors to effectively assign different weights to different types of activities. Also, for certain individuals within a domain of interest that do not meet minimum thresholds for talking and\/or listening, such individuals may be excluded from analysis entirely.","Returning to , selection of messages from archive , as well as the input of study parameters into study , may be performed in select step  in a number of manners. For example, one versed in SQL or other database languages may build a study  through the generation of appropriate database statements and instructions. In the alternative, a user interface, e.g., a graphical user interface, may be used to permit a user lacking specific knowledge of database languages to perform similar operations.","In addition to conversation, talker and listener criteria, a study may also specify a particular study domain, representing the narrowing of the harvest domain by a desired selection criterion. A study domain may be constrained, for example, by dates, forums, keywords\/content, ad hoc corrections\/exclusions (e.g., irrelevant individuals or forums), etc. Moreover, affective elements, e.g., representing the strength of the language used in messages, the presence of certain types of persuasive words, usages of particular semantic structures, etc., may also be considered, as may be the overall tone of messages (e.g., positive or negative).","Typically, a study , once selected, will include a database of \u201cconversations\u201d, with each identifying, in the least, an author and a recipient. In selection of the study, the conversation database may also be processed and organized to generate a conversation table that identifies in each entry an author, a recipient, and a conversation count, optionally weighted, representing the number of conversations found between the associated author and recipient.","From this study, quantitative analysis engine  is initiated to perform a build model step  to generate a mathematical model that expresses the dual propositions of strong talkers talking frequently to strong listeners, and strong listeners listening frequently to strong talkers.","This solution to these propositions is a circular definition that requires a mathematical solution, which in this implementation takes the form of an eigenvalue problem.

The eliminated forum was alt.hackers.malicious, which was of no relevance.","A select step was performed to shape the domain into a more compact set for analysis:\n\n","From the aforementioned selection step, the matrix of message activity (# of messages) from each Talker to each person was constructed. In this case the size of the matrix was 193\u00d7731, and was processed by Matlab 6 to solve the eigenvalue problem in the manner described above. The results generated included a set of relative strength weights assigned to each Talker, indexed to maximum. Listener strengths were also produced. The talkers with high strength ratings (e.g. talking strength indexes of at least 15) were designated \u201cconnectors\u201d, and from this selection criterion, 25 connectors were identified."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 9"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
