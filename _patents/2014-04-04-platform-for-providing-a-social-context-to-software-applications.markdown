title: Platform for providing a social context to software applications
abstract: The present invention provides a system and method for providing a social context to software applications. According to one embodiment of the invention, a user of a social network authorizes access by an external software application to information available in the social network. At some time later, the user of the social network uses an application designed by a third-party software developer. The application contacts the social network provider for permission to access the information available in the social network. If access has been authorized, the application incorporates the information from the social network into its interaction with the user, providing a social context to the user's interaction with the application.

No. 11\/893,559, titled \u201cPlatform for Providing a Social Context to Software Applications,\u201d filed on Aug. 15, 2007, and is related to U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 60\/906,961, titled \u201cSystems and Methods for Network Authentication,\u201d filed on Mar. 13, 2007. The disclosures of both of the above U.S. patent applications are incorporated by reference herein.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to internet applications, and particularly to using an internet-based social network to provide a social context to a user's interaction with a third-party software application.","2. Description of Related Art","Providers of internet-based social networks currently allow third-party software developers to develop applications that can interact with the social network. However, the social networks provide only limited information, and do not offer a social context to the application. That is, a user of the third-party application does not see what other users of the social network are doing, or access information about other users of the social network that is not publicly available information.","There is no currently available platform that a third-party developer of a software application may use to develop an application that draws a social context from information available in the social network.","The present invention provides a system and method for providing a social context to software applications. According to one embodiment of the invention, a user of a social network may authorize access by an external software application to information available in the social network. When the user of the social network uses the external application, the application contacts the social network provider for permission to access the information available in the social network. If access has been authorized, the application incorporates the information from the social network into its interaction with the user, providing a social context to the user's interaction with the application.","The present invention provides a platform for using a social network to provide a social context to a software application that is external to the social network, such as an application developed by a third-party developer rather than the social network provider and\/or which does not reside within the social network or social network provider. A social context comprises information that personalizes the interaction of a user with the software application.","A social network provider may offer access to a platform according to the present invention to a third-party developer of a software application, so that the developer may design an application that draws a social context from the social network. Such an application may then incorporate privacy-controlled information about users of the social network, allowing the user of the application to experience the social context provided by the social network provider.","For example, a user of a social network may also wish to use a third-party software application that displays book reviews. If the user has authorized the social network provider to provide information associated with the user in the social network to an external application, then the user may access that information through the book review application. For example, the user may use the application to find book reviews on that application created by people with whom he has established connections in the social network. If the social network normally collects its own data on books, location, or any other set of its own data accessible through the provided application programming interface, the user may incorporate that data into his use of the third party application as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","106","108","106","106","106","106","108","102","106","106","102"]},"The social network provider  may comprise any user or entity that provides social networking services, for example, communication services, dating services, or other services for social interaction. For example, the social network provider  may host a website that allows one or more users  to communicate with one another via the website. In one instance, the user A may communicate with the user B via a social networking website associated with the social network provider  that offers the user an opportunity to connect or reconnect with one or more other users B-N who attended, for example, the same university as the user A.","According to some embodiments, a developer of an application  may contact the social network provider  and request an application key from the developer. The social network provider  may review the developer's proposed application  and approve interaction between the application  and the social network. Review and approval may take any desired form; for example, they may require review by a person or they may be automatic.","The application  may be any type of application, so that, for example, those that display still or moving images, those that play sounds such as music or speech, those for financial management, for calendaring, or for any purpose are within the scope of the invention. The application  may be written in any natural and\/or computer language or languages.","When a user A encounters the application  and uses it in a way that requests access to information from the social network provider , the social network provider  checks to see whether the user of the application has provided authorization for access to the information by the application .","In some embodiments, a user of a social network may authorize external use of information available in the social network over which he has control. For example, the information may be associated with his user profile, account, userid (a piece of unique user identification), or any other data or data structure representing the user. Exemplary authorization methods include, but are not limited to, those in which: (1) the user opens an infinite session with the social network (as described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/906,961, titled \u201cSystems and Methods for Network Authentication,\u201d filed on Mar. 13, 2007); and (2) the user logs into the social network and through a checkbox menu or other display selects authorization settings for some or all of his information in the social network. Authorization may occur before or during the user's access to application , and may persist indefinitely until altered by the user or by the social network provider . Alternatively, for example, the login process of the social network may start a clock that results in the expiration of the authorization after some time period; after expiration, a new authorization would be required. Thus, the user of the application  may be, but need not be, actively using the social network (for instance, through a window open on his computer's desktop) while accessing information available in the social network through the application .","Information available in the social network for use with the application  may be subject to privacy settings selected by the users  of the social network (as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/493,291, titled \u201cSystems and Methods for Dynamically Generating a Privacy Summary,\u201d filed on Jul. 25, 2006). The privacy settings selections may be set either as a part of the authorization process described above, or independently. In such a case, the application  should be designed to incorporate privacy-controlled information about users  of the social network into the interaction of user A with the application , so that the privacy settings set by the user A in the social network are incorporated into the interactions of user A or other users with the application .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["106","102","104","106","202","104","102","104","106","204","206","202"]},"In an exemplary embodiment, interaction  between a user A and a social network provider  comprises the authorization process described above, in which user A authorizes the access of information about user A by the application . Interaction  may optionally also comprise the selection of privacy settings by user A. Interaction  comprises one or more instances of access of data in the social network by the application . For example, an application  that dynamically updates information from the social network will have frequent, multiple interactions  with the social network provider ; such interactions  may be mediated or otherwise processed by one or more application processing interfaces as shown in . Interactions  comprise authorizations, privacy settings selections, and\/or other information provided to the social network provider  by one or more users B-N, which similarly control access to their information by the application .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["102","104","102"]},"The social network provider  includes a user information database , a verification module , and an application programming interface , and may optionally also include a privacy settings selections component . The user information database  stores data associated with each user A-N of the social network, which may be accessible by a third-party application under appropriate conditions. When a user A authorizes access to one or more external applications, and\/or selects or updates privacy settings associated with his information, the user information database  updates the data associated with user A. Accordingly, authorizations and privacy settings selections are stored in association with each user . Authorizations, privacy settings selections and other user  information may be stored, modified, added, or otherwise embodied or captured in any storage medium.","The verification module  verifies that the user A of an application  attempting to access information from the social network has authorized use of that information, as discussed herein.","The application programming interface  communicates with the application  over the network . The application  communicates various types of information, such as requests for information about user A, requests for information about one or more users B-N, and optionally updates of information about user A, to the social network provider  through the application programming interface . Any type of application programming interface  is within the scope of various embodiments.","Optionally, a privacy settings selections component  receives privacy settings selections from a user , such as user A. The privacy settings selections component  updates the user information database  with the privacy settings selected by the user A.","Although the social network provider  is described as being comprised of various components (such as the user information database , the verification module , the application programming interface  and the privacy settings selections component ), fewer or more components may comprise the social network provider  and still fall within the scope of various embodiments.","The social network provider  may provide any type of social network. That is, a social network may comprise users grouped according to any type of category, such as friends, users living near each other, and fellow alumni. The user may specify the networks and groupings, and\/or the networks and groupings may be predetermined by the social network provider . Thus, a user A may be related to a user N in various ways through the social network, for example, by being included with user N in a group of users living in the Boston area.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","104","102","106","106","106","106","402"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","104","102","502","106","106","106","504","106","104","106","102","106","106","506","106","106","106","104","104"]},"While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation.
