The contents of each of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.","This work was funded in part by grant HL080222 from NIH. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder causing both lung and liver diseases, for which there is no effective treatment. The most common genotype of AAT deficiency is genotype PiZZ, which encodes mutant AAT, referred to as Z protein (ATZ). It affects 1 in 1,800 live births in Northern European and North American populations. The fundamental pathological process of the AAT deficiency is the accumulation of mutant AAT as polymers within hepatocytes. The resultant low levels of AAT in the serum, result in lung damage by proteinases, and eventually emphysema. Though not entirely clear, the protein accumulation in hepatocytes appears to play a crucial role in the development of liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.","AAT is a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor family. Its main function is to protect tissue from the damage caused by various proteinases during inflammatory responses. The liver is the main source of AAT. Deficiency in AAT causes both lung and liver diseases. There is no effective treatment available, except for symptomatic control and replacement therapy. A current focus on new treatment modalities is gene therapy. Although gene therapy may alleviate lung disease, the liver disorders are expected to remain. The ideal treatment would be a therapeutic intervention that promotes ATZ secretion from hepatocytes, which could cure both lung and liver diseases, and probably other diseases that are associated with AAT deficiency, such as panniculitis, vasculitis, pancreatitis or renal disease.","The prototype of AAT deficiency (PiZZ) affects 1 in 1,800 live births in Northern European and North American populations. The disease is associated with mutation of the gene, AAT. The Z form of AAT is a mutation that results from the substitution of lysine for glutamate at position , and accounts for the defective secretion and mutant molecule accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. In ZZ homozygotes, the low serum level of AAT predisposes the patients to lung disease, such as emphysema. In a subgroup of AAT deficiency patients, liver diseases also occur, which include chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, AAT deficiency-associated liver disease is the most common genetic liver disease in children and the most common genetic diagnosis for liver transplantation. However, the pathogenesis of the liver disease is poorly understood.","The lung disease in AAT deficiency patients is usually of an earlier onset than in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and often appears to be out of proportion to their smoking history. The typical pattern shows lower lobe predominant or pan-lobular emphysema. The pathogenesis of emphysema associated with AAT deficiency is closely related to neutrophil elastase. Leucocyte elastase, a neutrophil enzyme, can bind to the active site of AAT and permanently inactivates it, which causes elastin degradation, and lung tissue injury and destructionSmoking is a definite compounding factor for the development of lung disease. Other genetic factors and environmental conditions are also implicated in the pathogenesis of AAT-associated lung disease.","The current concept for AAT deficiency-associated liver cell injury is \u201cgain of function\u201d. In another words, it is related to the protein accumulation within hepatocytes (and, hence, is actually a storage disorder). The supporting evidence was mainly derived from studies using mice transgenic for mutant human AAT. Although the detailed kinetics of mutant AAT within a hepatocyte are still not completely defined, several groups have demonstrated that the mutation of AAT affects the gap between the third and fifth strands of the \u201cA\u201d sheet of the protein, which results in dimerization. The dimerized proteins eventually form polymers, which are retained in the ER. It is also possible that some unidentified cellular factors play a role in the turnover of the mutant AAT, though the details are still unknown. Recent studies have shown that chemical chaperons can reverse the cellular mislocalization or misfolding of mutant protein. It has been shown that 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) can increase blood levels of AAT in a human ATZ transgenic model. Its potential clinical effectiveness is currently undergoing evaluation).","It is still unclear how the retained protein causes cell damage. Recent studies by Teckman et al. suggested that the accumulation could initiate cellular responses. Among the responses is increased numbers of autophagosomes. It is known that autophagy is associated with cell stress, differentiation and morphogenesis. The autophagic response in the hepatocytes with mutant AAT is probably a protective mechanism for host cells. Interestingly, both AAT and mitochondria are present in the autophagosomes. Moreover, the mitochondria that are not surrounded by the autophagic vacuolar membranes are invariably damaged to a certain extent, indicating mitochondria may be involved in mutant AAT associated liver cell injury. Many studies have attributed the mitochondrion as one of the key players regulating program cell death (apoptosis). Therefore, a working hypothesis is that the accumulation of mutant AAT may subject the host cell undergoing apoptosis through signaling pathways related to the mitochondria. Supporting this notion, Perlmutter et al. have shown that activated caspase-3 is increased in the ATZ mouse liver. These observations indicate that hepatocyte apoptosis may be an important mechanism for ATZ-related liver damage.","Clinical studies have indicated that the protein accumulation alone could not explain all the cases of the liver diseases, implying that other factors may play a role in the pathogenesis, such as environmental factors and genetic traits. It has been shown that increasing ambient temperature causes an increase in the polymerization of mutant AAT. The phenomenon has been employed as an in vitro assay to study biochemical mechanisms of AAT polymerization. Systemic diseases also affect liver disease incidence and severity, probably through cytokines. It is known that several cytokines such as IL-1 or IL-6, affect expression levels of AAT. However, little is known on how these cytokines are involved in the disease process. In the case of IL-6, its signal is transmitted through STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). The binding site of STAT3 has been identified in the enhancer region of the AAT gene.","It appears that mutant AAT retention through polymerization is a key mechanism of hepatocyte damage. It is also the cause for low level of AAT in the serum.","Except for symptomatic control and replacement therapy, there is currently no effective treatment available for AAT deficiency.","The invention features compositions and methods that are useful for treating and\/or preventing AAT deficiency and conditions related to AAT deficiency, and methods for identifying compounds useful for such treatment.","In one aspect, the invention provides a method of treating alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency in a subject in need of such treatment, the method comprising administering to the subject a compound capable of disrupting polymerization of the mutant Z form of AAT under conditions such that AAT deficiency is treated.","In one aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a condition related to or associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency in a subject in need of such treatment, the method comprising administering to the subject a compound capable of disrupting polymerization of the mutant Z form of AAT under conditions such that a condition related to or associated with AAT deficiency is treated.","In another aspect, the invention provides a method of reducing the accumulation of the mutant Z form of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) in a cell (e.g., a hepatocyte), the method comprising contacting the cell with a compound capable of disrupting polymerization of the mutant Z form of AAT under conditions such that accumulation of the mutant Z form of alpha-1 antitrypsin in the cell is reduced.","In yet another aspect, the invention provides a method of increasing the secretion of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) from a cell (e.g., a hepatocyte) producing a mutant Z form of AAT, the method comprising contacting the cell with a compound capable of disrupting polymerization of the mutant Z form of AAT under conditions such that secretion of AAT from the cell is increased.","In still another aspect, the invention provides a method for inhibiting the polymerization of the mutant Z form of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) in a cell (e.g., a hepatocyte), comprising contacting the mutant Z form of alpha-1 antitrypsin with a compound capable of disrupting polymerization of the mutant Z form of AAT under conditions such that polymerization of the mutant Z form of alpha-1 antitrypsin in the cell is reduced (e.g., the amount of or accumulation of the mutant Z form of alpha-1 antitrypsin in the cell is reduced).","In a still further aspect, the invention provides a method for treating a subject diagnosed as having AAT deficiency (e.g., due to the subject producing a mutant form of AAT), the method comprising administering to the subject a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound capable of disrupting polymerization of the mutant Z form of AAT.","In another aspect, the invention provides a method of increasing the amount of a biochemically functional conformation of an AAT protein in a cell (e.g., a hepatocyte or a lung cell), the method comprising contacting the cell with an effective amount of a compound capable of disrupting polymerization of the mutant Z form of AAT, with the proviso that the compound is not 4-phenylbutyrate;

Such preparations have both therapeutic and prophylactic applications. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition includes compound capable of inhibiting mutant AAT protein polymerization (e.g., a compound of Table 1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Compounds of the invention may be administered as part of a pharmaceutical composition. The compositions should be sterile and contain a therapeutically effective amount of the active compound in a unit of weight or volume suitable for administration to a subject. The compositions and combinations of the invention can be part of a pharmaceutical pack, where each of the compounds is present in individual dosage amounts.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d refers to those compound of the inventions of the present invention, compositions containing such compounds, and\/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio.","In another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound capable of disrupting polymerization of the mutant Z form of AAT, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, with the proviso that the a compound capable of disrupting polymerization of the mutant Z form of AAT is not 4-phenylbutyrate.","In another aspect, the invention provides an oral dosage form comprising a compound capable of disrupting polymerization of the mutant Z form of AAT, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, with the proviso that the compound capable of disrupting polymerization of the mutant Z form of AAT is not a 4-phenylbutyrate.","In any of the above aspects, the compound can be a compound identified by computational screening, and\/or can be a compound selected from the following: 542-Bromo-ethoxy-methyl)-quinolin-8-ol, 3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrocinnamic acid, 4-hydroxyantipyrine, 5-Nitro-1-naphthol, 3\u2032-acetoxy acetophenone, 2-Ethyl-3-methyl-3-thiophen-2-yl-oxirane-2-carboxylic acid, sodium salt, 2-Bromo-1,5-dimethoxy-3-methyl-benzene, 2-acetyl-5-chlorothiophene, or 1,9-decadiene; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

In certain embodiments, mixtures of the above-referenced compounds can be employed. In certain embodiments, the compound is not 4-phenylbutyrate.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention to be used for prophylactic or therapeutic administration should be sterile. Sterility is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes (e.g., 0.2 \u03bcm membranes), by gamma irradiation, or any other suitable means known to those skilled in the art. Therapeutic compound compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle. These compositions ordinarily will be stored in unit or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampoules or vials, as an aqueous solution or as a lyophilized formulation for reconstitution.","The compounds may be combined, optionally, with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The term \u201cpharmaceutically-acceptable excipient\u201d as used herein means one or more compatible solid or liquid filler, diluents or encapsulating substances that are suitable for administration into a human. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate administration. The components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being co-mingled with the molecules of the present invention, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction that would substantially impair the desired pharmaceutical efficacy.","Compounds of the present invention can be contained in a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The excipient preferably contains minor amounts of additives such as substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability. Such materials are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, succinate, acetate, lactate, tartrate, and other organic acids or their salts; tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane (TRIS), bicarbonate, carbonate, and other organic bases and their salts; antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (for example, less than about ten residues) polypeptides, e.g., polyarginine, polylysine, polyglutamate and polyaspartate; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polypropylene glycols (PPGs), and polyethylene glycols (PEGs); amino acids, such as glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, histidine, lysine, or arginine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives, glucose, mannose, sucrose, dextrins or sulfated carbohydrate derivatives, such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate or dextran sulfate; polyvalent metal ions, such as divalent metal ions including calcium ions, magnesium ions and manganese ions; chelating agents, such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA); sugar alcohols, such as mannitol or sorbitol; counterions, such as sodium or ammonium; and\/or nonionic surfactants, such as polysorbates or poloxamers. Other additives may be included, such as stabilizers, anti-microbials, inert gases, fluid and nutrient replenishers (i.e., Ringer's dextrose), electrolyte replenishers, and the like, which can be present in conventional amounts.","The compositions, as described above, can be administered in effective amounts. The effective amount will depend upon the mode of administration, the particular condition being treated and the desired outcome. It may also depend upon the stage of the condition, the age and physical condition of the subject, the nature of concurrent therapy, if any, and like factors well known to the medical practitioner. For therapeutic applications, it is that amount sufficient to achieve a medically desirable result.","With respect to a subject suffering from or susceptible to AAT deficiency, an effective amount is, e.g., in certain embodiments, an amount sufficient to increase the level of a correctly folded or physiologically active AAT protein in a cell, or, in certain embodiments, an amount sufficient to reduce the amount of a mutant AAT protein in a cell or tissue. With respect to a subject having a disease or disorder related to a mutant AAT protein, an effective amount is an amount sufficient to stabilize, slow, or reduce a symptom associated with an AAT-deficiency-associated pathology such as lung or liver disease. Generally, doses of the compounds of the present invention would be from about 0.01 mg\/kg per day to about 1000 mg\/kg per day, e.g., from about 0.1 mg\/kg per day to about 100 mg\/kg per day. It is expected that doses ranging from about 1 to about 1000 mg\/kg will be suitable. Lower doses will result from certain forms of administration, such as intravenous administration. In the event that a response in a subject is insufficient at the initial doses applied, higher doses (or effectively higher doses by a different, more localized delivery route) may be employed to the extent that patient tolerance permits. Multiple doses per day are contemplated to achieve appropriate systemic levels of a composition of the present invention.","A variety of administration routes are available. The methods of the invention, generally speaking, may be practiced using any mode of administration that is medically acceptable, meaning any mode that produces effective levels of the active compounds without causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects. In one embodiment, a composition of the invention is administered orally. Oral administration may provide certain advantages, e.g., for treatment or prevention of liver damage, oral administration can provide a high concentration of the drug to hepatic circulation and thus to the liver. Other modes of administration include rectal; topical, intraocular, buccal, intravaginal, intracisternal, intracerebroventricular, intratracheal, nasal, transdermal, within\/on implants, or parenteral routes. The term \u201cparenteral\u201d includes subcutaneous, intrathecal, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or infusion. Compositions comprising a composition of the invention can be added to a physiological fluid, such as to the intravitreal humor. For CNS administration, a variety of techniques are available for promoting transfer of the therapeutic across the blood brain barrier including disruption by surgery or injection, drugs which transiently open adhesion contact between the CNS vasculature endothelial cells, and compounds that facilitate translocation through such cells. Oral administration can be preferred for prophylactic treatment because of the convenience to the patient as well as the dosing schedule. Oral administration is also beneficial because of the first passage effect on the liver, which may reduce the systemic side effects.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can optionally further contain one or more additional proteins as desired, including plasma proteins, proteases, and other biological material, so long as it does not cause adverse effects upon administration to a subject. Suitable proteins or biological material may be obtained from human or mammalian plasma by any of the purification methods known and available to those skilled in the art; from supernatants, extracts, or lysates of recombinant tissue culture, viruses, yeast, bacteria, or the like that contain a gene that expresses a human or mammalian plasma protein which has been introduced according to standard recombinant DNA techniques; or from the fluids (e.g., blood, milk, lymph, urine or the like) or transgenic animals that contain a gene that expresses a human plasma protein which has been introduced according to standard transgenic techniques.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can comprise one or more pH buffering compounds to maintain the pH of the formulation at a predetermined level that reflects physiological pH, such as in the range of about 5.0 to about 8.0. The pH buffering compound used in the aqueous liquid formulation can be an amino acid or mixture of amino acids, such as histidine or a mixture of amino acids such as histidine and glycine. Alternatively, the pH buffering compound is preferably an agent which maintains the pH of the formulation at a predetermined level, such as in the range of about 5.0 to about 8.0, and which does not chelate calcium ions. Illustrative examples of such pH buffering compounds include, but are not limited to, imidazole and acetate ions. The pH buffering compound may be present in any amount suitable to maintain the pH of the formulation at a predetermined level.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can also contain one or more osmotic modulating agents, i.e., a compound that modulates the osmotic properties (e.g, tonicity, osmolality and\/or osmotic pressure) of the formulation to a level that is acceptable to the blood stream and blood cells of recipient individuals. The osmotic modulating agent can be an agent that does not chelate calcium ions. The osmotic modulating agent can be any compound known or available to those skilled in the art that modulates the osmotic properties of the formulation. One skilled in the art may empirically determine the suitability of a given osmotic modulating agent for use in the inventive formulation. Illustrative examples of suitable types of osmotic modulating agents include, but are not limited to: salts, such as sodium chloride and sodium acetate; sugars, such as sucrose, dextrose, and mannitol; amino acids, such as glycine; and mixtures of one or more of these agents and\/or types of agents. The osmotic modulating agent(s) may be present in any concentration sufficient to modulate the osmotic properties of the formulation.","Compositions comprising a mutant AAT-stabilizing compound of the present invention can contain multivalent metal ions, such as calcium ions, magnesium ions and\/or manganese ions. Any multivalent metal ion that helps stabilizes the composition and that will not adversely affect recipient individuals may be used. The skilled artisan, based on these two criteria, can determine suitable metal ions empirically and suitable sources of such metal ions are known, and include inorganic and organic salts.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can also be a non-aqueous liquid formulation. Any suitable non-aqueous liquid may be employed, provided that it provides stability to the active agents (s) contained therein. Preferably, the non-aqueous liquid is a hydrophilic liquid. Illustrative examples of suitable non-aqueous liquids include: glycerol; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); polydimethylsiloxane (PMS); ethylene glycols, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol (\u201cPEG\u201d) 200, PEG 300, and PEG 400; and propylene glycols, such as dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol (\u201cPPG\u201d) 425, PPG 725, PPG 1000, PPG 2000, PPG 3000 and PPG 4000.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can also be a mixed aqueous\/non-aqueous liquid formulation. Any suitable non-aqueous liquid formulation, such as those described above, can be employed along with any aqueous liquid formulation, such as those described above, provided that the mixed aqueous\/non-aqueous liquid formulation provides stability to the compound contained therein. Preferably, the non-aqueous liquid in such a formulation is a hydrophilic liquid. Illustrative examples of suitable non-aqueous liquids include: glycerol; DMSO; PMS; ethylene glycols, such as PEG 200, PEG 300, and PEG 400; and propylene glycols, such as PPG 425, PPG 725, PPG 1000, PPG 2000, PPG 3000 and PPG 4000.","Suitable stable formulations can permit storage of the active agents in a frozen or an unfrozen liquid state. Stable liquid formulations can be stored at a temperature of at least \u221270\u00b0 C., but can also be stored at higher temperatures of at least 0\u00b0 C., or between about 0.1\u00b0 C. and about 42\u00b0 C., depending on the properties of the composition. It is generally known to the skilled artisan that proteins and polypeptides are sensitive to changes in pH, temperature, and a multiplicity of other factors that may affect therapeutic efficacy.","In certain embodiments a desirable route of administration can be by pulmonary aerosol. Techniques for preparing aerosol delivery systems containing polypeptides are well known to those of skill in the art. Generally, such systems should utilize components that will not significantly impair the biological properties of the antibodies, such as the paratope binding capacity (see, for example, Sciarra and Cutie, \u201cAerosols,\u201d in 18th edition, 1990, pp 1694-1712; incorporated by reference). Those of skill in the art can readily modify the various parameters and conditions for producing polypeptide aerosols without resorting to undue experimentation.","Other delivery systems can include time-release, delayed release or sustained release delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of compositions of the invention, increasing convenience to the subject and the physician. Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They include polymer base systems such as polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919; European Patent No. 58,481), poly(lactide-glycolide), copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acids, such as poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (European Patent No. 133, 988), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman, K. R. et al., Biopolymers 22: 547-556), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) or ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer, R. et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 15:267-277; Langer, R. Chem. Tech. 12:98-105), and polyanhydrides.","Other examples of sustained-release compositions include semi-permeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Delivery systems also include non-polymer systems that are: lipids including sterols such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids or neutral fats such as mono-di- and tri-glycerides; hydrogel release systems such as biologically-derived bioresorbable hydrogel (i.e., chitin hydrogels or chitosan hydrogels); sylastic systems; peptide based systems; wax coatings; compressed tablets using conventional binders and excipients; partially fused implants; and the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: (a) erosional systems in which the agent is contained in a form within a matrix such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,452,775, 4,667,014, 4,748,034 and 5,239,660 and (b) diffusional systems in which an active component permeates at a controlled rate from a polymer such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,832,253, and 3,854,480.","Another type of delivery system that can be used with the methods and compositions of the invention is a colloidal dispersion system. Colloidal dispersion systems include lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. Liposomes are artificial membrane vessels, which are useful as a delivery vector in vivo or in vitro. Large unilamellar vessels (LUV), which range in size from 0.2-4.0 \u03bcm, can encapsulate large macromolecules within the aqueous interior and be delivered to cells in a biologically active form (Fraley, R., and Papahadjopoulos, D., Trends Biochem. Sci. 6: 77-80).","Liposomes can be targeted to a particular tissue by coupling the liposome to a specific ligand such as a monoclonal antibody, sugar, glycolipid, or protein. Liposomes are commercially available from Gibco BRL, for example, as LIPOFECTIN\u2122 and LIPOFECTACE\u2122, which are formed of cationic lipids such as N-[1-(2,3dioleyloxy)-propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA) and dimethyl dioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB). Methods for making liposomes are well known in the art and have been described in many publications, for example, in DE 3,218,121; Epstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 82:3688-3692 (1985); Hwang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 77:4030-4034 (1980); EP 52,322; EP 36,676; EP 88,046; EP 143,949; EP 142,641; Japanese Pat. Appl. 83-118008; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and EP 102,324. Liposomes also have been reviewed by Gregoriadis, G., Trends Biotechnol., 3: 235-241).","Another type of vehicle is a biocompatible microparticle or implant that is suitable for implantation into the mammalian recipient. Exemplary bioerodible implants that are useful in accordance with this method are described in PCT International application no. PCT\/US\/03307 (Publication No. WO 95\/24929, entitled \u201cPolymeric Gene Delivery System\u201d). PCT\/US\/03307 describes biocompatible, preferably biodegradable polymeric matrices for containing an exogenous gene under the control of an appropriate promoter. The polymeric matrices can be used to achieve sustained release of the exogenous gene or gene product in the subject.","The polymeric matrix preferably is in the form of a microparticle such as a microsphere (wherein an agent is dispersed throughout a solid polymeric matrix) or a microcapsule (wherein an agent is stored in the core of a polymeric shell). Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,109. Other forms of the polymeric matrix for containing an agent include films, coatings, gels, implants, and stents. The size and composition of the polymeric matrix device is selected to result in favorable release kinetics in the tissue into which the matrix is introduced. The size of the polymeric matrix further is selected according to the method of delivery that is to be used. Preferably, when an aerosol route is used the polymeric matrix and composition are encompassed in a surfactant vehicle. The polymeric matrix composition can be selected to have both favorable degradation rates and also to be formed of a material, which is a bioadhesive, to further increase the effectiveness of transfer. The matrix composition also can be selected not to degrade, but rather to release by diffusion over an extended period of time. The delivery system can also be a biocompatible microsphere that is suitable for local, site-specific delivery. Such microspheres are disclosed in Chickering, D. E., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng., 52: 96-101; Mathiowitz, E., et al., Nature 386: 410-414.","Both non-biodegradable and biodegradable polymeric matrices can be used to deliver the compositions of the invention to the subject. Such polymers may be natural or synthetic polymers. The polymer is selected based on the period of time over which release is desired, generally in the order of a few hours to a year or longer. Typically, release over a period ranging from between a few hours and three to twelve months is most desirable. The polymer optionally is in the form of a hydrogel that can absorb up to about 90% of its weight in water and further, optionally is cross-linked with multivalent ions or other polymers.","Exemplary synthetic polymers which can be used to form the biodegradable delivery system include: polyamides, polycarbonates, polyalkylenes, polyalkylene glycols, polyalkylene oxides, polyalkylene terephthalates, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl ethers, polyvinyl esters, poly-vinyl halides, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyglycolides, polysiloxanes, polyurethanes and co-polymers thereof, alkyl cellulose, hydroxyalkyl celluloses, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, nitro celluloses, polymers of acrylic and methacrylic esters, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxy-propyl methyl cellulose, hydroxybutyl methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate phthalate, carboxylethyl cellulose, cellulose triacetate, cellulose sulphate sodium salt, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(ethyl methacrylate), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate), poly(isodecyl methacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), poly(octadecyl acrylate), polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene oxide), poly(ethylene terephthalate), polyvinyl alcohols), polyvinyl acetate, poly vinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid, polyanhydrides, poly(ortho)esters, poly(butic acid), poly(valeric acid), and poly(lactide-cocaprolactone), and natural polymers such as alginate and other polysaccharides including dextran and cellulose, collagen, chemical derivatives thereof (substitutions, additions of chemical groups, for example, alkyl, alkylene, hydroxylations, oxidations, and other modifications routinely made by those skilled in the art), albumin and other hydrophilic proteins, zein and other prolamines and hydrophobic proteins, copolymers and mixtures thereof. In general, these materials degrade either by enzymatic hydrolysis or exposure to water in vivo, by surface or bulk erosion.","Nanoparticles are a colloidal carrier system that has been shown to improve the efficacy of the encapsulated drug by prolonging the serum half-life. Polyalkylcyanoacrylates (PACAs) nanoparticles are a polymer colloidal drug delivery system that is in clinical development, as described by Stella et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 2000. 89: p. 1452-1464; Brigger et al., Int. J. Pharm., 2001. 214: p. 37-42; Calvo et al., Pharm. Res., 2001. 18: p. 1157-1166; and Li et al., Biol. Pharm. Bull., 2001. 24: p. 662-665. Biodegradable poly(hydroxyl acids), such as the copolymers of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(lactic-co-glycolide) (PLGA) are being extensively used in biomedical applications and have received FDA approval for certain clinical applications. In addition, PEG-PLGA nanoparticles have many desirable carrier features including (i) that the agent to be encapsulated comprises a reasonably high weight fraction (loading) of the total carrier system; (ii) that the amount of agent used in the first step of the encapsulation process is incorporated into the final carrier (entrapment efficiency) at a reasonably high level; (iii) that the carrier have the ability to be freeze-dried and reconstituted in solution without aggregation; (iv) that the carrier be biodegradable; (v) that the carrier system be of small size; and (vi) that the carrier enhance the particles persistence.","Nanoparticles are synthesized using virtually any biodegradable shell known in the art. In one embodiment, a polymer, such as poly(lactic-acid) (PLA) or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is used. Such polymers are biocompatible and biodegradable, and are subject to modifications that desirably increase the photochemical efficacy and circulation lifetime of the nanoparticle. In one embodiment, the polymer is modified with a terminal carboxylic acid group (COOH) that increases the negative charge of the particle and thus limits the interaction with negatively charge nucleic acid aptamers. Nanoparticles are also modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG), which also increases the half-life and stability of the particles in circulation. Alternatively, the COOH group is converted to an N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester for covalent conjugation to amine-modified aptamers.","Biocompatible polymers useful in the composition and methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyalkylenes, polyalkylene glycols, polyalkylene oxides, polyalkylene terephthalates, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl ethers, polyvinyl esters, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyglycolides, polysiloxanes, polyurethanes and copolymers thereof, alkyl cellulose, hydroxyalkyl celluloses, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, nitro celluloses, polymers of acrylic and methacrylic esters, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxy-propyl methyl cellulose, hydroxybutyl methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetage phthalate, carboxylethyl cellulose, cellulose triacetate, cellulose sulphate sodium salt, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(ethylmethacrylate), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutylmethacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate), poly(isodecylmethacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), poly(octadecyl acrylate), polyethylene, polypropylene poly(ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene oxide), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(vinyl alcohols), poly(vinyl acetate, poly vinyl chloride polystyrene, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyhyaluronic acids, casein, gelatin, glutin, polyanhydrides, polyacrylic acid, alginate, chitosan, poly(methyl methacrylates), poly(ethyl methacrylates), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutylmethacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate), poly(isodecyl methacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), poly(octadecyl acrylate) and combinations of any of these.

For topical delivery, the compositions are provided in any pharmaceutically acceptable excipient that is approved for topical delivery.","Those of skill in the art will recognize that the best treatment regimens for using compounds of the present invention to treat AAT deficiency can be straightforwardly determined. This is not a question of experimentation, but rather one of optimization, which is routinely conducted in the medical arts. In vivo studies in nude mice often provide a starting point from which to begin to optimize the dosage and delivery regimes. The frequency of injection will initially be once a week, as has been done in some mice studies. However, this frequency might be optimally adjusted from one day to every two weeks to monthly, depending upon the results obtained from the initial clinical trials and the needs of a particular patient.","Human dosage amounts can initially be determined by extrapolating from the amount of compound used in mice, as a skilled artisan recognizes it is routine in the art to modify the dosage for humans compared to animal models. In certain embodiments it is envisioned that the dosage may vary from between about 1 mg compound\/Kg body weight to about 5000 mg compound\/Kg body weight; or from about 5 mg\/Kg body weight to about 4000 mg\/Kg body weight or from about 10 mg\/Kg body weight to about 3000 mg\/Kg body weight; or from about 50 mg\/Kg body weight to about 2000 mg\/Kg body weight; or from about 100 mg\/Kg body weight to about 1000 mg\/Kg body weight; or from about 150 mg\/Kg body weight to about 500 mg\/Kg body weight. In other embodiments this dose may be about 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200, 1250, 1300, 1350, 1400, 1450, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, or 5000 mg\/Kg body weight.

In other embodiments the doses may be about 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 or 18 g\/Kg body weight. Of course, this dosage amount may be adjusted upward or downward, as is routinely done in such treatment protocols, depending on the results of the initial clinical trials and the needs of a particular patient.","Screening Methods and Systems","In another aspect, the invention provides a machine readable storage medium which comprises the structural coordinates of an AAT binding site identified herein, (e.g., a binding site in the P6-P3 region of an AAT protein monomer, e.g., one or more (preferably 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20) of residues 173-184, 327-333 and 352, or similarly shaped, homologous binding pockets.

No. 5,978,740 and\/or 6,183,121 (incorporated herein by reference). For example, a computer system can includes a computer comprising a central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d), a working memory (which may be, e.g., RAM (random-access memory) or \u201ccore\u201d memory), a mass storage memory (such as one or more disk drives or CD-ROM drives), one or more cathode-ray tube (CRT) or liquid crystal display (LCD) display terminals, one or more keyboards, one or more input lines, and one or more output lines, all of which are interconnected by a conventional system bus.","Machine-readable data of this invention may be inputted to the computer via the use of a modem or modems connected by a data line. Alternatively or additionally, the input hardware may include CD-ROM drives, disk drives or flash memory. In conjunction with a display terminal, a keyboard may also be used as an input device.","Output hardware coupled to the computer by output lines may similarly be implemented by conventional devices. By way of example, output hardware may include a CRT or LCD display terminal for displaying a graphical representation of a binding pocket of this invention using a program such as QUANTA or PYMOL. Output hardware might also include a printer, or a disk drive to store system output for later use.","In operation, the CPU coordinates the use of the various input and output devices, coordinates data accesses from the mass storage and accesses to and from working memory, and determines the sequence of data processing steps. A number of programs may be used to process the machine-readable data of this invention, including commercially-available software.","A magnetic storage medium for storing machine-readable data according to the invention can be conventional. A magnetic data storage medium can be encoded with a machine-readable data that can be carried out by a system such as the computer system described above. The medium can be a conventional floppy diskette or hard disk, having a suitable substrate which may be conventional, and a suitable coating, which may also be conventional, on one or both sides, containing magnetic domains whose polarity or orientation can be altered magnetically. The medium may also have an opening (not shown) for receiving the spindle of a disk drive or other data storage device.","The magnetic domains of the medium are polarized or oriented so as to encode in manner which may be conventional, machine readable data such as that described herein, for execution by a system such as the computer system described herein.","An optically-readable data storage medium also can be encoded with machine-readable data, or a set of instructions, which can be carried out by a computer system. The medium can be a conventional compact disk read only memory (CD-ROM) or a rewritable medium such as a magneto-optical disk which is optically readable and magneto-optically writable.","In the case of CD-ROM, as is well known, a disk coating is reflective and is impressed with a plurality of pits to encode the machine-readable data. The arrangement of pits is read by reflecting laser light off the surface of the coating. A protective coating, which preferably is substantially transparent, is provided on top of the reflective coating.","In the case of a magneto-optical disk, as is well known, a data-recording coating has no pits, but has a plurality of magnetic domains whose polarity or orientation can be changed magnetically when heated above a certain temperature, as by a laser. The orientation of the domains can be read by measuring the polarization of laser light reflected from the coating. The arrangement of the domains encodes the data as described above.","Structure data, when used in conjunction with a computer programmed with software to translate those coordinates into the 3-dimensional structure of a molecule or molecular complex comprising a binding pocket may be used for a variety of purposes, such as drug discovery.","For example, the structure encoded by the data may be computationally evaluated for its ability to associate with chemical entities. Chemical entities that associate with a binding site of an AAT protein (including a mutant AAT protein) may inhibit mutant AAT protein polymerization or aggregation, and are potential drug candidates. Alternatively, the structure encoded by the data may be displayed in a graphical three-dimensional representation on a computer screen. This allows visual inspection of the structure, as well as visual inspection of the structure's association with chemical entities.","Thus, according to another embodiment, the invention relates to a method for evaluating the potential of a chemical entity to associate with a) a molecule or molecular complex comprising a binding pocket defined by structure coordinates of AAT protein monomer amino acid residues in the P6-P3 region of the AAT protein (e.g., one or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20) of residues 173-184, 327-333 and 352), as described herein, or b) a homologue of said molecule or molecular complex, wherein said homologue comprises a binding pocket that has a root mean square deviation from the backbone atoms of said amino acids of not more than 2.0 (more preferably 1.5) angstroms.","This method comprises the steps of:","i) employing computational means to perform a fitting operation between the chemical entity and a binding pocket of the molecule or molecular complex; and","ii) analyzing the results of the fitting operation to quantify the association between the chemical entity and the binding pocket. This embodiment relates to evaluating the potential of a chemical entity to associate with or bind to a binding site of AAT protein.","The term \u201cchemical entity\u201d, as used herein, refers to chemical compounds, complexes of at least two chemical compounds, and fragments of such compounds or complexes.","In certain embodiments, the method evaluates the potential of a chemical entity to associate with a molecule or molecular complex defined by structure coordinates of all of the amino acids of AAT protein, as described herein, or a homologue of said molecule or molecular complex having a root mean square deviation from the backbone atoms of said amino acids of not more than 2.0 (more preferably not more than 1.5) angstroms.","In a further embodiment, the structural coordinates one of the binding pockets described herein can be utilized in a method for identifying a potential agonist or antagonist of a molecule comprising an AAT binding site. This method comprises the steps of:","a) using the atomic coordinates of AAT protein monomer amino acid residues in the P6-P3 region of the AAT protein (e.g., one or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20) of residues 173-184, 327-333 and 352), as described herein, with a root mean square deviation from the backbone atoms of said amino acids of not more than about 2.0 (more preferably not more than 1.5) angstroms, to generate a three-dimensional structure of molecule comprising an AAT binding site;","b) employing the three-dimensional structure to design or select the potential agonist or antagonist. The method further includes the optional steps of c) synthesizing the agonist or antagonist; and d) contacting the agonist or antagonist with the molecule to determine the ability of the potential agonist or antagonist to interact with the molecule.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for identifying a potential agonist or antagonist of mutant AAT polymerization, the method comprising the steps of:","a) using the atomic coordinates of AAT protein monomer amino acid residues in the P6-P3 region (e.g., one or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20) of residues 173-184, 327-333 and 352) of the AAT protein to generate a three-dimensional structure of an AAT binding site;","b) employing the three-dimensional structure to design or select the potential agonist or antagonist.","The present inventors' elucidation of heretofore unknown binding sites of AAT proteins provides the necessary information for designing new chemical entities and compounds that may interact with AAT proteins, in whole or in part, and may therefore modulate (e.g., inhibit) the polymerization of mutant AAT proteins.","The design of compounds that bind to or inhibit AAT binding sites according to this invention generally involves consideration of several factors. First, the entity must be capable of physically and structurally associating with parts or all of the AAT binding site. Non-covalent molecular interactions important in this association include hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions. Second, the entity must be able to assume a conformation that allows it to associate with the AAT binding site(s) directly. Although certain portions of the entity will not directly participate in these associations, those portions of the entity may still influence the overall conformation of the molecule. This, in turn, may have a significant impact on potency. Such conformational requirements include the overall three-dimensional structure and orientation of the chemical entity in relation to all or a portion of the binding pocket, or the spacing between functional groups of an entity comprising several chemical entities that directly interact with the binding pocket or homologues thereof.","The potential inhibitory or binding effect of a chemical entity on an AAT binding site may be analyzed prior to its actual synthesis and testing by the use of computer modeling techniques. If the theoretical structure of the given entity suggests insufficient interaction and association between it and the target binding pocket, testing of the entity is obviated. However, if computer modeling indicates a strong interaction, the molecule may then be synthesized and tested for its ability to bind to a binding site. This may be achieved, e.g., by testing the ability of the molecule to inhibit AAT polymerization, e.g., using assays described herein or known in the art. In this manner, synthesis of inoperative compounds may be avoided.","A potential inhibitor of an AAT binding site may be computationally evaluated by means of a series of steps in which chemical entities or fragments are screened and selected for their ability to associate with the AAT binding site.","One skilled in the art may use one of several methods to screen chemical entities or fragments for their ability to associate with an AAT binding site. This process may begin by visual inspection of, for example, an AAT binding site on the computer screen based on the an AAT structure coordinates described herein, or other coordinates which define a similar shape generated from the machine-readable storage medium. Selected fragments or chemical entities may then be positioned in a variety of orientations, or docked, within that binding site as defined supra. Docking may be accomplished using software such as Quanta and DOCK, followed by energy minimization and molecular dynamics with standard molecular mechanics force fields, such as CHARMM and AMBER.","Specialized computer programs (e.g., as known in the art and\/or commercially available and\/or as described herein) may also assist in the process of selecting fragments or chemical entities.","Once suitable chemical entities or fragments have been selected, they can be assembled into a single compound or complex. Assembly may be preceded by visual inspection of the relationship of the fragments to each other on the three-dimensional image displayed on a computer screen in relation to the structure coordinates of the target binding site.","Instead of proceeding to build an inhibitor of a binding pocket in a step-wise fashion one fragment or chemical entity at a time as described above, inhibitory or other binding compounds may be designed as a whole or \u201cde novo\u201d using either an empty binding site or optionally including some portion(s) of a known inhibitor(s). There are many de novo ligand design methods known in the art, some of which are commercially available (e.g., LeapFrog, available from Tripos Associates, St. Louis, Mo.).","Other molecular modeling techniques may also be employed in accordance with this invention (see, e.g., N. C. Cohen et al., \u201cMolecular Modeling Software and Methods for Medicinal Chemistry, J. Med. Chem., 33, pp. 883-894 (1990); see also, M. A. Navia and M. A. Murcko, \u201cThe Use of Structural Information in Drug Design\u201d, Current Opinions in Structural Biology, 2, pp. 202-210 (1992); L. M. Balbes et al., \u201cA Perspective of Modern Methods in Computer-Aided Drug Design\u201d, in Reviews in Computational Chemistry, Vol. 5, K. B. Lipkowitz and D. B. Boyd, Eds., VCH, New York, pp. 337-380 (1994); see also, W. C. Guida, \u201cSoftware For Structure-Based Drug Design\u201d, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biology 4, pp. 777-781 (1994)).","Once a compound has been designed or selected, the efficiency with which that entity may bind to a binding pocket may be tested and optimized by computational evaluation.","Specific computer software is available in the art to evaluate compound deformation energy and electrostatic interactions. Examples of programs designed for such uses include: AMBER; QUANTA\/CHARMM (Accelrys, Inc., Madison, Wis.) and the like. These programs may be implemented, for instance, using a commercially-available graphics workstation. Other hardware systems and software packages will be known to those skilled in the art.","Another technique involves the in silica screening of virtual libraries of compounds, e.g., as described herein (see, e.g., Example 1). Many thousands of compounds can be rapidly screened and the best virtual compounds can be selected for further screening (e.g., by synthesis and in vitro testing). Small molecule databases can be screened for chemical entities or compounds that can bind, in whole or in part, to an AAT binding site. In this screening, the quality of fit of such entities to the binding site may be judged either by shape complementarity or by estimated interaction energy.","Screening Assays","As discussed herein, useful compounds correct or prevent protein misfolding by increasing the amount of a mutant protein that is in a biochemically active conformation. Any number of methods are available for carrying out screening assays to identify such compounds. In one approach, a mutant AAT protein that fails to adopt a wild-type protein conformation resulting polymerization or aggregation is expressed in a cell (e.g., a cell in vitro or in vivo); the cell is contacted with a candidate compound; and the effect of the compound on the polymerization of the mutant AAT protein is assayed using any method known in the art or described herein. Useful compounds decrease the amount of mutant AAT protein polymerization by at least 10%, 15%, or 20%, or preferably by 25%, 50%, or 75%; or most preferably by at least 100%, 200%, 300% or even 400%.","If desired, the efficacy of the identified compound is assayed in an animal model of AAT deficiency (e.g., a transgenic mouse model).","Test Compounds and Extracts","In general, compounds capable of inhibiting AZT polymerization in a cell are identified from large libraries of either natural product or synthetic (or semi-synthetic) extracts or chemical libraries according to methods known in the art. Those skilled in the field of drug discovery and development will understand that the precise source of test extracts or compounds is not critical to the screening procedure(s) of the invention. Accordingly, large numbers of chemical extracts or compounds can be screened using the methods described herein. Examples of such extracts or compounds include, but are not limited to, plant-, fungal-, prokaryotic- or animal-based extracts, fermentation broths, and synthetic compounds, as well as modification of existing compounds. Numerous methods are also available for generating random or directed synthesis (e.g., semi-synthesis or total synthesis) of any number of chemical compounds, including, but not limited to, saccharide-, lipid-, peptide-, and nucleic acid-based compounds. Synthetic compound libraries are commercially available from Brandon Associates (Merrimack, N.H.) and Aldrich Chemical (Milwaukee, Wis.). Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal extracts are commercially available from a number of sources, including Biotics (Sussex, UK), Xenova (Slough, UK), Harbor Branch Oceangraphics Institute (Ft. Pierce, Fla.), and PharmaMar, U.S.A. (Cambridge, Mass.). In addition, natural and synthetically produced libraries are produced, if desired, according to methods known in the art, e.g., by standard extraction and fractionation methods. Furthermore, if desired, any library or compound is readily modified using standard chemical, physical, or biochemical methods.","In addition, those skilled in the art of drug discovery and development readily understand that methods for dereplication (e.g., taxonomic dereplication, biological dereplication, and chemical dereplication, or any combination thereof) or the elimination of replicates or repeats of materials already known for their activity in correcting a misfolded protein should be employed whenever possible.","When a crude extract is found to prevent mutant AAT polymer formation, further fractionation of the positive lead extract is necessary to isolate chemical constituents responsible for the observed effect. Thus, the goal of the extraction, fractionation, and purification process is the careful characterization and identification of a chemical entity within the crude extract that prevents mutant AAT polymer formation. Methods of fractionation and purification of such heterogenous extracts are known in the art. If desired, compounds shown to be useful agents for the treatment of any pathology related to a misfolded protein or protein aggregation are chemically modified according to methods known in the art.","Combination Therapies","Compositions of the invention useful for the treatment of AAT deficiency (or conditions related thereto) can optionally be combined with additional therapies. For example, 4-phenylbutyric acid has been shown to have potential therapeutic effect in AAT models.","Kits","The invention provides kits for the treatment or prevention of AAT deficiency or symptoms thereof.

Preferably, the compositions are present in unit dosage form. In some embodiments, the kit comprises a sterile container which contains a therapeutic or prophylactic composition; such containers can be boxes, ampules, bottles, vials, tubes, bags, pouches, blister-packs, or other suitable container forms known in the art. Such containers can be made of plastic, glass, laminated paper, metal foil, or other materials suitable for holding medicaments. In certain embodiments, the kit further comprises a second compound for treatment of AAT deficiency, e.g., 4-phenylbutyric acid.","If desired compositions of the invention or combinations thereof are provided together with instructions for administering them to a subject having or at risk of developing AAT deficiency.

A significant finding in understanding polymer formation in AAT deficiency is the conserved mode of interaction between monomers that yield plaque-causing polymers. The atomic interactions at the interface between monomers were characterized by x-ray crystallography. Residues from the P6-P3 region of one monomer insert into a gap in the \u03b2-sheet of an adjacent monomer. We utilized the atomic positions of the residues in the P6-P3 region as the site selected for molecular docking to disrupt polymer.","We positioned spheres at the selected site to allow the molecular docking program, DOCK5.1.0, to match spheres with atoms in potential ligands (small molecules in this case). During the molecular docking calculation, orientations are sampled to match the largest number of spheres to potential ligand atoms. The spheres are depicted in .","The atomic positions and chemical characteristics of residues in close proximity (within 4 \u212b) to the selected site were used to establish a scoring grid to evaluate potential interactions with small molecules. Blue spheres in  mark the boundaries of the scoring grid utilized in this preliminary study. Two types of interaction were scored: van der Waals contact and electrostatic interactions. A scoring grid was calculated to estimate the interaction between potential ligands and the AAT target site.","We utilized DOCK5.1.0 to perform docking molecular dynamic simulations. The coordinates for approximately 140,000 compounds (all of which are available through the NCI\/DTP) were used as the ligand database for molecular docking site. Each small molecule was positioned in the selected site in 100 different orientations, and the best orientations and their scores (contact and electrostatic) were calculated. The scored compounds were ranked and certain highest scoring compounds are shown in Table 1. The top scoring compound, CHBrNO, is shown in the selected site of AAT in  (right panel).","Research Design and Methods","Database Preparation","The National Cancer Institute\/Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCI\/DTP) maintains a repository of approximately 220,000 samples (the plated compound set) which are non-proprietary and offered to the extramural research community for the discovery and development of new agents for the treatment of cancer, AIDS, or opportunistic infections afflicting patients with cancer or AIDS (Monga and Sausville 2002). The three-dimensional coordinates for the NCI\/DTP plated compound set was obtained in the MDL SD format and converted to the mol2 format by the DOCK utility program SDF2MOL2 (UCSF). Partial atomic charges, solvation energies and van der Waals parameters for the ligands were calculated using SYBDB (Tripos, Inc.) and added to the plated compound set mol2 file.","Molecular Docking","All docking calculations were performed with the Oct. 15, 2002, development version of DOCK, v5.1.0 (Charifson et al. 1999; Ewing et al. 2001). The general features of DOCK include rigid orienting of ligands to receptor spheres, AMBER energy scoring, GB\/SA solvation scoring, contact scoring, internal non-bonded energy scoring, ligand flexibility and both rigid and torsional simplex minimization (Gschwend et al.; Good et al. 1995). Unlike previously distributed versions, this release incorporates automated matching, internal energy (used in flexible docking), scoring function hierarchy and new minimizer termination criteria.","The coordinates for the crystal structure of mutant ATZ (see, e.g., Huntington J A, et al., Journal of Molecular Biology 1999; 293:449-55), were used in the molecular docking calculations. The atomic positions of the residues in the P6-P3 region were used for the site selected for molecular docking, with the aim of disrupting polymer formation with small molecules. The site consists of residues 173-184, 327-333 and 352 in the crystal structure of PDB code 1QMB (accessed at http:\/\/www.rcsb.org\/pdb\/explore.do?structureId=1QMB). The PDB file is shown in the attached Appendix A, which is incorporated herein by reference.","To prepare the site for docking, all water molecules were removed. Protonation of receptor residues was performed with Sybyl (Tripos, St. Louis, Mo.). The structure was explored using sets of spheres to describe potential binding pockets. The number of orientations per molecule was 100. Intermolecular AMBER energy scoring (vdw+columbic), contact scoring and bump filtering were implemented in DOCK5.1.0 (Gschwend et al.). SETOR (Evans 1993) and GRASP (Petrey and Honig 2003) were used to generate molecular graphic images.","The approach is generally illustrated in .

The cell culture procedure was used according to an established protocol. Forty-eight hours after the cell attached to the plate, lentivirus containing human telomerase catalytic domain TERT was added to the cells for 12 hours in the presence of polybrene. The cells were continuously cultured in the culture medium. After two months, a cell line was established and referred to as AT01. The cells exhibit epithelial growth pattern. The cells have a doubling time approximately 36 hours. To determine whether the cells have hepatic phenotype, total RNA was extracted from AT01 cells and the control hepatoma cell line, Huh7, for RT-PCR analysis using human albumin-specific primers. The AT01 cells express albumin, though at lower levels compared to the Huh7 cells. The cells produce ATZ, as confirmed by monoclonal anti-ATZ antibody. It is noted that Huh7 cells produces a second band, suggesting different protein modification, such as glycosylation.","The possible explanations for the lower level expression of ATZ in AT01 cells are: firstly, the cell culture may not exhibit fully differentiated hepatic phenotype. The lower level of albumin expression is consistent with this postulate; secondly, signals are required for AAT expression. The potential signals may be derived from cytokines, which are not present in the culture medium; lastly, if ATZ protein is toxic, the adaptive cells would produce lower levels of the protein for growth advantage.","Based on the hypothesis that liver-specific transcription factors would up-regulate \u03b11-AT gene expression, we transfected the AT01 cells with the plasmid pCMVHNF3 containing HNF3\u03b1 gene. Expression of HNF3 slightly upregulated ATZ protein expression. Further experiments with constitutive HNF3 expression may enhance the ATZ expression in these cells.","Hepatoma Cell Line that Stably Expresses ATM or ATZ.","To have a robust cell culture system for AAT study, we transfected a human hepatoma cell line, Huh7, with either wild type AAT (ATM) or mutant AAT (ATZ) expression vector under RSV promoter control. The vector also contains a neomycin resistance gene that permits G418 selection for stable cell lines.","Stable cell lines for both ATM and ATZ were established. There is no overt abnormality in these cell lines. Huh7, Huh-ATM, and Huh-ATZ exhibit similar growth potential. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Polymers were only formed in Huh-ATZ cells. Moreover, we also determined the AAT expression level in the culture medium. Huh-ATM cells express much high levels of AAT in the supernatant, while Huh-ATZ cells only express the endogenous AAT, suggesting that the ATZ is trapped inside the cells as protein polymers.","Compounds listed in Table 1 were obtained from NCI\/DTP. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO. As the first step, the compounds were tested in CHO-ATZ cells. Various concentrations of the compounds were added to the cells. The supernatants were harvested at time points: 24, 48, and 72 hours. The samples were then used for ELISA assay for human AAT. Among the 9 compounds tested, many showed effectiveness to increase the ATZ secretion, and two compounds showed effectiveness to increase the ATZ secretion at the micromolar range.","Because DMSO was used as a solvent, and previous work has indicated that DMSO by itself increases AAT secretion, we tested the effect of DMSO on AAT secretion in our cell system. At the highest possible concentration, DMSO would have slightly increased the secretion of ATZ in CHO cells; however, the effect can be monitored through adequate controls.","Compounds were used to treat CHO-ATZ cells at various concentrations. Cell supernatant was harvested at different time points. ELISA test was performed to determine the level of ATZ in the supernatant. The cells were also harvested for Western blot analysis.","As shown in , two compounds, NSC 21034 (3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrocinnamic acid) and NSC 102789 (1,9-decadiene) appear to be effective for inhibition of ATZ secretion.","We then examined these two potentially effective inhibitors. The cells were treated by the inhibitors, followed by protein extraction and Western blot analysis. Comparing with controls, the cells treated with these inhibitors showed reduced amount of ATZ, as shown in  for 1,9-decadiene, suggesting that the compounds indeed enhanced the secretion of the ATZ.","To further test the two compounds, a pulse-chase experiment, which is more definitive to demonstrate the protein secretion, was performed. As shown in , the two compounds indeed increased the secretion of ATZ in CHO cells. A non-denaturing gel was used to analyze cell extracts from compound-treated CHO ATZ cells. Again, the treated cells exhibited fewer polymers in comparison with controls.","Two test compounds were administered to transgenic mice (four animals per group, including control) carrying a human ATZ transgene to determine whether the compounds are capable of increasing AAT secretion in a transgenic animal model. The animals were treated for two weeks. Serum AAT levels were determined by ELISA assay.  shows that Drug 1 (1,9-decadiene) and Drug 2 (3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrocinnamic acid) can enhance AAT serum level by more than two-fold.","Compounds according to the invention decrease AAT accumulation and reduce inflammation in liver cells compared to control. AAT-Z transgenic mice were treated by i.p. injection of a compound or control for 7 days, followed by collection of liver tissue.  shows that Drug 1 and Drug 2, when administered to animals, decrease AAT accumulation in hepatocytes as demonstrated by periodic acid-Schiff with diastases digestion (PASD) staining. Drug treatment also reduced live tissue inflammation compared to animals treated with a control.","These experiments suggest that interfering with polymer formation enhances ATZ secretion rather than ATZ degradation. In summary, these experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the molecular docking approach for identifying effective and specific ATZ-polymer inhibitors.","References",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0217","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
