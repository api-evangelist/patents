{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/024,040, filed on Jan. 28, 2008, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to telecommunications services. More particularly, the present invention relates to capabilities that enhance substantially the value and usefulness of various messaging paradigms including, inter alia, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), etc.","2. Background of the Invention","As the \u2018wireless revolution\u2019 continues to march forward the importance to a Mobile Subscriber (MS)\u2014for example a user of a Wireless Device (WD) such as a mobile telephone, a BlackBerry, etc. that is serviced by a Wireless Carrier (WC)\u2014of their WD grows substantially.","One consequence of such a growing importance is the resulting ubiquitous nature of WDs\u2014i.e., MSs carry them at almost all times and use them for an ever-increasing range of activities. For example, as reported by the industry group CTIA (see www.ctia.org) as of June 2007 there were in the U.S. approximately 243 million WD users.","Coincident with the rapid growth of WDs has been the desire of WCs, and other entities within a wireless messaging ecosystem, to offer MSs a continuing stream of new and interesting products and services that, possibly inter alia, attract new MSs and retain existing MSs, leverage or exploit the continually increasing features and capabilities of new WDs, incrementally increase the volume of messaging traffic (and the revenue that is associated with same) that flows through a wireless messaging ecosystem, etc.","Under various of the product\/service offerings that were referred to above it would be desirable to be able to reward a MS (with, possibly inter alia, cash, free service offerings, product coupons and\/or discounts, popularity indicators, etc.) for specific MS behaviors including, possibly inter alia, a MS' creation and sending of increasing numbers of certain types of messages. For example:","1) Joe is very popular in his high school and his acquaintances desire to be part of his message groups. His messages are entertaining and informative. In addition to text messages Joe will occasionally include in his messages various types of content (including for example photos taken with his WD's camera, small video clips also taken with his WD, third-party advertisements, pieces of User Generated Content [UGC], etc.). Joe's WC (possibly inter alia) might reward Joe based on possibly inter alia the number of messages that Joe sends to groups, Joe's inclusion of content in his messages, each time a recipient of one of Joe's messages acts upon the content in a message (e.g., visits an indicated Uniform Resource Locator [URL], replies to an indicated Telephone Number [TN] or Short Code [SC], etc.), each time a recipient of one of Joe's messages replies to a message, etc.","2) As word of Joe's messages spreads other MSs will contact Joe and ask to be included in one or more of Joe's groups. Joe's WC (possibly inter alia) might reward Joe based on possibly inter alia the number of MS that Joe adds to his groups, the number of \u2018Welcome to my group!\u2019 messages that Joe may send to new group members (such messages containing, possibly inter alia, content as described above), each time a recipient of one of Joe's messages acts upon the content in a message (as described for example above), each time a recipient of one of Joe's messages replies to a message (as part of possibly inter alia a confirmation, opt-in, etc. process), etc.","3) Tammy is a well-regarded financial advisor who sends numerous market update, analysis, etc. messages during the course of a day. Tammy may include in her messages different pieces of content (including for example market charts and graphs, advertisements from financial and other third-parties, pieces of UGC, etc.). Tammy's WC (possibly inter alia) might reward Tammy based on possibly inter alia the number of messages that Tammy sends to a group, Tammy's inclusion of content in her messages, each time a recipient of one of Tammy's messages acts upon the content in a message (e.g., visits an indicated URL, replies to an indicated TN or SC, etc.), each time a recipient of one of Tammy's messages replies to a message, etc.","4) In connection with a new product or service offering, an upcoming motion picture or television show or musical album, an upcoming conference event, etc. a third-party may provide one or more pieces of content (including possibly inter alia an advertisement, a piece of UGC, etc.). A WC (possibly inter alia) may incent MSs to employ such content by rewarding, for example, a MS when they include such content in their messages; a recipient of a MS' message when they act upon the content in a message (e.g., visit an indicated URL, reply to an indicated TN or SC, etc.); a content provider when their content is selected by and\/or acted upon by a MS; etc.","The specific examples that were described above are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other examples are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","The present invention facilitates aspects of an infrastructure that provides MS rewards and addresses, in new and innovatory ways, various of the (not insubstantial) challenges that are associated with same.","In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method for rewarding MSs that includes possibly inter alia receiving an incoming (SMS, MMS, etc.) message; completing various processing steps including (a) leveraging information previously supplied by a MS, (b) identifying one or more destination addresses, (c) optionally retrieving content, and (d) incrementing one or more reward counters; and generating one or more outgoing (SMS, MMS, etc.) messages where such messages include possibly among other things aspects of the incoming message, the retrieved content (if applicable), etc. and are addressed to the identified destination addresses.","In the embodiment the retrieved content may take the form of an advertisement, UGC, a URL, etc.","Still in accordance with the embodiment, the unit of measure of a reward counter may be money, points, or credits; a MS may be able to monitor the value of a reward counter; and a MS may redeem some portion of a reward counter as a reward where (1) the magnitude of a reward may be based on a combination of one or more of number of messages, message audience, popularity indicators, and content inclusion and (2) a reward may be realized as a combination of one or more of cash, a cash equivalent, a service offering, a coupon, or a discount.","Still in accordance with the embodiment, the value of a reward counter may be incremented in response to a recipient of a (SMS, MMS, etc.) message acting on aspects of the content that was included in the message.","In another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a system for rewarding MSs that includes possibly inter alia a gateway at which an incoming (SMS, MMS, etc.) message may be received and workflow modules that may be configured, etc. to (a) leverage information previously supplied by a MS, (b) identify one or more destination addresses, (c) optionally retrieve content, (d) increment one or more reward counters, and (e) generate one or more outgoing (SMS, MMS, etc.) messages where such messages include possibly among other things aspects of the incoming message, the retrieved content (if applicable), etc. and are addressed to the identified destination addresses.","These and other features of the embodiments of the present invention, along with their attendant advantages, will be more fully appreciated upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the associated drawings.","It should be understood that these figures depict embodiments of the invention. Variations of these embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the teachings contained herein.","The present invention may leverage the capabilities of a centrally-located, full-featured MICV facility. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 7,154,901 entitled \u201cINTERMEDIARY NETWORK SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FACILITATING MESSAGE EXCHANGE BETWEEN WIRELESS NETWORKS,\u201d and its associated continuations, for a description of a MICV, a summary of various of the services\/functions\/etc. that are performed by a MICV, and a discussion of the numerous advantages that arise from same. The disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 7,154,901, along with its associated continuations, is incorporated herein by reference.","As illustrated in  and reference numeral  a MICV  is disposed between, possibly inter alia, multiple WCs (WC, WC\u2192WC) on one side and multiple SPs (SP\u2192SP) on the other side and thus \u2018bridges\u2019 all of the connected entities. A MICV  thus, as one simple example, may offer various routing, formatting, delivery, value-add, etc. capabilities that provide, possibly inter alia:","1) A WC \u2192 (and, by extension, all of the MSs \u2192, \u2192, \u2192 that are serviced by the WC \u2192) with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of SPs \u2192, and","2) A SP \u2192 with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of WCs \u2192 (and, by extension, to all of the MSs \u2192, \u2192, \u2192 that are serviced by the WCs \u2192).","Generally speaking a MICV may have varying degrees of visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to the (MS\u21c4MS, MS\u21c4SP, etc.) messaging traffic:","1) A WC may elect to route just their out-of-network messaging traffic to a MICV. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to just the portion of the WC's messaging traffic that was directed to the MICV by the WC.","2) A WC may elect to route all of their messaging traffic to a MICV. The MICV may, possibly among other things, subsequently return to the WC that portion of the messaging traffic that belongs to (i.e., that is destined for a MS of) the WC. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to all of the WC's messaging traffic.","While the discussion below will include a MICV, it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that other arrangements are equally applicable and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","In the discussion below the present invention is described and illustrated as being offered by a SP. A SP may, for example, be realized through the combination of, possibly inter alia, one or more of a third-party service bureau, an element of a WC, an element of a landline carrier, an element of a MICV, multiple third-party entities working together, etc.","In the discussion below reference is made to messages that are sent, for example, between a MS and a SP. As set forth below, a given \u2018message\u2019 sent between a MS and a SP may actually comprise a series of steps in which the message is received, forwarded and routed between different entities, including possibly inter alia a MS, a WC, a MICV, and a SP. Thus, unless otherwise indicated, it will be understood that reference to a particular message generally includes that particular message as conveyed at any stage between an origination source, such as for example a MS, and an end receiver, such as for example a SP. As such, reference to a particular message generally includes a series of related communications between, for example, a MS and a WC; a WC and a MICV; a MICV and a SP; etc. The series of related communications may, in general, contain substantially the same information, or information may be added or subtracted in different communications that nevertheless may be generally referred to as a same message. To aid in clarity, a particular message, whether undergoing changes or not, is referred to by different reference numbers at different stages between a source and an endpoint of the message.","To better understand the particulars of the present invention consider for a moment a simple hypothetical example. Our hypothetical example includes, possibly inter alia, (1) SP(a SP that offers a service that has been enhanced or augmented as provided through aspects of the instant invention) and (2) numerous MSs including one specific individual MS, Mary.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","206","208","210","212","214","214","216"],"sub":["1 ","a ","1 ","z ","1 ","n ","x "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"MS  WD .

A single, consolidated interface that SP may use to easily reach, inter alia, one or more external entities such as a credit card or debit card clearinghouse, a carrier billing system, a service bureau that provides access to multiple carrier billing systems, etc.","SP  AS . Facilities that provide key elements of the instant invention (which will be described below).","It is important to note that while in  the MS  WD  and MS  PC  entities are illustrated as being adjacent or otherwise near each other, in actual practice the entities may, for example, be physically located anywhere.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as Mary  completes a registration process with SP:","A) Mary  uses one of her PCs  to visit SP's  WS  to, possibly among other things, complete a service registration process (\u2192).","B) SP's  WS  interacts with SP's  AS  to, possibly among other things, commit some or all of the information that Mary  provided to a data repository (e.g., a database), optionally complete a billing transaction, etc. ().","C) As appropriate and as required a BI  completes a billing transaction (\u2192).","D) Following a response () SP's  WS  responds appropriately (e.g., with the presentation of a confirmation message, etc.) (\u2192).","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention. For example, the collected information may be reviewed, confirmed, etc. through one or more manual and\/or automatic mechanisms. For example, the registration process may be completed through any combination of one or more channels including, inter alia, the WWW (via, for example, a Web site that is operated by SP), wireless messaging (SMS, MMS, etc.), Electronic Mail (E-Mail) messages, Instant Messaging (IM), conventional mail, telephone, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) facility, etc.","During the registration process described above a range of information may be captured from a MS including, inter alia:","A) Identifying Information. For example, possibly among other things, name, address, age, sex, a unique identifier and a password, WD TN, content preferences, etc.","B) Group Information. For example, possibly among other things, the contact information (such as for example WD TNs, E-Mail addresses, IM names\/identifiers, etc.) for each of the members of one or more groups (e.g., \u2018Family,\u2019 \u2018Friends,\u2019 \u2018Work,\u2019 etc.) that a MS may wish to define.","C) Billing Information. Different service billing models may be offered including, inter alia, a fixed one-time charge, a recurring (monthly, etc.) fixed charge, a recurring (monthly, etc.) variable charge, a per-event charge, etc. Different payment mechanisms may be supported including, possibly among other things, credit or debit card information, authorization to place a charge on a MS's phone bill, authorization to deduct funds from a MS' (bank, brokerage, etc.) account, etc.","The specific pieces of information that were described above are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other pieces of information (e.g., additional Identifying Information, WD feature or function details, scheduled daily\/weekly\/etc. reporting desired and\/or on-demand reporting desired, etc.) are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","As noted above the information that Mary provided during the registration process may be preserved in a data repository (e.g., a database) and may optionally be organized as a MS profile.","The content of Mary's profile may be augmented by SPto include, as just a few examples of the many possibilities, internal and\/or external demographic, psychographic, sociological, etc. data.","As noted above, a SP's BI may optionally complete a billing transaction. The billing transaction may take any number of forms and may involve different external entities (e.g., a WC's billing system, a carrier billing system service bureau, a credit or debit card clearinghouse, a financial institution, etc.). The billing transaction may include, possibly inter alia:","1) The appearance of a line item charge on the bill or statement that a MS receives from her WC. Exemplary mechanics and logistics associated with this approach are described in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/837,695 entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BILLING AUGMENTATION.\u201d Other ways of completing or performing line item billing are easily implemented by those skilled in the art.","2) The charging of a credit card or the debiting of a debit card.","3) The (electronic, etc.) transfer of funds.","4) The generation of an invoice, statement, etc.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as SP optionally coordinates, etc. with one or more external entities (such as, for example, a third-party, etc.) to, possibly among other things, secure access, confirm collected information, arrange to receive updates, etc. (see \u2192).","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges (including, inter alia, updates to various of the information in a MS Profile in a SP's repository, etc.) are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as SP's  AS  dispatches to Mary  one or more confirmation E-Mail messages (\u2192).","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as SP's  AS  dispatches one or more confirmation SMS, MMS, etc. messages to Mary's  WD  (\u2192) and Mary  optionally replies or responds to the message(s) (\u2192). Of interest and note are:","1) In the instant example the messages are shown traversing a MICV .","2) The SP  may employ a SC or a regular TN as its source address (and to which it would ask users of its service to direct any reply messages). While the abbreviated length of a SC (e.g., five digits for a SC administered by Neustar under the Common Short Code [CSC] program) incrementally enhances the experience of a MS  (e.g., the MS  need remember and enter only a few digits as the destination address of a reply message) it also, by definition, constrains the universe of available SCs thereby causing each individual SC to be a limited or scarce resource and raising a number of SC\/CSC management, etc. issues. A description of a common (i.e., universal) short code environment may be found in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/742,764 entitled \u201cUNIVERSAL SHORT CODE ADMINISTRATION FACILITY.\u201d","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","The Set , Set , Set , and Set  exchanges that were described above are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.

The criteria, conditions, etc. that may be associated with a reward may include, possibly inter alia:","1) Number of messages. For example, the more messages that Mary creates and sends (thus incrementally increasing the volume of messaging traffic that among others Mary's WC enjoys) the more reward points, credits, etc. Mary may accumulate.","2) Message audience. For example, the more messages that Mary sends to a group of recipients (as opposed to just a single recipient) the more reward points, credits, etc. Mary may accumulate.","3) Popularity indicators. For example, if Mary composes interesting, popular, etc. messages then those messages may yield incrementally more replies, responses, etc. and consequently may drive upwards possibly inter alia Mary's popularity indicator (yielding possibly inter alia more reward points, credits, etc.).","4) Message Content. For example, if Mary includes in her messages one or more pieces of content (such as possibly inter alia an advertisement, a piece of UGC, etc.) the more reward points, credits, etc. Mary may accumulate (as well as, possibly inter alia, the more hits, impressions, etc. that may be recorded for the selected pieces of content).","The factors that were described above are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other factors are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","This portion of our hypothetical example may be examined through  and reference numeral .
