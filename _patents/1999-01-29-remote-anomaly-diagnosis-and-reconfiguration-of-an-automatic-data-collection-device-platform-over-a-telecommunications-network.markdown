title: Remote anomaly diagnosis and reconfiguration of an automatic data collection device platform over a telecommunications network
abstract: The invention provides a system and method for remotely diagnosing and repairing a plurality of Automatic Data Collection (“ADC”) device platforms. A remote service technician utilizes a computing system having browsing software that communicates with a network of ADC platform devices. Diagnostic queries for particular ADC devices may be retrieved by the browsing software from a diagnostic server that sends Hypertext Mark-Up Language (“HTML”) documents, Dynamic Hypertext Mark-Up Language (“DHTML”) documents, and/or Extensible Mark-Up Language (“XML”) documents containing appropriate diagnostic applets. The remote technician sends diagnostic queries to a Simple Network Management Protocol (“SNMP”) master agent at the ADC device platform, and a translator translates the diagnostic queries sent to the ADC device platform into a format suitable for reception by its ADC devices in order to effect anomaly diagnosis and functionality restoration. Another translator translates data received from the ADC device into the SNMP format for transmission to the remote service technician in order for the remote service technician to perform diagnostic analysis. The SNMP master agent communicates with the remote computing system using the Transmission Control Protocol (“TCP”), the User Datagram Protocol/Internet Protocol (“UDP/IP”), and/or the User Datagram Plus Protocol (“UDP+”). The ADC platform device may also utilize a wireless communication system for communicating with the remote service technician.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally to Automatic Data Collection (\u201cADC\u201d) devices and more particularly to anomaly diagnosis and functionality restoration of ADC device platforms.","Automatic Data Collection (\u201cADC\u201d) device platforms, such as ADC device platforms equipped with bar code readers, have received increasing commercial attention in the past few years. ADC device platforms, such as hand-held data collection terminals, or hand-held personal computers, have been widely implemented in the retail marketplace and have garnered increasing utilization in a diverse range of application areas. The ever-decreasing cost and size of ADC device platforms has facilitated their entry into a wide variety of commercial, institutional, and governmental settings.","An ADC device platform having a bar code reader adeptly accesses and retrieves data stored in the form of a bar code label. Data representing virtually any product or service found in the marketplace may be encoded in a bar code label for later access by an ADC device platform having a bar code reader. For these reasons, ADC device platforms are now actively used for planning, controlling, producing, and analyzing most aspects of commerce. Bar code readers include laser scanners as well as other means of collecting product information, such as a bar code wand, still camera or area imager. In addition to bar code labels, other ADC data formats include Radio Frequency (\u201cRF\u201d) tags, magnetic strips, Optical Character Recognition (\u201cOCR\u201d), speech input, and any symbol having encoded data therein.","In a conventional ADC device platform environment, the recipient of ADC data either physically manipulates the ADC device platform itself to retrieve the ADC data or receives the ADC data through a local, and probably proprietary, network. Thus, a typical ADC device operator is limited both in terms of the distance from which the operator may be located away from the actual device and by the complexity and versatility of the elements that comprise the ADC device network which the operator utilizes. The operator suffers from still further limitations due to the fact that many conventional ADC device platforms are not readily configurable for new ADC devices, or even for ADC devices other than those attached to the ADC device platform when it is initially sold. Yet another limitation in a conventional ADC device platform arises when an operator wishes to add a new ADC device to one of the few ADC device platforms that will accept new ADC devices. This limitation stems from the fact that many ADC devices operate using proprietary communications protocols, and even when the communications protocols are non-proprietary, the communications protocols are typically non-standard. Thus, the operator cannot simply attach a new ADC device to an existing ADC device platform and expect that the new combination will function properly. The operator typically must either return the device to the manufacturer for re-fitting with the new ADC device or request that a service technician of the new ADC device's manufacturer visit the operator's location and perform the installation on site. Finally, the above limitations, both separately and together, hinder an ADC operator's ability to diagnose and make repairs to an ADC device platform.","ADC device platforms are primarily intended for technically unsophisticated operators. The typical ADC device operator has neither adequate training nor a rudimentary understanding of the basic principles upon which the ADC device platform operates. Consequently, when a typical ADC device operator encounters an anomaly or apparent anomaly with regard to the ADC device platform, the typical ADC device operator cannot diagnose the anomaly and make any required adjustments to the ADC device platform to restore its functionality. Some apparent ADC device platform anomalies result from the typical ADC device operator's unsophistication. Some manufacturers have found that fully half of the ADC device platforms returned to them as defective, in fact, contain no defects at all. ADC device platform manufacturers are understandably eager to reduce the number of ADC device platforms returned to them as inoperable and the number of on-site service calls, especially when the ADC device platforms are in proper working condition.","Aspects of the invention provides a method and system for remotely diagnosing and reconfiguring a plurality of networked Automatic Data Collection (\u201cADC\u201d) device platforms. Each ADC device platform in the plurality of networked ADC device platforms contains a communications device that connects to a communications network that allows remote access by a service technician. The service technician sends diagnostic queries to the ADC device platform over the communications network. Diagnostic queries passing over the communications network to the ADC device platform may arrive in a communications format different from the format required by the various subsystems connected to the ADC device platform, such as the ADC devices.","Aspects of the invention provide a method and system for retrieving diagnostic and analytical tools for restoring a plurality of ADC devices to proper working condition. A service technician utilizes a web browser in a remote computing system to access a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (\u201cHTTP\u201d) server and retrieve from the HTTP server Hypertext Mark-Up Language (\u201cHTML\u201d) documents, Dynamic Hypertext Mark-Up Language (\u201cDHTML\u201d) documents, Extensible Mark-Up Language (\u201cXML\u201d) documents, and\/or documents in other data formats over the World Wide Web, according to one embodiment of the invention. The service technician's remote computing system uses small diagnostic programs, or applets, contained in the HTML documents, DHTML documents, and\/or XML documents to perform diagnostic queries on ADC device platforms, diagnose anomalies, and reconfigure malfunctioning subsystems on the ADC device platform. In each ADC device platform of the plurality of the ADC device platforms, a Simple Network Management Protocol (\u201cSNMP\u201d) master agent communicates with the service technician's remote computing system. An SNMP subagent translates a diagnostic query forwarded by the SNMP master agent into a format suitable for reception by the subsystem to which the query was directed. The SNMP subagent translates data received from the queried subsystem into the proper format for transmission to the SNMP master agent which forwards the data to the remote computing system. Once the data arrives at the remote computing system, it may be analyzed by the service technician.","Aspects of the invention include an anomaly reporting system on an ADC device platform. The anomaly reporting system may include a subsystem for generating anomaly reporting electronic mail messages (\u201ce-mails\u201d) that may be composed by a device operator and sent to the remote service technician. The ADC device platform may also include an anomaly reporting beacon that automatically sends a predetermined anomaly reporting e-mail to a remote service technician when activated. The anomaly reporting beacon may be activated automatically by the device operator or by the ADC device platform itself.","Aspects of the invention also provide a method and system for effecting repair of defective ADC device platforms by providing repair instructions through a communications medium, such as the World Wide Web, to the device operator. A remote service technician may either reconfigure an ADC device platform and\/or instruct a device operator in how to make physical adjustments to the ADC device platform. The remote service technician may provide the device operator with instructions in mediums such as figures, text, flowcharts, and\/or video clips for repair of the ADC device platform.","Aspects of the invention also provide a method and system for both uploading and downloading new versions of software for subsystems of the ADC device platform. The downloaded or uploaded software includes software upgrades provided by the ADC device platform manufacturer and software upgrades provided by the manufacturer of an ADC device subsystem, such as an ADC reader.","The invention provides a method and system for remotely diagnosing and reconfiguring a plurality of networked Automatic Data Collection (\u201cADC\u201d) device platforms. Each ADC device platform in the plurality of networked ADC device platforms contains a network communications device. The network communications device connects to a communications network that may be remotely accessed by a service technician. The remote service technician sends commands for controlling the ADC device platform over the communications network, such as the World Wide Web, through the network communications device to the ADC device platform. Commands passing over the communications network may arrive at the ADC device platform in a communications format different from the format required by the ADC devices connected to the ADC device platform. Various subsystems on the ADC device platform translate information within the ADC device platform into appropriate communication formats.","A remote service technician may utilize a web browser on a remote computing system and retrieve status information from an ADC device platform over a communications network, such as the World Wide Web. The remote service technician uses the status information retrieved from the ADC device platform to diagnose anomalies and reconfigure the ADC device platform. In each ADC device platform of the plurality of the ADC device platforms, a Simple Network Management Protocol (\u201cSNMP\u201d) master agent communicates with the remote computing system. An SNMP subagent translates SNMP-formatted information sent from the SNMP master agent to an appropriate ADC element in a format suitable for reception by the ADC element. The SNMP subagent translates data received from the ADC element into the SNMP format for transmission to the remote computing system where it may be analyzed by the remote service technician.","The ADC device platforms may also include an anomaly reporting system, according to embodiments of the invention. The anomaly reporting system may include a subsystem for generating diagnostic and repair electronic mail messages (\u201ce-mails\u201d) that may be composed by a device operator and sent to the remote service technician. The ADC device platform may also include an anomaly reporting beacon that automatically sends an e-mail message to a remote service technician to report an anomaly in the ADC device platform.","Embodiments of the invention also provide a system for effecting repair of defective ADC device platforms by providing instructions through a communications medium to the device operator. A remote service technician may either reconfigure an ADC device platform and\/or instruct a device operator regarding how to perform physical adjustments to the ADC device platform. The remote service technician may provide the device operator with diagrams, text, and\/or video clips for repair of the ADC device platform. Embodiments of the invention also provide a simplified mechanism for both uploading and downloading new versions of software for driving subsystems of the ADC device platform. These new software modules may be provided by the ADC device platform manufacturer or by the manufacturer of an ADC device subsystem such as an ADC reader.","The invention is particularly applicable to instrumented ADC device platforms, including hand-held ADC devices, but is also applicable to other computing systems as well. An exemplary ADC device platform suitable for use with the invention is described in \u201cAutomatic Data Collection Device Having a Network Communications Capability,\u201d U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/084,272, filed on May 4, 1998, and assigned to a common assignee. In this embodiment of the ADC device platform, an SNMP master agent communicates with the service technician's remote computing system using the Transmission Control Protocol (\u201cTCP\u201d), the User Datagram Protocol\/Internet Protocol (\u201cUDP\/IP\u201d), or the User Datagram Plus Protocol (\u201cUDP+\u201d). While the SNMP protocol specifies that it uses UDP, a variant of the SNMP protocol may be used with TCP. The User Datagram Plus Protocol (\u201cUDP+\u201d) is further described in U.S. application Ser. No. 08\/852,002, entitled, \u201cReliable Communication over an Unreliable Transport Layer in a Hand-Held Device using User-Configurable Timers,\u201d filed on May 6, 1997 and assigned to a common assignee. The User Datagram Plus Protocol (\u201cUDP+\u201d) is also described in U.S. application Ser. No. 08\/851,848, \u201cProviding Reliable Communication over an Unreliable Transport Layer in a Hand-Held Device using a Persistent Session,\u201d filed on May 6, 1997 and assigned to a common assignee. The ADC platform device may also utilize a wireless communications system for all or a portion of its communications with the remote computing system.","The ADC device platform may employ a system management architecture that uses Internet technology to deliver system management functions to a remote service technician and uses SNMP for communication with ADC device platforms. The ADC device platform network is scaleable from a minimal system having a few ADC device platforms to a large system with hundreds of ADC device platforms connected in a network. The minimal system requires only a low-cost personal computer (\u201cPC\u201d) based web browser, while the larger system may utilize an existing SNMP infrastructure having a mixture of ADC devices.","According to one embodiment of the invention, the remote service technician's web browser uses Java applets as the user interface and SNMP to communicate with ADC device platforms. Java is an object-oriented programming language similar to C++. Java was designed to be secure and platform neutral, meaning that Java code may run on any computing platform. Java is a useful language for programming applications for the World Wide Web since users access the web from many different types of computers. Java is especially well adapted for use in programming small applications, or applets, for use in the World Wide Web. A Java applet may be loaded and run by an already running Java application, such as a web browser. Java applets may be downloaded and run by any web browser capable of interpreting Java, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, and Hot Java.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00033","num":"00033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","100","110","111","112","120","121","122","100","104","103","101","102","100","101","102","100"]},"Using the ADC console , a remote operator sends commands to the ADC devices  and  through a communication link . Communications from the remote computing system  arrive at the ADC devices  and  via the computer system  on the ADC platform . In a similar manner, data collected by the ADC devices  and  may be transferred to the remote computing system  via the computing system .","The remote computing system  also communicates with the network controller  through a communication link . This connection allows the remote computing system  to communicate with both the network controller  and the ADC device platform . The network controller  may communicate directly with the ADC device platform  through a communication link . Using the communication link , the network controller  may alter device parameters and settings on the ADC platform , as described below.","Using the architecture shown in , a service technician at the remote computing system  may analyze the operating characteristics of ADC device platform  subsystems such as the ADC devices  or , both individually and jointly. This system architecture also allows the remote service technician to diagnose anomalies and to reconfigure the ADC platform  and any configurable subsystems on the ADC platform .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00037","num":"00037"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","100","100","100","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00038","num":"00038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["210","220","211","212","210","220","211","212","101","102","211","212","220","101","102","220","220"]},"The SNMP master agent  communicates with the remote service technician using SNMP. SNMP is the network management protocol of the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (\u201cTCP\/IP\u201d). Using SNMP, agents, such as the SNMP master agent , monitor the activity in various devices on the network and may report the activity to a network console such as one maintained by the remote service technician.","A Management Information Base (\u201cMIB\u201d) describes or provides management information for SNMP devices. The MIB describes a set of objects to SNMP devices and provides information about each object, including its structure, its relationship to other objects, and the operations allowed on the object. The MIB essentially tells SNMP what pieces of information it can modify or view on the ADC device platform . Configuration, control, and statistics data particular to the ADC device platform  are described in the ADC device platform MIB. In addition to supporting the ADC device platform MIB, a MIB  on ADC device platform  also supports MIBs for: a MIB-II (\u201cRFC 1213\u201d), an Intermec Reader MIB, an Intermec UDP+ MIB, a Proxim Open Air Radio MIB, a Scorpion 900 MHz Radio MIB, and a 802.11 MIB (\u201cIEEE P802.11\u201d), and other protocols, especially RF readable tag protocols.","For example, control information about each ADC device ,  is maintained in the MIB . The SNMP master agent  controls SNMP subagents  and . These two SNMP subagents  and  respectively interface with the ADC devices  and . The ADC devices  and  may each operate under a different communications protocol or system. As described above, the ADC device platform  may be equipped with a wide variety of ADC device types, such as bar code readers and RF tag readers. Each of these exemplary ADC devices may operate under different protocols, and the MIB  includes information related to these protocols, according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The SNMP subagents  and  translate between the communications protocol of ADC devices  and  and the standardized SNMP protocol using information from the MIB . Adding a new ADC device to the ADC device platform  requires only adding a new SNMP subagent and storing relevant information in the MIB , regardless of the new ADC device's communication protocol.","A manager (\u201cclient\u201d) accesses information in the MIB  using three operations: Get, Get-Next, and Set. \u201cGet\u201d allows a manager to retrieve the value of an object. \u201cGet-Next\u201d allows a manager to retrieve the value of the next object instance in a data store without necessarily knowing the name of the object. \u201cSet\u201d allows a manager to change the value of one or more object.","Both remotely operated SNMP management applets and locally operated SNMP applications use management interfaces that provide a mechanism for performing SNMP \u201cGet\u201d and \u201cSet\u201d operations for retrieving and modifying information in a network node, such as the ADC device platform . SNMP \u201cSet\u201d requests change one or more values of a MIB object in the MIB . If an invalid value is given, an error is returned and none of the changes take effect. Changes may otherwise take effect immediately or after the ADC device platform  is reinitialized, depending on the variable. The \u201cSet\u201d request returns \u201csuccess\u201d only when all the changes have been applied successfully. SNMP \u201cGet\u201d request retrieves one or more MIB item values. The SNMP \u201cGet-Next\u201d request retrieves one or more MIB object values in the MIB . Upon receipt of a \u201cGet-Next\u201d request, the SNMP master agent  retrieves the next MIB entry based on the object identifier provided for each OID in the received list. If the \u201cGet\u201d or \u201cGet-Next\u201d requests provide an invalid OID or community name, an error is returned. The \u201cSet,\u201d \u201cGet,\u201d and \u201cGet-Next\u201d requests may receive input from the remote computing system  and format an SNMP packet to be delivered to the ADC device platform SNMP master agent .","SNMP also provides traps, or unacknowledged messages, sent asynchronously from the SNMP master agent  and the SNMP subagents ,  to the SNMP management support unit  to notify the SNMP management support unit  of an exception condition. SNMP traps allow the SNMP management support unit  to discover anomalous situations whose resolution may ultimately require intervention by a remote service technician or the device operator. SNMP primarily uses polling to gather information about a network node, such as the ADC platform , which produces traps that alert the management support unit  that additional polling is necessary. Since traps are unacknowledged, they cannot be used to replace SNMP polling.","SNMP may also provide the network protocol and utilize a UDP transport within an IP communications stack. UDP may also be bundled with TCP in the communications stack, while in other embodiments UDP is not bundled with TCP in the communications stack. Since the ADC device platform  uses SNMP, the ADC device platform  may be managed anywhere on a SNMP-enabled network via a SNMP management station such as HP Openview or IBM's NetView. This embodiment also provides a Java web browser interface that allows a remote service technician to reconfigure one or more ADC device platforms  from anywhere on the network. The embodiment further provides Java applets that perform system reconfiguration tasks for the ADC device platforms  in the network. This applet may include a graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) that operates from both the network controller  and from a web browser on the remote computing system .","A remote service technician may perform file transfer, view device performance statistics, perform device reconfiguration, and provide firmware upgrades via the World Wide Web or another communications network. The remote service technician may view a map of all ADC device platforms  on the network and their current status if granted appropriate access privileges by the network controller . Java applets send SNMP requests to a selected ADC device platform  to retrieve device data. The Java applets may include a security authentication module that varies from user-to-user based on a security profile. Depending on their individual security profiles, different remote service technicians may have different capabilities. For example, an ADC device platform manufacturer's representative may have greater privileges than a service technician for a particular ADC device on the ADC device platform.","For ADC device platforms  without a TCP\/IP stack loaded (e.g., a platform using the 900 MHz protocol), the remote network controller  serves as an SNMP proxy. A proxy is a software construct that relays data between applications. The remote network controller  receives the SNMP commands and sends them to the ADC device platform  using the 900 MHz protocol and an appropriate reader command language.","The SNMP system management support unit  also provides support for the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (\u201cTFTP\u201d), application installation, and FLASH memory upgrades. Thus, using the system management support unit , a remote service technician could add a new SNMP subagent to the computing system  or perform an update on an existing SNMP subagent, such as the SNMP subagent . The system management support unit  communicates with the remote computing system  using sockets, TCP, UDP, and UDP+. Sockets provide an identifier for a particular service on a particular node of a network. The socket consists of a node address and a port number that identifies the service. TCP governs the break up of data messages into packets to be sent via the Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) and the reassembly and verification of the complete messages from packets received. UDP is a connectionless protocol parallel to TCP in the IP communication stack. UDP converts data messages generated by an application into packets to be sent via IP but does not verify that the messages have been delivered correctly. Therefore, UDP is more efficient than TCP, although the reliability of UDP depends on the application generating the message. UDP+ provides additional functionality that is not provided by UDP, such as guaranteed packet delivery and packet ordering.","The system management unit  also provides upgrades to unit management HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML pages . The unit management HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML pages  may be accessed by an ADC platform HTTP server . HTML, or the Hypertext Markup Language, is a client\/server protocol that provides documents for use on the World Wide Web. HTML uses tags to mark elements, such as text and graphics, in a document to indicate how web browsers should display the elements to the user and to indicate how the web browser should respond to user actions, such as an activation of a link by means of a key press or mouse click. The unit management HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML pages  also contain Java applets for controlling different elements within the ADC platform device . DHTML provides the same capabilities as HTML but adds a capability for a Dynamic User Interface without requiring the web browser to query the HTTP server computer. XML provides a data standard that can encode the content, semantics, and schemata for a gamut of cases, from simple to complex. XML can encode the representation for an ordinary document; a structured record, such as an appointment record or purchase order; an object, with its data and methods such as the persistent form of a Java object or an ActiveX\u2122 control; a data record, such as the result set of a query; metacontent about a World Wide Web site, such as Channel Definition Format (\u201cCDF\u201d) information; graphical presentations such as an application's user interface, and standard schema entities and types. In essence, XML may be used for encoding all the links between information and people, such as remote service technicians, on the World Wide Web.","Using the unit management HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML pages , the ADC platform HTTP server  provides information and applets, or small application programs, to the remote computing system , allowing a remote service technician to control the ADC device platform  and to receive data from an ADC device, such as the ADC device . The HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML pages  located on the ADC platform device  reference unit management Java applets. Referencing a Java applet in an HTML page provides the mechanism for addressing that applet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00051","num":"00051"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["112","110","112","310","311","310","120","112","320","220","100","320","120","112","100"]},"A service technician using the remote computing system  may need to utilize information from the network system manager . For example, if the remote service technician is a service technician from a value-added reseller (\u201cVAR\u201d), the remote service technician may not have access to all of the necessary ADC device platform system management information. In other instances, the remote service technician may be aware that the customer has modified the system management information in a manner different from that provided by the manufacturer. Thus, even a service technician from the ADC device platform manufacturer might need to retrieve information from the network system manager  before performing diagnostic analysis on the ADC device platform .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00053","num":"00053"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["122","120","100","120","122","410","420","430","410","122","410","410","311","420","320"]},"The system management Java applets  enable remote diagnostic examination and reconfiguration on the ADC device platform . The unit management Java applets  may communicate with the Java system management application , the system management support unit , the SNMP master agent  and other elements of the ADC device platform . The unit management Java applets  are unit specific in scope and enable remote diagnostic evaluation and reconfiguration. Various system management Java applets  and unit management Java applets  may be loaded into the remote computing system  from the network HTTP server  and the ADC platform HTTP server , respectively. Unit management Java applets may also be loaded into the remote computing system  from a diagnostic server, such as that shown in FIG. .","For example, a system management Java applet  communicating through Java RMI to the Java system management application  may display the summary status of many ADC device platforms  to the remote service technician. The Java system management application  uses SNMP to collect summary information that is sent to the system management Java applet  for display. When the remote service technician needs to perform diagnostic analysis on an individual ADC device platform , the remote service technician may retrieve a diagnostic applet from the ADC device platform's HTTP server . The ADC device platform's HTTP server  sends a unit management Java applet  to the browser  in the form of a unit management HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML page . The remote computing system may also receive the unit management Java applet  from a diagnostic server, such as the diagnostic server shown in FIG. . The unit management Java applet  communicates to an ADC device platform SNMP master agent  to perform system management functions, such as diagnostic analysis and device reconfiguration. The ADC device platform's SNMP master agent  uses system management support utilities to perform diagnostic analysis on a specified subsystem. The system management support utilities communicate to the unit management Java applet  through a socket layer, TCP\/IP, and UDP\/IP.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00056","num":"00056"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["220","512","211","101","212","102","211","212","101","102","510","512","511"]},"New SNMP subagents and upgrades to existing SNMP subagents sent from the remote service technician arrive through the SNMP system management support unit . The SNMP system management support unit  provides a DLL or COM interface for the SNMP subagents . A DLL, or Dynamic-Link Library interface, and a COM, or Component Object Model interface, both allow executable routines to be stored separately as files having DLL extensions that are loaded only when needed by a program, such as by a SNMP subagent. A DLL\/COM routine consumes no memory until it is used. Because a DLL\/COM routine is a separate file, a programmer may make connections or improvements to the routine without effecting the operation of the calling program or any other DLL\/COM routine. In addition, a programmer may use the same DLL\/COM routine with other programs. The ADC device platform  may include DLL\/COM objects for the various ADC symbologies, such as RF tag symbologies and bar code symbologies, that may be recognized by the ADC device readers  and . As described above, the ADC device platform  may be equipped with a wide variety of ADC device types.","The SNMP master agent  resides on the ADC device platform  and routes all SNMP requests to SNMP subagents . This architecture provides flexibility to the ADC device platform  by allowing the remote service technician to reconfigure or add new SNMP subagents  without effecting the other SNMP subagents or the MIBs in the MIB . The SNMP subagents  extend the standard SNMP MIB and handle SNMP requests for a list of OIDs representing a particular functional area. SNMP uses an OID, or object identifier, to address specific \u201cSet\u201d and \u201cGet\u201d functions. An SNMP reader subagent, such as the SNMP subagent , configures and monitors reader functions, such as the ADC device . A system management SNMP subagent performs firmware upgrades, diagnostic data transfers and installation of reconfigured subagents.","The system management support unit  communicates with a SNMP management station  using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (\u201cTFTP\u201d). TFTP provides a minimal implementation of the File Transfer Protocol (\u201cFTP\u201d). Both FTP and TFTP are well-known protocols for copying files between hosts. The system management station  implements SNMP or other protocols to interface with the communications device . The system management station  runs an SNMP management package such as HP Open View.","The SNMP subagents  also communicate through a UDP+\/TMF protocol communications block  and through a UDP+\/MIB interface . The communications block  then uses the UDP+\/TMF protocol to communicate with the SNMP management station . The Terminal Message Format protocol (\u201cTMF\u201d) may function alternatively with the UDP+ protocol. TMF is a protocol layered on top of UDP+ for 2.4 GHz systems and on top of 900 MHz drivers for 900 MHz systems. The ADC device platform  includes device drivers that interface with the 900 MHz radio frequency drivers and TMF. TMF routes commands and data to the appropriate service or application and performs system management in 900 MHz systems and in legacy UDP+ systems. An SNMP subagent configures and monitors UDP+. The TCP, UDP\/IP, and UDP+ communication stacks  and  are communication protocol stacks managed through the SNMP architecture. The protocol stacks also provide a MIB-II interface, an extension to the standard MIB.","The SNMP management support unit  communicates with a Reader Command\/SNMP gateway . The Reader Command\/SNMP gateway  routes ADC commands from the SNMP management support unit , allowing SNMP elements to be used for 900 MHz, UDP+, and bar code systems, as well as UDP\/IP networks. The Reader Command\/SNMP gateway  controls parsing\/formatting and routing reader commands. The Reader Command SNMP gateway  controls ADC devices, such as the ADC device , by sending commands for operations, such as turning laser scans on and off, changing reader configuration, and performing system management operations like backup and restore. Reader commands may be received from bar code devices, 900 MHz devices, and local or remote clients. The Reader Command\/SNMP gateway  parses these commands, translates them to an OID and routes them through the SNMP management support unit . The SNMP management support unit  then dispatches these requests to the appropriate SNMP subagents for processing. If a client requests configuration data in reader command format, then the Reader Command\/SNMP gateway  packages the configuration data for the reader command format. This architecture intentionally isolates all legacy reader command processing in a single place, simplifying maintenance of the ADC device platform .","Using the Reader Command\/SNMP gateway , the SNMP management support unit  may transfer legacy system management commands through the Reader Command\/SNMP command gateway  to a unit management application . The unit management application  receives legacy reader command application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d). The SNMP management support unit  provides an SNMP interface to the Reader Command\/SNMP gateway , which in turn provides a DLL interface to the unit management application . The Reader Command\/SNMP gateway  may also communicate through the UDP+\/TMF communication block  to reach the SNMP management station .","The ADC data server  provides device handlers for configuring ADC devices, such as the ADC devices  and . The ADC data server  may communicate with the Reader Command\/SNMP gateway  to provide reader commands for the ADC devices. The ADC data server  provides reader command processing and configuration management. The ADC data server  notifies reader devices, such as reader devices  and , when their configuration has changed to support on-the-fly configuration changes. The ADC data server  supports an SNMP ADC group MIB in cooperation with the ADC devices, such as the ADC devices  and . A Reader Group MIB provides ADC device configuration, reporting ADC device statistics and running end device diagnostics. MIB subgroups support the Reader Group MIB for each end device and for the ADC data server itself.","As previously discussed, the HTTP server  runs on the ADC device platform  and may serve up the system management Java applets to the remote HTML browser . The HTTP server  may read HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML pages from the HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML page unit . These HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML pages serve up the Java applets that the HTTP server  then transfers through the SNMP management station  to the remote browser .","A unit management applet  provides the user interface for the ADC device platform . The unit management applet  uses Java or a Win32 CPL applet as its user interface. The unit management applet  uses Win 32 CPL for local execution only and may use Java for both local and remote execution. Win32 is the application programming interface in Windows 95 and Windows NT that enables applications to use the 32-bit instructions available on 8386 and higher processors. The Win32 CPL applet is an applet for the control panel folder.","The unit management applet  communicates with the HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML pages  and may provide new HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML pages or updates to HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML pages or new Java applets for the HTML, DHTML, and\/or XML pages . The unit management applet  communicates to the SNMP master agent  using an SNMP interface. The SNMP master agent  may transfer system management commands to the unit management applet . A unit management Java applet  and unit management application  provide the user interface for local and remote access. When accessed remotely, this applet is served up through the HTTP protocol in the manner previously discussed. When it is accessed locally, this applet operates as an application.","The SNMP management support unit  may also communicate with the unit management application  through a SNMP interface . The SNMP management support unit  may transfer system management commands to the unit management application . The SNMP management support unit  communicates with the SNMP management station  using the SNMP protocol.","As previously discussed, the unit management applet  provides local access to the system management functions of the ADC device platform . Thus, backup\/restore, firmware upgrade, application installation and other functions may be provided using the same unit management Java applets used for remote access by the remote computing system . For UDP+ and for legacy system management applications, the terminal management format (\u201cTMF\u201d) protocol and the Reader Command\/SNMP gateway  route configuration and system management requests to the SNMP master agent .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00069","num":"00069"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["100","100","120","601","100","601","120","100","601","100","100","100","120","601","100","601"]},"Unit management Java applets  may be loaded into the remote computing system  from a diagnostic server . The diagnostic server  may send a unit management Java applet  to the browser  in the form of a unit management HTML document, DHTML document, and\/or XML document. The unit management Java applet  communicates with the SNMP master agent  to perform diagnostic analysis. The ADC device platform SNMP master agent  uses the system management support unit  to perform diagnostic analysis on a specified subsystem. The system management support utilities communicate to the unit management Java applet  through a socket layer, TCP\/IP, and UDP\/IP. Unit management Java applets  for diagnostic purposes may also be served up by the ADC platform HTTP server  in the manner previously discussed.","Once the remote service technician  has determined which elements of the ADC device platform  appear to be malfunctioning, then the remote service technician  determines whether repairs may be made over the communications network, e.g., rebooting a system element or reinstalling a MIB or SNMP subagent for a malfunctioning element. The remote service technician  may also determine that the anomaly requires the return of the ADC device platform  to the manufacturer or that a service call should be performed by a trained technician. The remote service technician  may also conclude that repair to the ADC device platform  could be accomplished by a physical adjustment within the technical ability of the on-site device operator, e.g., a simple mechanical adjustment. In some instances the simple mechanical adjustment may be conducted in conjunction with a restoration operation performed by the remote service technician  over the telecommunications network, e.g., reconfiguring a particular MIB.","The ADC device platform  may include a test kit containing one or more test images  appropriate for a particular ADC device, such as the ADC device . Should the device operator experience difficulty using the ADC device , for example, the remote service technician  may instruct the device operator to position the test image  so that the service technician  may remotely scan or image the test image . The service technician  may direct raw device data to be returned directly to the remote computer  without any processing on the ADC device platform . A successful scan or image of the test image  may indicate to the remote service technician  that either the anomaly has been corrected or that an alternative diagnosis is appropriate, e.g., the device operator has not enabled a particular bar code symbology on the ADC device  on the ADC device platform . The remote service technician  may also use data from the scanning or imaging of the test image  to diagnose specific anomalies. For example, since the remote service technician  knows the correct data associated with the test image , then the remote service technician may diagnose anomalies by comparing the data retrieved by the ADC device  in scanning or imaging the test image  against the test image . The remote service technician  knows what the test image  looks like because the test image  has been provided by the manufacturer, for example.","Using the system shown in , the remote service technician  may correct all anomalies except for those requiring major physical modifications to the ADC device platform . As noted above, with the cooperation of the device operator, minor physical modifications the ADC device platform  may be corrected without having to return the ADC device platform  to its manufacturer.","In order for the remote service technician  to initiate a diagnostic analysis, the remote service technician  must first be alerted to an anomaly in a specific ADC device platform . The remote service technician  may be alerted to an anomaly condition in the ADC device platform  through any form of communications media. For example, the remote service technician  may receive an electronic mail message (\u201ce-mail\u201d), either from the device operator or from the ADC device platform  itself. The remote service technician  may also receive notice of an anomaly via a telephone call or a facsimile message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00075","num":"00075"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["701","100","100","701","709","701","701","601","100"]},"The ADC device platform  includes a number of individual elements.

Using a \u201cTo\u201d button , the device operator scans through a list of previously stored e-mail addresses associated with the service departments of the ADC device platform's various elements.","In some circumstances, the device operator may wish to enter a number other than the ADC device platform's unit number, such as an element's part number. Using a \u201cFrom\u201d button , the device operator scans through a list of element part numbers. For example, the device operator may use the \u201cTo\u201d button  to select the e-mail address for the service department for the manufacturer of the ADC device  and may use the \u201cFrom\u201d button  to indicate the element number of the ADC device . Similarly, the device operator may use a \u201cSubject\u201d button  to select an additional topic information for the diagnostic and repair email message .","If the device operator does not find an appropriate e-mail address or needs to indicate information that has not previously been stored, then the device operator may use the ADC device 's keyboard to enter pertinent information, e.g., an e-mail address. In addition, the device operator may access a \u201cHelp\u201d button  to receive help in completing the diagnostic and repair e-mail message . When the device operator has completed the first page of the diagnostic and repair e-mail message , then the device operator may actuate a \u201cNext\u201d button  that allows the device operator to complete the remaining entries in the diagnostic and repair e-mail message .

In some instances, the device operator may simply enable a pre-arranged password for the remote service technician . As shown in , a \u201cMaintenance Security Enabled\u201d field  has been enabled for the remote service technician . In the embodiment shown in , enabling the Maintenance Security Enabled field  allows the remote service technician  to utilize a password that is otherwise disabled. For example, prior to the purchase of the ADC device  from an ADC reader manufacturer, the ADC reader manufacturer may install a password that allows the remote service technician  to gain access to the ADC device  through ADC device platform ; however, this password may be disabled normally and remain disabled until deliberately enabled by the device operator.","Since the ADC device platform  may include a number of elements not provided by its original manufacturer, the device operator may indicate which element supplier has an enabled password in an \u201cElemenf\u201d field .
