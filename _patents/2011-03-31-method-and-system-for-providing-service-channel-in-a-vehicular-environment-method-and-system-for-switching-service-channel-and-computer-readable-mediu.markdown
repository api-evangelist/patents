{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of Taiwan application Serial No. 99142895, filed Dec. 8, 2010, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference.","1. Technical Field","The disclosure relates in general to a method and a system of service channels in a vehicular environment, and more particularly to a method and a system for switching service channels in a vehicular environment.","2. Description of the Related Art","Due to the maturity in the technology of wireless communication, navigation, and on-board electronics, many countries are dedicated to the research and development in the vehicular communication technology with an attempt to creating new industries. Considering the high mobility and instantaneity of the vehicles as well the characteristics of a wireless network itself, it is acknowledged that there are significant differences between the demands for communications in vehicular environment and commonly used wireless communication technologies such as 3.5G and Wi-Fi. Thus, the IEEE Standard Association develops a set of protocols for on-board communication, such as IEEE 1609 for wireless access in vehicular environment (WAVE), which includes a protocol group for processing respective layers of the network OSI model and performing communication with the accompany of the IEEE 802.11p physical layer.","In the bottom layer of IEEE 1609 protocol, the channels are divided into a control channel and several service channels. The control channel is for transmitting emergency information and used as a channel via which a service provider sends a broadcast packet to inform the users within the coverage of communication about the information of the services provided by the service provider and the service channels belonging to the service provider. The service channels are for transmitting various services. Due to the restrictions on the communication hardware as stipulated in the protocol, the service provider end should employ at least two antennas: one for the control channel and the other for the service channel. When the user end uses a single antenna, only one channel can be monitored at a time. Thus, the protocol provides the user with a mode in which the control channel and the service channel are being switched alternately with an equal ratio in time. In addition, the protocol has been updated to introduce a functionality of extending the time limit of the service channel, wherein the user end pre-determines an extension interval. However, the restrictions on the communication hardware remain unchanged, and the flexibility and the channel utilization rate are still insufficient for both the service provider end and the user end.","The disclosure is directed to embodiments of a method and system for providing service channels in a vehicular environment, a method and a system for switching service channels and a computer readable medium. In an embodiment, the service provider can adjust the switch ratio between a control channel and a service channel according to service characteristics.","The disclosure provides an embodiment of a method for switching service channels in a vehicular environment. The method includes the following steps: In response to a message indicating that a service provider unit uses an access mode of an extended service channel, whether information of the switch ratio is stored in service information of the user unit is searched in the user unit according to geographical information of the service provider unit. If the information of the switch ratio is stored in the service information of the user unit in the searching step, the user unit is set accordingly to enter the access mode of the extended service channel.","The disclosure provides an embodiment of a computer readable medium having instructions for performing the above method for switching service channels in a vehicular environment.","The disclosure provides an embodiment of a communication system using a vehicular communication service. The system includes a wireless communication module, a memory unit, and a processing module. The wireless communication module communicates with a service provider unit according to a switch ratio between a service channel and a control channel. In response to a message indicating that a service provider unit uses an access mode of an extended service channel, the processing module, according to geographical information of the service provider unit, searches whether the information of the switch ratio is stored in the memory unit. The processing module sets the user unit to enter an access mode of an extended service channel according to the information of the switch ratio obtained from the memory unit.","The disclosure provides an embodiment of a method for providing service channels in a vehicular environment. The method includes the following steps: In a service provider unit, a switch ratio between a control channel and a service channel is adjusted, and a broadcast message indicating the channel access mode used by the service provider unit is sent. In response to the broadcast message indicating that the service provider unit uses an access mode of an extended service channel, information of a switch ratio between the service channel and the control channel is obtained in a user unit according to geographical information of the service provider unit, and the user unit is set to enter the access mode of the extended service channel.","The disclosure provides an embodiment of a system for providing service channels in a vehicular environment. The system includes a service provider unit and a user unit for implementing the method of the above embodiment. The service provider unit provides communication service.","The above and other aspects of the disclosure will become better understood with regard to the following detailed description of the non-limiting embodiment(s). The following description is made with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","100","150","100","100","150","152","154","101","100","150"]},"In the above embodiment, the service provider unit  adjusts the switch ratio between the control channel and the service channel according to a required frequency for an individual application at which service advertisement messages, such as WAVE service advertisement (WSA) packets or messages, are sent. Specifically, various on-board applications have different latency requirements, so the required frequencies for the applications at which the WSA packets are sent differ accordingly. For example, the allowed latencies for the traffic signal violation warning service, the left turn assistant service, and the pedestrian crossing information at designated intersections service are about 100 ms; the latency tolerance for the post-crash warning service is about 0.5 s. The latencies for the approaching emergency vehicle warning service, and the curve speed warning service are about 1 s. The service provider unit  extends the access times of the service channel according to the characteristics of the latency requirement of the application, so that the channel utilization rate can be increased.","According to IEEE 1609 protocol, a channel is divided into a control channel and 6 service channels, and a timing sequence is divided into a control interval (CCH interval) and a service interval (SCH interval), wherein emergency information with security and high priority or a WSA messages are transmitted via the control intervals and ordinary service information is exchanged via the service intervals. In addition, IEEE 1609 protocol provides various channel access modes such as continuous access, alternating access, immediate access and extended access. The extended access mode enables the apparatus to stay in the service channel without returning to the control channel at the end of the service interval. In the extended access mode compliant with the standard protocol, the service software that serves the user needs to predetermine an extension interval, the service provider must have multiple antennas, one antenna is switched to the control channel and the remaining antennas are switched to the service channel. In the standard practice, the service provider cannot adjust the switch ratio between the control channel and the service channel according to the characteristics of service, and cannot dynamically obtain the current access mode of the service provided by service provider when the user enters or leaves the service coverage. Although the channel utilization rate can be slightly increased in an extended access mode temporarily under the standard protocol in which the service provider requires a multi-antenna apparatus, a substantial increment of the channel utilization rate still cannot be achieved.","In the above embodiment, the signal SG sent from the service provider unit  is switched between the control channel and the service channel. In this way, the service provider unit  can send the signal SG with a single antenna in the present embodiment. In the present embodiment, the channel utilization rate can be effectively increased if the service provider unit  and the user unit  can use a switch ratio extending the time of the service channel. In addition, the service provider unit  of the present embodiment is not limited to the implementation with a single antenna.","According to the above embodiment of , the service provider unit  provides the information of the switch ratio in the signal SG, or the user unit , which selects the service of the service provider unit , obtains the switch ratio by way of query so as to receive the signal from the service provider unit  via the control channel and the service channel. The service provider unit  achieves the above processing, for example, by using the characteristics of IEEE 1609. The service provider unit  can indicate the channel access mode by using a \u201cchannel access\u201d field of the \u201cextension field\u201d of the \u201cchannel info\u201d of the WSA message. According to IEEE 1609 protocol, the \u201cchannel access\u201d field having a value of 0 implies that the service channel can be continuously accessed; the field having a value of 1 implies that the apparatus only provides service access at the service interval, i.e., in an alternating channel access mode. The access mode of the extended service channel of the above embodiment is thus indicated by the \u201cchannel access\u201d field used in the service provider unit  having a value of 0, which denotes the usage of other channel access mode, so as to be compliant with IEEE 1609 protocol. Since the way of providing the information of the switch ratio is not defined in the current IEEE 1609 protocol, in a practical example disclosed above, the service provider unit  enables the user unit  to obtain the information of the switch ratio by way of searching.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"150"},"As indicated in step S, the channel access mode is determined. In the above example of IEEE 1609, after the WSA message is received by a user unit  and the matching is successful, then the user unit is within the service coverage of the service provider, and the channel access mode of the service provider unit  is determined according to the \u201cchannel access\u201d field of the WSA message. When the \u201cchannel access\u201d field equals 1, this indicates that the channel of the service provider unit  is in an alternating access mode, i.e., in a switch ratio of 1:1 or the parameter of the extended access being equal to 0. As indicated in step S, the user unit  enters an alternating access mode. If the \u201cchannel access\u201d field equals 0, this indicates that the service provided by the service provider unit  is in a continuous access mode. The service provider unit  can extend the continuous access mode to indicate other channel access modes such as the access mode of the extended service channel disclosed in the above embodiment.","Thus, the user unit  further needs to obtain the switch ratio. As indicated in step S, the user unit  searches whether the local service information of the user unit  includes the information of the switch ratio of the service, such as an extended access parameter or a record of ExtendedAccess, according to the geographical information, such as the GPS coordinate information of the service provider unit of the WSA message or the geographical information provided by other navigation system. The service information, for example, includes at least one piece of information of the switch ratio corresponding to a service provided by a service provider unit. If the service information does not exist, then the service information can be established after being obtained. The service information is such as the historic record of the switch ratio previously used by the service provider unit  or information that is preloaded or downloaded from a readable medium or a website. If the searching in step S shows that the service information includes the information of the switch ratio of the service provider unit , the method proceeds to step S, the user unit  alternatively accesses the control channel and the service channel of the service provider unit  according to the information of the switch ratio obtained by way of searching.","If the searching in step S does not show any corresponding information of the switch ratio, the method proceeds to step S, the information is obtained by other methods. The implementation of step S is exemplified below by way of searching or the calculation based on map data. Then, the method proceeds to step S, the results obtained in step S are stored in the service information, which is used for accessing the service provider unit  next time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 2","FIG. 3A"],"b":["310","250","320","330","240","340"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"],"b":"320","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["the required time for traveling through the transmission coverage T=(D\/P)*36001000 (ms);","the required number of control channel access (CCH access) C=T\/(L\/2);","the required number of service channel access (SCH access) S=T\/50\u2212C;","the extended access parameter (ExtendedAccess)=[S\/C]\/2."]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0035"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Latency Requirements of Application L (ms)"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1500","1250","1000","750","500","250"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Speed Limit P","40","50","60","70","80","P \u2267 90"]},{"entry":"(km\/h)"},{"entry":["Distance D","1","1","1","1","1","1"]},{"entry":"(km)"},{"entry":["T","90000","72000","60000","51428","45000","36000"]},{"entry":["C","120","115","120","137","180","288"]},{"entry":["S","1680","1325","1080","891","720","432"]},{"entry":["Extended","7","6","4","3","2","1"]},{"entry":"Access"},{"entry":"Parameter"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"As illustrated in Table 1, the extended access parameter ranges between 1 to 7, corresponding to different latency L (ms), such as ranging between 250 ms to 1500 ms, required by the application, wherein when the extended access parameter is equal to 1, 2, 3, the numbers of obtained service intervals are respectively equal to 3, 5, 7, and the switch ratios are respectively equal to 3:1, 5:1, 7:1, and other scenarios can be obtained in the same way. If the service provider unit and the user unit both use the above formula, then the service provider unit and the user unit can both achieve the channel access mode using the same switch ratio. In an example, if the user does not receive an end-of-service message, then the method proceeds to step S, whether the user is outside the service coverage can be determined according to the calculation of the GPS coordinates, and the mode is switched to the original alternating access mode (i.e., the switch ratio is 1:1).","Regardless of the manners of implementations of step S, as indicated in step S, the user unit can record the coordinate information of the service provider unit of the service or update the service information accordingly.
