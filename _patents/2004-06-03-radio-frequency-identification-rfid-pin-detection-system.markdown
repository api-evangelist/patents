{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Technical Field","This invention relates generally to bowling systems, and, more particularly, to a radio frequency identification (RFID) pin detection system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Bowling centers have evolved from systems that required the manual setting of ten pins on a lane and manual scoring during game play, to systems that utilize automatic pinsetting devices, and ultimately to systems that utilize automatic bowling scoring systems.","Automatic scoring systems for bowling centers have been provided that respond to an output produced by a pin fall monitor in order to automatically score each bowler's game. The automatic scoring system typically includes a scoring console having a display device and a user input for displaying information, including scores, and for entering the names of the bowlers, correcting scoring errors, and the like. One such system is disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,255,185 entitled BOWLING CENTER VIDEO DISPLAY SYSTEM, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The above-mentioned pin fall monitor is provided to automatically detect the number of fallen pins after a ball has been thrown by a bowler. In this regard it is known to provide pin fall monitors that rely either on mechanical contacts, switches or video processing technology. For example, it is known to provide mechanical \u201cpaddle\u201d switches in a setting table of a pinsetter. The setting table is lowered to count pins after a ball has been thrown. The paddle switches are configured to engage the heads of standing pins. The number of standing pins is determined based on \u201cpaddle\u201d switch closures. As with other mechanical or electromechanical devices, such \u201cpaddle\u201d switches are subject to wear and break down, requiring maintenance. Wear and\/or break down may be advanced due to the high impact environment in which they are used. In addition, the requirement of lowering the setting table to take the standing pin count can, in some circumstances, introduce a delay. More specifically, in the case where there are one or more pins standing after a ball has been thrown, the setting table must be lowered to respot the pins in any event, so there is no additional delay in these situations. However, in the case where the bowler rolls a strike, and thus no pins are left standing, the setting table must go through at least one down cycle in order to determine that there are no pins standing (i.e., a strike) and then to clear the pin deck and respot a new complement of pins. The double down stroke for a strike is perceived by some bowlers as being slow.","As to video processing technologies for pin fall detection, it is known to employ a charge couple device (CCD) for capturing an image of the pin deck area. The captured image is then processed to determine the number of pins standing after a ball has been thrown by a bowler. Such bowling scoring systems are conventionally organized around a pair of bowling lanes. In this regard, CCD-based video systems typically use one camera to image both bowling lanes. While such systems provide accurate results under normal lighting conditions, performance in low lighting conditions prevalent in popular ultraviolet light (\u201cblack light\u201d or glow-in-the-dark) bowling environments tend to be problematic. Such systems also tend to require frequent alignment and calibration.","It is also known to provide a pin fall monitor that uses video pin sensor technology that improves accuracy under both black light and white light conditions. However, video pin sensor technology incorporates two cameras per lane pair and while providing improved levels of convenience, accuracy, and bowler satisfaction under black light bowling conditions, as well as independent visual assessment of pins per lane, such video-based systems may be characterized by an increased cost.","In addition, it is known to provide a bowling pin with a magnet in the head portion thereof as seen by reference to U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,596 entitled MAGNETICALLY RESPONSIVE BOWLING PINS. It is also known to use such magnetically-responsive pins for scoring.","There is therefore a need for a bowling pin detection system that minimizes or eliminates one or more of the problems set forth above.","The present invention provides a pin detection system that provides accurate pin detection under all lighting conditions, reduces maintenance, reduces overall system cost, as well as improves scoring\/pinsetting speed under some circumstances (i.e., can eliminate pinsetter double stroke). Other features, advantages, and objects are achieved by a bowling pin detection system according to the invention that employs radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags.","In one aspect of the invention, a bowling pin detection system is provided for use with bowling pins of the type wherein each pin includes a respective RFID tag including a pin antenna configured to identify the pin. The bowling pins are conventionally placed on a pin deck in a predetermined arrangement. The system comprises a pin detect controller, a monitor block, and a plurality of reader antennas. The pin detect controller is responsive to a pin fall signal to generate a reader activation signal. In one embodiment, the pin fall signal is produced by a conventional pinsetter apparatus and is indicative of a time to determine the number of fallen pins. The monitor block includes an antenna drive circuit responsive to the activation signal configured to energize the reader antennas. The reader antennas are configured, when energized by the antenna drive circuit, to radiate a respective reader field to a corresponding position in the predetermined arrangement. In one embodiment, the reader antennas are disposed in the pin deck. In another embodiment the reader antennas are disposed proximate the setting table of the pinsetter. The reader antennas are further configured to sense modulations in the reader field when a bowling pin in the pin-up position (i.e., standing) is within a range of one of the positions in the predetermined arrangement (i.e., is within one of the reader fields, which activates the RFID tag causing the modulations to occur). In one embodiment, the predetermined arrangement of bowling pins is the well-known triangular ten-pin arrangement.","The monitor block includes a filter and amplifier circuit configured to process the sensed modulations from the reader antennas for detecting bowling pins in the pin-up position and generating an output signal. The pin detect controller is responsive to the output signal of the monitor block to generate a pin detection signal indicative of, in alternate embodiments, the number of standing and\/or fallen bowling pins.","In another aspect of the present invention, a bowling pin is provided that is configured for use in an RFID pin detection system. The bowling pin includes a body having a base, a neck and a head portion. The bowling pin includes an RFID tag having a pin antenna. The pin antenna is responsive to the reader field and is configured to generate a power signal. The RFID tag is responsive to the power signal for activation thereof wherein the RFID tag is configured to produce an identification signal for identifying the pin. The identification signal may be sensed and used for, among other things, scoring a bowling game.","In a still further aspect of the present invention, a pin deck is provided. The pin deck is configured for use at a first end of a bowling lane opposite a second, approach end. The pin deck comprises a base layer, an upper layer, and at least one reader antenna intermediate the base layer and the upper layer. The upper layer has a top surface configured for placement of a plurality of bowling pins in a predetermined arrangement. The reader antenna is configured to radiate a reader field to a corresponding position in the predetermined arrangement. The reader antenna is further configured to sense modulations in the reader field when a bowling pin, of the type that includes an RFID tag having a pin antenna, is within a predetermined range of the radiated position.","In a still further aspect of the present invention, an automatic bowling pinsetter is provided. The pinsetter includes a pin elevator configured to receive bowling pins, for example from a pit conveyor or the like, and to elevate the pins to an orienting and delivery mechanism. The orienting and delivery mechanism is configured to orient the bowling pins in a desired fashion for delivery to a plurality of pin stations. The pinsetter further includes a setting table configured to receive the bowling pins from the pin stations for setting on the pin deck in a predetermined arrangement. The setting table includes a plurality of apertures corresponding to the predetermined pin arrangement for receiving bowling pins, the table being configured to selectively engage, hold and release bowling pins. The setting table is movable between upper and lower positions for both (i) setting bowling pins in the predetermined arrangement on the pin deck, and (ii) for picking up and resetting bowling pins on the pin deck. According to the invention, the pinsetter also includes a plurality of reader antennas disposed proximate the apertures in the setting table. The reader antennas are configured to radiate a respective reader field to a corresponding position in the predetermined arrangement. The reader antennas are further configured to sense modulations in respective reader fields that occur when a bowling pin of the type that includes an RFID tag is within a predetermined range of the position.","In a yet further aspect of the present invention, a method of tracking a bowling pin is provided. The first step of the method involves providing a bowling pin having a pin antenna associated therewith configured to generate a power signal in response to a reader field. The pin also includes an RFID tag responsive to the power signal for activation thereof. The RFID tag is configured to store an identification code for identifying the pin. The method further includes the step of deploying the bowling pin on a first, deployment date. The method further includes the step of associating the identification code with the deployment date in a computer database. The method further includes, on a second date subsequent to the deployment date, the step of applying a reader field to the bowling pin to thereby activate the RFID tag to obtain the identification code. Finally, the method includes the step of retrieving the deployment date using the identification code. In one embodiment, the method further includes the step of determining warranty coverage using the retrieved deployment date and warranty data associated with the pin.","In a still further aspect of the invention, a method of bowling is provided. The method includes the step of spotting a plurality of bowling pins on a pin deck in a predetermined arrangement wherein each bowling pin includes a respective RFID tag configured to produce an identification signal in response to a reader field. The method further includes the step of, in response to a pin fall signal indicative of a thrown ball, determining the number of pins in a pin-up position using the RFID tags. Finally, the method includes the further step of providing the determined number of pins in the pin-up position to a bowling scoring unit.","Further features and advantages of the invention will be readily apparent from the specification and from the drawings.","The game of bowling is played on a bowling lane that typically includes an automatic pinsetter operable for setting ten pins on the lane at the start of a game. In a conventional ten pin bowling game, each bowler is allowed to roll two balls in an attempt to knock down all of the pins. The throwing of two balls constitutes what is known as a frame, except that three balls may be permitted in the tenth frame, and the completion of ten frames comprises one game. The player's score is determined according to the number of pins that are knocked down in each frame. In a bowling center that includes an automatic scoring system, the score is automatically computed and displayed on a suitable display screen or printed out using a printing device.","A basic input required for an automatic scoring system is the number of bowling pins knocked down after the player has thrown a bowling ball down the lane. The conventional pin sensing systems rely either on mechanical (or electromechanical) switches or on video processing technology. The mechanical systems tend to require a fair amount of maintenance, and the video approach tends to be problematic in low lighting conditions prevalent in the popular \u201cglow-in-the-dark\u201d bowling environments. The present invention provides a pin detection system that uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag technology to overcome one or more of the shortcomings of conventional pin sensing systems. As will be seen, the invention provides accurate scoring under all lighting conditions, reduces cost and provides improved speed of operation.","Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to identical components in various views,  shows a two lane (\u201clane pair\u201d) arrangement  including first and second lane assemblies  and \u2032 in a typical arrangement with each lane assembly having a lane  being straddled by a pair of gutters . It should be understood that a bowling center includes, typically, many more bowling lanes than are shown, although it is still typical to group lanes in pairs. Between the two lane assemblies is a ball return capping , which is above a ball return channel of conventional construction. At the opposite sides of the two lanes from the ball return capping are lane divisions , also of conventional constructions.","Each lane  may be of standard length, i.e., 60 feet plus or minus one-half inch as measured from a foul line  to the center of the number one pin on a pin deck . At the head of the lane, i.e., adjacent foul line , is what is known as an approach . The approach  is where the bowler advances toward the lane with the ball in hand in order to bowl the ball down the lane towards the pins on the pin deck . The lane may be of standard width of 41\u00bd inches plus or minus one-half inch, according to the standards of the American Bowling Congress (ABC).","The bowling lanes shown in  may be formed of wood, synthetic material and\/or may be of the type having a polymer sheet  extending from foul line  to the rear edge of pin deck , adhered thereto by double sided tape or the like , all as known in the art.","Associated with each lane is an automatic pinsetter . The two pinsetters  of each lane pair are electrically connected to a lane control system . The lane control system  operates both pinsetters  to set a desired array of pins according to the bowling game being played, and to provide automatic scoring for the bowling game being played. Also connected to each lane control  is a scoring unit input terminal , which is used by a bowler to enter information to be transmitted to the lane control system . The scoring unit input terminal  is physically located, typically, near a bowling staging area immediately adjacent to the associated approach area . A respective overhead display monitor (not shown) is generally provided for the left and right lanes of each lane pair to display scoring and other types of information. While some embodiments of lane control system  operate with respect to a lane pair (i.e., the two lanes adjacent one another), other embodiments of lane control system  are configured to control up to as many as eight lanes.","A bowling center control  is configured to communicate with each lane control system  over a communications line. The bowling center control  may be located in a typical bowling center at a manager's control desk (MCD) and provides accounting control of the bowling lanes as well as the ability to download game information to lane control system .

The pin detection signal  is indicative of at least one of (i) the number of pins in the pin-up position or (ii) the number of fallen pins or pins in the pin down position. In further embodiments, other identifying information (e.g., the position of the standing pin in the overall pin arrangement) may be included in the pin detection signal  provided to lane control system , among other pieces of information.  shows RFID pin detection system  in block form, which will be described and illustrated in greater detail hereinafter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["32","32","42","40"]},"Pinsetter  includes a pin elevator , which receives pins randomly from a conventional pit conveyor (not shown) and elevates them to a pin turn .

The distributor  delivers the pins to a plurality of pin stations, ten in the illustrated embodiment, for eventual unloading to a setting table . The setting table  includes a plurality (e.g., ten) tipping baskets, one for each pin, for holding pins which are to be set on the lane. Each tipping basket may include a solenoid configured to operate a pair of flaps to controllably engage the neck of a pin prior to setting it on the pin deck. A scissors is used to lift a standing pin when the deck is to be swept and to release a pin for respotting.","The setting table  is moveably mounted so that it may be lowered to pick up and then respot standing pins after a rake  has removed fallen pins, or to set a new group of pins on the pin deck. A more detailed description of a suitable pinsetter may be had by reference to U.S. Pat.

When the bowling pin is knocked down, however, the pin antenna rotates out of optimal position and away from the reader antenna, thereby reducing the amount of inductive coupling to a second, lower level. The present invention provides for discrimination of the pin-up position versus the pin-down position under a wide variety of conditions. A particularly challenging condition is the sliding pin that stays standing. This condition should not be counted as a pin-down, but may be difficult to distinguish from a pin that has been knocked completely off the pin deck, because of the reduced coupling when the pin is moved out of optimal position with respect to a particular reader antenna.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["60","72","104","106","108","110","104","24","60","72","60","104","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["104","110","24"]},"As described above, one condition to be accounted for is the sliding pin condition.  shows a noticeable \u201cnull\u201d at about 3.5 inches from center. This null corresponds to a point when the pin antenna  is directly above the windings of the reader antenna . At this point half of the reader field is split across the windings of the reader antenna and the net coupling is about zero.","Accordingly, in view of the foregoing observation, filter\/amplifier circuit  is configured to include discrimination logic having a threshold selected to reject traces  and  as relating to pin-down pins and to receive and process trace  as relating to pin-up pins. Thus, pins that have been knocked completely off pin deck , or that remain on pin deck  but have been knocked on their side or are in a neck on neck position, will exhibit insufficient coupling to overcome the discrimination function described above, and will be considered as pins in the pin-down position. A default discrimination threshold is shown as line  in . The discrimination function may be implemented using conventional components known to those of ordinary skill in the art employing any one of a (i) fixed discrimination; (ii) variable discrimination; and (iii) variable discrimination with hysteresis.","As further seen in , in some orientations and in some locations (i.e., with respect to the offset distance from the reader antenna), the coupling difference between a pin in the pin-up position and a pin in the neck-on-body condition is small. Accordingly, in another aspect of the present invention, the discrimination of a pin in the pin-up position (trace ) can be improved with respect to the neck-on-body condition (trace ) by including a Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) signal. This is shown as block  in . This additional functionality can be used to replace the default, predetermined threshold as indicated by discrimination line  with a calibrated threshold as indicated by discrimination line . For example, this recalibration may occur at the start of each frame. That is, the actual receive signal strength of a pin-up pin can be used to substantially set the calibrated discrimination line  and can be used to reject coupling conditions that are weaker than this threshold. In this way, \u201cneck-on-neck\u201d conditions (trace ) that may be improperly interpreted as a pin-up, may be properly identified. In a preferred embodiment, therefore, an RSSI circuit  may be included in connection with the reader filter\/amplifier circuit . RSSI circuit  may comprise conventional components known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and are quite often offered on commercial components (e.g., in connection with processor  of RFID tag ).

In another embodiment, the pin detect controller , having predetermined knowledge of the identity of the initial pins set on the pin deck, can determine which pins have been knocked down by the bowler's throw by using the determination of what pins are left standing, and provide that information (i.e., the pins in the pin-down position) as the pin detection signal .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 25","FIG. 25","FIG. 25"],"b":["184","186","188","190","62","192","62","62","186"]},"Through the following method, a proprietor may determine how long a bowling pin has been in use by performing the additional step of determining the length of deployment using the first, deployment date, and the second date noted above. For example when a pin has become cracked or otherwise unusable, one may determine warranty coverage using the retrieved deployment date and warranty data associated with the pin. Additionally, a proprietor may wish to preemptively replace pins after a predetermined period of time (e.g., 1 year). It should be understood that the fixture  is exemplary only. For example, a proprietor may use pin deck  configured with reader antennas to obtain the pin serial number. Other applications, of course, are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 26","b":["194","196"]},"In step , the method enters a decision step as to whether it has received a pin fall signal indicating that a bowler has completed the throw of a bowling ball and it is thus an appropriate time to check for fallen pins. If the answer to this step is \u201cNO,\u201d then the method loops on itself in a wait state. Otherwise, if the answer is \u201cYES,\u201d the method branches to step .","In step , the method continues with the step of determining the number of pins in the pin-up position using the RFID tags. This method may be implemented as described in the various embodiments herein. The method then proceeds to step .","In step , the method continues with the step of providing either pin-up and\/or pin-down information to a bowling scoring unit. The bowling scoring unit may then process this information, as is conventional.","A further embodiment of the method may include further steps in order to track bowling pin usage as well as to implement particular bowling games. For example, after spotting of the pins but before the pin fall signal is generated, the method may include the further step of determining the identity of at least one, and preferably all, of the pins that have been set on the pin deck in the predetermined arrangement, and, incrementing a usage parameter associated with the identified pins. In this way, a running total may be obtained of the number of cycles (frames) a bowling pin has been used. This will allow, for example, an operator to conduct preventative maintenance and\/or replacement of pins as they approach known, preselected usage milestones.","In another variation, it is known to configure bowling center control  with the capability of allowing a certain bowling game to be played on lanes that involve identification of the color of the bowling pin. For example, a \u201cred\u201d color pin may randomly circulate through the bowling center. Should that pin be spotted in the pin number one position, a subsequent strike by the bowler would result in a reward, such as a money prize or house credit, being awarded to that bowler. The present invention provides the capability to implement the playing of that game by either (1) hard coding the color of the pin in the identification code of the RFID tag, or (2) virtually associating a particular serial number associated with the bowling pin with a color. In either of these conditions, the method may be performed to include the following further steps. First, after spotting the pins on the pin deck but before the pin fall signal, determining the identity of the pins that have been spotted on the pin deck. Second, providing the identity of such pins to the bowling game unit (e.g., executing on lane control system  or on the bowling center control ) that is configured to control the playing of the bowling game. Next, generating a signal when the identity of one of the pins matches predetermined criteria. The last step involves altering either the rules of the bowling game or an outcome in response to such signal. As described above, in one embodiment, the identity of such a pin may include the color characteristic of the pin and the predetermined criteria programmed into the lane control system  (or other game playing unit) may comprise a preselected color. In this situation, the bowler can win the predetermined reward or prize for bowling a strike (or other specified act such as a spare, or spare on a split, etc.) when the color of the at least one pin matches the preselected color. Additionally, the game requirement may specify a particular position for the specified-color pin. Pin detection system  can provide this information as well, as described above."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIGS. 22\u201324"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 26"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
